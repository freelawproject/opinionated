The orders awarded sole legal and physical custody of the parties\u2019 nine-year-old child (\u201cthe child\u201d) to appellee, Rachel Karanikas Cartwright (\u201cMother\u201d), and ordered Konstantinos Karanikas (\u201cFather\u201d) to pay child support to Mother. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Father presents three questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">1. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by denying Father\u2019s motion to disqualify the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">2. Whether the trial judge abused his discretion due to the manner in which he conducted an interview with the parties\u2019 daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">3. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the award of child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Mother and Father are the parents of a nine-year-old daughter (\u201cthe child\u201d), born on July 7, 2003. The parties are also the parents of a son, who is emancipated by reason of age, and is not a subject of the present litigation. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 consent order and judgment of divorce, they were awarded joint legal custody of the child. In the event of a conflict with regard to long-range decisions, the parties were required to participate in mediation. Mother was awarded primary physical custody of the child, and Father received a specific visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">The consent order and judgment of divorce also awarded Mother use and possession of the marital home for a period of four years. During Mother\u2019s use and possession, she was ordered to pay the mortgage, taxes, and interest payment for the marital home. Mother\u2019s use and possession period expired on October 5, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The child had resided in Maryland her entire life. She attended Oak Hill Elementary School in Severna Park, Maryland. On March 1, 2012, Mother sent an e-mail to Father indicating that she intended to relocate to Pennsylvania with the child after the end of the school year. Father did not consent to the relocation. Thereafter, the parties participated in mediation, but were unable to reach an agreement regarding the relocation of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Both parties filed pleadings with the circuit court requesting a modification of the consent order and judgment of divorce with regard to custody and visitation. The circuit court scheduled an expedited trial to address the relocation of the child. Both parties appeared at a pre-trial hearing, propounded and responded to written discovery requests, and participated in depositions. The relocation trial was scheduled for September 7, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On August 1, 2012, during the pendency of the litigation, Mother registered the child to attend a public school in Pennsylvania. Upon notification of the school registration, Father requested a temporary restraining order and other injunctive relief in the circuit court. The circuit court denied Father\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order. Further, the court entered a <em>pendente lite </em>order prohibiting the child\u2019s registration in school in Pennsylvania, and required the child to start the school year in Maryland until further order of the circuit court and completion of the relocation trial. Accordingly, the child began school at Oak Hill Elementary in Maryland in August 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The trial began on September 7, 2012. Father\u2019s counsel alerted the trial court that he planned to have the child testify either in open court or in chambers. At the conclusion of the first day of trial, the trial judge met with the child in chambers. The trial was not completed on September 7, 2012, and was continued to September 12, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">At the beginning of the second day of trial, Father presented an oral motion to disqualify the trial judge, accompanied by a written memorandum of law in support of his motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Father alleged that the trial judge had demonstrated bias due to comments he made regarding testimony on the first day of trial. Additionally, Father alleged that the trial judge conducted the child interview inappropriately. Father argued that these actions required disqualification of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The trial judge initially entertained counsel\u2019s argument on the motion for disqualification. At the close of counsel\u2019s argument, the trial judge referred the motion to another judge for a ruling. As a result, the parties and counsel went to the second judge\u2019s courtroom for a determination of the motion for disqualification. The second judge denied the motion for disqualification based upon her review of the written motion and memorandum of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The second day of trial proceeded before the original judge. Mother and Father testified regarding their financial resources and expenses. It was undisputed at the trial that the Maryland child support guidelines did not apply because the parties\u2019 combined gross monthly income exceeded the guidelines. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge held the ease under advisement and indicated that his decision would be forthcoming. Father\u2019s counsel made an oral motion to stay any order to be issued by the trial judge in the event that the child was relocated to Pennsylvania. The trial judge did not rule on the motion to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On September 13, 2012, the trial judge signed a Memorandum and Interim Custody Order relocating the child from Maryland to Pennsylvania. The order required the child to relocate to Pennsylvania on September 15, 2012. The trial judge faxed copies of the order to counsel the same day, but the order was not entered or docketed by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Father\u2019s counsel called the trial judge\u2019s chambers to inquire when he could be heard on the motion to stay that had been made in open court at the conclusion of the trial. Subsequently, Father\u2019s counsel was informed that the trial judge decided to hold Father\u2019s oral motion to stay under advisement, that the trial judge would not hear counsel\u2019s argument on the motion to stay, and that a decision on any open issues in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>case, including the motion to stay, would follow in a further written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">On September 14, 2012, Father filed a Notice of Appeal and Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal. At this time, the interim custody order had not yet been entered on the docket. This Court granted Father\u2019s request in part, entering a temporary stay and setting a deadline for Mother to file any written response to Father\u2019s motion. On September 17, 2012, the custody order was released from chambers to the clerk\u2019s office for docketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On September 17, 2012, the trial judge signed and entered a Custody, Visitation, and Support Order and an Order for Sale of Property. This order modified custody, and awarded Mother sole legal and sole physical custody of the child, with a specific visitation schedule for Father. The order also required Father to pay child support to Mother in the amount of $2,883. The order further mandated that Father pay the mortgage and all associated expenses for the former marital home until it was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">That same day, Father filed his second notice of appeal, appealing the following orders: the interim custody order entered on September 17, 2012; the custody, visitation, and support order docketed on September 17, 2012; the presiding judge\u2019s refusal to disqualify himself from the case; and the second trial judge\u2019s denial of Father\u2019s motion for disqualification of the presiding trial judge. Subsequently, after the case concluded, the trial judge disqualified himself from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">I. Motion for Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Father\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to disqualify the presiding trial judge on the basis of comments the trial judge made during testimony, and his handling of the interview of the child. In Father\u2019s view, the behavior demonstrated bias, established the perception that the trial judge was not impar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tiai, and constituted a failure to uphold and apply the law. Mother responds that the judge\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level that a reasonable person would perceive as improper or impartial. We agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Father\u2019s motion for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">A Maryland judge \u201cshall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned ...\u201d Md. Rule 16-813, Md.Code of Judicial Conduct Rule 2.11(a) (the \u201cRules\u201d). Similarly, \u201c[a] judge shall avoid conduct that would create in reasonable minds a perception of impropriety.\u201d Rule 1.2(b). Impartiality under the Rules means the \u201cabsence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular classes of parties, as well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge.\u201d Rules, Section B.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Further, a judge \u201cshall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d Rule 1.2(a). The Rules also require that judges \u201cuphold and apply the law and shall perform all duties of the office impartially and fairly.\u201d Rule 2.2. Accordingly, \u201c[a] judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct, manifest bias, prejudice or harassment based upon race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation.\u201d Rule 2.3. \u201cA judge shall be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, court staff, court officials, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity ...\u201d Rule 2.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\u201cWhen bias, prejudice or lack of impartiality is alleged, the decision is a discretionary one ...\u201d <em>Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 465, 578 A.2d 745 (1990). A \u201ctrial judge is presumed to know the law and apply it properly.\u201d <em>State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 180, 825 A.2d 452 (2003) (quotations omitted). The person seeking recusal bears a \u201cheavy burden to overcome the presumption of impartiality.\u201d <em>Atty. Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 297, 818 A.2d 219 (2003). <em>See also Reed v. Baltimore Life Ins. Co., </em>127 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Md.App. 536, 556, 733 A.2d 1106 (1999) (citing <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 107, 622 A.2d 737 (1993)) (\u201cMaryland adheres to a strong presumption that a trial judge is impartial, thereby requiring a party requesting recusal to prove that the judge has a bias or prejudice derived from an extrajudicial-personal-source.\u201d). We review a trial court\u2019s recusal decision pursuant to an objective standard; namely, \u201c[wjhether a reasonable member of the public knowing all of the circumstances would be led to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 253, 533 A.2d 916 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">A. Bias and Lack of Impartiality</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Father cites several instances in which the trial judge allegedly demonstrated bias and lack of impartiality due to comments he made regarding the testimony of Father and Father\u2019s wife, Deanna Karanikas (\u201cStep-Mother\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">i. Father\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Father first alleges that he attempted to testify about a suggestion to Mother that the parties extend Mother\u2019s use and possession period in the former marital home and that Father would continue to pay the mortgage. Mother\u2019s counsel objected, characterizing the discussion as a settlement negotiation. Father\u2019s counsel responded to the objection. The trial judge replied: \u201cIt\u2019s either a settlement offer or nonsense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Mother argues that this comment is taken out of context, and provides the following complete citation for reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM8\">That is a negotiation of some kind. I think the relevant, admissible and important part of that is that the Court has previously indicated that she would have exclusive use and possession of the house. Now, of course, the Court can\u2019t chain somebody to a house, but she was given that right through October, and she moved out in what would seem about June. Now, I\u2019ll let you explain to me at the end of the case why that\u2019s relevant, but the fact that he might have offered some\u2014it sounds like a bit like a hyperbole to say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u2018I\u2019ll pay you to be there 10 years from now.\u2019 It\u2019s either a settlement offer or nonsense, so in any event, it\u2019s stricken. And I\u2019ll admit, as I say, only discussions that he attempted to make it easier for her to stay for a longer period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Mother contends that the trial judge\u2019s entire commentary makes clear that the trial judge was \u201cmerely acknowledging that the proffer contained some form of a negotiation, or settlement offer, and that he would take from it the relevant portions and strike those portions that he felt were irrelevant, or \u2018nonsense.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Next, when Father explained that he went to inspect the former marital home and brought someone with him to see the state of the home, the trial judge commented: \u201cYou brought a witness with you, huh? ... Do you normally take witnesses around with you when you go places?\u201d Mother contends that the trial court was \u201cmerely attempting to clarify and understand what happened when Father inspected the house.\u201d Mother provides the following citation to the entire exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0i\">THE COURT: Is this the U <em>&amp; </em>0 house, the formal marital home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes, the one\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">THE COURT: So no one had been living there for how long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">[THE WITNESS]: Maybe a week to two weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">THE COURT: Oh, just a\u2014it was within a week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. Brought a witness with you, huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">THE COURT: Why\u2019d you bring a witness with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">[THE WITNESS]: Because I didn\u2019t want anyone to think that I went in and did anything, and it was also videotaped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWd\">THE COURT: So you brought a videotape. You want me to watch your videotape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">[THE WITNESS]: No, Your Honor. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. All right. Do you normally take witnesses around with you when you go places?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">[THE WITNESS]: I normally don\u2019t, but for this situation, Your Honor, I felt it was necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">THE COURT: All right. Next question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Mother contends that when reading the entire exchange, it is \u201cunreasonable to interpret the trial judge\u2019s questions of the witness as \u2018improper\u2019 or \u2018hostile\u2019 \u201d and that there is \u201cno evidence of partiality or bias within this exchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Third, when Father attempted to explain the distance between his home and the child\u2019s school, in both miles and driving time, the trial judge commented: \u201cYou better slow down. It\u2019s more than 60 miles an hour isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mother contends that this was nothing more than \u201ca mere observation\u201d after Father testified that to get from his home to the school, \u201c[fit\u2019s approximately a 15-minute drive and maybe about 18 miles away.\u201d Mother asserts that it is \u201cunreasonable for this comment to be perceived as partial or biased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Additionally, the trial judge commented on Father\u2019s salary and his employer, Hewlett Packard. After Father testified that his gross monthly income is $22,275.11, the trial judge remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">Now that I\u2019ve heard that number I have to tell you\u2014and that\u2019s a good number. I called Hewlett Packard last week to order a computer for my son who\u2019s down in college and they couldn\u2019t do it because their computers were down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASQ\">Mother posits that it \u201cis a significant stretch of the imagination for a person to perceive the trial judge\u2019s comment as demonstrative of prejudice or bias based upon [Father\u2019s] socioeconomic status. To the contrary, the comment ... shows that the judge was impressed with [Father\u2019s] earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AB3e\">Finally, Father contends that during his cross-examination, Father\u2019s counsel \u201cwas required to repeatedly object to questions ... by the judge himself, because the questions clearly mischaracterized the Father\u2019s testimony with respect to his occasional work-related travel.\u201d Mother argues that the trial judge merely \u201casked several questions of the witness in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>to clarify the frequency of his travel.\u201d Further, Mother points out that, \u201cit is not uncommon for a witness to be questioned, and for there to be objections to said questions .... a trial judge is vested with the responsibility of fact finding, and in order to do so, will often need to question a witness regarding his or her testimony. This, in and of itself, does not create a hostile and discourteous environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">ii. Step-Mother\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Additionally, Father contends that the trial judge exhibited bias throughout StepMother\u2019s testimony. After Step-Mother testified about her various residences over the previous five years, the trial judge asked: \u201cWhy so many moves? Why have you live [sic] in four different houses in five years?\u201d Mother asserts that this questioning was appropriate, because when making a custody determination, \u201cthe stability of the potential environment\u201d is a relevant factor to be considered by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Next, Step-Mother explained that in order to drive into the neighborhood of their current home, she travels along Bywater Street. The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: The public housing sections, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">[STEP-MOTHER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: So you got Bywater right outside of Kingsport, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">[STEP-MOTHER]: Yes, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">THE COURT: Are you renting? Are you renting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">[STEP-MOTHER]: Well, we have a delayed purchase date, but yes, essentially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">THE COURT: All right. You may want to think about that neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">Father\u2019s counsel then tried to elicit further testimony from Step-Mother regarding the safety of her neighborhood. The trial judge interjected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>I\u2019m going to take judicial notice. It\u2019s a horrible, dangerous neighborhood. I mean, I don\u2019t know about yours, but unless there\u2019s a 40 foot wall between you and them, it\u2019s a very dangerous neighborhood, counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Mother contends that it \u201cis appropriate for a trial judge to consider the potential environment(s) in which a child may reside in making a determination regarding custody. The comment is focused on the safety of the neighboring community, not the socioeconomic status ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">iii. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Father contends that the trial judge\u2019s conduct and comments pertaining to Father\u2019s and Step-Mother\u2019s testimony would create in any reasonable mind a perception of impropriety. For this reason, Father maintains that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that disqualification was unwarranted. Alternatively, Father contends that the second trial judge failed to expressly analyze the recusal request, and therefore, the decision not to disqualify the trial judge must be reversed. In support, Father points out that we must \u201creverse a decision that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge\u201d if we are \u201cunable to discern from the record that there was an analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances that resulted in the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Maddox v. Stone, </em>174 Md.App. 489, 502, 921 A.2d 912 (2007). Father contends that there was no such analysis here, and that reversal is, therefore, required. Mother argues that Father failed to overcome the strong presumption that the trial judge was impartial. We agree with Mother that the trial court adequately considered th\u00e9 recusal motion, and did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In ruling on the motion for disqualification, the second trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">Counsel, I have reviewed independently the motion to recuse Judge Goetzke and the memorandum of the law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>support of the disqualification of the trial judge. I am familiar with the case law ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">... I had read in great detail your memorandum in support of the disqualification of the trial judge, as well as attached Exhibit B, and I am familiar, as I indicated, with the case law in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">I find that in light of the allegations, erring on the side of caution, I independently reviewed all that was submitted. As I indicated, I read the memorandum, I\u2019m very familiar with the <em>Surat </em>(phonetic) case, and I find that this does not rise to the level warranty [sic] disqualification of Judge Goetzke so I\u2019m going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">As an initial matter, we hold that the second trial judge did not fail to conduct the requisite analysis in ruling on the motion for recusal. Rather, the second trial judge made it abundantly clear that she had carefully considered Father\u2019s motion and accompanying memorandum of law. The 16-page memorandum of law articulated each basis for Father\u2019s request for disqualification, provided a detailed account of the judge\u2019s specific instances of alleged misconduct (including a reproduction of the relevant parts of the trial transcript), and presented a discussion of the applicable law. Although the second trial judge did not discuss the basis for her decision at length, she clearly considered the applicable facts and law. Thus, we find no merit in Father\u2019s argument that there was an utter lack of analysis such that reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Likewise, we hold that the second trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Father\u2019s motion for disqualification. We reiterate that a deferential standard of review applies on appeal, and there is a strong presumption that a trial judge acted impartially. Upon reviewing the context surrounding the comments at issue, we hold it was not an abuse of discretion to find that the trial judge\u2019s comments did not rise to a level warranting disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>B. Failure to Uphold and Apply the Law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Next, Father contends that the trial judge should have been disqualified due to his failure to uphold and apply the law with respect to interviewing the child. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">i. Initial Refusal to Conduct Child Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">First, Father argues that the trial judge \u201cflatly refused to uphold and apply the law when he initially refused to interview the child at all ... \u201d Our review of the record, however, demonstrates that the trial judge did not \u201cflatly refuse\u201d to conduct the child interview at any point. Rather, when the issue was raised at the start of trial, the trial judge decided to reserve on that issue, explaining that other witnesses might be able to provide the same information, thereby making an interview with the child unnecessary. The trial judge indicated his preference for the parties introducing sufficient evidence without the child\u2019s testimony, in order to avoid putting the child in the middle of the dispute between her parents. Thus, since the presiding trial judge never refused to interview the child, the second trial judge did not abuse her discretion in rejecting Father\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">ii. Unreasonableness in Conducting Child Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Next, Father contends that after the trial judge allegedly refused to initially conduct the child interview, he \u201cthen only agreed to do so in such an extremely limited and unreasonable fashion.\u201d Our review of the record shows that Father renewed his request for the trial judge to conduct an interview with the child near the end of the first day of trial. The trial judge agreed. He disclosed to counsel the general questions that he planned to ask the child, and noted that the questions would only take a few minutes. Father requested that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>trial judge specifically ask the child about her custody preference. After hearing Father\u2019s argument, the trial judge stated: \u201c... I\u2019ll just ask again very generally what do you do here, what do you do there, and do you enjoy\u2014we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Upon completion of the interview in chambers, the trial judge explained to the parties that he asked the child general questions about her interests and hobbies, as well as the following questions: \u201cDo you like being with both parents?\u201d; \u201cDo you like being at one place a little more than the other?\u201d; and \u201cIf you could live at one place\u2014with your mom or your dad, which would you prefer?\u201d The child stated that she enjoyed her time with both parents, and had no preference for living with either parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Thus, the trial judge not only conducted the child interview, but asked the very questions requested by Father\u2019s counsel. Accordingly, we hold that the second trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for disqualification on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">iii. Bias Against Conducting Interviews with Children</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Third, Father contends that the trial judge did not uphold or apply the appropriate law in conducting the child interview, and \u201cdeprived counsel of appropriate time to present proper argument.\u201d This argument is premised on statements that the trial judge made about the implications of conducting child interviews. In particular, after the trial judge initially indicated his desire to reserve on the issue of the child\u2019s testimony, Mother\u2019s counsel interjected: \u201cYour Honor, may I just say for the record that I would ask the Court not to interview [the child] because I think at nine years old, I just think that\u2019s not necessarily appropriate. I think it puts her\u2014no matter how innocuous the questions or discussion may be, I think it still puts her in a position of\u2014\u201d The trial judge agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmYI\">Yeah, I\u2014you know, you\u2019re right. I mean, if she were 14 or 15, maybe something else, but you have the other silly, silly, ridiculous part of this is when they\u2019re young, the law says the wisdom is, well, go into chambers with them and don\u2019t ask them about their presence [sic]. Well, why are they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>going into chambers talking? Well, talk about where they hang their clothes and what cars they like and get a sense, you know, so in 15 minutes, the judge is supposed to become a psychiatrist and divine from listening to the child about where her friends are and what she likes to do, what her preference is, and\u2014anyway, somebody\u2019s going to take me to task because I said, so I\u2019d better can it____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In our view, the trial judge did nothing more than comment on Mother\u2019s view of the public policy implications of conducting child interviews. The trial judge made clear that the basis for his statements was his sensitivity and concern for young children. Father\u2019s counsel understood the exchange as such, commenting: \u201cI understand you on a humanitarian basis\u2014 ...\u201d Father\u2019s counsel then went on to articulate the legal standards governing child interviews, and the trial judge listened and considered these arguments. Ultimately, the trial judge adopted Father\u2019s rationale, interviewed the child, and asked the child about her custody preference. Thus, the trial judge neither failed to apply the law, nor' was counsel deprived of an opportunity to \u201cfully argue the child\u2019s preference.\u201d Accordingly, the second trial judge did not abuse her discretion in this regard in denying the motion for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Father also argues that a child\u2019s preference \u201ccannot possibly be ascertained and properly considered with no interview of the child or a very limited interview of the child,\u201d and challenges the interview based on the length of time that the trial judge met with the child in chambers. The transcript reflects that the court recessed for twelve minutes, within which the trial judge conducted his interview of the child. As discussed in greater detail, <em>infra, </em>the trial judge has discretion as to the length and content of a child interview. Whether an abuse of discretion exists is a case-by-case determination. Here, the trial judge adopted a flexible, \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d approach as to the content and length of the interview. He asked a variety of questions related to the child\u2019s interests, pets, relationship with her parents, and custody preference. In our view, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in handling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the child interview. Accordingly, the second trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion lor disqualification on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">II. Interview of the Child<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Second, Father contends that the trial judge abused his discretion in the entire handling of the \u201cintentionally limited chambers interview\u201d of the child. In particular, Father argues that the trial judge abused his discretion because: (1) he only \u201cgrudgingly\u201d agreed to interview the child; (2) he only \u201cagreed to do so in an extremely limited way\u201d; and (3) the trial judge \u201coutright refused to inquire as to the child\u2019s preference, as required by <em>Montgomery County v. </em>Sanders\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mother argues that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in the handling of the child interview. We agree that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">\u201cWhere modification of a custody award is the subject under consideration, equity courts generally base their determinations upon the same factors as those upon which an original award was made, that is, the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Sanders, </em>38 Md.App. 406, 419, 381 A.2d 1154 (1977). We have recognized, however, that \u201cthere is no litmus paper test that provides a quick and relatively easy answer to custody matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe best interest standard is an amorphous notion, varying with each individual case ... [t]he fact finder is called upon to evaluate the child\u2019s life chances in each of the homes competing for custody and then to predict with whom the child will be better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>off in the future. At the bottom line, what is in the child\u2019s best interest equals the fact finder\u2019s best guess.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In particular, the court must examine \u201cnumerous factors\u201d and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative environments. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 381 A.2d 1154. \u201cThe criteria for judicial determination includes, but is not limited to, 1) fitness of the parents ... 2) character and reputation of the parties ... 3) desire of the natural parents and agreements between the parties ... 4) potentiality of maintaining natural family relations ... 5) preference of the child ... 6) material opportunities affecting the future life of the child ... 7) age, health, and sex of the child ... 8) residences of parents and opportunity for visitation ... 9) length of separation from the natural parents ...; and 10) prior voluntary abandonment or surrender ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). \u201cWhile the court considers all the above factors, it will generally not weigh any one to the exclusion of all others. The court should examine the totality of the situation in the alternative environments and avoid focusing on any single factor ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The trial court has the \u201cdiscretion to interview a child.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Stefanides, </em>17 Md.App. 364, 302 A.2d 682 (1973). \u201cIn disputed custody cases, the court has the discretion whether to speak to the child or children and, if so, the weight to be given the children\u2019s preference as to the custodian.\u201d <em>Leary v. Leary, </em>97 Md.App. 26, 36, 627 A.2d 30 (1993) (citing <em>Casey v. Casey, </em>210 Md. 464, 474, 124 A.2d 254 (1956)). \u25a0While the preference of the child \u201cis a factor that <em>may </em>be considered in making a custody order, the court is not required to speak with the children.\u201d <em>Lemley v. Lemley, </em>102 Md.App. 266, 288, 649 A.2d 1119 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We have explained that in determining whether to interview a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">[T]he child\u2019s own wishes may be consulted and given weight if he is of sufficient age and capacity to form a rational judgment.... But we adopt a rule that there is no specific age of a child at which his wishes should be consulted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>given weight by the court. The matter depends upon the extent of the child\u2019s mental development. The desires of the child are consulted, not because of any legal rights to decide the question of custody, but because the court should know them in order to be better able to exercise its discretion wisely. It is not the whim of the child that the court respects, but its feelings, attachments, reasonable preference and probable contentment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><em>Leary, </em>97 Md.App. at 30, 627 A.2d 30 (citing <em>Ross v. Pick, </em>199 Md. 341, 353, 86 A.2d 463 (1952)). We review a trial court\u2019s decision relating to the competency of children to testify under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Wagner v. Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. 1, 24, 674 A.2d 1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The following is an excerpt of the trial transcript regarding Father\u2019s initial request for the child\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">THE COURT: I am very reluctant to put kids in these disputes between their parents, whether on the stand, in chambers or anywhere else. If somebody believes there\u2019s an urgent need for me to talk to [the child], I will hear your argument, but I will tell you I\u2019m very reluctant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">[FATHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I understand you on a humanitarian basis.... But that\u2019s not really the issue. The issue is that [the child] has factual information that would be helpful to the Court with respect to her school, her friends, and hearing that from the horse\u2019s mouth, so to speak, we say, would be very helpful to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">THE COURT: Well, let me see how far we go on the evidence having it testified to by the parents. She\u2019s got friends who can testify to that\u2014the rest of it. You know, one day, somebody\u2019s going to take me to task in a published opinion, but I think the provision in the law that the judge can talk to a child in these situations is barbaric. I just\u2014 you know, 25 years from now, [the child]\u2019s going to be looking back that one or other parent raised her primarily, and she\u2019s going to\u2014may very well likely say that\u2019s because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>I testified against my other parent, and\u2014anyway, I\u2019ll reserve on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may I just say for the record that I would ask the Court not to interview [the child] because I think at nine years old, I just think that\u2019s not necessarily appropriate.

Well, talk about where they hang their clothes and what cars they like and get a sense, you know, so in 15 minutes, the judge is supposed to become a psychiatrist and divine from listening to the child about where her friends are and what she likes to do, what her preference is, and\u2014anyway, somebody\u2019s going to take me to task because I said, so I\u2019d better can it____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The trial judge then indicated that he was reserving on the issue of the child\u2019s testimony. Later, the trial judge agreed to conduct an interview with the child. After the trial judge was notified that the child had arrived at the courthouse, the trial court made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">THE COURT: All right. Well, why don\u2019t we take a break now, if you don\u2019t mind, and I\u2019ll talk with her in chambers for a couple minutes. Just to let you know, I\u2019m going to ask a very general question about what she does when she\u2019s up with her mom and what does she do when she\u2019s down with her dad, and going to be one or two questions about what she enjoys doing in both places. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">[FATHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Sorry, Your Honor.

Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">THE COURT: Very specifically, a lawyer\u2014a judge is specifically precluded from asking that question, and I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019ve been requested to ask it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">[FATHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. I need to make a record here, Your Honor____And one of the factors is if the child has reached an age and degree of maturity where it\u2019s appropriate for her to express her views, then the Court may inquire of the preference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">THE COURT: Well, would you suggest that age nine is such an age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">[FATHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting to, Your Honor, respectfully. As you know, the Court of Special Appeal [sic] has said a child as young as five---At a minimum, the Court must do a competency test to determine if she is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">THE COURT: Minimum, find they\u2019re capable of taking an oath, but being asked for their preference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-18\">[FATHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you can\u2019t decide that until you meet with her and decide if she\u2019s competent or not to answer that question.

I\u2019ve never spoken to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-19\">THE COURT: I mean, I\u2014counsel, I\u2019ve always been told you never ask a kid about a preference if they\u2019re at such an age.

But the preference is not with respect to mom or dad.

I\u2019ll just ask again very generally what do you do here, what do you do there, and do you enjoy\u2014 we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019ve done this in years, but\u2014....\u2014whatever I do, I\u2019ll let you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-15\">THE COURT:---- I spoke with [the child] in chambers. Pretty much the way I expected it would come out. She indicated that she was told by stepmom that she might be talking to me, and she said just the kind of questions I\u2019d be asking and she wasn\u2019t coached at all. She said that I might ask her, and she wasn\u2019t coached at all. She said that she was told to tell the truth. We moved on from that. I asked what she liked to do at both places, and the answer\u2019s pretty much the same. When she\u2019s with her mom, she likes to play with her friends and go swimming. When she\u2019s with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>her dad, she likes to go swimming and play with her Mends. She has two dogs, a beagle and a redbone coon hound. One of them\u2019s named JT at her dad\u2019s house. I asked her if she could wave a wand, what would happen after, and understandably, she said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d And I said, \u201cDo you like being with both parents?\u201d She said, \u201cYeah.\u201d And I said, \u201cDo you like being at one place a little more than the other?\u201d She said, \u201cNo.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf you could live at one place\u2014with your mom or your dad, which would you prefer?\u201d She said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a preference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Upon our review of the record, we see no basis to support the notion that the trial judge only \u201cgrudgingly\u201d agreed to interview the child, or that the trial judge only \u201cagreed to do so in an extremely limited way.\u201d The trial judge has discretion to decide whether to conduct a child interview. The trial judge exercised this discretion by electing to hear other testimony first in order to determine whether the child\u2019s testimony would be useful. The trial judge later considered Father\u2019s arguments and ultimately decided to interview the child in chambers. In our view, the trial judge\u2019s comment that it would not take long to conduct the interview was intended merely to give notice to the parties as to how long of a recess should be expected, not to express any sentiment about conducting the interview. Moreover, the trial judge adopted a flexible, \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d approach as to the content and length of the interview. He asked a variety of questions related to the child\u2019s interests, pets, and her relationship with her parents. We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in handling the child interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Additionally, we find no merit in Father\u2019s argument that the trial court \u201coutright refused to inquire as to the child\u2019s preference, as required by <em>Montgomery County v. Sanders.\u201d </em>As an initial matter, we note that <em>Montgomery County v. Sanders </em>does not require that a court expressly ask a child his or her custody preference. Although the preference of the child is a consideration for the court, interviewing the child is not the only method by which the trial judge may discern the preference of the child. <em>See Lemley, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 288, 649 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>A.2d 1119 (\u201cthe court is not required to speak with children\u201d). Regardless, Father\u2019s argument on this point is irrelevant, because the record demonstrates that the trial court inquired as to the child\u2019s preference. Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in his handling of the interview of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">III. Child Support Award</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Finally, Father argues that the trial court abused its discretion in entering a child support order \u201cbased solely on extrapolated guidelines without fully analyzing and balancing the child\u2019s best interests with the Father\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d Mother contends that it was undisputed that the parties\u2019 combined income is above the maximum amount set forth in the guidelines, and that the trial court therefore had discretion to set the amount of child support. Further, Mother posits that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in determining the amount of child support. We agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering its child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Generally, \u201cthe amount to be awarded for child support is governed by the circumstances of the case and is entrusted to the sound discretion of the [trial judge], whose determination should not be disturbed on appeal unless he arbitrarily used his discretion or was clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Gates v. Gates, </em>88 Md.App. 661, 663, 577 A.2d 382 (1990) (citing <em>Kramer v. Kramer, </em>26 Md.App. 620, 636, 339 A.2d 328 (1975)). A trial court\u2019s child support award in an \u201cabove-guidelines\u201d case is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Frankel v. Frankel, </em>165 Md.App. 553, 587, 886 A.2d 136 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Section 12-202(a)(l) of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code requires a court to use the child support guidelines \u201cin any proceeding to establish or modify child support, whether <em>pendente lite </em>or permanent.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Fam.

In <em>Voishan v. Palma, </em>327 Md. 318, 331-32, 609 A.2d 319 (1992), the Court of Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">[T]he guidelines do establish a rebuttable presumption that the maximum support award under the schedule is the minimum which should be awarded in cases above the schedule. Beyond this, the trial judge should examine the needs of the child in light of the parents\u2019 resources and determine the amount of support necessary to ensure that the child\u2019s standard of living does not suffer because of the parents\u2019 separation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In <em>Voishan, </em>a case in which the parents\u2019 incomes were above the guidelines, the husband appealed the court\u2019s child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>support decision on the basis that the amount of support could not exceed the maximum amount under the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 609 A.2d 319. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that \u201chad the legislature intended to make the highest award in the schedule the presumptive basic support obligation in all cases ... it would have so stated and would not have granted the trial judge discretion in fixing those awards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 609 A.2d 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Voishan </em>further explained that the legislature specifically declined to set guidelines above a certain amount because \u201cthe legislative judgment was that at such high income levels judicial discretion is better suited than a fixed formula to implement the guidelines\u2019 underlying principle that a child\u2019s standard of living should be altered as little as possible by the dissolution of the family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 609 A.2d 319. The Court of Appeals stated that \u201cextrapolation from the schedule may act as a guide, but the judge may also exercise his or her own independent discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 609 A.2d 319 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Father first takes issue with the fact that Mother\u2019s testimony indicated that the total expenses for herself and her two children were $4,400, and that \u201cif you divided that by [ ] three it would approximate that that would be [the child\u2019s] portion.\u201d By Father\u2019s calculation, this equated to monthly expenses of approximately $1,466.00 for the child. Mother\u2019s counsel then submitted an extrapolated child support guidelines worksheet requesting a monthly child support award in the amount of $2,883. The trial court ultimately awarded Mother child support in the amount of $2,883 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Additionally, Father alleges that the child support order demonstrates that the trial judge performed no analysis in making the custody determination. Father contends that the order \u201cmerely states in a footnote that \u2018[although this is an \u2018above guidelines\u2019 case, we apply [the guidelines\u2019] formula in determining Father\u2019s obligation. <em>See </em>attached worksheet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We first observe that the child support guidelines were not directly applicable because the parties\u2019 combined adjusted income exceeded the maximum level specified in the guidelines. The circuit court determined that the salaries of the parties were $22,275 per month for Father and $4,425 per month for Mother. This amounted to a total of $26,700 combined income, which is $11,700 greater than the $15,000 maximum under the child support guidelines. A combined adjusted income of $15,000 for one child equates to a monthly child support payment of $1,942 under the guidelines. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 12-204(e). Consequently, the amount of child support here rested in the sound discretion of the trial court. As such, the court exercised its discretion in ordering Father to pay monthly child support of $2,883, which is $941 more than the top end of the guidelines for one child.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In making the child support determination, the trial judge announced that he was \u201crelying upon <em>Frankel versus Frankel, </em>165 Md.App. 553 [886 A.2d 136], exercising my discretion ...\u201d There is simply nothing in the record to suggest, as Father urges, that the trial judge regarded the extrapolated guidelines amount as a rebuttable presumption, and awarded that amount without any examination of the requisite factors. The trial judge specifically recited his findings with respect to the parties\u2019 incomes, the child\u2019s best interests, the financial needs of the child, the parents\u2019 financial ability to meet the child\u2019s needs, the station in life of each parent, their respective ages and physical conditions, and the expenses associated with educating the child. It is evident that the trial judge considered the requisite factors, and made a finding with regard to each factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In the same vein, Father\u2019s allegation that \u201cthe lower court did not make any specific findings with respect to the child\u2019s needs and the parent\u2019s abilities to pay\u201d is wholly unsupported by the record. To be sure, the trial judge expressly stated that: \u201cIt seems to me that the best interest of [the child] and her needs would be for her to be able to continue to maintain as much financial security as she has had in the past.\u201d Moreover, the trial judge stated: \u201cwith regard to the parent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>financial ability to meet those needs, the financial ability is almost exclusively on the father\u2019s part. He makes substantially more money than mother on a reliable and monthly basis and mother\u2019s financial circumstances are significantly inferior to those of father.\u201d Further, the footnote in the order referring to the guidelines is not dispositive because the transcript makes clear that the trial judge conducted an analysis of the relevant factors and made findings of fact orally on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the second trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for disqualification. Additionally, we hold that the presiding trial judge did not abuse his discretion in the handling of the child interview, or in the granting of the award of child support. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\">. This section analyzes whether the second trial judge abused her discretion by failing to disqualify the presiding trial judge based upon his handling of the child interview. Section II addresses whether the presiding judge abused his discretion in his handling of the child interview. The relevant facts related to the child interview are summarized here, and described in greater detail in Section II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">. For clarification, we note that in Part I, Father argues that the handling of the child interview warranted disqualification of the trial judge. In Part II, Father argues that the custody decision should be reversed due to the trial judge\u2019s handling of the child interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">. Father also discusses, at length, the capacity of the child to participate in the interview, and cases involving a trial court's refusal to conduct an interview with a child. We do not discuss these cases or analyze these issues because the record here is clear that the trial judge conducted an interview with the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
