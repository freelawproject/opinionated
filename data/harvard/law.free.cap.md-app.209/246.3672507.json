Law Art. (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 2-201 (first-degree murder). On August 24, 2011, the circuit court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment, with all but eighty years suspended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant noted an appeal raising five issues, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Did the [circuit] court fail to comply with Maryland Rule 4-215(e)? I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEs\">Did the [circuit] court err in failing to determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether [a]ppellant was competent to stand trial? II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ael\">Did the [circuit] court err in failing to instruct the jury on the defenses of legally adequate provocation and voluntary intoxication? III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B\">Is the evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction for first[-]degree murder? IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APO\">Did the [circuit] court err in excluding hearsay evidence that the victim identified persons other than [a]ppellant as those responsible for assaulting the victim shortly before he was killed? V.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer each question in the negative. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of conviction. We remand the case to the circuit court, however, for the limited purpose of reimposition of the sentence followed by a period of probation in accordance with Criminal Procedure Article \u00a7 6-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">On February 17, 2010, Deputy Jesse Alexander of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office responded to a call reporting a death at 1720 East Old Philadelphia Road in Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland. Upon entering the residence located at 1720 East Old Philadelphia Road, Deputy Alexander found Daniel Cur-ran deceased. Dr. Zabiullah Ali, an assistant medical examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>er, performed an autopsy on Curran, and reported finding stab wounds to Curran\u2019s head, neck, upper chest, hand, and leg. Dr. Ali determined that Curran died as a consequence of \u201cmultiple sharp force injuries\u201d and that the manner of death was homicide. On September 22, 2010, appellant was indicted in connection with Curran\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">(1) Pretrial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">(a) Appellant\u2019s Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">On October 13, 2010, Thomas E.L. Klenk, Assistant Public Defender, entered his appearance in the case on behalf of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">On April 17, 2011, appellant wrote a letter to the circuit court, stating, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">I am writing because I have been incarcerated since October 1, 2010 and still have[not] received a Discovery, which I know was filed [October 13, 2010, and] entered [October 15, 2010,] and the Motion complied back [January 21, 2011], with Rule 4-263.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">I[have] been having problems with my Defense Attorney Thomas Klenk and I believe he has[not] issued me [ ] my copy of the Discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">Please issue me a copy of this Discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">On May 6, 2011, at a pretrial hearing, another attorney appeared in place of Klenk, and the following exchange occurred between appellant and the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsM\">[APPELLANT]: Your Honor, I have not been issued discovery. For seven months I have been incarcerated.... I\u2019ve only seen my lawyer twice since I\u2019ve been incarcerated the past seven months. And to be honest with you, he hasn\u2019t really\u2014I don\u2019t know how to say this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t think he\u2019s effectively representing you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">[APPELLANT]: There we go, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">THE COURT: Well, again, that\u2019s something that you need to talk to [Klenk] about on Tuesday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">[APPELLANT]: Well, I just want to know why I\u2019ve been incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>THE COURT: Because you\u2019re charged with first[-]degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">[APPELLANT]: Right. But I don\u2019t have any evidence shown towards me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">THE COURT: [Prosecutor], does the [S]tate have any evidence against this gentlem[a]n?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Oh, the [S]tate has overwhelming evidence against this gentleman.... [Discovery was provided to [Klenk] in December of 2010[.] ... [Discovery was f]airly extensive, your Honor, as you would imagine in a first-in a second[-]degree murder case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">THE COURT: Yeah, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">So it appears that the [S]tate has given the discovery to [Klenk]. Now if he hasn\u2019t shared it with you you have to ask him why, [appellant], but I can\u2019t answer that question. Certainly if you don\u2019t think he\u2019s representing your interests you have the right to take a number of courses of action. You can keep him as your attorney. You can dismiss him as your attorney. But if [you do] that the public defender is not going to provide you with another lawyer. So if you wanted to represent yourself\u2014which, you know, we have a saying in the law, one who represents himself, even if that person\u2019s an attorney, has a fool for a client. So if you have problems with Mr. Klenk\u2019s representation of you, you can certainly address them by way of a letter to ... the district public defender.... And I would put your complaints in a letter [to the district public defender], after you share them with Mr. Klenk. I think you ought to give Mr. Klenk an opportunity to address your concerns first. Maybe he has some plans for doing that. If you are not satisfied, then contact [the district public defender] and tell [the district public defender] what\u2019s going on. Ask him to intervene for you. Does that make sense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">A VOICE: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">THE COURT: Okay. So the matter is set in for next Tuesday. Hopefully Mr. Klenk, who is sick, will be well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>enough to attend next week, and you will be able to talk to him about these matters; and you\u2019ll be before a judge, [appellant]. If you want to address the court with regard to any of these concerns you can certainly do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am7\">[APPELLANT]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Klenk continued to represent appellant throughout pretrial hearings of May 10, 2011, May 20, 2011, and May 26, 2011, the trial, from June 13, 2011, through June 16, 2011, and at sentencing on August 24, 2011, and appellant did not raise an issue as to Klenk\u2019s representation again.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">(b) Competency to Stand Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">On January 21, 2011, at a pretrial hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel advised the circuit court that appellant's mother had informed him that appellant had \u201ca history of some admissions in the hospitals[,]\u201d which raised an issue he wanted to pursue. On January 28, 2011, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a \u201cSuggestion of Incompetency,\u201d formally requesting a competency evaluation and the circuit court granted the request. On the same day, the circuit court issued an Order for In Custody Competency Evaluation, ordering the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to examine appellant \u201cto determine whether [appellant] is able to understand the nature or object of the proceedings and to assist in his defense[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">On April 11, 2011, Andrew W. Donohue, DO, a forensic psychiatrist, submitted a letter to the circuit court, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">Pursuant to [the] order under Criminal Procedure \u00a7 3-105 of January [2]8, 2011,1 attempted to examine [appellant]. I was unable to complete the evaluation because [appellant] refused to participate, stating that he did not think that the examination was necessary and he expressed concern that to take part would potentially incriminate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">If [appellant] changes his mind and agrees to take part in the evaluation, I would be happy to see him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">On May 10, 2011, at a pretrial hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel informed the circuit court of appellant\u2019s refusal to participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>in the competency evaluation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 26, 2011, at a pretrial hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel advised the circuit court that the request for a competency evaluation was being withdrawn. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor we are here for an issue of competency to stand trial. And after further discussions with [appellant], both substantively and about this particular issue, I have come to the conclusion that I should withdraw my request. And that is with [appellant\u2019s concurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Is that correct, [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">THE COURT: Okay. And you understand the consequences of withdrawing that motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And the consequences are there will be no such evaluation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">THE COURT: Because it\u2019s my understanding they attempted to perform an evaluation and they wrote back that at that time you refused to participate, so that\u2019s why we were going to send you for further evaluation at Clifton T. Perkins. But you are withdrawing the motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s all moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">On June 13, 2011, the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">(2) Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"AVP\">(a) Witness Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">Because our resolution of the instant appeal involves the sufficiency of evidence, we set forth the lengthy and detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>facts of the case. The facts are set forth below in the order the witnesses testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">As a witness for the State, Michael Martin, a friend of the deceased, testified that he had known Curran, whom he thought of as a \u201cbrother,\u201d for approximately sixteen years, and that he saw Curran twice a week. Martin described Curran as follows: \u201cHe was an old guy. Pretty feeble. Dying of cancer, ... and liver was shot and [his] kidneys were gone, and [he was] on [ ] medications and he drank and smoked.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Martin testified that, in February 2010, Curran lived alone in a two-room house with his dog. According to Martin, Curran stored \u201chis pills, bottles of pills, medication\u201d and money in a dresser drawer in his bedroom. Martin testified that he drove Curran to the doctor\u2019s office and the pharmacy to fill his prescriptions because Curran \u201ccould barely walk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Martin testified that he last saw Curran on Tuesday, February 9, 2010. Martin last spoke with Curran by telephone on Fridays February 12, 2010, around 5:00 p.m., but was unable to see him that day due to a snowstorm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Martin testified that, on Wednesday, February 17, 2010, he went to visit Curran to \u201c[c]heek in on him.\u201d When he arrived at Curran\u2019s house, Martin discovered that the door, although closed, was already unlocked. According to Martin, he walked to the bedroom and \u201csaw the dresser drawer on the floor upside down.\u201d Martin testified that the house was \u201c[t]rashed[,]\u201d clothes were laying all over the floor, the \u201cnightstand was pulled apart[,]\u201d and a lamp was \u201cknocked over, leaning[.]\u201d Martin found Curran lying on his side on the bed. Martin testified that Curran was \u201cgray[,]\u201d \u201crock hard and cold as ice.\u201d Martin drove to Wright\u2019s Country Deli (the \u201cDeli\u201d) and told Carol Wright to call the police. Wright called 911 and law enforcement officers arrived at the Deli.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">On cross-examination, Martin testified that during questioning by law enforcement officers, he provided a list of names of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>people who had recently visited Curran. The list Martin provided to law enforcement officers included the names Archie Nunley, Archie\u2019s brother, John Nunley, Archie\u2019s nephew, \u201cMikey,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Robert \u201cTex\u201d Archer. According to Martin, these men visited with Curran and drank beer, and some of them used drugs, but \u201cthey basically took care of\u2019 Curran when they were at Curran\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As a witness for the State, Wright testified that she works at the Deli and that Curran had been a customer since 1993. Wright testified that Curran mostly \u201cbought alcohol and cigarettes\u201d and sandwiches from the Deli. According to Wright, Curran received all of his mail at the Deli, the Deli \u201cran a tab for him, and once a month [Curran] would pay his tab.\u201d Wright testified that the Deli had a note system with Curran, such that if Curran was unable to stop by the Deli to pick something up, he would write notes and send friends to the Deli to get what he needed at the time. Wright testified that when Curran \u201cwas sober, he was awesome. If he wasn\u2019t sober, we didn\u2019t let him in the store.\u201d According to Wright, on Thursday, February 11, 2010, Curran visited the Deli to buy two packs of cigarettes. Wright never spoke to or saw Curran again.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Wright testified that she knew appellant, who lived next door to the Deli with his mother, Candace Carpenter. Wright testified that, on Friday, February 12, 2010, around 7:00 p.m., appellant visited the Deli with a note signed by Curran authorizing the purchase of a twelve-pack of beer. Wright testified that she gave the twelve-pack of beer to appellant, charged the beer to Curran\u2019s tab, and placed the note into a \u201cbill box\u201d with the other notes signed by Curran. Later that night, on February 12, 2010, appellant came back to the Deli and asked for more beer for Curran. Because appellant did not have another note from Curran, Wright told him that she could not help him. Wright testified that the February 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>2010, note delivered by appellant was the last note the Deli received from Curran.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">On cross-examination, when asked by appellant\u2019s counsel to describe Curran\u2019s condition in February, 2010, Wright testified that Curran had just been released from the hospital because he \u201chad been beaten very badly[,]\u201d and had \u201c[b]lack eyes, swollen face, busted lip, [and] scrapes all over his face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As a witness for the State, Antonio Buckland, Curran\u2019s neighbor, testified that the last time he saw Curran was on Wednesday, February 10, 2010, when he took pizza to Curran. Buckland testified that, on that date, Curran appeared to have been \u201c[b]adly beaten[.]\u201d During direct examination of Buck-land, the prosecutor presented State\u2019s Exhibit 5 to Buckland, which Buckland identified as a photograph of a calendar he had given to Curran. According to Buckland, Curran marked off each day on the calendar, and the last time he visited Curran, February 10 had been marked off on the calendar. State\u2019s Exhibit 5, a photograph of the calendar, was admitted into evidence. State\u2019s Exhibit 5 showed that the calendar had been marked off through February 11, 2010. During cross-examination, Buckland testified that he\u2014like Martin\u2014provided law enforcement with the names of recent visitors to Curran\u2019s house, including Tex, \u201cRobbie,\u201d Archie, \u201cJames,\u201d John, and Mike (John\u2019s son).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As a witness for the State, Samuel Ingram, a friend of Curran\u2019s for thirteen or fourteen years, testified that he last saw Curran in February 2010, a little over a week before Curran\u2019s body was found on February 17, 2010. According to Ingram, on that visit, appellant was at Curran\u2019s house, sitting in a chair next to Curran\u2019s bed, where Curran was propped up against the wall. Ingram testified that Curran had been \u201cbeat up pretty bad. He was black and blue, still bloodied up.\u201d Ingram testified that appellant told him \u201cTex was involved with it [the beating]\u201d and that he (appellant) had seen Tex walk out of Curran\u2019s house, get into a black truck and drive off. Ingram testified that he responded to appellant\u2019s statement by saying, \u201c[r]eally, Tex drove off? [Appellant] said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Yes. I said, Well, I said, Really? He said, Well, I\u2019m sorry, it was a neon colored truck. I said, That\u2019s funny because Tex don\u2019t drive.\u201d According to Ingram, he had seen Tex a week before his visit to Curran\u2019s house and he had dropped Tex off at the train station in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Ingram testified that on the day of his last visit to Curran\u2019s house, he went to the Deli with appellant to buy Curran a six-pack of beer. According to Ingram, appellant \u201ctried to get a 12 pack of beer\u201d on Curran\u2019s tab, but the Deli would not permit appellant to do so. Ingram testified that, after picking up the beer for Curran\u2014which he (Ingram) purchased\u2014he and appellant returned to Curran\u2019s house. When Ingram left Curran\u2019s house that evening, appellant was still there. Ingram never saw or heard from Curran again.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">As a witness for the State, Detective Chris Lewis of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office testified that, on February 17, 2010, he responded to Curran\u2019s house, where he observed Curran deceased, lying on a bed, with blood on his clothing as well as on the bed. Detective Lewis testified that Curran was wearing \u201cwhat appeared to be a hospital gown,\u201d and that he observed \u201capparent stab wounds\u201d on Curran\u2019s leg and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Around 3:00 a.m. on February 18, 2010, Detective Lewis spoke with appellant in a recorded interview at the Sheriffs Office. Appellant told Detective Lewis that, on February 17, 2010, he (appellant) had been with Alicia Brown and Helen Morris<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at Steele\u2019s Motel helping Brown move from the Motel to another residence. Appellant stated that he knew Curran, who was a friend, and that he had last seen him during \u201cthe first snowstorm[,]\u201d which Detective Lewis believed was a week or two weeks before Curran\u2019s body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">As a witness for the State, Matthew Morris testified that he was Martin\u2019s step-son, that he knew Curran as one of Martin\u2019s friends, and that he had met appellant once through his brother, Miles Morris. According to Matthew, he met appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>lant when he took Miles and Helen, Miles\u2019s wife, to ask Carpenter to lend them rent money. Matthew testified that he drove Miles and Helen to Carpenter\u2019s residence, and he stayed in the car with Miles while Helen went inside to speak with Carpenter. While Matthew was waiting in the car, appellant walked up to the car and tried to sell him \u201cSeroquel,\u201d a \u201cdepression medication].\u201d Matthew testified that, at that time, appellant \u201ctalk[ed] about robbing the guy up the street[,]\u201d to \u201csteal his pills[.]\u201d According to Matthew, appellant meant Curran when he said \u201cthe guy up the street\u201d because Curran \u201cwas the only one that lived up near that way.\u201d Matthew testified that appellant told him and Miles, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to borrow money, we can rob this guy.\u201d Matthew testified that he said \u201cno\u201d to appellant\u2019s offer, and appellant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As a witness for the State, Miles testified that he knew Curran as a friend of his stepfather, Martin, and that, when Curran \u201cstay[ed] with\u201d his mother and Martin, he saw Curran \u201cabout every Friday.\u201d Miles testified that he and his wife, Helen, visited Carpenter \u201c[o]nce or twice\u201d for Helen to borrow money from Carpenter. According to Miles, on one occasion, Matthew drove him and Helen to Carpenter\u2019s, and Helen went into Carpenter\u2019s house. Appellant came outside and approached him and Matthew while they were waiting in the car. Miles testified that appellant asked if the brothers wanted to buy Seroquel, which they refused. According to Miles, appellant stated that he knew \u201cwhere to get some Percocets at, [and that] we got to go get the man drunk down at the shacks\u201d and \u201ctake his medicine.\u201d Miles testified that he believed appellant was referring to Curran.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">As a witness for the State, Thomas Allen testified that in February 2010, he lived at Steele\u2019s Motel with his mother. At some point in mid-February, at around 10:00 p.m., there was a knock at his motel room door, and a young man was at the door. Allen testified that he did not know the young man. Allen testified that the young man \u201casked if he could just come in\u201d and acted \u201creal nervous and he was crying, he was upset.\u201d Allen let the young man enter his room, and observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that the young man was \u201ccrying\u201d and \u201cshaking[,]\u201d and that he \u201ckept saying that he didn\u2019t k\u00f1l nobody[.]\u201d Allen identified appellant as the young man.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">According to Allen, appellant stated that he had been in the neighboring room at the Motel and that the people in that room \u201chad the idea that he had committed a murder\u201d of \u201can older guy that was his friend.\u201d Allen testified that appellant said he was scared and requested that he (Allen) accompany him to the room next door. Allen walked with appellant to the neighboring room, nobody was there, so they went back to Allen\u2019s room. Allen testified that appellant asked to call his mother, Carpenter, and that he overheard appellant asMng Carpenter \u201cif the cops had been by the house at all, and he [appellant] was scared to go back to the house.\u201d On the phone call, appellant \u201cwas just crying uncontrollably, repeating that he didn\u2019t Mil nobody.\u201d Allen testified that his encounter with appellant ended when he walked appellant to the neighboring room and saw appellant go inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">As a witness for the State, Michael McDonald<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> testified that in February 2010, he lived across the street from the Deli and approximately one quarter mile from Curran\u2019s house. According to McDonald, he had known Curran \u201cvery well\u201d since around 1993. McDonald testified that he first met appellant in either late January 2010 or early February 2010, in the driveway of Curran\u2019s house. McDonald testified that he and appellant conversed about \u201cpills\u201d and that he \u201cended up buying a few [Seroquel] pills\u201d from appellant. McDonald testified that he saw appellant frequently after this first encounter and that he considered himself and appellant friends. According to McDonald, in February 2010, he moved to Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">McDonald testified that, in March 2010, he returned to Maryland to go camping. During this visit, McDonald saw appellant. McDonald testified that appellant invited him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>his house to \u201chang out.\u201d McDonald took a twelve-pack of beer (with \u201ceight or nine beers\u201d remaining) to appellant\u2019s house, and appellant drank a beer while the two men sat talking. McDonald testified that the conversation \u201cturned to [how appellant] ... worried that his mom was talking to detectives or something like that.\u201d According to McDonald, prior to that day, the only thing he had heard appellant say concerning Curran\u2019s death was that he \u201cwas being persecuted [ ] by the local sheriff[\u2019]s department\u201d and had been forced to view autopsy photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">When asked by the prosecutor whether appellant told him \u201canything specific about [] Curran\u2019s murder[,]\u201d McDonald replied \u201c[y]es,\u201d and testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">On the last day I seen [appellant] when he was still drinking the beer, I had two\u2014I actually had four Suboxones, I gave him one and I took one, and I don\u2019t know how long after that, but he told me a little bit about being up at [Curran]\u2019s house that day and they were drinking, some kind of argument started, and that he snapped, I believe it was over pills, and he stabbed [Curran] in the temple and in the neck or something like that. He said more than that, but after I heard that, I really lost track of what was going on[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">On cross-examination, McDonald testified that he had been at Curran\u2019s house twice on the day Curran\u2019s body was discovered. According to McDonald, he went to visit Curran early in the morning, knocked on the door and, receiving no answer, left. As to the second visit, McDonald testified that he went to visit Curran around 11:00 a.m., opened the door, took a step inside the house and called for Curran. Receiving no response and not seeing anything unusual, McDonald left.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">McDonald testified that, in his August 30, 2010, conversation with detectives, he told detectives that he had brought up the topic of Curran during his March 2010 conversation with appellant. McDonald admitted that, during the March 2010 conversation with appellant, he had begun to suspect appellant and was \u201ctrying to butter [appellant] up\u201d to get appellant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tell him about Curran\u2019s death. When asked by defense counsel why he waited until August 2010, to tell detectives about his conversation with appellant, McDonald testified that he was wanted in Maryland for the violation of parole, and was afraid to return to Maryland to talk to law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As a witness for the State, Dr. Ali, the medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Curran, testified that he observed \u201ca total of ten stab wounds and three cutting wounds\u201d on Curran. Dr. Ali described the wounds to Curran\u2019s chest as follows: \u201c[t]wo of the stab wounds injured [Curran\u2019s] heart, perforated the heart, and caused significant bleeding in the chest cavity[,]\u201d and another \u201ccluster of three stab wounds to the right side of the chest\u201d injured the heart and passed through the liver \u201ccausing] bleeding in the abdominal cavity or inside the belly.\u201d Dr. Ali testified that another stab wound perforated Curran\u2019s left leg-or \u201centered and exited the other side of the leg[.]\u201d As to the wound to Curran\u2019s head, Dr. Ali testified that a stab wound to the left temple \u201cfractured the skull and went through the brain[.]\u201d Dr. Ali testified that he observed a cutting wound to the neck and two cutting wounds on Curran\u2019s right hand. Dr. Ali opined that the cutting wound \u201cinjuries to the right hand are typical of defense-type injuries,\u201d and that the injuries to the leg \u201ccould be consistent with defense injuries.\u201d As to the stab wound to Curran\u2019s temple, Dr. Ali opined that \u201c[b]reaking into the temple requires some force but the bone in the temple area is not very thick\u201d and he could not \u201ctell exactly how much force\u201d was used, but it was more force \u201cthan penetrating the belly or arm[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Ali acknowledged that he could not determine the order the wounds were inflicted or whether different instruments were used to inflict the wounds. Dr. Ali testified that he could not determine exactly when Curran died, but testified that the wounds were consistent with the use of a knife. A copy of the autopsy report, which included a toxicology report, was admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 7. According to the toxicology report, Curran\u2019s blood and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>urine tested positive for ethanol and various other substances, such as acetaminophen,- oxycodone, and quietiapine.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As a witness for the State, Carpenter, appellant\u2019s mother, testified that she had known Curran for approximately seven years, and that she had lived at Curran\u2019s house when she was homeless after her divorce. According to Carpenter, she knew Curran to be a drinker and user of recreational drugs, and that Curran also took prescription medication as a result of being diagnosed with cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Carpenter testified that between August 2009 and November 2009, appellant lived with her, and that prior to August 2009, she had not seen appellant in seven years. According to Carpenter, appellant met Curran on February 1, 2010. Carpenter testified that appellant and Curran \u201chit it off real well[,]\u201d that the two men watched movies and drank together, and appellant delivered meals to Curran. Carpenter did not know whether appellant and Curran had ever used recreational drugs or prescription medicine together, but testified that she knew appellant used recreational and prescription drugs. Carpenter testified that in February 2010, she had been prescribed medication, and that she \u201cstarted realizing that the medication in the bottles ... were disappearing\u201d and thought appellant was stealing her medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Carpenter testified that on February 12, 2010, appellant was residing with her. According to Carpenter, appellant went to Curran\u2019s house that day and was gone for around five hours, returning at approximately 9:20 p.m. Carpenter testified that upon his return, appellant \u201cseemed lethargic[,]\u201d was \u201cvery drunk[,]\u201d and went to his room. Carpenter followed appellant into his room to discuss his late arrival\u2014which was past his 9:00 p.m. curfew\u2014and appellant \u201csaid he thought he had hurt [Curran]\u201d and then appellant \u201cfainted or passed out.\u201d Carpenter testified that appellant had been sitting on the end of his bed and then \u201cjust collapsed\u201d and \u201cfell off the end of the bed.\u201d Carpenter \u201cstarted pouring water on [appellant], slapping him in the face, trying to talk to him\u201d and \u201c[t]he only thing that [appellant] was really able to tell [her] was that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>thought he had hurt [Curran].\u201d According to Carpenter, she wanted to go check on Curran, but she was not able to do so because appellant \u201cwas incapacitated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Carpenter testified that she was interviewed by detectives on September 8, 2010, and, she participated in a recorded interview with detectives on September 9, 2010. Carpenter initially testified that she did not tell detectives that appellant told her he killed Curran. The prosecutor refreshed her recollection with the transcript of the interview. As a result, Carpenter acknowledged that, during the interview,, she advised detectives twice that appellant told her that he thought he had killed Curran.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Carpenter testified that, during her September 9, 2010, interview with detectives, she informed detectives that appellant stated that Curran \u201chad been stabbed in each lung and in the head.\u201d Carpenter insisted at trial that, on February 12, 2010, appellant told her only that he thought he had \u201churt\u201d Curran, not that he had killed Curran. Carpenter testified that she told detectives that appellant \u201churt\u201d Curran because Curran \u201chad said something inappropriate about [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">A redacted transcript of Carpenter\u2019s September 9, 2010, interview was admitted into evidence as substantive evidence pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1 as State\u2019s Exhibit 15. In the interview, Carpenter told detectives that on February 12, 2010, appellant came home around 11:00 p.m. \u201ca lot more than intoxicated[,]\u201d \u201ctotally disoriented,\u201d and told her that \u201che thought that he had killed [Curran].\u201d Carpenter informed detectives that appellant told her that \u201che had stabbed [Cur-ran] on either side of the chest and then, uh, put a blade through his skull.\u201d Carpenter advised detectives that appellant told her, around the time law enforcement was executing a search warrant of her home, that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anything in the house[,]\u201d and that after the search warrant was executed, appellant told her that he had thrown the knife in a dumpster.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">As a witness for the State, Captain Wayne Kessler of the Santa Fe, Texas, Police Department testified that on September 2, 2010, he arrested appellant in Texas. When arrested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>appellant \u201cappeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs[,]\u201d so Captain Kessler postponed his interview of appellant for approximately two hours. Captain Kessler testified that, during his interview with appellant, appellant stated that he knew Curran through his mother, and that Curran \u201cwould occasionally give him medicine.\u201d Appellant informed Captain Kessler that he last saw Curran on February 12, 2010. According to Captain Kessler, appellant was coherent during the interview and aware of what they were discussing. Captain Kessler testified that, at one point during the interview, appellant asked to speak with a district attorney, and he (Captain Kessler) \u201cexplained to [appellant] that the district attorneys in [his] jurisdiction [in Texas] had nothing to do with th[e] case and that they couldn\u2019t be involved with any kind of deal[.]\u201d Captain Kessler testified that, at other points in the interview, appellant called himself a \u201cpsychopath,\u201d stated he wanted the death penalty, and joked that he should have gone to Mexico. Captain Kessler testified that he ended the interview after he realized that he was not \u201cgoing to get anywhere.\u201d On cross-examination, Captain Kessler acknowledged that, during the interview, appellant stated several times that he did not hurt or kill anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The State\u2019s last witness, Detective William Sewell, the lead investigator, testified that law enforcement officers did not release any information about the location and number of stab wounds inflicted on Curran. Detective Sewell testified that he never showed Curran\u2019s autopsy photographs to appellant because the Sheriffs Office \u201cactually did not receive any autopsy photos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Detective Sewell testified that, as part of the investigation, he discovered that Curran had been to the hospital in February 2010, and he retrieved the hospital report concerning Curran\u2019s visit. Five pages of the hospital report were admitted into evidence as Defense Exhibit 1. The hospital report showed that Curran visited Union Hospital on February 12, 2010, at approximately 10:30 a.m. because he was \u201cbeat up[.]\u201d In a section labeled \u201cSuieidal/Homicidal Behavior Assessment,\u201d a nurse recorded that Curran stated he would \u201clike to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>kill the person who beat [him] up[.]\u201d According to the report, when asked whether he had any history of aggressive behavior or whether he had threatened anyone physically or verbally, Curran stated, \u201cyeah when I\u2019m drunk or high[.]\u201d The report showed that Curran responded \u201cyes\u201d when asked if he had current and past substance abuse problems and stated he used cocaine, hallucinogens, and amphetamines \u201canytime [he] can get [them.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">As a witness for the defense, Jamie McFalls testified that in February 2010, she lived next door to the Deli and had known Curran for approximately four years. McFalls testified that she last saw Curran on Thursday, February 11, 2010, but agreed that she had told detectives that she last saw Curran on Tuesday, February 16, 2010. Ultimately, McFalls testified that she last saw Curran at the Deli on February 16, 2010, between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. as she and Cody Gilbert were driving to Blockbuster to return a movie, and that she recognized Curran from his distinctive walk. On cross-examination, McFalls admitted that she told detectives that it was \u201cdefinitely dark\u201d on February 16, 2010, and that Curran was \u201c[a]bout a field away.\u201d McFalls acknowledged that she did not go over and offer Curran a ride or say hello, and that she could not see Curran\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As a witness for the defense, Gilbert testified that in February 2010, he lived next door to the Deli and had known Curran, whom he considered a friend, for ten to fifteen years. Gilbert could not remember the date that he last saw Curran, but testified that it was only \u201ctwo days before he was discovered\u201d on February 17, 2010. Gilbert testified that, as he was backing out of his driveway around 5:30 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. to go to Blockbuster to return a movie, he last saw Curran \u201cwalking down the road right by the\u201d Deli. Gilbert testified that he could see Curran\u2019s face, that Curran was roughly 80 to 100 yards away, and he was sure it was Curran he saw that night. According to Gilbert, it was \u201c[g]etting dark but not black\u201d and there were lights on in the Deli parking lot area. Gilbert acknowledged that he told detectives that he was about 150 to 200 yards away from Curran when he saw him, but testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>that he was \u201c[a] hundred percent\u201d sure it was Curran he saw on this occasion. On cross-examination, Gilbert admitted that, in contrast to his in-court testimony, he had told detectives that he had not seen Curran\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">(b) Exclusion of Curran\u2019s Statements to Martin and Buckland</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Prior to the State calling Martin to testify, appellant\u2019s counsel requested a bench conference to discuss \u201can issue about some of [] Martin\u2019s testimony.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Curran apparently was beat up rather severely a couple of days before the 12th when the State believes he was last seen, and [ ] Martin had some contact with [ ] Curran about the individuals who were involved. There is [ ] Martin and actually [ ] Buckland, and I suppose the issue is the same with respect to both of them. [ ] Curran indicated to both these individuals, and I believe [ ] Buckland is on the State\u2019s list as well, who beat him up rather severely, fractured his face, caused him great pain, and it is going to be my attempt to get from those individualsr[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] on cross[-]examination those statements from [ ] Curran. I understand they are ordinarily hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">The importance to [appellant] cannot be underestimated here. This is a question about ... who killed [ ] Curran. And I believe the police will\u20141 mean, initially these people were suspects. They have all been talked to. And I think it is, again, it\u2019s crucial that that evidence gets out. There is no other way to get it out. And it is I think inherently reliable under the conditions in which it was given with respect to [ ] Curran fearing for his own safety at that point in time, his natural responses to tell the truth to his friends about what happened. Even though he wasn\u2019t talking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>everybody about what happened and he didn\u2019t identify individuals to everybody, but with respect to this individual who\u2019s apparently a good friend of his and the other individual, [] Buckland, who apparently lives close[]by and was very well about as good a friend as [] Curran had I suppose. Again, these individuals were identified and I would like to get that out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Curran\u2019s statements were not admissible under a specific hearsay exception, but argued that they were admissible under the \u201ccatch-all exception\u201d set forth in Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24). In arguing that the statements were admissible under the \u201ccatch-all exception,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel relied on the \u201cFoster case[,]\u201d as a case in which \u201cdue process considerations in being able to present the defendant\u2019s case\u201d required the admission of certain statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The State opposed the admission of Curran\u2019s statements, arguing that they were hearsay and did not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. The circuit court agreed with the State, ruling as follows: \u201cWell, the Court\u2019s not going to allow it. The Court does find that it\u2019s hearsay. [The Court does not] find that it falls within any exceptions under [Maryland Rule] 5\u2014803[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel urged the circuit court to \u201cconsider perhaps due process,\u201d but the circuit court ruled that appellant\u2019s counsel could not ask either Martin or Buckland about Curran\u2019s statements because the circuit court \u201cjust think[s] it\u2019s hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">(c) Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing, in full, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">I guess I would be making a motion, Your Honor, and indicate, again, with respect to what the state of the evidence is, it is that we have expert medical testimony indicating maybe a couple of days before\u2014anywhere from a couple days before February 18[th] to February 12[th] this individual might have died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The evidence directly implicating [appellant] is two witnesses, one of whom has a criminal background, apparently pending criminal matters, and his mother, who was kind of all over the map with respect to what she was saying, how she was saying it, how she was focused, and describing an event that seems incredible on its face to have gone that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">And on direct what [ ] Carpenter ended up saying is that, I\u2019m a nurse and I\u2019ve done all these classes and I\u2019ve done all the continuing education and so on and so forth, even though I\u2019m not able to work at this point in time. And when she sees the condition of anybody, much less her son on the evening of the 12[th] when he falls unconscious, stops breathing, and has to do things, not to describe any nurse-related activities in terms of trying to revive him\u2014she described water-boarding first of all\u2014nor calling 911, again, the Court has to believe it for that to carry weight. And given those circumstances, I think it\u2019s extremely difficult to say that she makes much sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">The rest of the evidence about who saw [Curran] last, there\u2019s pizza in the microwave that was apparently delivered on the ... 10th. So we know while he was alive it lasted until at least the 12[th] under the State\u2019s theory. Whether he would rather drink a couple beers than eat a couple pieces of pizza, nobody knows. I mean, clearly I know what they want the inferences to be, what they want the conclusions to be, but it doesn\u2019t get us there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Other evidence: There\u2019s pictures of a calendar with dates X\u2019d out. There is no evidence of character and that he did it every morning when he got up or every evening when he went to bed, he X\u2019d the next day out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The circuit court denied the motion, ruling from the bench that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">[T]here is evidence here, if the jury believed it, that could convince them beyond a reasonable doubt. If they believe the mom and they believe ... McDonald. If they believe those two witnesses, in the Court\u2019s view there is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>evidence for the jury to find [appellant] guilty of this murder, first degree, beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel interjected, stating that he thought there was \u201cstill some minimal assessment of credibility that the Court must exercise.\u201d The circuit court reiterated that the motion was denied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">Again, I think there is more than enough evidence, if the jury believes it and if the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, based on all of this evidence taken in the light most favorable to the State, where they could find [appellant] guilty of the charges that he faces. So, the Court is going to deny the motion at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">At the close of all the evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing, in entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">I would make a motion for judgment of acquittal, incorporate the argument I made last time, and ask the Judge again to assess credibility with respect to the further witnesses that have been introduced in evidence with respect to what I think is a greatly-expanded period of time that harm could have been done to [ ] Curran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">The State has laid a significant foundation that this was done by [appellant] on the 12th. We\u2019ve got two people who have not been impeached in any way, not been to Court at any time, and were clearly nervous, but said distinctly, I know it was [Curran]. I know who he is. I recognized him and it was him. I\u2019m a hundred percent sure. On the 16[th], within days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">Now, the other aspect of that is that the medical examiner said a couple days. Now, he saw [ ] Curran on the 18[th]. It still fits the framework even for the medical testimony. The 18th to the 16th is a couple days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">THE COURT: Within a day and a half. If you believe the\u2014if the jury believes the last two or those two witnesses, the young lady and the man, they said they saw [Curran] around 5:30, 6 or so.... So it would have been a day and a half by the time the medical examiner got the body then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And again, what the doctor said was those were his estimates. There is no exact timeframe. Two days was within his own estimation of when this could have happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">So again, given all of that, I would ask Your Honor, I guess\u2014well, one other thing. Even assuming that this individual was involved in an altercation that ended [] Curran\u2019s life, the circumstances are completely unknown. The character of [ ] Curran is known to a certain extent, and that is he is a disagreeable sort and someone prone to violence if he\u2019s been drinking. He\u2019s hard to get along with. Even [ ] Wright said, you know, Look, I mean, he\u2019s been nasty with me when I\u2019ve asked him to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">And so, again, the State has to have established, even prima facie at this point, the elements of first and second degree. To the extent that Your Honor is satisfied at this point that there is agency here, intent I think is still something completely open, especially given [] Curran\u2019s state of mind as established by the hospital records that were introduced. So those are my arguments. Agency at first, intent second.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The circuit court denied the motion, ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWC\">Well, again, the jury can\u2014obviously they can believe any witness, they can believe all of their testimony, part of their testimony, or none of their testimony. But at this point, I think there is, again, if the jury were to believe it, I think there is more than enough evidence for the jury to find that the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [appellant] did in fact commit the charges which he faces. I think it\u2019s a matter for the trier of fact with regard to credibility. It\u2019s not for me to decide at this point. So again, for that reason, the Court is going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">(d) Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence in the case, appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the circuit court instruct the jury as to legally adequate provocation and voluntary intoxication. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>As to voluntary intoxication, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that there was \u201cclear evidence of voluntary intoxication[,]\u201d demonstrated in part by Carpenter\u2019s testimony that appellant seemed lethargic and \u201cvery drunk\u201d when he returned home. As to legally adequate provocation, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that evidence of an altercation between appellant and Curran, as well as Curran\u2019s self-assessment \u201cthat when he gets drunk and high he can go off, [leads to] an inference that can be drawn that [Curran] could be the aggressor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In response to the request for a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication, the State argued that \u201c[t]here is no evidence of [appellant\u2019s intoxication at the time of th[e] incident. There is some evidence of [appellant\u2019s] impairment when he goes home at 11:00 o\u2019clock; but there is zero evidence of his intoxication at the time of this incident. And it\u2019s not he has some beers. It\u2019s not he smoked some dope.\u201d As to legally adequate provocation, the State argued that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any evidence generated\u201d regarding the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The circuit court refused to give the requested instructions. As to voluntary intoxication, the circuit court ruled from the bench, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">Okay. Well let\u2019s say [appellant] popped four pills on his way home from the victim\u2019s house to his house. How do we know when? I don\u2019t know. There hasn\u2019t been any evidence as to whatever he\u2014what he consume and when. I mean [appellant] didn\u2019t testify, and obviously he doesn\u2019t have to testify, and that\u2019s his right, obviously. But no other witnesses have come forward and presented any evidence as to what if anything [appellant] consumed and when. He was never taken to a doctor, a hospital. They never did any type of tests. So I don\u2019t know.

First degree murder is the intentional killing of another person with willfulness, deliberation, and premeditation. In order to convict the defendant of first degree murder the state must prove that the conduct of the defendant caused the death of [ ] Curran, and that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated. Willful means that the defendant actually intended to kill the victim. Deliberate means that the defendant was conscious of the intent to kill. Premeditated means that the defendant thought about the killing, and there was enough time before the killing, though it may have only have been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>brief\u2014or may have only been brief, for the defendant to consider the decision whether or not to kill, and enough time to weigh the reasons for or against the choice. The premeditated intent to kill must be formed before the killing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">After instructing the jury, the circuit court asked if counsel had any exceptions \u201cother than what was previously noted[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cNo, your Honor, just what was previously noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">(e) Jury Note 1</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">During deliberations, the circuit court received a note from the jury.

That it is an issue for you to decide based upon the facts and the law (jury instructions).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Appellant contends that at the pretrial conference of May 6, 2011, the circuit court failed to comply with Maryland Rule 4-215(e) by not: (1) inquiring as to whether he wanted to discharge his counsel; (2) eliciting and considering an explanation for his dissatisfaction with his counsel; and (3) determining whether the reasons were meritorious, and thereby warranting discharge. Appellant argues that his letter of April 17, 2011, stating, \u201cI\u2019ve been having problems with my Defense Attorney Thomas Klenk[,]\u201d and his remark at the pretrial conference of May 6, 2011, that he believed he was not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>represented effectively, \u201cwere obvious statements of dissatisfaction with counsel and were sufficient to trigger the [court\u2019s] requirements under Rule 4-215(e).\u201d Appellant asserts that his failure to raise the issue again at trial does not excuse the circuit court\u2019s error as Maryland Rule 4-215(e) does not require a defendant to repeat the request to discharge counsel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The State responds that the circuit court properly complied with Maryland Rule 4-215(e) as appellant\u2019s written and oral communications were not requests to discharge counsel and, thus, the circuit court was not required to undertake an inquiry pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-215(e). The State argues that appellant\u2019s April 17, 2011, letter to the circuit court was simply a complaint about not being provided discovery. The State maintains that at the May 6, 2011, hearing appellant\u2019s oral response, \u201c[t]here we go, yes[,]\u201d to the circuit court\u2019s question about effective representation of counsel \u201cdid not intimate a desire, much less make a request, to discharge\u201d Klenk. The State asserts that Maryland Rule 4-215(e) was not triggered because nothing in appellant\u2019s statements could reasonably have led the circuit court to conclude that he wished to discharge his counsel. The State points out that the circuit court informed appellant that if, after discussing his concern about discovery with Klenk, he wanted to address the court further he could \u201ccertainly do that,\u201d but that appellant never again raised an issue as to his representation by Klenk.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. 612, 621-22, 4 A.3d 908 (2010), the Court of Appeals set forth the following standard of review for issues concerning the discharge of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">When applicable, Rule 4-215(e) demands strict compliance. \u201cThe provisions of the rule are mandatory\u201d and a trial court\u2019s departure from them constitutes reversible error.

Maryland Rule 4-215(e), concerning discharge of counsel, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request.

If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsection (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>408 Md. 515, 531-32, 970 A.2d 908 (2009), the Court of Appeals discussed the procedures set forth in Maryland Rule 4-215(e) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">Under the Rule, when a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>in his or her case, the court must provide the defendant an opportunity to explain why the defendant wishes to discharge that attorney. Next, the trial court must make a determination about whether the defendant\u2019s desire to discharge counsel is meritorious. Finally, ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Where the trial [court] finds a defendant\u2019s reasons to be meritorious, [it] must grant the request and, if necessary, give the defendant an opportunity to retain new counsel. When a defendant makes an unmeritorious request to discharge counsel, the trial judge may proceed in one of three ways: (1) deny the request and, if the defendant rejects the right to represent himself and instead elects to keep the attorney he has, continue the proceedings; (2) permit the discharge in accordance with the Rule, but require counsel to remain available on a standby basis; (3) grant the request in accordance with the Rule and relieve counsel of any further obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In <em>State v.

In <em>Davis, id. </em>at 28, 997 A.2d 780, after defense counsel\u2019s statement, the county administrative judge ordered that the case proceed to trial. The Court of Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s request to discharge counsel, relayed through his attorney, was an adequate request. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 997 A.2d 780. The Court of Appeals pointed out that defense counsel \u201cexplicitly reported [the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction to the court\u201d followed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>defendant\u2019s request for new counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 34-35, 997 A.2d 780.

In <em>Davis, id. </em>at 36, 997 A.2d 780, the Court of Appeals allayed the State\u2019s fears that its decision would place an undue burden upon trial judges, stating: \u201cWe do not suggest that a mere hint of discord within the defense\u2019s ranks <em>from any source </em>demands investigation.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In <em>State v. Northam, </em>421 Md. 195, 197, 26 A.3d 344 (2011), the Court of Appeals held that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on the contention that the trial court failed to comply with the procedures of Maryland Rule 4-215(e). In <em>Northam, id. </em>at 198-99, 26 A.3d 344 shortly after his arrest, the defendant \"wrote two letters, one addressed to the clerk of the trial court and one addressed to the District Court of Maryland, expressing his dissatisfaction with his assigned public defender and stating that he was \u201cdropping\u201d the public defender and requesting a pro bono lawyer. At a pretrial hearing, the defendant verbally expressed his dissatisfaction with the public defender and the public defender\u2019s office. <em>Id. </em>at 199-201, 26 A.3d 344. Six months later, at a motions hearing, the defendant was still represented by his assigned public defender. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 26 A.3d 344. Less than two months after the motions hearing, the defendant filed a motion for a change in venue in the form of a letter captioned \u201cFor a Change of Venue,\u201d stating at the end of the letter that his public defender had not contacted him even though trial was three weeks away and requesting \u201ca Court appointed attorney and Change of Venue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202-03, 26 A.3d 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In <em>Northam, id. </em>at 206, 26 A.3d 344 the Court of Appeals agreed with the State that the defendant\u2019s change of venue letter was \u201c \u2018sufficient only to alert the prosecutor and the trial court that [the defendant] desired a change of venue ... and [the] vague request that he wanted a \u201cCourt appointed attorney,\u201d buried in the final sentence of the final paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of what was captioned and pled ... solely as a change of venue motion stands in stark contrast to other cases where 4-215 inquiries were mandated.\u2019 \u201d (Omission in original). The Court of Appeals pointed out that, after filing the change of venue letter, the defendant had the opportunity to request permission to discharge his assigned public defender at two separate pretrial hearings as well as prior to the start of trial itself. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 26 A.3d 344. The Court of Appeals held: \u201cBecause no such request was presented to [the trial judge] on any of these occasions, we agree with the State\u2019s argument that ... \u2018Rule 4-215(e) was not implicated, much less violated, by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 615-16, 4 A.3d 908 the Court of Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s statement during jury <em>voir dire </em>that he was \u201cthinking about changing [his] attorney or something\u201d constituted a request to discharge counsel, but that the procedures of Maryland Rule 4-215(e) were not applicable as <em>voir dire, </em>a meaningful trial proceeding, had begun. During <em>voir dire, </em>the defendant informed the trial court that he had not changed his mind about \u201cwanting a trial\u201d and that he was \u201cthinking about changing the attorney or something.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 4 A.3d 908 (emphasis omitted). The Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant\u2019s statement about changng his attorney qualified as a request to discharge counsel because \u201ca trial court reasonably should have interpreted it as such.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622, 4 A.3d 908. The Court explained that the defendant\u2019s statements \u201ccommunicated [ ] his unhappiness (albeit a passing state of mind at the time) with his trial counsel clearly enough to constitute a request to discharge counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 4 A.3d 908. The Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s statement was \u201ctoo vague and indecisive to amount to a request to discharge\u201d his counsel, stating: \u201cEven if [the defendant] did not intend to make such a request definitively, however, the fact that he was considering the possibility of discharging counsel suggests that some consideration by the court into his rationale was appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623 n. 8, 4 A.3d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In <em>Joseph v.

The trial court responded that the defendant could have any attorney he wanted as long as the attorney was present for the start of trial the following day. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 988 A.2d 545. This Court held that the prosecutor and defense counsel clearly made known the defendant\u2019s desire to discharge his counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88, 988 A.2d 545. We pointed out that, in order to trigger an inquiry under Maryland Rule 4-215(e), case law indicated that the requirement was that a defendant\u2019s desire to discharge counsel be made known to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 988 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In <em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 632, 870 A.2d 217, the Court of Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s statement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtC\">regarding his dissatisfaction with his attorney, if timely, should have triggered an inquiry by the court as to whether [the defendant] wanted to discharge his counsel.

In both instances, appellant\u2019s specific complaint concerned a \u201clack of discovery\u201d rather than an attempt to discharge counsel. In the April 17, 2011, letter to the circuit court, appellant stated he had not been issued a copy of the discovery and requested that the circuit court \u201c[p]lease issue [him] a copy of this Discovery.\u201d At the May 6, 2011, pretrial hearing, appellant reiterated his concern about the lack of discovery, stating, \u201cI have not been issued discovery.\u201d To be sure, the circuit court interjected: \u201cYou don\u2019t think [your counsel is] effectively representing you,\u201d and appellant responded: \u201cThere we go, yes.\u201d At no point did appellant indicate that he wished to discharge counsel or independently raise the issue of a lack of effective representation. At this juncture, it is readily apparent from the record that appellant sought only to receive discovery from the attorney. As a result, the circuit court suggested that appellant talk to the attorney about why he had not received the discovery materials. The circuit court advised appellant that if he continued to have concerns which he wanted to address before the court, he could \u201ccertainly do that\u201d at the next upcoming pretrial hearing, which was scheduled for May 10, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">After the letter of April 17, 2011, and the May 6, 2011, hearing, appellant had the opportunity to request permission to discharge Klenk at three separate pretrial hearings held in May, 2011\u2014on May 10, May 20, and May 26\u2014as well as prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to the start of and during trial in June 2011, and at sentencing on August 24, 2011. Appellant was aware, based on the circuit court\u2019s advisement to him at the May 6, 2011, pretrial hearing, that the court had provided an opportunity for him to resolve the discovery issue with Klenk, and that the court was willing to address the matter again should he still have \u201cany of these concerns[.]\u201d The record reflects, however, that appellant never raised the issue of discovery\u2014or any other problems with Klenk\u2014again. Because appellant did not request to discharge Klenk as counsel\u2014but instead sought discovery and never raised an issue as to Klenk\u2019s representation of him at additional pretrial hearings, trial or sentencing\u2014under the circumstances of this case, appellant\u2019s communications with the court did not trigger the discharge of counsel inquiry required by Maryland Rule 4-215(e). <em>See Northam, </em>421 Md. at 202-03, 207, <em>26 </em>A.3d 344 (Where a defendant earlier made a vague request for a new attorney in a multi-part motion and did not request to discharge counsel at subsequent pretrial hearings, the Court of Appeals held that Maryland Rule 4-215(e) was not implicated.).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Applying principles gleaned from relevant case law, we are satisfied that appellant\u2019s written and oral communications were not \u201cstatements that would reasonably apprise [the circuit] court of [his] wish to discharge [Klenk as his] counsel.]\u201d <em>Davis, </em>415 Md. at 32, 997 A.2d 780.

Although appellant is correct that nothing within Maryland Rule 4-215(e) requires a defendant to renew the request to discharge counsel at trial, the Rule clearly requires that to trigger its application a request to discharge must be made. In expressing a concern over the lack of discovery, appellant did not explicitly request to discharge Klenk, or notify the circuit court in any manner of the desire to seek different counsel. Compounding the lack of notification to the court of a desire to seek different counsel, appellant accepted Klenk\u2019s representation without complaint at three additional pretrial hearings, trial, and sentencing. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the circuit court properly addressed appellant\u2019s concerns over the lack of discovery and did not violate the procedures set forth in Maryland Rule 4-215(e).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in failing to determine, based upon evidence presented on the record, whether he was competent to stand trial.

In <em>Peaks, id., </em>prior to trial, defense counsel requested an evaluation of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, and the trial court ordered an evaluation. Prior to the start of trial, the trial court determined that the defendant was competent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 246-47, 18 A.3d 917.

The trial court found on the record, after <em>voir dire, </em>that it was \u201csatisfied\u201d the defendant was competent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 18 A.3d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In <em>Peaks, id. </em>at 251, 18 A.3d 917 the Court of Appeals observed that there was no substantive challenge to the defendant\u2019s competency because the defendant had not alleged that he was incompetent to stand trial, but rather that the defendant challenged an alleged procedural error by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>court\u2014namely, that the trial court failed to determine the competency issue prior to the start of trial. The Court of Appeals held that, because the issue involved reconsideration of a prior determination of competency, the matter was not controlled by C.P. \u00a7 3-104(a), and the reconsideration could be made, \u201cwithin the court\u2019s discretion, at any time before final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 18 A.3d 917. In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals pointed out that, \u201c[ojn the day of trial, defense counsel did not make a motion with respect to competency or challenge the lack of a completed evaluation. Had defense counsel considered the issue still outstanding, he had every opportunity to object to the characterization and bring the issue to the court\u2019s attention at that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 18 A.3d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 356-57, 761 A.2d 885, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred by finding that a competency examination was not necessary and failing to hold a competency hearing. In <em>Roberts, id. </em>at 354, 761 A.2d 885, defense counsel filed a motion requesting a mental examination to determine the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The State filed an answer to the motion the following day. <em>Id. </em>at 355, 761 A.2d 885. The day after that, the trial court denied the motion without a hearing, and approximately a month later, trial commenced. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 761 A.2d 885. Upon review, the Court of Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azp\">once the issue of competency has been triggered, a trial court has an affirmative duty to determine an accused\u2019s competency on evidence presented on the record. Under circumstances, such as the facts of the case at bar, where there is <em>no evidence </em>on the record concerning [the defendant\u2019s competency, a hearing to present evidence is appropriate to put evidence on the record from which a valid determination of competency can be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 367, 761 A.2d 885 (emphasis in original). The Court observed that defense counsel triggered the requirement for a competency determination by filing a motion for an evaluation. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 761 A.2d 885. As such, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred by failing to make such a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tion based on evidence on the record as there was no evidence from which such a determination could be made nor were the parties provided an opportunity to present any evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s competency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Returning to the case at hand, we begin by noting that appellant contends that the circuit court erred by failing to determine whether he was competent to stand trial despite the fact that he withdrew his request for a competency evaluation. Based on the circumstances of the case, we conclude that the circuit court properly addressed the issue of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial, implicitly finding that appellant was competent to stand trial and permitting appellant to withdraw his request for a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Appellant\u2019s withdrawal of the request for a competency evaluation is dispositive of the issue under C.P. \u00a7 3-<em>104(a)\u2014i.e. </em>once the request was withdrawn, the circuit court was no longer under an obligation to determine, as a result of the request, whether appellant was competent or incompetent to stand trial. Withdrawal of the request for a competency evaluation is not prohibited by statute or Maryland case law, and given the facts in this case, the circuit court properly permitted appellant to withdraw the request for a competency evaluation. The record reflects that, on January 28, 2011, appellant\u2019s counsel requested a competency evaluation. The request was based on information communicated to appellant\u2019s counsel by appellant\u2019s mother and not based on any conduct by appellant before the circuit court. The circuit court granted the request and promptly issued an order on the same date for an in-custody competency evaluation. Appellant refused to participate in the competency examination. At the May 26, 2011, pretrial hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel withdrew the request for a competency evaluation, stating that the decision to withdraw the request was arrived at with appellant\u2019s consent and came \u201cafter further discussions with [appellant], both substantively and about this particular issue[.]\u201d The circuit court informed appellant on the record that, as a result of withdrawing the request, there would be no competency evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ation. Appellant stated twice that he understood and was withdrawing the request. The circuit court then stated: \u201cAnd that\u2019s all moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the circuit court\u2019s remark that the matter was \u201cmoot\u201d was not the equivalent of a finding that the issue of appellant\u2019s competency, independent of the withdrawal of the request, was rendered moot-indeed, the issue of competency may be raised by either party or the court at any time pursuant to C.P. \u00a7 3-104(a). Rather, the circuit court observed that the matter at hand\u2014appellant\u2019s request for a competency evaluation\u2014was \u201cmoot\u201d because the request had been withdrawn. As such, there was nothing further for the circuit court to consider as to appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The record is devoid of any indication that, after appellant withdrew the request for a competency evaluation, appellant\u2019s behavior at trial or sentencing was such that it triggered either appellant, appellant\u2019s counsel, or the circuit court to re-raise the issue of his competency. In <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 364, 761 A.2d 885, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201ca trial court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of the accused is triggered in one of three ways: (1) upon motion of the accused; (2) upon motion of the defense counsel; or (3) upon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial.\u201d (Citation omitted). There is no indication in the record that the circuit court lacked an understanding of its duty or departed from its duty. Judges are presumed to know the law. <em>State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 179, 825 A.2d 452 (2003) (It is a \u201cwell-established principle that \u2018trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it properly.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted)). Here, appellant and his counsel withdrew the request for a competency evaluation, ending the court\u2019s obligation to determine competency based on their request. After withdrawal of the request, appellant exhibited no conduct that gave rise to a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the circuit court that he may not be competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">At oral argument, the State agreed with appellant\u2019s position that where a substantive challenge as to a defendant\u2019s compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tency to stand trial is made, the trial court is required to make a determination on competency, even if the defendant withdraws the request. Without directly expressing an opinion as to the State\u2019s position\u2014that a defendant\u2019s substantive challenge to. competency may not be withdrawn\u2014we conclude that, in this case, to the extent that appellant raised a substantive challenge to his competency to stand trial, the circuit court implicitly determined that appellant was competent to stand trial and permitted withdrawal of the request for a competency evaluation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In so concluding, we observe: (1) the record is completely silent as to any behavior or conduct on the part of appellant giving rise to a concern by the circuit court as to his competence; (2) appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request for a competency evaluation was based on information received from appellant\u2019s mother, not his own independent observations of appellant\u2019s conduct and behavior; (3) the record contains no information from appellant\u2019s mother concerning his prior hospitalizations, <em>i.e. </em>when appellant was hospitalized, the duration of the hospitalizations, or any information about whether appellant had been diagnosed with a psychiatric condition;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (4) in informing the circuit court of appellant\u2019s failure to participate in a scheduled competency evaluation, the forensic psychiatrist stated that appellant refused to participate because he believed that \u201cto take part would potentially incriminate him[,]\u201d demonstrating that, although not legally correct in his thinking, appellant\u2019s refusal to participate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>not the result of a psychiatric condition but rather based on a rational choice; and (5) when the request for a competency evaluation was withdrawn, appellant coherently responded to the circuit court\u2019s question. Given these facts, there was no basis on the record for the circuit court to conclude that appellant was anything other than competent. It is evident from the record that the circuit court was satisfied that appellant was competent to stand trial. Contrary to appellant\u2019s position at oral argument, the circuit court was not required to specifically question appellant as to his competence, <em>i.e. </em>to engage in a question and answer colloquy with appellant on the issue of competence, where the evidence of record demonstrated that he was, indeed, competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Both on brief and at oral argument before this Court, appellant relied upon Pate for the proposition that a defendant may not withdraw his request for a competency evaluation. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Pate, </em>383 U.S. at 384, 86 S.Ct. 836, held that a defendant who is incompetent cannot \u201cknowingly or intelligently \u2018waive\u2019 his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial[,]\u201d Pate is readily distinguishable. In <em>Pate, id. </em>at 378-83, 86 S.Ct. 836 four defense witnesses testified extensively at trial as to the defendant\u2019s long history of troubled behavior, each expressing the opinion that the defendant was insane, medical records documenting the defendant\u2019s mental health issues were admitted in which one practitioner noted that the defendant was possibly schizophrenic, and a few years prior to trial, the defendant shot and killed his eighteen-month-old son and then twice attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head and by jumping into a lagoon. Unlike in <em>Pate, id. </em>at 384, 86 S.Ct. 836 there was nothing in the record demonstrating that throughout the trial proceedings despite the withdrawal of the request for a competency evaluation, the issue of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial warranted further examination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the circuit court properly permitted the request for a competency evaluation to be withdrawn and, in permitting the withdrawal, the court implicitly determined that appellant was competent to stand trial. We observe that, after withdrawing the request for a competency evaluation, appellant made no further motion or request concerning his competency to stand trial. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Peaks, </em>419 Md. at 262, 18 A.3d 917 \u201c[h]ad [appellant\u2019s] counsel considered the issue still outstanding [or had he desired an explicit statement as to appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial], he had every opportunity to ... bring the issue to the court\u2019s attention\u201d at the time he withdrew the request or at any point during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in failing to give jury instructions on legally adequate provocation and voluntary intoxication because the evidence was sufficient to generate such instructions. Appellant argues that \u201cmultiple sources of evidence[,]\u201d including\u2014(1) his statement to McDonald that he and Curran were drinking and arguing over pills when he \u201csnapped\u201d and stabbed Curran; (2) Curran\u2019s statements to medical personnel that he wanted to kill the person who assaulted him; (3) Curran\u2019s history of aggressive behavior and making physical and verbal threats when he was \u201cdrunk or high\u201d; (4) Wright\u2019s testimony that Curran was not permitted in the Deli if he was not sober; (5) testimony from other -witnesses, such as Martin, Buckland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>and Carpenter, that Curran drank and used illegal drugs; and (6) the autopsy toxicology report showing that Curran tested positive for \u201cethanol\u201d and drugs\u2014sufficiently generated an instruction on legally adequate provocation. Appellant asserts that the question from the jury concerning whether stabbing someone during a heated argument constituted first-degree murder demonstrated that an instruction on legally adequate provocation was generated by the evidence. Appellant maintains that the circuit court committed plain error by failing to give an instruction on legally adequate provocation after receiving the jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Appellant contends that the following evidence was sufficient to generate an instruction as to voluntary intoxication: (1) McDonald\u2019s testimony that he (appellant) told McDonald that he and Curran were drinking the night of the argument; and (2) Carpenter\u2019s testimony that he appeared very drunk and passed out after returning home from Curran\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The State responds that the circuit court properly denied appellant\u2019s request for jury instructions concerning legally adequate provocation and voluntary intoxication because the defenses were not generated by the evidence. The State contends that, in requesting an instruction as to legally adequate provocation, appellant\u2019s counsel admitted there was a lack of evidence to support the giving of such an instruction. The State argues that McDonald\u2019s testimony about appellant and Curran arguing over pills does not establish sufficient evidence to warrant giving an instruction on provocation. As to Carpenter\u2019s testimony that Curran made a \u201cderogatory statement\u201d concerning her, the State maintains that the circuit court properly determined that there simply was not enough information about the alleged statement to generate an instruction on legally adequate provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">As to an instruction on voluntary intoxication, the State contends that the circuit court properly refused to give such an instruction because there was no evidence from which \u201ca jury [could] rationally conclude that [appellant] was intoxicated, and that that intoxication was to such [an] extent as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>make him incapable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We review a \u201ctrial court\u2019s refusal or giving of a jury instruction under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Stabb v.

In considering whether a trial court abused its discretion in declining to give a particular jury instruction, we consider the following factors: \u201c(1) whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law; (2) whether it was applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) whether it was fairly covered in the instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">(3) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">(a) Jury Instructions Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding.\u201d In <em>Bazzle v. State, </em>426 Md. 541, 550, 45 A.3d 166 (2012), the Court of Appeals stated that a \u201crequested jury instruction is applicable if the evidence is sufficient to permit a jury to find its factual predicate.\u201d As to that determination\u2014whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a jury to find its factual predicate\u2014the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">The threshold determination of whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the desired instruction is a question of law for the judge.

The Court described \u201csome evidence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It c\u00e1lls for no more than what it says\u2014\u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the [] claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim ..., the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant [acted in the manner set forth in the specific jury instruction requested].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251 (emphasis in original). In determining whether competent evidence was produced to generate the giving of the requested instruction, an appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>Bazzle, </em>426 Md. at 551, 45 A.3d 166 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">(b) Legally Adequate Provocation</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 582, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010), the Court of Appeals explained the four elements of the defense of legally adequate provocation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">1. There must have been adequate provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">2. The killing must have been in the heat of passion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">3. It must have been a sudden heat of passion\u2014that is, the killing must have followed the provocation before there had been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">4.

The Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[i]t is well settled that provocative words\u2014even if accompanied by some physical contact\u2014do not constitute adequate provocation to mitigate a murder to a manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 3 A.3d 1210; <em>see also Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 552, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990) (\u201cInsulting words or gestures, [even racial and derogatory comments,] no matter how opprobrious, do not amount to an affray, and standing alone, do not constitute adequate provocation\u201d). In <em>Christian v. State, </em>405 Md. 306, 323, 951 A.2d 832 (2008), the Court of Appeals observed that appellate courts have recognized the defense of adequate provocation \u201cin cases involving mutual affray, assault and battery, discovering one\u2019s spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another, resisting an illegal arrest, witnessing, or being aware of, an act causing injury to a relative or third party, and anything the natural tendency of which is to produce passion in ordinary men and women.\u201d (Citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 551-52, 573 A.2d 1317, the Court of Appeals discussed the circumstance of mutual combat and adequate provocation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">Mutual combat has been recognized as a possible source of adequate provocation. The rule of provocation will apply when persons enter into angry and unlawful combat with a mutual intent to fight and, as a result of the effect of the combat, the passion of one of the participants is suddenly elevated to the point where he resorts to the use of deadly force to kill the other solely because of an impulsive response to the passion and without time to consider the consequences of his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In <em>Sims, id. </em>at 547-48, 573 A.2d 1317, the defendant requested an instruction on manslaughter, and the trial court denied the request. The Court of Appeals observed that, although there was evidence of words and gestures exchanged between the defendant and the victim, and evidence that the victim had \u201cdirected racial and derogatory comments toward\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the defendant, \u201cthere was no evidence of a mutual affray\u201d and the victim\u2019s comments \u201cdid not constitute adequate provocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 573 A.2d 1317. In discussing the evidence presented at trial, the Court of Appeals stated that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there was sufficient evidence of an adequate provocation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">there [was] not a shred of evidence showing the state of mind of the defendant at the moment of the shooting. [The defendant\u2019s] testimony shed[] no light on this because he testified he was not there. No one else saw his facial expressions or heard his speech at the time critical to this determination. Assuming that there might be a case where evidence of that type could demonstrate the sudden onset of hot-blooded passion that produced the mortal blow or shot, this [was] not such a case. The blood must indeed be hot, and under some circumstances only the hot-blooded killer can attest to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 553, 573 A.2d 1317 (citations omitted). The Court of Appeals noted that, although the ultimate burden rests with the State to prove the absence of a legally adequate provocation, a defendant bears the initial burden of producing \u201csome evidence\u201d to warrant giving a jury instruction on legally adequate provocation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>McKay v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 204, 207, 600 A.2d 904 (1992), this Court held that, given the facts of the case, there was sufficient evidence to warrant the giving of an instruction on adequate provocation. Two witnesses testified that they saw the defendant shoot the victim twice \u201cfollowing an affray between the two combatants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One witness testified that he saw the victim yell at the defendant and them jump on the defendant and start fighting him. <em>Id. </em>The victim \u201cpounded\u201d the defendant\u2019s head \u201cseveral times into metal steps along the sidewalk,\u201d and the fight between the two men lasted several minutes until the defendant withdrew a revolver from his waistband and fired at the victim. <em>Id. </em>The defendant requested a jury instruction as to legally adequate provocation, which was denied by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 209-11, 600 A.2d 904. We concluded that \u201cthere was evidence from which the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>could have found [the defendant] acted in the heat of passion\u201d and that the defendant had met the \u201cburden of presenting sufficient evidence of mitigation to satisfy the \u2018some evidence\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 217, 600 A.2d 904. Accordingly, we held that the trial court should have instructed the jury as to legally adequate provocation. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 600 A.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">(c) Voluntary Intoxication</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The Court of Appeals has held that \u201c[voluntary intoxication as a defense to some criminal charges is clearly recognized in Maryland.\u201d <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 58, 512 A.2d 358 (1986). Indeed, as early as 1888, the Court of Appeals \u201cnoted as a general principle that evidence of intoxication was admissible to negate the <em>mens rea </em>required for a first degree murder conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 512 A.2d 358 (citation omitted). Stated otherwise, \u201c[voluntary intoxication can have [an] exculpatory effect on any crime requiring specific intent. Thus, voluntary intoxication could negate guilt for criminal homicide of the specific-intent-to-kill variety at all levels of blameworthiness\u2014 first-degree murder, second[ ]degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Bey v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 607, 631, 781 A.2d 952 (2001) (last alteration in original); <em>see also State v.

The only exception to this occurs when a defendant, charged with a crime requiring a specific intent, is so drunk that he is unable to formulate that <em>mens rea. </em>His intoxication then will excuse his actions and serve as a defense.\u201d (Citations omitted)); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 1, 8-9, 555 A.2d 509, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 549, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989) (\u201c[V]oluntary intoxication does not excuse murder, but it may reduce murder in the first degree to murder in the second degree.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">As to the degree of intoxication, in <em>Gover, </em>267 Md. at 607-08, 298 A.2d 378, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">[T]he degree of intoxication which must be demonstrated to exonerate a defendant is great. Evidence of drunkenness which falls short of a proven incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>establishes that the mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion and does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequence of his act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In <em>Lewis, </em>79 Md.App. at 12-13, 13 n. 4, 555 A.2d 509, as to evidence of intoxication, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">[T]he single fact that one has consumed what some may consider to be an inordinate amount of alcohol, standing alone, with no evidence as to the [ejffect of that alcohol on the defendant, would not permit a jury reasonable to conclude that he had lost control of his mental faculties to such an extent as to render him unable to form the intent[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">[Tjhere was no attempt in this case to offer expert opinions as to the [e]ffect on the defendant of the ingestion of those quantities of alcohol and drugs[.] ... Without knowing the -level of one\u2019s tolerance, no good correlation can be observed between the amount of alcohol consumed and the degree of drunkenness displayed. In short, it is not the amount consumed but the effect on the consumer that is important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azh\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">In <em>Bazzle, </em>426 Md. at 545, 45 A.3d 166 the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe evidence did not generate an instruction on voluntary intoxication because it was insufficient to allow a jury to rationally conclude that [the defendant] was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the intent necessary to constitute his crimes.\u201d The defendant \u201cgot drunk with his friends[,]\u201d consuming at least three 40-ounce containers of beer and then consuming more alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 45 A.3d 166. The victim testified that he had been sitting in a truck at a gas station when the defendant approached, told him to get out, and then stabbed him multiple times. <em>Id. </em>The defendant, who had also been stabbed, was taken to the hospital, where his blood alcohol content was measured at .157 and .137. <em>Id. </em>A friend testified that the defendant was bleeding and about to pass out. <em>Id. </em>Testifying on his own behalf at trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>defendant denied that he attacked the victim and stated \u201che was unable to recall some of his own behavior on the night he was attacked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant requested a voluntary intoxication jury instruction, which the trial court denied. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 45 A.3d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In <em>Bazzle, id. </em>at 555-56, 45 A.3d 166 the Court of Appeals held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">In this case, the evidence is insufficient to allow a jury to rationally conclude that [the defendant] was so severely impaired that he could not form the intent necessary to constitute his crimes. To be sure, [the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content of. 157 was nearly twice the legal driving limit. Illogical behavior and memory loss are also generally associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Yet [the defendant] has not shown that such phenomena, which are undoubtedly \u201csome evidence\u201d that he was drunk, are also \u201csome evidence\u201d that he was unable to form a specific intent. Essentially, all [the defendant] has shown is that he was drunk and exhibited the typical characteristics of being drunk. This is not evidence that he was unable to form a specific intent, and is therefore insufficient to raise a jury issue on voluntary intoxication as a defense to a specific intent crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(Citation omitted). The Court of Appeals observed that some of the defendant\u2019s actions were inconsistent with being intoxicated, including that he was able to recognize the gender of his two attackers, escape by running from the attackers, locate his friend\u2019s house at night, and \u201cspeak intelligibly while allegedly intoxicated[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556-57, 45 A.3d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Although acknowledging that the defendant \u201cwas indeed drunk on the night the crimes were committed,\u201d the Court of Appeals noted that voluntary drunkenness alone <em>(i.e. </em>not to the \u201cdegree of intoxication which must be demonstrated to exonerate a defendant\u201d) is no defense to a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 45 A.3d 166 (citation omitted). As such, the Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give an instruction on voluntary intoxication. <em>Id.

Rather, the question is whether instructions as to legally adequate provocation and voluntary intoxication were generated by the facts of the case. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the instructions were not warranted based on the evidence, and the circuit court properly declined to give the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">(a) Legally Adequate Provocation</p>\n<p id=\"An\">Given the evidence presented in the case, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that there was at least \u201csome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>evidence\u201d establishing either a mutual affray, or words and conduct on Curran\u2019s part that provoked him.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, there is simply no evidence of a mutual affray. When requesting the instruction, appellant\u2019s counsel admitted that there was a lack of evidence of a mutual affray, acknowledging that the issue of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2g\">self-defense [or legally adequate provocation] is generally generated either by a statement of the defendant about some kind of altercation, or of witnesses, of viewing some kind of altercation. We don\u2019t have that in this case in either statement by the witnesses, who report a confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_m\">Appellant\u2019s attempt to cast Curran as the physical aggressor\u2014based on: (1) Curran\u2019s statements to medical personnel that he would like to kill those responsible for beating him; (2) Wright\u2019s testimony that Curran was not a good customer when drunk; and (3) the toxicology report showing Curran tested positive for ethanol and other substances\u2014fails on multiple levels to establish facts sufficient to warrant an instruction on legally adequate provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">First, appellant\u2019s characterization of Curran as capable of a physical affray is at odds with evidence presented at trial. Multiple witnesses testified that Curran was in poor physical condition before his death, having been \u201cbeaten very badly[,]\u201d in Wright\u2019s words. Martin testified that Curran was an \u201cold guy. Pretty feeble. Dying of cancer[.]\u201d According to Martin, Curran \u201ccould barely walk\u201d and relied on him for transportation to and from the doctor\u2019s office and the pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Dr. Ali testified that Curran had several \u201cdefense-type injuries\u201d on his right hand and leg. Next, whether Curran was drunk at the time of his death or had a history of becoming verbally and physically aggressive when drunk or intoxicated was not sufficient to demonstrate that, on this occasion, Cur-ran was the physical aggressor or that Curran physically or verbally threatened appellant, thereby provoking appellant to respond in hot blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 551-52, 573 A.2d 1317 we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">[t]he rule of provocation will apply when persons enter into angry and unlawful combat with a mutual intent to fight and, as a result of the effect of the combat, the passion of one of the participants is suddenly elevated to the point where he resorts to the use of deadly force to kill the other solely because of an impulsive response to the passion and without time to consider the consequences of his action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A60\">(Citations omitted). Although in a reply brief, appellant contends that \u201c[t]he conditions for Curran physically threatening [him] right before [he] allegedly killed [Curran] were all in placet,]\u201d the record is devoid of any indication that Curran and appellant entered into a mutual physical fight on the evening of February 12, 2010. Appellant never confessed to having had such a fight\u2014indeed, he indicated only that he and Curran had argued\u2014nor did Carpenter testify that, upon arriving home, she observed signs that appellant had been in a fight, such as scratches, bruises, dried blood, or torn clothing. We agree with the State that Curran and appellant\u2019s alleged argument over medication does not alone establish sufficient evidence of provocation to warrant giving the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Finally, there was no evidence presented demonstrating appellant reacted with impulse or lacked time to consider the consequences of his actions. In other words, there was no indication that appellant was provoked or experiencing a \u201chotblooded\u201d response at the time he killed Curran. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 553, 573 A.2d 1317: \u201cThe blood must indeed be hot, and under some circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>only the hot-blooded killer can attest to that.\u201d (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In sum, there is a complete lack of evidence as to either words or conduct sufficient to constitute legally adequate provocation. At trial, Carpenter testified that appellant \u201churt\u201d Curran because Curran \u201chad said something inappropriate about [her].\u201d No further information was provided about Curran\u2019s allegedly inappropriate statement\u2014such as, the content of the statement, <em>i.e. </em>what the allegedly inappropriate comment was, the time at which the comment was allegedly made, or the circumstances under which Curran made the comment. Even if Curran made a derogatory comment about Carpenter, words alone, \u201cno matter how opprobrious, do not amount to an affray, and standing alone, do not constitute adequate provocation.\u201d <em>Sims, </em>319 Md. at 552, 573 A.2d 1317. There was no evidence presented that Curran made any physical contact with appellant, prior to appellant killing him. Testimony from McDonald demonstrates that appellant and Curran argued, not that they had a physical altercation. Further, \u201c[i]t is well settled that provocative words\u2014even if accompanied by some physical contact\u2014do not constitute adequate provocation to mitigate a murder to a manslaughter.\u201d <em>Rich, </em>415 Md. at 581, 3 A.3d 1210.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>For all of these reasons, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as to legally adequate provocation, as appellant failed to demonstrate that \u201csome evidence\u201d generated such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">(b) Voluntary Intoxication</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Similarly, in this case, we conclude that appellant failed to produce evidence sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that he was intoxicated to such a degree that he was unable to form the specific intent necessary to commit first-degree murder. Appellant identifies only two pieces of evidence as supporting his request for an instruction on voluntary intoxication\u2014(1) McDonald\u2019s testimony that appellant confided to him that he and Curran had been drinking; and (2) Carpenter\u2019s testimony that appellant appeared \u201cvery drunk\u201d and passed out when he returned home from Curran\u2019s house. The circuit court properly refused to give the instruction on voluntary intoxication, finding that there had been no evidence demonstrating what appellant consumed or when he consumed it, <em>ie. </em>before, at the time of, or after the murder. Viewed generously, the evidence demonstrates merely that, on the day of the offense, appellant drank alcohol at some time at Curran\u2019s house, and appeared drunk and passed out later after he returned home.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Appellant failed to generate evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dence that he was intoxicated or exhibiting the effects of alcohol while at Curran\u2019s house, and, most importantly, at the time he killed Curran. In <em>Bazzle, </em>426 Md. at 553, 45 A.3d 166 the Court of Appeals clearly stated that \u201cmere intoxication is insufficient to negate a specific intent[.]\u201d We agree with the State that the evidence falls short of establishing that, at the time of the offense, \u201c[appellant] was intoxicated, and that that intoxication was to such [an] extent as to make him incapable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Bazzle, id. </em>at 546-47, 555-56, 45 A.3d 166 a case in which the Court of Appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to raise a jury issue as to voluntary intoxication, there was evidence concerning the amount of alcohol the defendant drank, the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content, and the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was unable to recall some of his behavior the night of the crime. In <em>Smith v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 115, 119-21, 516 A.2d 985 (1986), a case where we held that the evidence was sufficient to generate an instruction on voluntary intoxication, there was evidence presented as to the quantity and type of alcohol and drugs the defendant consumed, the timeframe in which the defendant consumed the substances, and witness testimony that the defendant was slurring, unbalanced when walking, falling, and \u201cout of it.\u201d Here, there is no evidence concerning what appellant consumed, how much he consumed, when he consumed it, or what effect\u2014if any\u2014such consumption had upon him, sufficient to demonstrate that he was intoxicated to the point that he was unable to form a specific intent to kill Curran.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As to the effect of alcohol on appellant, with evidence only that appellant appeared drunk at his own house and passed out, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>unable to conclude that there was \u201csome evidence,\u201d which, if believed, would support a finding that appellant\u2019s degree of intoxication negated his ability to form a specific intent at the time of the offense. Simply put, an instruction on voluntary intoxication was not generated by the facts of the case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for first-degree murder. Appellant concedes that, in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he stabbed Curran with the intent to kill him, but that the evidence is not sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201ckilled Curran deliberately and premeditatively,\u201d <em>ie. </em>that he committed first-degree murder. Appellant argues that there is \u201cabundant evidence\u201d that the stabbing occurred as a result of his rashness and impulsive anger, but little or no evidence that he killed Curran deliberately and with premeditation. Appellant maintains that evidence concerning the manner in which Curran was killed and the wounds that were inflicted is \u201cambiguous.\u201d Appellant asserts that, assuming there is evidence supporting a finding that he deliberately and with premeditation killed Curran, there is an equal amount of evidence to support a finding to the contrary. Appellant maintains that where \u201c \u2018the evidence equally supports two versions of events, and a finding of guilt requires speculation as to which of the two versions is correct, a conviction cannot be sustained.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The State responds that the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for first-degree murder. The State contends that the elements of premeditation and deliberation were established by evidence that Curran was stabbed ten times, sustained injuries to different locations of his body, and by appellant\u2019s admission to stabbing Curran in the head and lungs. The State maintains that the intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon aimed at a vital body part, and that the evidence in the instant case demonstrated that, appellant stabbed Curr\u00e1n \u201cmultiple times in vital parts of the body[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In <em>Morris v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 1, 30-31, 993 A.2d 716 (2010), this Court explained the standard of review for the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction. This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution in order to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We defer to the fact-finder\u2019s decisions on which evidence to accept and which inferences to draw when the evidence supports differing inferences. In other words, we give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether ... [we] would have chosen a different reasonable inference. In our independent review of the evidence, we do not distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence because [a] conviction may be sustained on the basis of a single strand of direct evidence or successive links of circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations, emphasis, and omission in original) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In <em>Pinkney v.

Instead, we must ensure that the evidence supports a finding that the elements of the crime existed beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In <em>Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 458, 697 A.2d 462 (1997), the Court of Appeals explained that \u201cwhen the evidence equally supports two versions of events, and a finding of guilt requires speculation as to which of the two versions is correct, a conviction cannot be sustained. This, of course, does not preclude a conviction based on a credibility determination emanating from disputed evidence.\u201d (Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">(3) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">First-degree murder is \u201ca deliberate, premeditated, and willful killing[.]\u201d C.L. \u00a7 2-201. In <em>Pinkney, </em>151 Md.App. at 332, 827 A.2d 124, this Court reiterated the elements necessary to support a conviction for first-degree murder, stating that first-degree murder \u201crequires that the defendant possess the intent to kill (willful), that the defendant have conscious knowledge of the intent to kill (deliberate), and that there be enough time for the defendant to deliberate, i.e., time enough to have thought about that intent (premeditate).\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830 (1980) (\u201cFor a killing to be \u2018willful\u2019 there must be a specific purpose and intent to kill; to be \u2018deliberate\u2019 there must be a full and conscious knowledge of the purpose to kill; and to be \u2018premeditated\u2019 the design to kill must have preceded the killing by an appreciable length of time, that is, time enough to be deliberate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Because \u201cmost defendants do not announce their intent to kill to witnesses or other third partes, [appellate courts] are forced to look to other factors as reflecting the defendant\u2019s intent to kill.\u201d <em>Pinkney, </em>151 Md.App. at 332, 827 A.2d 124. Maryland appellate courts have found evidence of a defendant\u2019s specific intent and design to kill based on facts such as the number of times a defendant shoots a victim at point-blank range, the use of a defendant\u2019s hands to strike fatal blows to a baby\u2019s head, a defendant\u2019s motive for murder, and a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>dant\u2019s version of events being contradicted by other witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 333-34, 827 A.2d 124 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As stated above, an intent to kill need not\u2014and most likely will not\u2014be announced by the defendant. \u201cIn Maryland, it is well established that \u2018under the proper circumstances an intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buck v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 585, 642, 956 A.2d 884 (2008) (citations omitted).

In <em>Willey v. State, </em>328 Md. 126, 133, 613 A.2d 956 (1992), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as noted in State v. Wischhusen, </em>342 Md. 530, 534 n. 4, 677 A.2d 595 (1996), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201can appreciable length of time\u201d has been equated \u201cwith any amount of time sufficient to convince the trier of fact that the purpose to kill was not \u2018the immediate offspring of rashness and impetuous temper,\u2019 but was the product of a mind \u2018fully conscious of its own design.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted). The Court of Appeals further explained that \u201c \u2018[i]f the killing results from a <em>choice made as the result of thought, however short the struggle between the intention and the act, </em>it is sufficient to characterize the crime as deliberate and premeditated murder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis and alteration in original). Importantly, \u201cpremeditation may be established circumstantially from the facts of a particular murder.\u201d <em>Pinkney, </em>151 Md.App. at 336, 827 A.2d 124 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>In <em>Smith v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 277, 317-18, 398 A.2d 426 (1979), with Judge Charles E. Moylan speaking for the Court, we discussed the elements of deliberation and premeditation at length as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">Deliberation and premeditation may be instantaneous. The period of time required for premeditation and deliberation in first-degree murder is only that which is necessary for one thought to follow another. For a killing to be premeditated there need be no appreciable space of time between the intention to kill and the killing\u2014they may be as instantaneous as successive thoughts of the mind.... If there be sufficient deliberation to form a design to take life, and to put that design into execution by destroying life, there is sufficient deliberation to constitute murder, no matter whether the design be formed at the instant of striking the fatal blow or whether it be contemplated for months. It is enough that the intention precedes the act although that follows instantly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">The [diminution of the time interval virtually to the vanishing point] has been inexorably at work in Maryland. The evidence was found to be legally sufficient to support deliberation and premeditation in the following questionable circumstances: [ ] a street fight where the defendant only turned upon the victim at the moment when the victim attempted to dissuade him from killing another[]; [] an unexplained killing following a drunken quarrel[]; [] a drunken quarrel with the time interval being represented by the time necessary to walk across the room, pick up a gun, raise it and fire it[ ]; [ ] a drunken and jealous quarrel with the time for premeditation being represented by a walk to the kitchen to pick up a knife and the use of it a minute or two later[ ]; [ ] a drunken and jealous quarrel[.] The classic instance of this erosion is <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87, 95 A.2d 577 (1953). Chisley had been drinking and was riding home with his father, the father\u2019s brother-in-law and the victim. Chis[]ley was sleeping. When the car arrived home, the father got out first, followed by the father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>brother-in-law. At that point, the brother-in-law told the father that the father had dropped some cigarettes. This was the onset of trouble. Chisley said the cigarettes were his and the victim said that they were not. The father described what followed that exchange: \u201cThat\u2019s all there was to it. He gets out the gun and shot him; there wasn\u2019t any argument to it.\u201d A second shot later followed the first shot. Ignoring the very real possibility that the first shot may well have been the fatal one, the Court of Appeals held that the time interval between the two shots was sufficient to permit a finding of deliberation and premeditation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">(Internal quotation marks and most citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In <em>Colvin v.

A glass pane of the door was broken, the chain locks unhinged, and jewelry was missing. <em>Id. </em>The investigation revealed that latent fingerprints from the glass basement door matched known prints of the defendant, and that the defendant had pawned the jewelry taken from the house. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">In <em>Colvin, id. </em>at 109, 472 A.2d 953, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cIn this case there was evidence of a protracted assault and an effort by the victim to defend herself. Twenty eight stab wounds were inflicted to various parts of the victim\u2019s body. Some of these wounds were defense-type wounds found on the victim\u2019s hands.\u201d Based on these circumstances, in <em>Colvin, id. </em>at 110, 472 A.2d 953, the Court of Appeals determined that the jury \u201cwas entitled to conclude that the time during which [the defendant] carried the knife from the kitchen to the stairway, compounded by the protracted nature of the assault, was sufficient time for him to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>chosen, after thought and deliberation, to kill.\u201d In <em>Pinkney, </em>151 Md.App. at 343, 827 A.2d 124 this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">We [ ] do not adopt a bright line rule of legal sufficiency for first degree murder, based solely on the number of blows delivered. We merely hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to convict [the defendant] of first degree murder for the death of a six-month-old child based on the totality of the evidence, including evidence as to the number, severity, and brutality of the blows, the circumstances leading up to the beatings, and [the defendant\u2019s version of events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">To begin, we observe that appellant concedes that \u201cthe evidence is sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] stabbed Curran with the intent to kill him, i.e., that the killing was wi[llful].\u201d The issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant killed Curran with deliberation and premeditation as required for a conviction of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Although not raised by the State on brief, we conclude that, on appeal, appellant advances an argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence that he failed to bring in the circuit court on motion for judgment of acquittal, <em>i.e. </em>that the evidence failed to demonstrate the deliberation and premeditation sufficient for first-degree murder. Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Tetso v.

At the close of all the evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal, asking the circuit court \u201cto assess credibility with respect to the further witnesses\u201d and arguing that the evidence demonstrated that Curran was killed on February 16, 2010, not February 12, 2010. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he thought intent was \u201csomething completely open, especially given [ ] Curran\u2019s state of mind as established by the hospital records that were introduced.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel failed to argue\u2014at all or with any specificity as required by Maryland Rule 4-324\u2014that there was insufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation, thus failing to preserve the issue for review. Nonetheless, we address the merits of appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with premeditation and deliberation in stabbing and killing Curran. For premeditation and deliberation, the law requires only that \u201cthe defendant have conscious knowledge of the intent to kill (deliberate), and that there be time enough for the defendant to deliberate, i.e., time enough to have thought about that intent (premeditate).\u201d <em>Pinkney, </em>151 Md.App. at 332, 827 A.2d 124 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

The record reflects that the following evidence more than establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with deliberation and premeditation: (1) On one occasion, shortly before the murder, appellant approached Matthew and Miles as they were sitting in a vehicle, and \u201ctalk[ed] about robbing the guy up the street\u201d to \u201csteal his pills[.]\u201d (2) During this discussion, appellant stated that he knew \u201cwhere to get some Percocets at, [and that Matthew and Miles had] to go get the man drunk down at the shacks\u201d and \u201ctake his medicine.\u201d (3) Both Matthew and Miles believed appellant was referring to Curran. (4) McDonald testified that appellant admitted that he and Curran argued over pills, and that \u201che stabbed [Curran] in the temple and in the neck or something like that.\u201d (5) Carpenter testified that appellant confessed that he had hurt or killed Curran. According to Carpenter, appellant stated that Curran \u201chad been stabbed in each lung and in the head.\u201d (6) During Carpenter\u2019s September 9, 2010, interview with detectives, she informed detectives that appellant told her that \u201che had stabbed [Curran] on either side of the chest and then, uh, put a blade through his skull[,]\u201d and that he had thrown away the knife in a dumpster. (7) The autopsy performed on Curran revealed that he suffered a total of ten stab wounds and three cutting wounds. (8) According to Dr. Ali, \u201ctwo of the stab wounds injured the heart, perforated the heart, and caused significant bleeding in the chest cavity[,]\u201d another \u201ccluster of three stab wounds to the right side of the chest\u201d injured the heart and passed through the liver \u201ccausing bleeding in the abdominal cavity or inside the belly[,]\u201d another stab wound perforated the left leg\u2014or \u201centered and exited the other side of the leg[,]\u201d\u2014and a stab wound to the left temple \u201cfractured the skull and went through the brain[.]\u201d Curran had a cutting wound to the neck and two cutting wounds on his right hand. Dr. Ali opined that the cutting wound \u201cinjuries to the right hand are typical of defense-type injuries, when you start to ... try to grab a knife[,]\u201d and that the injuries to Curran\u2019s leg \u201ccould be consistent with defense injuries.\u201d Dr. Ali testified that the wounds were consistent with the use of a knife. (9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Detective Sewell testified that law enforcement did not release any information to the public about the location and number of stab wounds inflicted on Curran, yet appellant was aware Curran had been stabbed in the head and chest. (10) Cur-ran\u2019s residence was ransacked, and the drawer in which he stored his pills, medication, and money was turned over on the floor upside down.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The above evidence was more than sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that appellant acted with deliberation and premeditation. The jury was well within its province to resolve any factual disputes in favor of the State. In addition to other facts, the evidence demonstrated that appellant\u2019s suggestion to Matthew and Miles to rob Curran of his pills, the ransacking of Curran\u2019s house, including the dresser drawer in which Curran stored his pills and medication, as well as the length and nature of the assault\u2014 ten stab wounds, including wounds that pierced Curran\u2019s heart and brain and three cutting wounds\u2014constituted deliberation and premeditation.

Appellant argues that, procedurally, the circuit court failed to make findings concerning the admissibility of Curran\u2019s statements under Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24). Appellant maintains that Curran\u2019s statements are admissible under Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) because: (1) the statements had \u201c \u2018circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 \u201d and indicia of reliability; (2) the statements were evidence of a material fact, <em>i.e. </em>who killed Curran, as the \u201cpersons who recently assaulted Curran are reasonable suspects in his killing\u201d; (3) the statements were \u201cmore probative than any other evidence which [] could have been procured through reasonable efforts\u201d; and (4) he had provided prior notice to the State of his intention to offer the statements into evidence. Appellant asserts that Curran\u2019s statements are admissible \u201cas a matter of due process.\u201d Appellant contends that the circuit court\u2019s error in not admitting the statements was not harmless as there was no physical evidence linking him to Curran\u2019s murder and the State\u2019s case \u201crested on alleged confessions and random statements all of dubious import.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The State responds that the circuit court properly excluded Curran\u2019s statements to McDonald and Buckland on the grounds of relevancy and hearsay. The State contends that the hearsay testimony appellant sought to <em>introduce\u2014i.e. </em>information concerning those Curran identified as his assailants in a \u201cprior beating\u201d\u2014was unrelated to the instant offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The State argues that the statements appellant attempted to elicit were not related to Curran\u2019s murder, but rather were statements identifying \u201cthree individuals as being involved in an earlier, unrelated assault on the victim several days before the murder.\u201d The State asserts that appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s proffer that Curran, in one instance, identified two individuals, and in another instance, identified three individuals, \u201crefuted any suggestion that the victim\u2019s statements contained \u2018equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 as [] required[.]\u201d In sum, the State maintains that the criteria for admissibility of the statements under Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) was not satisfied. The State asserts that any error by the circuit court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and points out that appellant was not precluded from calling as witnesses the people about whom he sought to elicit information.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Bernadyn v.

Such major revisions are best accomplished by amendments to the Rule itself.

The prosecutor called the defendant\u2019s wife as a witness, and she invoked the spousal privilege not to testify against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 510, 668 A.2d 990. The prosecutor moved to admit written, signed statements that the wife had given to law enforcement officers before she married the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the wife\u2019s statements were admissible pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(5) because they were \u201creliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 668 A.2d 990. This Court reviewed the legislative history of Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(5), noting that the Court of Appeals intended the \u201c \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 requirement [of the Rule] to be followed strictly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 668 A.2d 990. We stated that, \u201calthough the Court of Appeals ultimately decided to adopt a residual exception, the introductory limiting language and the Committee note should be interpreted in a manner that requires the trial judge to [give] careful and thoughtful consideration on the record of all of the rule\u2019s limiting requirements before admitting evidence under the residual exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 668 A.2d 990. In admitting the wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>statements to detectives, we observed that the trial court failed to determine whether: (1) the statements possessed sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness; and</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">(2) there were exceptional circumstances justifying admission of the statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In <em>State v.

Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An3\">(Footnote omitted). \u201cThe harmless error standard is highly favorable to the defendant, and \u2018the burden is on the State to show that [the error] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 and did not influence the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 66, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011) (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted). In <em>Perez, id. </em>at 76, 21 A.3d 1048 the Court of Appeals instructed that in \u201c[a]pplying <em>Dorsey </em>and its progeny, we must determine, based on the record, whether the error possibly influenced the verdict in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In this case, we conclude that the circuit court properly excluded Curran\u2019s statements to Martin and Buckland, finding that the statements were hearsay not admissible under any hearsay exception. Based on the circumstances in this case, as well as appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s proffer concerning the statements, we see no error in the circuit court\u2019s exclusion of the statements. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Appellant contends that, procedurally, the circuit court failed to make any findings concerning the admissibility of the statements under Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24). Neither the Rule nor case law, however, requires that a trial court procedurally make findings as to each factor of the Rule in excluding the admission of a hearsay statement. Rather, the Rule and case law mandate only that a trial court procedurally address each factor when it admits the hearsay statement. Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) simply states that a statement, not otherwise covered by a hearsay exception, is not excludable by the hearsay rule if the trial court determines that the statement meets the criteria set forth in the Rule, <em>i.e. </em>the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>court must determine that the criteria are satisfied before admitting\u2014not excluding\u2014a statement. In <em>Walker, </em>107 Md. App. at 526, 668 A.2d 990, we held that the trial court erred when it admitted hearsay statements pursuant to a residual exception without determining whether the requisite criteria were satisfied.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Similarly, upon the grant of <em>certiorari, </em>in <em>Walker, </em>345 Md. at 318, 691 A.2d 1341, the Court of Appeals discussed that certain \u201cconditions need to be satisfied for evidence to be admissible under\u201d a residual exception. The Court of Appeals also stated: \u201cWe do not agree ... that the failure to announce subsidiary findings and conclusions necessarily requires reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 691 A.2d 1341. Neither we nor the Court of Appeals discussed or mandated a procedure which trial courts must follow when excluding a hearsay statement. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court in this case did not err in excluding Curran\u2019s statements to Martin and Buckland, finding that the statements were inadmissible hearsay. Although a\"trial court is certainly free to address each factor and make findings concerning the admissibility of a statement pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24), we discern no error where the trial court\u2014as the circuit court did in this instance\u2014excludes a statement as hearsay without further ado.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We conclude that Curran\u2019s statements were inadmissible hearsay because there were no exceptional circumstances justifying their admission pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24). We are guided by the Committee Note accompanying Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24), which states that the residual hearsay exception is intended to \u201cbe used very rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances\u201d where there are \u201cnew and presently unanticipated situations[.]\u201d Before the circuit court and on brief before this Court, appellant fails to allege that exceptional circumstances exist warranting admission of the hearsay statements. Appellant has neither offered nor de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>scribed any exceptional circumstance warranting admission of the statements. The only circumstance which we discern from the record as possibly being an exceptional circumstance in this case is that Curran is dead and not available to testify as to who assaulted him. We, therefore, examine whether that circumstance qualifies as \u201cexceptional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The Maryland Rules clearly contemplates situations in which a declarant is deceased and yet his or her statement is admissible pursuant to a hearsay exception. \u201cUnavailability as a witness\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201csituations in which the declarant ... is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death[.]\u201d Maryland Rule 5-804(a)(4). Thus, death of a declarant is not a \u201cnew and [ ] unanticipated situation[ ]\u201d for which the residual hearsay exception in Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) should be applied. As \u201c[t]here is nothing \u2018unique\u2019 or exceptional\u201d about Curran having made statements prior to his death, we hold that the circuit court properly excluded the statements. <em>See Walker, </em>345 Md. at 329, 691 A.2d 1341 (\u201cThere is nothing \u2018unique\u2019 or exceptional about a spouse invoking his or her statutory privilege.\u201d). Because we determine that there were no exceptional circumstances justifying admission of Curran\u2019s statements pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24)\u2014and that Curran\u2019s death was not an exceptional circumstance\u2014we need not address the other factors required for admission of a statement under the Rule as outlined by the Court of Appeals in <em>Walker, </em>345 Md. at 318-19, 691 A.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Appellant mistakenly relies upon <em>Foster v. State, </em>297 Md. 191, 193, 464 A.2d 986 (1983), a case decided before the Maryland Rules contained the residual exception for hearsay, in which the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to admit \u201cexculpatory hearsay testimony critical to [the defendant\u2019s] defense.\u201d The defendant was sentenced to death for murdering the manager of a motel in which the defendant and her husband resided. <em>Id. </em>At trial, the defendant sought to demonstrate that her husband committed the murder. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 464 A.2d 986. The defendant offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>testimony from the victim\u2019s friend that the victim had called her (the friend) in a \u201chighly agitated state\u201d and advised that she had asked the husband for past-due rent, that she was afraid for her life, and that the husband had threatened her. <em>Id. </em>at 200-01, 464 A.2d 986. The trial court determined \u201cthat the proffered testimony [from the victim\u2019s friend] was hearsay, and that ... it was not sufficiently reliable to be admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 464 A.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On appeal, in <em>Foster, id. </em>at 202, 464 A.2d 986, the defendant contended that \u201cthe application of the hearsay rule, which prevented her from presenting a portion of her defense, rendered her trial fundamentally unfair and deprived her of due process of law.\u201d Relying on <em>Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals agreed with the defendant, concluding that \u201c[r]egardless of whether the proffered testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>mony [was] inadmissible because of Maryland\u2019s hearsay rule, under the facts of th[e] case, its exclusion deprived the [defendant] of a fair trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Foster, </em>297 Md. at 210, 464 A.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">At trial, when arguing against admitting Curran\u2019s statements, the prosecutor stated that appellant\u2019s counsel had informed her that he \u201cintend[ed] to call them [the people Curran had named as his assailants].\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cAnd I will.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that there were other means of eliciting the sought after information. Because appellant could have called the individuals as witnesses, he was not deprived of fair trial such that his right to due process was violated. The rule against hearsay was not \u201capplied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice[,]\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038indeed, appellant had every opportunity to present a full and complete defense, but, for reasons not clear from the record, chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Alternatively, we conclude that any error in the exclusion of testimony concerning Curran\u2019s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Testimony at trial\u2014including confessions to two State\u2019s witnesses\u2014established overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s identity as the killer. On brief before this Court, appellant concedes that \u201cthe evidence is sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] stabbed Curran with the intent to kill him[.]\u201d As the State points out, although appellant had no duty to present evidence, he was not precluded from calling as witnesses those individuals about whom he sought to elicit testimony through Curran\u2019s statements to Martin and Buck-land. Nor was appellant precluded from eliciting information about the assault from others who may have witnessed the assault. In this case, given the overwhelming evidence of guilt, as well as the other circumstances described above, we are satisfied that any error, if at all, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We discern no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court \"improperly indicated\u201d that he should first address his complaints with Klenk and the district public defender, and \"misinformed\u201d him of the consequences of dismissing Klenk. A review of the record reveals that the circuit court did not order appellant to speak with Klenk or the district public defender first concerning his complaint about discovery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The circuit court stated: \"I think you ought to give Mr. Klenk an opportunity to address your concerns first. Maybe he has some plans for doing that\u201d <em>[i.e. </em>addressing the discovery issue]. The circuit court's suggestion to talk to Klenk was entirely reasonable under the circumstances. In <em>Northam, </em>421 Md. at 207, 205, 26 A.3d 344 the Court of Appeals stated that the trial court\u2019s \" 'talk to your lawyer\u2019 response is the proper response to a criminal defendant who is represented by counsel\u201d where the defendant attempted to speak directly to the trial court about an issue rather than speaking with his attorney. We, accordingly, find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that the circuit court improperly required that he first address his issues with Klenk.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As to appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court \"misinformed\u201d him of the consequences of dismissing Klenk, the record reveals that the circuit court stated that if he thought Klenk was not representing his best interests, appellant could keep or dismiss Klenk, and that if he dismissed Klenk, he would not receive representation from another public defender, but would rather be required to obtain another lawyer or represent himself. These options, as set forth by the circuit court, properly outline the possible courses of action appellant could take if the circuit court found that there was no meritorious reason for a request to discharge Klenk pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-215(e). In so stating, the circuit court implied that it would not find the lack of discovery alone a meritorious reason for discharging Klenk. The circuit court was not required to inform appellant of the converse\u2014the courses of action available if a request to discharge was meritorious\u2014 because appellant did not request to discharge counsel and the circuit court was not ruling on a request to discharge counsel pursuant to the procedures set forth in Maryland Rule 4-215(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">. <em>Roberts </em>interpreted the precursor to \u00a7 3-104, Md.Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-103 of the Health-General Article.

Although we do not necessarily agree with the State\u2019s concession, we need not decide the issue because whether the request for a competency evaluation was a substantive or procedural request was not an issue raised in or decided by the circuit court. The circuit court accepted the withdrawal of the request and, it is clear from the record, was confident that appellant was competent to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">. Appellant's counsel informed the circuit court at a pretrial hearing on May 10, 2011, that appellant\u2019s history of hospital admissions were admissions into \u201cpsychiatric facilities.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel failed, however, to provide any information about the admissions or appellant\u2019s medical record which indicated appellant\u2019s prior hospitalizations in any way affected his competence to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\">. At oral argument, appellant contended that identifying himself as a \u201cpsychopath\u201d to Captain Kessler during his interview demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that he was incompetent to stand trial. The record reflects that, although Captain Kessler testified at trial that appellant referred to himself as a \"psychopath\u201d during their interview, at the time the request for a competency evaluation was made, the circuit court had no information concerning the matter and neither appellant nor his counsel informed the circuit court that such a comment had been made. Additionally, at oral argument, appellant failed to explain how a comment made to a law enforcement officer in an interview nine months prior to trial showed that appellant was incompetent\u2014at the time of trial\u2014to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. In a reply brief, appellant takes issue with the circuit court\u2019s ruling refusing to give an instruction on legally adequate provocation, arguing that the circuit court only considered Carpenter's testimony\u2014that he told her that Curran made a derogatory remark about her\u2014and failed to consider \"other highly relevant evidence,\u201d thereby abusing its discretion. The record reflects the contrary\u2014that the circuit court listened to extensive argument from both parties concerning the request for an instruction on legally adequate provocation before ruling that there was no \"evidence to demonstrate any legally adequate provocation for the voluntary manslaughter [instruction].\u201d While the circuit court focused on Carpenter\u2019s testimony, as set forth below, it is evident that the circuit court properly considered argument from counsel and exercised its discretion appropriately in refusing to give the instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the jury question concerning whether stabbing someone during a heated argument is first-degree murder demonstrates that an instruction on legally adequate provocation generated by the evidence, and that the circuit court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury as to legally adequate provocation after receiving the juiy question. The record reflects that the jury submitted a note to the circuit court, asking the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">During a heated argument, a knife is picked up [and] used-would this be considered [first-]degree murder? Would those few seconds from the time that he grabbed the knife be considered premeditated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">The jury\u2019s inquiry demonstrates that at most it questioned whether \u201cduring a heated argument\u201d use of a knife is sufficient to constitute first-degree murder. A heated argument is a circumstance that, as discussed above, is legally insufficient to generate an instruction on provocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>As to the circuit court's alleged failure to instruct the jury as to legally adequate provocation after receiving the jury note, we observe that the circuit court and counsel discussed and agreed upon the appropriate response to the jury note. In response to the proposed response to the jury note, appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cOkay. I have no objection to that.\u201d Given that appellant's counsel agreed with the circuit court's response and failed to request an instruction as to legally adequate provocation at that point, any issue as to the court\u2019s failure to give the instruction after the jury's question is not preserved for appellate review. As to plain error, the circumstances fail to satisfy the first prong of the plain error review test, <em>i.e. </em>there is no indication of any error by the circuit court. <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 578, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">. At trial, Carpenter testified that appellant arrived home at approximately 9:20 p.m. on February 12, 2010. In the interview with detectives, Carpenter advised that appellant came home at 11:00 p.m. on February 12, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">. Although appellant is correct that \"some evidence\u201d of voluntary intoxication does not mean that \"specific evidence of what intoxicating substance the defendant consumed\u201d is required, we observe that, in this case, other than McDonald\u2019s testimony that appellant said he was drinking and Carpenter\u2019s testimony that appellant appeared \"very drunk,\u201d there is absolutely no evidence as to the type or amount of substances appellant consumed and whether they had any effect upon him, <em>i.e. </em>whether they made him so intoxicated as to negate any specific intent to kill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">. In a reply brief, appellant reiterates that there was evidence that he \u201cconsumed alcohol and/or drugs on the alleged date of the offense!,]\u201d thus warranting an instruction as to voluntary intoxication. Appellant misses the point entirely, though. The issue is not whether he was intoxicated, as mere intoxication is not a defense, but whether he was intoxicated to such a degree at the time of the offense that he was be unable to form the intent necessary to commit the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">. Appellant's contention that, because there is an equal amount of evidence supporting a finding that he \"snapped\u201d and killed Curran without premeditation and deliberation, the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for first-degree murder is without merit. To support his contention, appellant misguidedly quotes case law piecemeal out of context, arguing that \" \u2018when the evidence equally supports two versions of events, and a finding of guilt requires speculation as to which of the two versions is correct, a conviction cannot be sustained.\u2019 \u201d A review of the case law, and in particular, <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 458-59, 697 A.2d 462, reveals that the Court of Appeals placed the following caveat on the holding to which appellant cites\u2014\"This, of course, does not preclude a conviction based on credibility determination emanating from disputed evidence.\u201d Thus, taken as a whole, the Court of Appeals has stated that, where a finding of guilt requires speculation as between two equally supported versions of events, a conviction cannot stand, but that a conviction based on credibility determinations arising from disputed evidence are not precluded. Here, as appellant\u2019s counsel pointed out in both of the motions for judgment of acquittal, the witnesses' credibility was a key issue. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>much of the case rested upon the jury\u2019s determination as to the witnesses\u2019 credibility, and as we give deference to the juty\u2019s decisions and inferences, <em>Morris, </em>192 Md.App. at 30-31, 993 A.2d 716, we decline to address appellant\u2019s contention further and observe that, as stated above, the jury was well within its province to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed first-degree murder based on the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. The other \"residual\u201d or \"catch-all\u201d exception for hearsay was contained in Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(5), which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Under exceptional circumstances, the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is unavailable as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>witness: A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. A statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party, sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Y\">It should be noted that, prior to 1994, when Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) and Rule 5-804(b)(5) were adopted, the Court of Appeals, \"though on rare occasions allowing hearsay statements that did not fall within any of the recognized categorical exceptions to be admitted, had never formally or directly recognized a general residual exception to the hearsay rule[J\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>345 Md. 293, 304, 691 A.2d 1341 (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">By a Rules Order issued by the Court of Appeals on November 8, 2005, effective January 1, 2006, Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(5) was amended. The Rules Order deleted the existing language of Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(5) and replaced it with the current exception allowing hearsay statements by witnesses in criminal cases to be admitted where the witness is unavailable due to a party's wrongdoing. Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) was amended to its present form. Thus, after the amendment became effective on January 1, 2006, Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(24) was the only residual exception for hearsay. In a case decided prior to the amendment, this Court stated that Maryland Rule 5-803 (b)(24) and Rule 5-804(b)(5) \u201care the same but for one difference[\u2014]Rule 5-803(b)(24) does not require that the witness be unavailable.\u201d <em>Nixon v.

In <em>Green, </em>442 U.S. at 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150, the Supreme Court held that, given the \"unique circumstances\u201d of the case, the trial court erroneously excluded testimony in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that \"the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice\u201d and deprive the defendant of a fair trial.

In the exercise of this right, the accused, as is required of the State, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. Although perhaps no rule of evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied in jury trials than that applicable to the exclusion of hearsay, exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed. The testimony rejected by the trial court here bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and thus was well within the basic rationale of the exception for declarations against interest. That testimony also was critical to Chambers\u2019 defense. In these circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
