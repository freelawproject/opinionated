We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-24\">Verduzco-Lopez\u2019s contention that the district court improperly estimated the amount of cocaine found at the Franklin Avenue apartment lacks merit because the district court based its estimate on the amount stated in the presentence report in determining the base offense level. We conclude that the presentence report, to which Verduzco-Lopez did not object, contained sufficient indicia of reliability to allow the district court to calculate the total amount of cocaine. <em>Cf. United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159, 1162-63 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that district court does not abuse its discretion in determining a sentence based on a presentence report that contains sufficient indicia of reliability of defendant\u2019s criminal history); <em>United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
