Each appellant entered a plea of guilty to the drug conspiracy charge and all remaining counts were dismissed at the time of sentencing pursuant to plea agreements with the government. The appellants now raise a number of issues, including: (1) the district court\u2019s failure to award certain defendants a downward departure on the grounds that their criminal history scores overstated the seriousness of their prior criminal activity; (2) the duplicity of the indictment; (3) ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) the district court\u2019s refusal to award a downward departure under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; (5) the government\u2019s breach of a plea agreement; (6) the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a motion for substitution of counsel and a continuance; (7) the government\u2019s failure to allege facts relating to drug quantity in the indictment; and (8) the government\u2019s failure to prove the existence of prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the following reasons, We AFFIRM in part and REVERSE AND REMAND in part. We affirm as to all claims, except as they concern Timothy Adkins. The case is remanded as to Adkins for a determination as to whether he breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">On November 17, 1999, a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Ohio returned a seventy-two count superseding indictment against twenty-four defendants, including Alonzo Bryant, Rasheed Sewell, Myron Black, Timothy Adkins and Michael Phillips (\u201cAppellants\u201d). All of the Appellants in these consolidated appeals were charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine base with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, along with additional drug related charges. Each Appellant pled guilty to Count One and all remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Alonzo Bryant was sentenced on April 28, 2000, to seventy-eight months years) of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Judgment was entered on May 1, 2000. Rasheed Sewell was sentenced on May 1, 2000, to 160 months (13 1/3 years) of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Judgment was entered on May 3, 2000. Myron Black was sentenced on May 1, 2000, to 168 months (14 years) of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Judgment was entered on May 3, 2000. Timothy Adkins was sentenced to 262 months (21 5/6 years) of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Judgment was entered on June 2, 2000. Michael Phillips was sentenced on June 14, 2000, to 130 months\u2019 imprisonment. Judgment was entered on the same day. All of the appellants filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A8I\">A. Sewell and Phillips</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Sewell and Phillips appeal the denial of a downward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which authorizes the district court to depart from the guideline range where \u201crehable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Both men were sentenced as career offenders pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Sewell was designated as a career criminal based upon two prior felony convictions for aggravated drug trafficking and one prior conviction for assaulting a probation officer. As a consequence, his criminal history category was increased from Category V to Category VI. His base offense level (prior to adjustments for acceptance of responsibility and substantial assistance) was increased from twenty-eight to thirty-four. Phillips was also designated a career criminal based upon two prior felony offenses involving violence and a controlled substance offense. As a consequence, Phillips\u2019 criminal history category was increased from IV to VI. His base offense level was increased from thirty to thirty-four. Phillips and Sewell argued to the district court that downward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 was appropriate because their designation as career offenders overstates the seriousness of their prior criminal conduct. They appeal their sentences on the grounds that the district court failed to consider or properly rule on their \u00a7 4A1.3 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Sewell\u2019s and Phillips\u2019 claims are without merit. A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is not reviewable on appeal unless the court\u2019s refusal to deviate from the Sentencing Guidelines was based on the erroneous belief that it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>53 F.3d 144, 145 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>There is no indication from the record that the district court believed it lacked the authority to depart. Sewell and Phillips argue that the district court did not consider their motions. But this is also unsupported by the record. During Se-well\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court specifically addressed a letter from defense counsel, wherein \u201cyour client objects that [] you should not be found a career offender, in that if you were found a career offender, [ ] that would overstate your criminal history.\u201d After reviewing Sewell\u2019s prior convictions, the court concluded that \u201cit would seem that your client does have more than two convictions.\u201d Similarly, during Phillips\u2019 sentencing hearing, defense counsel reminded the court of its discretion to depart, while acknowledging that his client\u2019s prior conviction did qualify Phillips as a career offender. The court then rejected the \u00a7 4A1.3 motion, outlining the underlying convictions. The district court considered and addressed both defendants\u2019 departure motions, and denied them because the court felt that career offender status did not overstate the seriousness of their prior offenses. This determination is not reviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">B. Alonzo Bryant</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Bryant raises three issues on appeal. He contends: (1) the indictment was duplicitous; (2) he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel; and (3) he was eligible for \u201csafety valve\u201d departure and reduction of offense level. His appeal fails on all three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">\n<em>Duplicitous Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Bryant\u2019s first assignment of error alleges that Count One of the Superseding Indictment was duplicitous, because it alleges that he engaged in trafficking of both cocaine and crack. Ordinarily, the district court\u2019s decision not to dismiss an allegedly duplicitous indictment is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>127 F.3d 510, 512 (6th Cir. 1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>524 U.S. 940, 118 S.Ct. 2348, 141 L.Ed.2d 718 (1998). Because Bryant did not raise this claim before the district court, it will be reviewed for plain error. <em>See Id. </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Bryant\u2019s duplicity claim is without merit. \u201cAn indictment is duplicitous if it joins in a single count two or more distinct and separate offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>279 F.3d 392, 398 (6th Cir.2002)(quotation omitted). The danger of a duplicitous indictment is that it does not permit juries to convict on one count and acquit on the other. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Count One charged Bryant with participating in an illegal conspiracy having multiple objects, including distribution of both crack and cocaine. As this court has recognized, however, \u201cthe allegation, in a single count of conspiracy, of an agreement to commit several crimes is not duplicitous, as conspiracy is itself the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Dale, </em>178 F.3d 429, 431 (6th Cir.1999). Moreover, \u201c[a] single conspiracy may have as its objective the distribution of two different drugs without rendering it duplicitous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Bryant next contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to call witnesses and did not cross-examine key government witnesses at sentencing. We will not consider Bryant\u2019s claim at this stage in the proceedings. In general, \u201c[w]e will consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal of a criminal conviction only when the record is adequate to assess the merits of the defendant\u2019s allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>956 F.2d 540, 543 (6th Cir.1992). \u201cIneffective assistance of counsel claims are best brought by a defendant in a post-conviction proceeding un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>der 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 so that the parties can develop an adequate record on the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Presently, the record is not adequate to evaluate Bryant\u2019s claim. Bryant has not identified any witnesses who should have been called or what testimony any potential witnesses might offer. Also, the government did not present any witnesses at Bryant\u2019s sentencing who could have been cross-examined. Without further development of the record, there is no basis upon which this court could conclude that errors were committed, or that those errors were prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Kincaide, </em>145 F.3d 771, 785 (6th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1166, 119 S.Ct. 1085, 143 L.Ed.2d 86 (1999)(discuss-ing necessary showing for ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">\n<em>Eligibility for \u201cSafety Valve\u201d Departure and Reduction in Offense Level</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Bryant appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to order a sentence below the statutory minimum under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, as well as the court\u2019s decision not to award a two-level reduction in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). Because he pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of five grams of cocaine, Bryant faces a statutory minimum sentence of five years of imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii). The \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) provides that in cases involving certain drug offenses, including violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, a sentencing court may impose a sentence \u201cwithout regard to any statutory minimum sentence,\u201d if the court determines that the five criteria listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) are satisfied. The first criterion requires that \u201cthe defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1). Section 2Dl.l(b)(6) of the Guidelines provides that if a defendant meets the requirements of the safety valve, the district court should reduce the defendant\u2019s offense level by two. The district court determined that Bryant had more than one criminal history point, and therefore was not eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo. </em>The district court\u2019s determination as to whether a defendant meets the five criteria of the \u201csafety valve\u201d is a finding of fact, and is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Adu, </em>82 F.3d 119, 124 (6th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">On appeal, Bryant argues that he is eligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d because, although he has more than one criminal history point, his criminal history score overstates the seriousness of his past criminal conduct, such that a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 was warranted. This argument fails for two reasons. First, the district court considered and rejected Bryant\u2019s motion for a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3, reasoning that a criminal history category II was within the heartland of the Sentencing Guidelines. Since the court\u2019s decision was not based upon the erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart, it is not reviewable by this court. <em>Byrd, </em>53 F.3d at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Second, as a matter of law, a defendant cannot be rendered eligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d if he or she has more than one criminal history point, even if the court subsequently determines that the defendant\u2019s criminal history score overstates the seriousness of his or her past criminal conduct for the purposes of \u00a7 4A1.3. Section 5C1.2, defines \u201c[mjore than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines\u201d as \u201cmore than one criminal history point as determined under \u00a7 4A1.1\u201d, the guideline provision that in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>structs how to calculate a defendant\u2019s criminal history points. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 commentary, applic. note 1. As the court held in <em>United States v. Penn, </em>282 F.3d 879 (6th Cir.2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">[This] language is unambiguous, and clearly limits the district court\u2019s authority to apply the \u2018safety valve\u2019 provision to cases where a defendant has not more than one criminal history point <em>as calculated under </em>\u00a7 4A1.1, regardless of whether the district court determines that a downward departure in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted by \u00a7 4A1.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFh\"><em>Penn, </em>282 F.3d at 881 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Since Bryant does not assert that his criminal history points were incorrectly calculated under \u00a7 4A1.1, he cannot claim eligibility for the \u201csafety valve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">C. Timothy Adkins</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">\n<em>Breach of Plea Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Adkins contends that the government breached its obligation under the plea agreement by failing to move the court for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. This section permits departure for substantial assistance upon a motion by the government. The relevant clause of the plea agreement in this case states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">In the event the defendant fully cooperates with the government, as set forth herein, the government will move the Court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and provision 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, to impose a sentence by reducing the defendant\u2019s Total Adjusted Offense Level [ ] a total of four (4) additional levels to reflect the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the government [ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-11\">The defendant understands that in the event he does not fully cooperate, as set forth herein, the government is released from its obligations under this agreement, including the recommendation that sentence be imposed beneath the mandatory minimum of 10 years, and the defendant has no right to withdraw his guilty plea to count one of the superseding indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-13\">The defendant further understands and acknowledges that the decision to request the \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 departure, as set forth above, rests solely with the United States\u2019 Attorney\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">At Adkins\u2019 sentencing hearing, the government expressed its view that Adkins had breached his obligation to \u201cfully cooperate,\u201d and that it therefore would not make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">The government maintained that Adkins breached the agreement to cooperate by failing to testify truthfully at the trial of Thomas Winbush, a co-defendant who was ultimately acquitted. To support this claim, the government introduced the testimony of Detective Dawn Schivinski. Schivinski testified that Adkins qualified his testimony in order to protect Winbush, that his trial testimony contained some inconsistencies with earlier proffers, and that his demeanor appeared \u201creluctant\u201d undermining the effectiveness of his testimony. Upon cross-examination, Schivinski conceded that Adkins\u2019 testimony was essentially consistent with the proffer made during a second meeting with prosecutors and defense counsel on the eve of trial, but maintained that the testimony differed from an earlier proffer made to the FBI. Defense counsel argued at sentencing that the alleged discrepancies were \u201cminute,\u201d and did not constitute a breach of the agreement. Upon hearing of the government\u2019s intention to not move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, Adkins first attempted to withdraw his plea, and then requested that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>court grant the departure. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">This court has recognized that \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d requires the court to enforce promises made in a plea agreement that induce the defendant to plead guilty. \u201cWhere a defendant fulfills his promise in entering a guilty plea, the prosecution is bound to fulfill any promise made in exchange.\u201d <em>United States v. Robison, </em>924 F.2d 612, 613 (6th Cir.1991). In the absence of a plea agreement, the government has the sole discretion to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Where the language of a plea agreement expressly reserves the government\u2019s ultimate discretion to determine whether to make the motion, \u201ca district court may only review the government\u2019s refusal to make the motion to determine whether the refusal is based on unconstitutional considerations, such as the defendant\u2019s race.\u201d <em>United States v. Benjamin, </em>138 F.3d 1069, 1074 (6th Cir.1998). This court has also recognized, however, that \u201cin order to induce a defendant to enter a plea agreement, the government may bargain away its discretion and simply promise to make the substantial assistance motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1074. In such cases, the government is obligated to make the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, unless it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant breached the agreement. <em>Id. </em>Whether a defendant has complied with a term in a plea agreement requiring him or her to \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the government is a question of fact, which must be determined by the district court in the first instance. <em>United States v. Wells, </em>211 F.3d 988, 996 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The question before this court, therefore, is whether the government bargained away its discretion to deny a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion in Adkins\u2019 plea agreement. The plea agreement is ambiguous as to whether the government retained its discretion to make the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Initially, the terms of Adkins\u2019 agreement provided that the government \u201cwill\u201d make the motion if Adkins fully cooperates. In <em>Benjamin, </em>138 F.3d at 1074, this court determined that the use of the word \u201cwill\u201d suggested that the government\u2019s obligation to move for a substantial assistance departure was mandatory. The \u201cCooperation\u201d section in Adkins\u2019 plea agreement also states that \u201cin the event [the defendant] does not fully cooperate, as set forth herein, the government is released from its obligations under this agreement.\u201d The word \u201cobligations\u201d suggests that the government\u2019s commitment to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is not merely discretionary. This clause implies that the government would not be \u201creleased\u201d from their obligation if Adkins did cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The inclusion of this release clause distinguishes the instant agreement from the agreement in <em>United States v. Head, </em>927 F.2d 1361 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 846, 112 S.Ct. 144, 116 L.Ed.2d 110 (1991), in which the court determined that the government retained its discretion. The <em>Head </em>court determined that a clause indicating that the government \u201cwill\u201d file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was not sufficient to evince a binding agreement to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The <em>Head </em>waiver did not contain any provision similar to the one in this case discussing the government\u2019s \u201cobligation.\u201d The inclusion of such mandatory language, in the present case, is inconsistent with the statement that the U.S. Attorney has the sole authority to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Moreover, the \u201csole decision\u201d language is not entirely clear. It would be clearer, for example, to state that the government retains the exclusive right to determine whether the defendant has \u201cfully cooperated.\u201d As it is currently phrased, the \u201csole decision\u201d language may be read as a restatement of the fact that \u00a7 5K1.1 motions must originate with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>government, whether or not the government waives its discretion to deny such motions. There is ambiguity in the agreement as to whether the government retained its discretion to withhold the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The rules of construction of plea agreements dictate that the agreement be interpreted to impose a binding obligation on the government. <em>Johnson, </em>979 F.2d at 399 (holding that ambiguities in plea agreements are construed against the government); <em>see also United States v. Houston, </em>40 Fed.Appx. 139 (6th Cir.2002)(unpublished)(holding that the government did not reserve discretion to make 5K1.1 motion based on the use of both discretionary and nondiscretionary language in the plea agreement creating an ambiguity).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In this case, the sentencing court did not determine whether Adkins complied with the plea agreement, because it believed that it lacked authority to review the government\u2019s decision not to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. When confronted with the defense counsel\u2019s argument that the evidence did not demonstrate a breach by Adkins, the district court responded by saying \u201c[a]ren\u2019t we in a situation where it\u2019s \u2014 as persuasive as your arguments are, in large measure it\u2019s not my call to make?\u201d The court further inquired of defense counsel \u201c[i]s there any way I can force the United States\u2019 Attorney\u2019s Office to exercise their discretion in making a motion for 5K1.1?\u201d Apparently not convinced that it could do so, the court declined to order a departure. These comments indicate that the court felt it was without authority to compel the motion. This conclusion was in error, because the government did not retain its discretion to withhold the motion by the terms of the plea agreement. The court did have the authority to order specific performanee of the agreement. <em>Benjamin, </em>138 F.3d at 1074. Thus, this case is hereby remanded to the district court to make factual findings as to whether Adkins breached the agreement. <em>Wells, </em>211 F.3d at 996 (remanding to the district court where the court had not made factual findings as to whether defendant fully cooperated with the government).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AyaX\">\n<em>Adkins\u2019 Apprendi Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Adkins also contends that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), renders his sentence invalid. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the proscribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Adkins claims that Count One of the Superseding Indictment, to which he pled guilty, failed to specify the quantity and types of drugs involved in the conspiracy charge. This circuit has suggested that, in addition to requiring facts that increase the statutory maximum to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Apprendi </em>requires the government to allege facts that increase the statutory maximum penalty for a crime in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Strayhorn, </em>250 F.3d 462, 470 (6th Cir.2001). It is unclear whether the \u201cindictment question\u201d has been finally decided. <em>See United States v. Stafford, </em>258 F.3d 465, 477 n. 8 (6th Cir.2001). The court need not resolve the question here, because Adkins has failed to show a constitutional violation even assuming that <em>Apprendi </em>requires the government to allege quantity in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Normally, this circuit reviews constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. Strayhorn, </em>250 F.3d at 467. The govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ment contends that plain error review is appropriate, however, because Adkins did not raise the objection to the district court below. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Adkins\u2019 claims fail under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Adkins was sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), which provides a maximum sentence of forty years\u2019 imprisonment for offenses involving more than five grams of cocaine base (crack).' Count One of the Superseding Indictment alleged facts sufficient to show that Adkins was personally responsible for quantities well in excess of five grams. Among the overt acts alleged in Count One were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">9. On December 8, 1998, TIMOTHY M. ADKINS sold approximately 9.29 grams of crack cocaine in Mansfield, Ohio, to an individual known to the Grand Jury....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">61. On August 4, 1999, TIMOTHY M. ADKINS and BRYANT L. BROOKS sold approximately 959.5 grams of crack cocaine to an individual known to the Grand Jury....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">64. On September 29, 1999, TIMOTHY M. ADKINS distributed approximately 1.555 grams of crack cocaine in Mansfield, Ohio, to an individual known to the Grand Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">65. On September 30, 1999, TIMOTHY M. ADKINS distributed approximately 1.564 grams of crack cocaine in Mansfield, Ohio, to an individual known to the Grand Jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Since the facts alleged in the Superseding Indictment were sufficient to expose Adkins to a forty year maximum penalty, there is no <em>Apprendi </em>violation because his 262 month sentence did not exceed this maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Moreover, if plain error is the appropriate standard of review, Adkins\u2019 claim is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stafford, </em>which held that even if \u25a0 failure to include drug quantity in the indictment was error under <em>Apprendi, </em>such an omission does not rise to the level of plain error where the defendant admitted to the quantity of drugs in the plea agreement. <em>Stafford, </em>258 F.3d at 477.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2022\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), the Supreme Court indicated that while an indictment\u2019s failure to include drug quantity may render an enhanced sentence erroneous under <em>Apprendi, </em>it does not rise to the level of plain error unless it seriously affects fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. In <em>Cotton, </em>as in this case, the deficiency does not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">D. Myron Bl\u00e1ck</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">Black argues that the enhancement of his sentence based upon the finding that he was a career criminal violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The lower court held that Black was a career offender. Black contends that this determination violated <em>Apprendi </em>because the facts of his prior convictions were not listed in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This circuit has previously held, however, that the <em>Apprendi </em>rule does not apply to the fact of a prior conviction. <em>See United States v. </em>Gatewood 230 F.3d 186, 192 (6th Cir.2000)(en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 911, 151 L.Ed.2d 878 (2002). In addition, the district court\u2019s determination that Black was a career offender did not cause Black\u2019s sentence to exceed the statutory maximum that would apply absent such a finding. Black pled guilty to personal and jointly undertaken criminal activity involving at least 500 grams but less than five Mlo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>grams of cocaine. The statutory maximum sentence for an unspecified amount of cocaine is twenty years of imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Black\u2019s sentence of 168 months (14 years) of imprisonment did not exceed this maximum. Thus, there is no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in part; and REVERSE AND REMAND in part. The decision of the district court is affirmed as to all Appellants, except Timothy Adkins. The case is hereby remanded to the district court, as to Adkins, to determine whether there was a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ait_\">. Based on the Court\u2019s determination as to Adkins' plea agreement argument, we will not decide Adkins' other issue on appeal regarding the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-11\">. The Court need not decide the effect of the waiver of appeal as to the <em>Apprendi </em>claim because <em>Apprendi </em>argument fails on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
