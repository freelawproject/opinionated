We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Villela-Rodriguez pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement containing a waiver of the right to appeal unless the court imposed a sentence based on a total offense level greater than 30. Because the court sentenced Villela-Rodriguez to 57-months imprisonment based on a total offense level less than 30, the waiver of the right to appeal is enforceable unless otherwise unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Baramdyka, </em>95 F.3d 840, 843 (9th Cir. 1996) (recognizing exception to waiver of right to appeal where sentence imposed is in excess of statutory maximum penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Villela-Rodriguez now contends that the statutory scheme under which he was convicted, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, is facially unconstitutional after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that the district court erred by finding, without proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that Villela-Rodriguez knew that the vehicle he was driving contained 42.31 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">These contentions are foreclosed by our recent decisions in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-1110 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that \u00a7 960 is not facially unconstitutional), and <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that the government was required to prove that he knew the type and amount of the imported controlled substance); accordingly, Villela-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is constitutional and his waiver of the right to appeal is enforceable. This Court, therefore, lacks jurisdiction to review his claims on appeal. <em>See Baramdyka, </em>95 F.3d at 844 (concluding that valid waiver precludes any direct appeal of conviction or sentence)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b451-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
