In Valderama Cano\u2019s presentence report, the probation officer recommended that the offense level be increased three levels pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (1998) because Valderama Cano was a manager or supervisor of a conspiracy involving five or more persons. Valderama-Cano claims that the district court did not make findings of fact to support the court\u2019s conclusion that he was a manager or supervisor of the conspiracy, and that the evidence was insufficient to support such an enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">An enhancement under the guidelines must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir. 1989). We grant substantial deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings that a defendant was a manager or supervisor of a conspiracy involving five or more persons and reverse the district court\u2019s decision only if it was clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>914 F.2d 565, 569 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">After careful review of the record, we find that the evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing was sufficient to support Valderama-Cano\u2019s enhancement. Further, we find the record demonstrates that the district court made sufficient findings to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Valderama-Cano\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
