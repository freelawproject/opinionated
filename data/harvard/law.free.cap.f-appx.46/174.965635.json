At trial, videotapes of Almanza selling drugs to undercover police in controlled buys were shown to the jury. Almanza\u2019s counsel conceded the tapes depicted Almanza selling drugs, but argued this did not establish Almanza was involved in a drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>On appeal, Almanza argues his counsel was ineffective for conceding the tapes depicted him selling drugs. The record does not conclusively establish Almanza\u2019s counsel was ineffective, and consequently, this claim is not cognizable on direct appeal, and must be raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1096, 120 S.Ct. 837, 145 L.Ed.2d 704 (2000); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Leifried, </em>732 F.2d 388, 390 (4th Cir. 1984); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>477 F.2d 300, 302 (4th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Almanza\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
