Appellant Victor Luis Barrera, who pled guilty to a single-count information charging that he knowingly and intentionally imported into the United States over 100 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 960(b)(2)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of a minor participant downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The District Court, following the recommendations of the PreSentence Report (PSR), which were in accord with the stipulations in the written plea agreement, assigned Barrera a base offense level of 30 for the unlawful importation of an amount of heroin between 700 and 1,000 grams under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), reduced by three levels for timely acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b)(2), and reduced a further two levels under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, for a final offense level of 25. With Barrera\u2019s criminal history category of I, the PSR placed his applicable sentencing range at 57 to 71 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">At the sentencing hearing, Barrera objected to the PSR\u2019s lack of recommendation for a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Barrera argued that when compared to the other participants in the importation scheme who were charged in the Eastern District of New York under a separate, but related indictment for conspiracy to distribute, his role was minor. In considering Barrera\u2019s request, the District Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-15\">1) The minor role adjustment applied only if Barrera played a part in committing the offense that made him substantially less culpable than the average participant, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-16\">2) Barrera could receive the adjustment notwithstanding the fact that he was only charged with a single act of importation and, thus his relevant conduct consisted of only one act (pursuant to a recent amendment to \u00a7 3B1.2 by the Sentencing Commission).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-17\">3) Its inquiry was \u201cguided by the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata,\u201d </em>which required the district courts to examine \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u201d 148 F.3d 236, 239 (3d Cir. 1998) (quotations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The District Court then adopted the recommendations of the PSR and denied Barrera\u2019s motion for the minor role adjustment. The District Court acknowledged that other participants acquired the drugs, packaged them for Barrera to swallow, and received them from Barrera. However, it was Barrera who \u201cswallowed them. He took a trip on the airliner. He landed at Newark ... He was entrusted with ... delivery of these drug Appellant\u2019s App. at 43. The District Court then concluded that Barrera\u2019s role and his culpability in regard to the importation were as great as that of the other participants because: 1) Barrera imported a large quantity of heroin and a large amount of drugs militated against the finding of a minor role, 2) although he was subservient to Sandra Foronda, his new wife, and her family, who were involved in heroin distribution, Barrera differed little from an average participant for the conduct charged (importation), 3) Barrera had smuggled drugs before for the same people and possessed the drugs for several days, and was well paid for his efforts, thus demonstrating that he had sufficient knowledge of the group\u2019s organization and activities such that he could not qualify as a minor participant, and 4) although not charged with the conspiracy or the distribution aspects thereof, Barrera\u2019s role in the importation was pivotal insofar as the importation could not have occurred but for Barrera\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The District Court sentenced Barrera to 57 months incarceration (the bottom of the guideline), no fine, four years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. Barrera filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the findings of fact by a district court in a \u00a7 3B1.2 analysis for clear error. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 351 (3d Cir.2002), petition for cert, filed, No. 01-10721 (2002). We have plenary review of the legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 818 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Barrera asserts that the District Court erred as a matter of law by viewing him as an \u201caverage participant in an importation scheme,\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. at 42-3, and failing to compare his actions to those of the entire importation/distribution scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The scope of the District Court\u2019s inquiry was guided by our decision in <em>Isaza-Zapata </em>where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-12\">In 1990, the Sentencing Commission clarified the scope of the conduct relevant to the role in the offense adjustment, and the introductory commentary now directs that the determination of the defendant\u2019s relative culpability for purposes of assessing the applicability of the adjustment must be made on the basis of all relevant conduct \u2014 namely, all conduct within the scope of \u00a7 1B1.3\u2014 and not simply on the basis of the elements and acts referenced in the count of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">148 F.3d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">We held that a \u00a7 3B1.2 determination is heavily dependent on the individual facts of the particular case at issue and the circumstances of the individual defendant. Id. at 238-39. Barrera had the burden to prove that the conduct charged in the New York indictment was \u201cconduct within the scope of \u00a7 1B1.3.\u201d U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. B, Introductory Commentary. It can be im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>plied from the plea agreement that Barrera\u2019s relevant conduct was the extent of the importation scheme, as it stipulated \u201c[t]he amount of heroin that comprises the relevant conduct in this case is more than 700 grams but less than 1 kilogram,\u201d rather than the 3.8 kilograms attributed to the members of the larger distribution conspiracy of the New York indictment. Appellant\u2019s App. at 15. Had the court included the latter in Barrera\u2019s relevant conduct, he would have been subject to a base offense level four points higher than the one he actually received for the extra drug amount, resulting in a guideline range of 70 to 87 months, even with his sought-after two-level minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">As the court stated in <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 941 (11th Cir.1999), it would not make sense for a defendant to claim that her relevant conduct be construed narrowly for the purposes of calculating the offense level while simultaneously arguing for a broad interpretation of the same conduct for the purpose of determining whether a role adjustment was warranted. Barrera cannot have it both ways. The District Court did not err in restricting its scope of inquiry to the relevant conduct of the importation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Nor did the District Court clearly err in its treatment of Barrera\u2019s conduct relative to the total importation scheme. A minor role adjustment is warranted only on a finding that the defendant was substantially less culpable than an average participant in the relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(A); <em>see also United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Price, </em>13 F.3d 711, 735 (3d Cir.1994). Using the standards set forth in <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>the District Court examined \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u201d Isaz<em>a-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 239 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Barrera imported large amounts of heroin on more than one occasion and he was twice offered a substantial monetary reward for his role in the importation. He married a woman who was apparently the \u201cnumber two\u201d person in the organization so that she could reside here and represent the interests of the cartel in the United States. He had knowledge of the roles of Sandra Foronda, Wilson, and Romero within the organization, as well as knowledge of the organization\u2019s scope and purpose insofar as he had imported large quantities of drugs into the United States on the organization\u2019s behalf on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The evidentiary basis of the above facts is not in dispute and, by the standards of <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>Barrera\u2019s level of culpability in the importation scheme was at least average, not substantially less so. Thus, there is both a credible evidentiary basis and a firm rational connection between the facts of record and the findings of the District Court based upon those facts. Barrera\u2019s factual argument fails just as his legal argument did.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">For the reasons set forth, we will affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
