McLaurin claims that Cole issued the misconduct ticket solely in retaliation for a grievance McLaurin had filed against Cole. Cole claims that he was not motivated by the grievance, and, in any case, that he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment granting Cole\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A0U\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">The relevant facts of this case are set forth in <em>McLaurin v. Cole, </em>115 F.3d 408 (6th Cir.1997), <em>vacated, </em>202 F.3d 269 (6th Cir.1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-13\">McLaurin is serving a life term in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (\u201cMDOC\u201d) at the State Prison of Southern Michigan (\u201cSPSM\u201d) in Jackson, Michigan. On August 9, 1991, SPSM officers ordered an emergency count of the inmates just as McLaurin was preparing to take a shower. Upset because of his inability to take a shower, McLaurin struck the fire extinguishing sprinkler in his cell with a shoe, causing his cell to flood. McLaurin was immediately moved to a \u201cquiet cell\u201d for two hours. Following his release from the \u201cquiet cell,\u201d McLaurin returned to his cell and allegedly discovered that his legal materials were covered with shampoo and butter. McLaurin later climbed on top of a basketball support in the recreation yard and refused to come down. He was eventually subdued and moved to a cell in SPSM\u2019s administrative segregation unit. McLaurin subsequently filed a grievance against Cole for his role in the sprinkler incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-17\">While housed in the administrative segregation unit, McLaurin demanded his prayer rug and fez. When Cole refused McLaurin\u2019s request (because prisoners in administrative segregation are not permitted to possess such items pursuant to MDOC policy), McLaurin purportedly beat his chest and cell window with his hands, kicked the door to his cell, and repeatedly threatened to kill Cole. Cole subsequently issued McLaurin a \u201cmisconduct ticket\u201d for his threatening behavior. McLaurin, however, asserts that Cole issued the \u201cmisconduct ticket\u201d solely in retaliation for the grievance that McLaurin filed against Cole days earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-19\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">Based on the above-stated events, McLaurin filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>against four MDOC officers, seeking damages for \u201cpsychological distress, anxiety, mental anguish, [and] physical anguish.\u201d Specifically, McLaurin alleged that the \u201cDefendants denied [McLaurin] access to the court, the right to practice his religion, medical treatment, [and] retaliation [as] assured by the First[ ], Eighth[ ], and Fourteenth ] Amendments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The district court dismissed McLaurin\u2019s claims against three of the four named officers, but denied Cole\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to McLaurin\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">At trial, and after McLaurin presented his case, the district court granted Cole\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, because Cole\u2019s conduct did not \u201cshock the conscience\u201d of the court. McLaurin appealed that determination to this court and a divided panel affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal for two primary reasons: first, \u201c[bjecause McLaurin failed to prove that his filing of the grievance was a substantial or motivating factor behind Cole\u2019s issuance of the misconduct ticket\u201d; and second, \u201cbecause Cole\u2019s actions were not shocking to the conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. One judge, the author of this opinion, disagreed that the majority\u2019s \u201cshock the conscience\u201d standard was the proper test for resolving the case, but agreed that McLaurin \u201cfailed to present any evidence whatsoever that his filing of a grievance played any role in the defendant\u2019s decision to issue a misconduct ticket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413 (Ryan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">McLaurin filed a petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>which was pending when this court decided <em>Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, </em>175 F.3d 378 (6th Cir.1999), a case that established a three-part test to determine whether a plaintiff has suffered an actionable constitutional violation resulting from the exercise of a protected First Amendment right. <em>Id. </em>at 394. After the <em>en banc </em>court issued its decision in <em>Thaddeus-X, </em>the original panel in McLaurin\u2019s case vacated its judgment and remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration in light of <em>Thaddeus-X. </em>Cole then filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that McLaurin had not established a constitutional violation and, in any case, that the doctrine of qualified immunity shielded Cole from liability. The district court granted Cole\u2019s Rule 50 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">On this appeal, McLaurin argues that the district court erred in two respects: first, in concluding that McLaurin had not established a constitutional violation; and second, in concluding that Cole is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law, brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, <em>de novo. Brickers v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., </em>145 F.3d 846, 849 (6th Cir.1998). We must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and give the nonmovant the benefit of all reasonable inferences. <em>Id. </em>\u201c\u2018Only when it is clear that reasonable people could come to but one conclusion from the evidence should a court grant a motion for [judgment as a matter of law].\u2019 \u201d <em>Wayne v. Village of Sebring, </em>36 F.3d 517, 525 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Lewis v. City of Irvine, </em>899 F.2d 451, 454-55 (6th Cir.1990)). Accordingly, judgment as a matter of law is appropriate \u201c[i]f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>that issue ... [and if the] claim or defense [] cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">1. Failure to Provide a Trial Transcript</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Preliminarily, we will briefly address Cole\u2019s argument that McLaurin\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because McLaurin failed to provide a trial transcript to support his claim that the district court erred in finding that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Cole\u2019s motivation in issuing the misconduct ticket was the grievance McLaurin filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(2) states that \u201c[i]f the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\u201d FED. R. APP. P. 10(b)(2). Moreover, in lieu of a trial transcript, parties may, pursuant to Rule 10(d), \u201cprepare, sign, and submit to the district court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the district court.\u201d FED. R. APP. P. 10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The purpose of these rules is to enable an appellate court to conduct an informed and meaningful review. However, we have not required a transcript or a Rule 10(d) statement where the appellees are neither misled nor prejudiced by the appellant\u2019s failure to provide a trial transcript or statement of the case. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Local Union No. 1827, </em>568 F.2d 7, 8 (6th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Cole\u2019s brief to this court indicates that he agrees with the statement of facts and description of the district court proceedings with respect to the issues presented, as stated in McLaurin\u2019s brief. Moreover, our independent review of the record satisfies us that we have a sufficient record to properly review the questions presented, without the aid of a verbatim trial transcript. Therefore, Cole\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">2. The Rule 50 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">As we have indicated, McLaurin\u2019s principal claim is that the district court committed two errors when it granted Cole\u2019s Rule 50 motion: its determination that no constitutional violation occurred; and its conclusion that Cole is entitled to qualified immunity. Actually, the first issue\u2014 whether a constitutional violation occurred \u2014 -is subsumed in the second\u2014 whether Cole is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">When acting in a discretionary role, government officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless them conduct violates \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). A clearly established right is one that is \u201csufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). \u201cIn other words, \u2018in the light of pre-existing law[,] the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Noble v. Schmitt, </em>87 F.3d 157, 161 (6th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 640). The doctrine of qualified immunity does not offer a safe-haven to government officials who are \u201cplainly incompetent or [to] those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>In <em>Williams v. Mehra, </em>186 F.3d 685 (6th Cir.1999) (ere <em>banc), </em>this court outlined a tripartite inquiry for evaluating a claim of qualified immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-4\"><em>First, </em>we determine whether a constitutional violation occurred; <em>second, </em>we determine whether the right that was violated was a clearly established right of which a reasonable person would have known; <em>finally, </em>we determine whether the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts, and supported the allegations by sufficient evidence, to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 691 (citing <em>Dickerson v. McClellan, </em>101 F.3d 1151, 1157-58 (6th Cir.1996)) (emphasis added). Our first inquiry, therefore, is whether a constitutional violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">a. Whether a Constitutional Violation has Occurred</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">In <em>Thaddeus-X, </em>175 F.3d 378, this court established that in order to prove a constitutionally actionable retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show three things: \u201c(1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between elements one and two \u2014 that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiffs protected conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The parties agree that <em>Thaddeus-X </em>enunciates the applicable law in this circuit for retaliation claims. The parties disagree, however, whether the rule stated in <em>Thaddeus-X </em>was \u201cclearly established\u201d when Cole issued the misconduct ticket in question in 1991. However, this is a controversy without consequence. The question whether the criteria for establishing a cause of action as enunciated in <em>Thaddeus-X </em>were clearly established in 1991 is relevant only <em>after </em>McLaurin has shown that a constitutional violation has occurred. <em>See McCloud v. Testa, </em>227 F.3d 424, 432 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also Daugherty v. Campbell, </em>935 F.2d 780, 783 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Assuming, without deciding, that the evidence shows that McLaurin was engaged in protected conduct and that Cole took an adverse action against McLaurin that would have deterred a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct, we nevertheless agree with the district court that McLaurin failed to prove the requisite causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse action; that is, that a constitutional violation occurred. Indeed, McLaurin presented no evidence to indicate that his filing the grievance against Cole was a motivating factor in Cole issuing the misconduct ticket. <em>See Thaddeus-X, </em>175 F.3d at 399. In affirming the district court\u2019s original dismissal of McLaurin\u2019s retaliation claim, the panel concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ace\">Because McLaurin <em>failed to prove that his filing of the grievance was a </em>substantial or <em>motivating factor </em>behind Cole\u2019s issuance of the misconduct ticket, ... the district court properly dismissed McLaurin\u2019s retaliation claim against Cole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-11\"><em>McLaurin, </em>115 F.3d at 411 (emphasis added). The concurring opinion agreed with this conclusion and added that McLaurin \u201cfailed to present <em>any evidence whatsoever </em>that his filing of a grievance played <em>any role </em>in the defendant\u2019s decision to issue a misconduct ticket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413 (Ryan, J., concurring) (emphasis added). Nothing has changed. McLaurin has not suggested on this appeal that there is any evidence in the record that was not before the district court and this court the first time around to improve the strength of his cau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>sation argument and, therefore, we have no basis to disturb our original conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Because McLaurin has produced no evidence to support a finding that a constitutional violation has occurred, it is not necessary to consider the other two steps of the qualified immunity inquiry, namely\u2014 \u201cwhether the right that was violated was a clearly established right,\u201d and \u201cwhether the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts, and supported the allegations by sufficient evidence, to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.\u201d <em>See Mehra, </em>186 F.3d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
