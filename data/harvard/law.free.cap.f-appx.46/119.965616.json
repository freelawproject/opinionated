Following a jury trial, Martin was convicted of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Due to two prior violent felony convictions, Martin was sentenced to life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) (\u201cThree Strikes\u201d statute). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">Martin makes two arguments on appeal \u2014 first, that the prosecutor denied his right to due process and a fair trial by stating her beliefs regarding the evidence and mis-characterizing the testimony of the photographic evidence expert; second, that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the government was required to prove his two prior violent felony convictions to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the \u201cthree strikes\u201d mandatory life sentence to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-19\">Since Martin failed to object to the alleged trial errors, we review for plain error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under the plain error test,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quotations and citations omitted). The Supreme Court has declared that Rule 52(b)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">authorizes the Courts of Appeals to correct only particularly egregious errors, those errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. In other words, the plain-error exception to the contemporaneous-objection rule is to be used sparingly, solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\"><em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (quotations and citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Martin argues that the prosecutor\u2019s opening and closing statements included improper vouching. We have noted that in order to find improper vouching, two criteria must be met: (1) the prosecutor must assure the jury that the testimony of a Government witness is credible; and (2) this assurance is based on either the prosecutor\u2019s personal knowledge, or other information not contained in the record. Thus, it is not enough for a defendant on appeal to assert that the prosecutor assured the jury that a witness\u2019 testimony was credible. The defendant must be able to identify as the basis for that comment an explicit or implicit reference to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney or information not contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\"><em>United States v. Walker, </em>155 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Martin contends that in her opening statement, the prosecutor expressed her personal opinion on the evidence by stating \u201c[t]his man [Martin] walked into the bank carrying a loaded sawed-off shotgun.\u201d The prosecutor then continued to describe how \u201cthis man\u201d robbed the bank without the qualification that this is what the evidence would show. Martin argues the prosecutor compounded the error in her closing argument when she improperly vouched for government witnesses regarding eyewitness testimony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the surveillance photographs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">While improper, we do not believe the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted plain error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court gave preliminary instructions immediately before opening statements instructing the jury that \u201c[t]he statements, the arguments and the questions by the lawyers aren\u2019t evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Furthermore, the prosecutor\u2019s comments and phraseology (\u201cI believe ... \u201d) in her closing arguments, did not themselves constitute improper vouching. These comments were correctly analyzed by the District Judge who noted that while they \u201carguably satisfy the first criteria of improper vouching because they stated her opinion on the validity of the government witnesses\u2019 identifications,\u201d the comments did not contain \u201can implicit or explicit reference to personal knowledge of the prosecutor or information not in the record .... [but] clearly referred to evidence the jury might have properly considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>2000 WL 233217, *5 (E.D.Pa.2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u201creferred to evidence presented in the record, it does not constitute vouching.\u201d <em>United States v. Dispoz-O-Plastics, Inc., </em>172 F.3d 275, 288 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">During trial, Martin called one witness, Richard Vorder Bruegge from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an expert examiner of photographic evidence. Vorder Bruegge testified about his comparison of surveillance photos of the bank robber and the arrest photo of Martin. Vorder Bruegge stated that while \u201che was very close to making a positive identification,\u201d ultimately he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell\u201d whether the surveillance photos of the bank robber was a photograph of Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In her closing statement, the prosecutor misrepresented Vorder Bruegge\u2019s testimony regarding his comparison of the photographs on at least three occasions: (1) by telling the jury that to Vorder Bruegge \u201cthey certainly looked like the same person\u201d; (2) by arguing that he \u201csaid that it sure looked like the same person\u201d; and (3) that he was \u201csure that these were the same person.\u201d Martin contends that by mischaracterizing the testimony of Vorder Bruegge, the prosecutor denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments were error, but they did not constitute plain error. The Supreme Court has declared that \u201ca criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s statements standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by so doing can it be determined whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct affected the fairness of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). Accordingly, we do not believe the challenged statements seriously affected the fairness of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Although the prosecutor misrepresented Vorder Bruegge\u2019s testimony at various points during her closing, she also accurately portrayed his testimony by stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">Mr. Vorder Bruegge ... is an expert in the comparison of photographs. He compared certain photographs ... and he could not make a positive identification of the two people in the photographs, whether it was one person or more than one person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">Furthermore, the evidence presented at trial was substantial. There were three eyewitnesses who identified Martin as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>bank robber as well as a witness who observed \u201chis funny walk\u201d during the robbery. (An FBI agent testified that he noticed Martin\u2019s \u201cpigeon toed\u201d gait while he was in custody.) The jury was able to evaluate the witnesses\u2019 testimony by comparing it with a video surveillance tape of the bank robbery. In addition, the jury was able to compare the video, and the surveillance photos of the robber with the arrest photograph of Martin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, as it did before opening arguments, the District Court gave general curative instructions to the jurors following closing arguments, charging them that they were the judges of the facts and that they should not consider counsel\u2019s arguments as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Viewing the entire proceedings, there was ample evidence for the jury to determine Martin\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not \u201cundermine the fundamental fairness of the trial\u201d or \u201ccontribute to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The District Court sentenced Martin to a mandatory sentence of life in prison under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1), because of two prior violent felony convictions. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1)(A)\u00ae, \u201ca person who is convicted in a court of the United States of a serious violent felony shall be sentenced to life imprisonment if the person has been convicted ... on separate prior occasions in a court of the United States or of a State of 2 or more serious violent felonies.\u201d Martin contends as a matter of due process that under <em>Apprendi </em>his prior convictions should have been submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt before they could be used to increase his maximum sentence under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Nonetheless, Martin acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by this circuit\u2019s precedent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Weaver, </em>267 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.2001). In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cdecided that no due process violation occurs when prior convictions are used to increase a statutory maximum without being charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>267 F.3d at 250 (citation omitted). We have repeatedly noted that the Court excepted the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d from the sentence-enhancing factors which must be proved to a jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Stubbs, </em>281 F.3d 109, 123 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Weaver, </em>267 F.3d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-12\">. Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYa\">\u201cPLAIN ERROR. Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">. In reference to the eyewitnesses, the prosecutor stated in her closing argument: (1) \"So I believe that the evidence shows you that all three of these eye witnesses had, at various times, unobstructed views of the defendant, and each of them came to court, swore to tell the truth, and identified him as the man who had robbed the bank that day.\u201d (2) \"I believe that given the lighting and the unobstructed views, the photo spread identifications ... and the other various factors that you heard when these people testified, based on all of these things, you can find that their identification of him is correct, that he did rob the bank.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-16\">. In reference to the photographs, the prosecutor stated in her closing argument, \"Yes, they [surveillance photographs] corroborate the government\u2019s view and corroborate the eye witnesses. They show you that the eye witnesses are not wrong when they come into court and identify Mr. Martin as the robber.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-17\">. In <em>Walker, </em>we reminded prosecutors that: It is perfectly acceptable practice for a prosecutor to use language in addressing the jury such as \"you are free to conclude,\u201d \"you may perceive that,\u201d \"it is submitted that,\u201d or \"a conclusion on your part may be drawn,\u201d to mention only a few examples of unobjectionable phraseology. It is obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tory for prosecutors to find careful ways of inviting jurors to consider drawing argued inferences and conclusions and yet to avoid giving the impression that they are conveying their personal views to the jurors. 155 F.3d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We remind them again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\">. While the prosecutor's comments during her closing argument did not constitute plain error, we reiterate that \" '[i]t is obligatory for prosecutors to find careful ways of inviting jurors to consider drawing argued inferences and conclusions and yet to avoid giving the impression that they are conveying their personal views to the jurors.' \u201d <em>Walker, </em>155 F.3d at 189 (quoting <em>United States v. Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d 1294, 1328 (2d Cir.1987)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">. Before the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts, they requested and received from the District Court a second opportunity to observe Martin while wearing a Philadelphia Eagles cap so that they could compare it with the photograph of the bank robber who was wearing an Eagles cap during the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">. In his brief, Martin states he \u201crecognizes that this Court has already ruled that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to the fact of prior conviction. Nonetheless, this issue is raised here in order to preserve it in the event that this Court or the Supreme Court extends the reasoning of <em>Apprendi </em>to the fact of prior conviction.\u201d (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b171-17\">. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (\"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
