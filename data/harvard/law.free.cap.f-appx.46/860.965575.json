A jury found Webb guilty. Webb did not challenge the earlier state convictions at sentencing, and the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>life sentence under \u00a7 3559. Webb then filed this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The district court denied Webb\u2019s motion, but certified two issues for appeal: (1) whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the 1972 robbery conviction and the 1980 escape conviction, and (2) whether the Government\u2019s failure to plead the earlier state convictions in the indictment and to submit them to the jury under the reasonable doubt standard violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. We affirm the denial of Webb\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Webb first contends trial counsel should have challenged the 1972 robbery conviction because it does not qualify as a serious violent felony under \u00a7 3559. For the purposes of \u00a7 3559, \u201cserious violent felony\u201d includes an \u201coffense punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)(ii). Robbery convictions do not count if the defendant proves, as an affirmative defense, that no firearm or other dangerous weapon was used, no threatened use was involved in the offense, and \u201cthe offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) to any person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A); <em>see United States v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 965, 969-70 (2001). Serious bodily injury includes substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Webb asserts the robbery does not qualify because he did not use or threaten to use a firearm or other weapon and because no serious bodily injury occurred. Webb has made no showing that he could have met his burden to prove this affirmative defense. Indeed, in Webb\u2019s direct appeal of his conviction for the 1972 robbery, the Arkansas Supreme Court stated Webb beat a witness so badly that the witness \u201cwas bedridden and could not sit up without suffocating\u201d at the time of Webb\u2019s trial, and the witness testified he had not worked a day since the robbery. <em>Webb v. State, </em>253 Ark. 448, 486 S.W.2d 684, 685-86 (Ark.1972). Like the district court, we conclude the witness\u2019s injury falls within the definition of serious bodily injury under \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A) and \u00a7 1365(g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Alternatively, Webb argues the 1972 robbery conviction is unconstitutional. Because of the witness\u2019s inability to come to the courtroom, the trial judge moved the trial to the witness\u2019s home to take his testimony. Webb contends this violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. Webb cannot use a \u00a7 2255 motion to raise this contention. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>202 F.3d 1066, 1067 (8th Cir.2000) (only denial-of-counsel claims are excluded from the general rule against collaterally attacking earlier convictions used for federal sentence enhancements); <em>Arnold v. United States, </em>63 F.3d 708, 709 (8th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Webb also contends his 1980 escape conviction does not qualify for the purposes of \u00a7 3559. Webb does not dispute his 1987 aggravated robbery conviction, however. The three strikes law only requires two qualifying serious violent felony convictions, and Webb\u2019s 1972 and 1987 convictions qualify Webb for the mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 3559. Because trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Webb\u2019s 1972 conviction was not deficient performance, and the failure to challenge Webb\u2019s 1980 conviction did not prejudice Webb\u2019s defense, Webb\u2019s ineffective assistance claim fails. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Last, Webb asserts the earlier convictions were elements of the current offense, and should have been pleaded in the indictment and submitted to the jury for finding beyond a reasonable doubt. Webb\u2019s assertion is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Davis, </em>260 F.3d at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Webb's \u00a7 2255 motion</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\"> The Honorable James M.
