We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination that it lacked discretion to depart. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>133 F.3d 1208, 1214 (9th Cir.1998). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">McCahill contends, and the government agrees, that the district court failed to recognize that it had the discretion under the sentencing guidelines to depart downward six months to allow the sentence in this matter to run fully concurrent with an undischarged federal sentence. We agree, and conclude that the district court did have that authority. <em>See United States v. Kimble, </em>107 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir.1997) (stating that under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), a district court can impose a sentence \u201cconcurrent with or without credit for time served\u201d); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez, </em>161 F.3d 556, 563-64 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (concluding that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, a district court can depart based on the lost opportunity to serve a greater portion of a state sentence concurrently with a federal sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand to allow the district court to consider exercising its discretion to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
