We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. The district court\u2019s factual findings in the sentencing phase are reviewed for clear error, but must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Fox, </em>189 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir.1999). \u2018Whether the method adopted by the district court to approximate the relevant quantity of drugs is proper under the guidelines is ... reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. August, </em>86 F.3d 151, 153 (9th Cir.1996). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Based on sworn statements made by individuals involved in drug transactions with McIntosh, the Presentence Report found that she had distributed at least 3.17 kilograms of methamphetamine. This amount has a base offense level of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). The district court\u2019s conclusion that McIntosh was more likely than not actually responsible for a quantity greater than or equal to the quantity for which she was ultimately held responsible was based on sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy. <em>See August, </em>86 F.3d at 154. Even exercising caution and discounting all the transactions to which McIntosh objected, the minimum amount of methamphetamine reasonably attributable to her is 1.5876 kilograms, which also has a base offense level of 34. Therefore, the district court properly calculated McIntosh\u2019s sentence using a base offense level of 34. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b583-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
