Messersmith pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 262 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. Messersmith did not appeal. Within one year, the government moved to reduce his sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), and the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reduced the sentence to 131 months imprisonment to be followed by 5 years supervised release. Messersmith now appeals the reduced sentence. His counsel has moved to withdraw, filing a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For reversal, counsel argues that Messersmith\u2019s sentence should have been reduced more based on his assistance to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the extent of a departure made by a district court under Rule 35(b). <em>See United States v. Coppedge, </em>135 F.3d 598, 599 (8th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (dismissing challenge to extent of Rule 35(b) reduction because appeal is not based on any criteria listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)). Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-11\">. The Honorable Warren K.
