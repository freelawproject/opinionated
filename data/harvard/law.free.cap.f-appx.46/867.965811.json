We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Roche failed to establish a prima facie case of either disability discrimination or rehabilitation discrimination. <em>See Fast v. Southern Union Co., </em>149 F.3d 885, 889 (8th Cir.1998) (stating de novo standard of review). Roche has failed to show that her sight problems<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her positive reaction to a tuberculin skin test constitute a disability or that they limited her in any major life activity. <em>See Heintzelman v. Runyon, </em>120 F.3d 143, 145 (8th Cir.1997) (noting that a condition must be permanent or produce long-term limitations for the individual to constitute an actual disability under either the Rehabilitation Act or MHRA); <em>see also Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 </em>U.S. 471, 488-89, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (holding available corrective measures or medications must be considered in assessing whether a physical condition qualifies as a disability). Roche has also failed to demonstrate that Saint Lukes regarded her as being disabled. <em>Roberts v. Unidynamics Corp., </em>126 F.3d 1088, 1092 (8th Cir.1997) .(stating standard for \u201cregarded as\u201d claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">The district court did not err in dismissing Roche\u2019s retaliation claims. Roche failed to establish that she engaged in any protected activity. <em>Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., </em>169 F.3d 1131, 1136 (8th Cir. 1999) (stating prima facie elements for retaliation). The district court also did not err in dismissing Roche\u2019s FMLA claims. Roche failed to demonstrate that her elective outpatient eye surgery was a \u201cserious health condition,\u201d entitling her to FMLA protections. <em>See Austin v. Haaker, </em>76 F.Supp.2d 1213, 1220-21 (D.Kan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>1999) (noting the limited instances when the FMLA applies and defining a \u201cserious health condition\u201d). Finally, the district court did not err in dismissing Roche\u2019s retaliation claim for making a worker\u2019s compensation claim, where the filing of the claim occurred five years prior to her termination. <em>See Hansome v. Northwestern Cooperage Co., </em>679 S.W.2d 273, 275 (Mo. 1984) (stating prima facie elements for worker\u2019s compensation retaliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-17\">.

In her Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint, Roche claimed her disability was refractive surgery. In contrast, in her complaint, Roche claimed disability based on nearsightedness and astigmatism.
