His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record.

Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83,109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that Samaniego-Abril knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
