The parties have expressly waived oral argument pursuant to Rule 34(j)(3), Rules of the Sixth Circuit, and we agree that oral argument is not necessary. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">Hernandez-Mojica pleaded guilty to a charge of illegal re-entry by a deported alien, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2) &amp; (b)(2). He was sentenced to fifty-seven months of imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a USSG \u00a7 5K2.0, p.s., downward departure: (1) because his federal prosecution was delayed by a state prosecution and (2) because he has a child who is seriously ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-19\">A district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward is not an appealable decision unless the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked the discretion to do so. <em>United States v. Prince, </em>214 F.3d 740, 766 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 974, 121 S.Ct. 417, 148 L.Ed.2d 322 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">The district court specifically noted that neither of the grounds for departure urged by Hernandez-Mojica took the case \u201coutside the heartland\u201d of cases anticipated by the sentencing guidelines. Thus, the district court demonstrated an awareness of its discretion but found downward departures unwarranted under the circumstances. This decision is not subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-22\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
