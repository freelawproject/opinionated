Defendants were surprised by its existence and were not afforded the opportunity to conduct discovery about its contents. Now Plaintiffs attempt to support their motion with an exhaustive list of other articles they produced during discovery as well as a chronology of how the 1988 Life Sciences article was located and turned over to Defendants. However, Plaintiffs still cannot provide the Court with the justification as to why the article was not located earlier in the four years this lawsuit has been pending.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">A writ of mandamus will issue only in exceptional circumstances to correct a clear abuse of discretion or usurpation of judicial power by a trial court. <em>In re Calmar Inc., </em>854 F.2d 461, 464 (Fed.Cir. 1988). A party who seeks a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired, <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Southern Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). \u201cWhere a matter is committed to discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant\u2019s right to a particular result is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">Zeiss concedes, as it must, that the district court\u2019s ruling in this case was a matter committed to the district court\u2019s discretion. The authority to control discovery is confined almost entirely to the exercise of a trial court\u2019s discretion. In view thereof, Zeiss has not shown that its right to vacatur of the ruling is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d Further, Zeiss has not shown that it lacks no other means of attaining relief. \u201cA litigant is free to seek review of the propriety of such an order on direct appeal after a final judgment has been entered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">Zeiss\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>is denied.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">Zeiss filed confidential and nonconfidential copies of its writ, but filed only confidential copies of its appendix. Nearly all of documents in the appendix are nonconfidential. Accordingly, Zeiss is ordered to file one non-confidential copy of the appendix to be placed in the court's public file.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
