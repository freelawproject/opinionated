In his plea agreement, Corpening waived his right to appeal his sentence on any grounds except ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. Corpening now seeks to appeal his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in refusing to depart below the guideline range based on substantial assistance, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2001), despite the government\u2019s failure to move for a substantial assistance departure. Finding that Corpening knowingly waived his right to appeal his sentence, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-23\">It is well established that \u201ca defendant may not.appeal his sentence if his plea agreement contains an express and unqualified waiver of the right to appeal, unless that waiver was unknowing or involuntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402 (4th Cir.2000). Corpening does not allege that his waiver was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>knowing or involuntary. To the extent that he may intend to raise the issue of prosecutorial misconduct, we find nothing in the record that would support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
