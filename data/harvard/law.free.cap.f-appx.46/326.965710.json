Belle and her son, Kweli Baraka Belle (\u201cthe Belles\u201d), proceeding pro se, appeal a district court order dismissing their civil action filed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. The Belles also appeal the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>court\u2019s order striking their first amended complaint. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On October 2, 2001, the Belles filed a complaint against 60 defendants, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), Manuel Noriega, the Nation of Israel, the United Kingdom, Osama Bin Laden, President George W. Bush, Richard Cheney, and the Mother Supreme [Masonic] Council of the World. The Belles asserted numerous allegations against the defendants. Essentially, the Belles alleged that the FBI failed to honor their request under the FOIA for personal information about President George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, John Ellis Bush, and Michael Aquino and has been involved in \u201cillegal monitoring, surveillance, and counter-intelligence activities against [them].\u201d The Belles also alleged that the defendants conspired to deprive them of their civil rights and to sabotage several lawsuits that Anita Belle had filed in federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The district court granted the Belles\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis and subsequently dismissed the Belles\u2019 complaint as frivolous. The Belles filed a timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing their complaint, which has been docketed in this court as case number 02-1100. Following the dismissal of their complaint, the Belles filed an amended complaint. The district court ordered the amended complaint striken from the record because it was filed after the case was dismissed. The Belles filed a timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order striking their amended complaint, which has been docketed in this court as case number 02-1304. Both cases have been consolidated. The Belles have filed a motion \u201cfor Disclosure of Masonic Affiliation\u201d and a motion for \u201cSanetions/Costs Against Appellees,\u201d for \u201cHearing/Oral Argument,\u201d and for \u201cDisclosure of Masonic Affiliation\u201d with respect to case number 02-1100. The Belles have also filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis and \u201cfor Disclosure of Masonic Affiliation/Disqualification\u201d with respect to case number 02-1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We review de novo an order dismissing a suit as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000). A complaint \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>see also Lawler v. Marshall, </em>898 F.2d 1196, 1198 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the Belles\u2019 complaint. The allegations made in the complaint lack an arguable basis in fact as they are both fantastic and delusional. <em>See Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 327-28, 109 S.Ct. 1827. The arguments asserted by the Belles in their appellate briefs do not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when striking the Belles\u2019 amended complaint. <em>See Duggins v. Steak \u2018N Shake, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 828, 833-34 (6th Cir.1999) (district court\u2019s disposition of an amended complaint is reviewed for an abuse of discretion); <em>Crawford v. Roane, </em>53 F.3d 750, 753 (6th Cir.1995) (same). After judgment has been entered, a complaint may not be amended without leave of court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). Leave to amend a complaint \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The Belles did not seek leave of court prior to filing their amended complaint even though the district court\u2019s order dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>missing their case had already been filed. Furthermore, the amended complaint did not correct the deficiencies of the original complaint, as pointed out in the district court\u2019s January 7, 2002, order. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>Sinay v. Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., </em>948 F.2d 1037, 1041-42 (6th Cir.1991). Under these circumstances, justice does not require that amendment occur. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Accordingly, the motions for disclosure of Masonic affiliation, sanctions, costs, and oral argument are denied and the district court\u2019s orders are affirmed. The motion to proceed in forma pauperis in case number 02-1304 is granted for the limited purpose of deciding this appeal.
