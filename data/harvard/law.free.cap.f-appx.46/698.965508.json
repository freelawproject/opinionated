Gomez contends the district court\u2019s misstatement of the relevant statutory sentencing range at Gomez\u2019s plea colloquy pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and his attorney\u2019s ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>assistance in acceding to a plea agreement that also misstated his potential sentence undermine his conviction. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Gomez fails to demonstrate reversible error in his Rule 11 plea hearing. Because Gomez did not object to the adequacy of his plea hearing before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cannady, </em>283 F.3d 641, 648 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014---, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1048-49, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002)). The district court\u2019s instruction to Gomez that he could receive a sentence of ten years to life imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), despite the fact that the quantities charged in his indictment only qualified Gomez for sentencing under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (allowing sentences of five to forty years), is erroneous in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 529 (4th Cir.2002). Gomez bears the \u201cburden of persuasion with respect to prejudice,\u201d however, <em>Martinez, 217 </em>F.3d at 532, and we are not persuaded that Gomez has demonstrated he would not have pled guilty but for this error. It is also significant that the 188-month sentence Gomez received is within the correct sentencing range. We therefore conclude the error did not affect his substantial rights, and even if it did, we would not recognize the error as one affecting \u201cthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Accordingly, Gomez has not shown plain error in the district court\u2019s administration of his Rule 11 colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Nor has Gomez presented a reviewable issue with respect to his argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in relation to his guilty plea. Generally, ineffective assistance of counsel claims should be pursued in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion in order to allow for adequate development of the record, <em>see United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994), and this court will review such claims on direct appeal only if they appear conclusively on the record, see <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir. 1994). We do not find Gomez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim conclusively appears on the face of the appellate record. Accordingly, Gomez should present this claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Gomez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
