Because we write for the parties who are familiar with the facts, we need not review them in any detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">The suit filed by plaintiffs arose out of an incident in which Larry D\u2019Alessandro Sr., Donna Hansell\u2019s former husband, shot his way into the Hansell home and briefly held hostage Shannon D\u2019Alessandro (the daughter of Larry D\u2019Alessandro, Sr. and Donna Hansell), Carl Christopher Hansell and Christopher Hansell, Donna Hansell\u2019s current husband and their son. At the time, Larry D\u2019Alessandro was a member of the Atlantic City Police Department (Police Department). Plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2002), alleging a state-created danger and failure to train or supervise D\u2019Alessandro and the other officers. They also included claims based on New Jersey state tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">Plaintiffs originally also sued several individual Atlantic City police officers, but all were dismissed other than former Chief of Police Nicolas Rifice and former Internal Affairs Sergeant Kirk Sutton. Defendant, the City of Atlantic City, represents the Police Department. The defendants moved for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-17\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343, and 1367 (2002), and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-19\">After reviewing the briefs and the record, and hearing oral argument, we conclude that we must affirm. Plaintiffs\u2019 principal argument is based on the state-created danger theory asserted under 1983. Under that theory, as set forth in <em>Kneipp v. Tedder, </em>95 F.3d 1199, 1208 (3d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, </em>51 F.3d 1137, 1152 (3d Cir.1995)), plaintiffs must show that \u201c(1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct; (2) the state actor acted in will<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ful disregard for the safety the plaintiff; (3) there existed some relationship between the state and the plaintiff; (4) the state actors used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise would not have existed for the third party\u2019s crime to occur.\u201d In a later refinement of the second prong of that theory, we required plaintiffs to show that \u201cthe state\u2019s actions must evince a willingness to ignore a foreseeable danger or risk.\u201d <em>Morse v. Lower Merion School District, </em>132 F.3d 902, 910 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In this case, plaintiffs contend that the fact that D\u2019Alessandro was permitted to retain his service revolver, which he used to effect the hostage taking, provided the element of state-created danger, as did the Police Department\u2019s failure to properly investigate complaints of domestic violence against D\u2019Alessandro. However, although plaintiff Donna Hansell points to several instances in which she notified a defendant of some domestic disturbance, those instances were spread over a period of time and were unspecific. The most specific, as well as most recent, reported incident (and it did not involve Ms. Hansell) appears to have been negligently overlooked by defendant Sutton, who was carrying a heavy workload. We thus conclude that the defendants were not sufficiently notified of the danger to the plaintiffs for the hostage taking to be considered foreseeable under the state-created danger theory. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the state-created danger theory under \u00a7 1983 thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Regarding the claim on the failure to train under \u00a7 1983, after being provided with extensive discovery the plaintiffs can only point to the Police Department\u2019s handling of the complaints against D\u2019Alessandro. This one case fails to show a pattern or practice of ignoring domestic violence complaints against police officers. Although we are concerned as to how acts of domestic violence by police officers are treated by the Police Department, plaintiffs have not shown that the City of Atlantic City displayed \u201c \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to the rights of persons with whom [its] employees will come into contact,\u201d namely, victims of acts of domestic violence by police officers. <em>Carter v. City of Philadelphia, </em>181 F.3d 339, 357 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989)). Therefore, plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to support a claim under \u00a7 1983 for failure to train or supervise.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Finally, because the injuries alleged were psychological rather than physical, plaintiffs did not suffer compensable injuries under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59:9-2(d) (West 2002), as interpreted by the New Jersey courts. <em>Ayers v. Township of Jackson, </em>106 N.J. 557, 525 A.2d 287 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City of Atlantic City, Nicolas Rifice and Kirk Sutton.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
