Oakes and other unnamed police officers.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This court may reverse a jury verdict only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusions reached by the jury. <em>Sherrill White Constr., Inc. v. S.C. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>713 F.2d 1047, 1050 (4th Cir.1983). We find probative facts to support the conclusions reached by the jury. Accordingly, we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict. We deny Clark\u2019s motion \u201cto serve Officers Oakes and Hurley with perjury charges\u201d and his motion to authorize preparation of transcript at government expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-18\"> On appeal, Clark does not contest the district court\u2019s dismissal of the other defendants from this action. With respect to the unnamed officers, despite warning by the district court that failure to amend the complaint with the identities of these officers would result in dismissal against the unnamed officers, Clark failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
