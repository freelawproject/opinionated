As part of his plea agreement, Tea waived his right to appeal his sentence. Because he received a sentence within the statutory maximum specified in the plea agreement, the court did not depart upward in offense level or criminal history category and there is no evidence that the waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing or was not voluntary, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
