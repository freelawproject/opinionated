Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">On appeal, Little contends the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for carrying and brandishing a firearm in a crime of violence and possession of a firearm by a felon. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find a reasonable trier of fact could have found Little guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Little next contends the district court erred in providing the jury with an extensive supplemental instruction regarding possession. Because Little did not object to the instruction, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35. 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Little\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
