Because none of his claims has merit, we AFFIRM Sims\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">In February 1997, based on information provided by cooperating individual Jeff Jones (\u201cJones\u201d), Daniel Krause (\u201cKrause\u201d), a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) in Detroit, Michigan, began to investigate Sims for narcotics trafficking. On February 25,1997, in a telephone conversation that Krause recorded, Jones arranged to meet Sims at 1469 Atkinson Street. At that meeting, Jones paid Sims $3,000 in prerecorded funds for a narcotics debt and received a kilogram of cocaine on consignment. On March 7, 1997, Jones arranged in another recorded telephone conversation to make a $3,000 payment to Sims; this meeting took place at 19972 Hawthorne Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">Krause then obtained search warrants for the Atkinson and Hawthorne addresses and planned to arrest Sims. On March 11, 1997, in yet another recorded telephone conversation, Jones arranged to meet Sims at 19972 Hawthorne Street at around 4:30 p.m. At 4:45 p.m., having previously established surveillance at both houses, Krause and his team executed the search warrant at the Hawthorne address, but did not find any drugs, money, or Sims. At about this time, Sims called Sonya L. Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) at 1469 Atkinson Street and told her to \u201ctake that stuff out [of] the stove and put it in [a bag].\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 134.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thomas placed the contents of the stove<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a backpack, left the house, and started to drive away. Informed that someone was leaving the Atkinson address, Krause directed agents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>stop Thomas. Thomas\u2019s backpack was later found to contain two kilograms of cocaine and at least one bag of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">On November 18, 1999, the United States (\u201cGovernment\u201d) filed a superseding indictment against Sims, charging him with four counts: Count One, for distribution of a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); Count Two, for possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); and Counts Three and Four, for aiding and abetting in the possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Counts Three and Four charged Thomas and Sims with \u201caidfing] and abet[ting] each other.\u201d J.A. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">On February 25, 2000, Thomas pleaded guilty to use of a communication facility in furtherance of a controlled substance felony, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sims pleaded not guilty and proceeded to a jury trial, where he was convicted of all charges. On June 5, 2000, Sims filed (1) a motion for a judgment of acquittal on Counts Three and Four and (2) a motion to vacate his conviction and for a new trial on Counts One and Two, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">On October 11, 2000, the district court sentenced Sims to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, an eight-year term of supervised release on Counts One, Two, and Three, and a concurrent five-year term of supervised release on Count Four; it also ordered a special assessment of $100 on each count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Sims first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on Counts Three and Four, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove Thomas\u2019s intent to distribute the drugs that she carried out of 1469 Atkinson Street. We review such a denial de novo, asking \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>279 F.3d 372, 378 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Under <em>Jackson, </em>we \u201cview both circumstantial and direct evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We accordingly will \u201cdraw all available inferences and resolve all issues of credibility in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Salgado, </em>250 F.3d 438, 446 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 306, 151 L.Ed.2d 228 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">Counts Three and Four charged Thomas and Sims with \u201cknowingly, intentionally aidfing] and abet[ting] each other in knowingly and intentionally, and unlawfully, possessing with the intent to distribute a controlled substance.\u201d J.A. at 25-26. Because Thomas cooperated with the Government, the district court read Counts Three and Four as charging Sims with aiding and abetting Thomas, and so instructed the jury. Therefore, the primary question before us is whether Thomas\u2019s conduct violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>373 U.S. 262, 265, 83 S.Ct. 1130, 10 L.Ed.2d 335 (1963) (\u201cIt is generally recognized that there can be no conviction for aiding and abetting someone to do an innocent act.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hoffa, </em>349 F.2d 20, 40 (6th Cir.1965), <em>aff'd. </em>385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>If so, then Sims would be liable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. <em>See Standefer v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 20, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980) (\u201cWith the enactment of [\u00a7 2], ail participants in conduct violating a federal criminal statute are \u2018principals.\u2019 As such, they are punishable for their criminal conduct; the fate of other participants is irrelevant.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">At trial, Thomas testified that Sims called her on the early evening of March 11, 1997, at 1469 Atkinson Street and instructed her to remove \u201c[s]ome stuff\u2019 from the stove and put it in a particular bag. J.A. at 413. This call made her panic, especially because Sims had not given any \u201cinstruction what to do once [she] got that stuff in the bag.\u201d J.A. at 477. Although Thomas claimed during her testimony that she did not know what the \u201cstuff\u2019 was until the police told her that it was cocaine and crack, Sims appears to concede on appeal that Thomas knowingly possessed the drugs. He focuses instead on the alleged lack of evidence concerning Thomas\u2019s intent to distribute, particularly the district court\u2019s statement at trial that \u201cnowhere is there any evidence in this record \u2014 in this case \u2014 of possession with the intent to distribute on her part. All that she did was to take this \u2014 she called it \u2018stuff out of the oven, brought it down to the car, and she was apprehended.\u201d J.A. at 499.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Sims maintains that the district court\u2019s statement was tantamount to a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>that Thomas had not possessed the cocaine and crack with any intent to distribute. After reviewing the record, however, we conclude that the statement was not a binding finding. The district court expressed doubt about Thomas\u2019s intent to distribute while hearing Sims\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. In that context, the district court questioned the extent to which intent to distribute could be inferred from possession of a large quantity. After asking the prosecutor for a case on point, the district court resolved \u201cto simply take some more time to decipher this [issue],\u201d J.A. at 521, and to send the case to the jury for a verdict, which could be revisited under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 and reviewed on appeal. We believe that the district court\u2019s decision to obtain a jury verdict militates against construing the district judge\u2019s statement as an actual finding about the sufficiency of the evidence with r\u00e9spect to Thomas\u2019s intent to distribute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it appears from the guilty verdict that the jury discredited Thomas\u2019s testimony and inferred the requisite intent to distribute from her attempt to remove the cocaine and crack from the Atkinson address, which presumably would have been followed by delivery of the drugs to Sims, had Thomas not been apprehended. This inference was available to the jury, as Thomas\u2019s instructions came from Sims. <em>Cf. United States v. Jackson, </em>55 F.3d 1219, 1226 (6th Cir.) (holding that \u201cintent to distribute was shown through evidence that [a defendant] did actually \u2018distribute\u2019 the heroin by giving the package to [his co-defendant]\u201d and emphasizing that \u201c[p]roof of intent to <em>sell </em>is not required\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 926, 116 S.Ct. 328, 133 L.Ed.2d 229 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, we have held that \u201c[a]n intent to distribute [] cocaine may be inferred from the large quantity and purity of the cocaine,\u201d such as five kilograms of eighty-three percent pure cocaine. <em>Salgado, </em>250 F.3d at 446-47; <em>see also Jackson, </em>55 F.3d at 1221, 1226 (understanding a large quantity as \u201ctoo large for personal use alone,\u201d in a case involving fifty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>eighty grams of heroin). Thomas possessed at least two kilograms of cocaine and 300 grams of crack. Therefore, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Sims\u2019s convictions for aiding and abetting Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Sims argues that prejudicial spillover from the insufficient evidence for Counts Three and Four subjected him to retroactive misjoinder. \u201cRetroactive misjoinder arises when joinder of multiple counts was proper initially, but later developments ... render the initial joinder improper.\u201d <em>United States v. Aldrich, </em>169 F.3d 526, 528 (8th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). Because we have affirmed Sims\u2019s aiding and abetting convictions, this claim is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Sims claims that the district court erred in admitting three audiotapes that allegedly recorded his voice in 1997.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s admission of evidence. <em>Humphrey, </em>279 F.3d at 376; <em>see also Trepel v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 708, 716-17 (6th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 141, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) for the proposition that all evidentiary decisions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion). \u201cThe scope of this discretion has been broadly construed, and the trial court\u2019s actions are to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Humphrey, </em>279 F.3d at 376 (quotation omitted). At trial, Krause identified the voice as that of Sims on the basis of \u201cthe flow of the conversation on the tapes\u201d and his general conversation with Sims when the Government processed Sims in 1999. J.A. at 199.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Krause testified that he talked with Sims for ten to fifteen of the forty-five minutes that processing a defendant usually takes. Although Krause did not listen to the tapes again until February 2000, he remembered Sims\u2019s voice because it was \u201ca distinct type voice.\u201d J.A. at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(5), voices may be identified \u201cby opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\u201d Because Krause identified Sims\u2019s voice based upon a conversation with Sims, we hold that the admission of the audiotapes was not an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. Cooper, </em>868 F.2d 1505, 1519 (6th Cir.) (affirming the admission of voice identification testimony, where the witness spoke with the defendant \u201cfor a total of approximately 30 seconds ... [or] \u2018maybe longer,\u2019 \u201d in addition to listening to tape recordings and overhearing the defendant\u2019s conversations), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1094, 109 S.Ct. 2440, 104 L.Ed.2d 996 (1989). Sims basically believes that Krause\u2019s testimony was \u201cinherently incredible,\u201d Reply Br. at 15, but credibility deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ruinations are beyond the scope of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Sims claims that the district court deprived him of a fair trial by making \u201cdisparaging remarks to defense counsel in the presence of the jury,\u201d which \u201cwhen weighed against the lack of [admonitions] towards the government, gave the jury the impression that the judge thought the defendant\u2019s case was of little substance and somewhat of a sham.\u201d Reply Br. at 18-19. We review for harmless error objections to judicial conduct that were properly preserved and for plain error those that were not. <em>United States v. Owens, </em>159 F.3d 221, 227 (6th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 817, 120 S.Ct. 56, 145 L.Ed.2d 49 (1999). Because defense counsel did not object to the district court\u2019s remarks at trial and Sims does not \u201cargue that to do so would have exacerbated the situation,\u201d we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Tipton, </em>11 F.3d 602, 611 (6th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 U.S. 1212, 114 S.Ct. 2692, 129 L.Ed.2d 823 (1994). \u201cThe plain error doctrine mandates reversal only in exceptional circumstances and only where the error is so plain that the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In <em>United States v. Hickman, </em>592 F.2d 931 (6th Cir.1979), where we reversed and remanded for a new trial, the district court essentially became \u201ca surrogate prosecutor,\u201d making nearly constant interruptions and actually taking over the cross-examination of defense witnesses in the course of a one-day trial. <em>Id. </em>at 936. The district court also raised and sustained objections sua sponte. <em>Id. </em>at 934. Finding this conduct troubling, we specifically wondered why the district court did not \u201cwait for an objection, or ... call counsel up before him out of the hearing of the jury and admonish them if they were misbehaving or bungling an examination of a witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">In this case, the vast majority of the comments that Sims describes as disparaging were made during cross-examination, when the district court felt that defense counsel was arguing with the Government\u2019s witnesses. For example, roughly half of the district court\u2019s allegedly biased remarks came during the cross-examination of Krause. In an early instance, the prosecutor objected after defense counsel asked Krause the same question twice. Defense counsel asked the question again, and the district court warned him not to argue with the witness. When defense counsel persisted in following the same line of questioning, the district court instructed the jury to leave because he \u201cwant[ed] to have a little chat with [defense counsel].\u201d J.A. at 218. The district court then told defense counsel that he would have \u201cas much leeway as [he needed] to civilly cross-examine a witness,\u201d but that he should not shout or be argumentative. J.A. at 218-19.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So advised, defense counsel continued to repeat questions and to ignore the district court\u2019s rulings as he cross-examined Krause, which prompted the district court to ask if defense counsel was \u201ctrying to irritate me.\u201d J.A. at 259. The cross-examination of Hawes played out in a similar vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">We have held that district courts have \u201cwide discretionary control\u201d when limiting cross-examination. <em>United States v. Slone, </em>833 F.2d 595, 600-01 (6th Cir.1987) (\u201c[S]ince the extent of cross-examination is within the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the judge may reasonably determine when a subject is exhausted\u201d). Preventing defense counsel \u201cfrom belaboring his point\u201d does not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 601. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not deprive Sims of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Sims\u2019s other charges of judicial bias do not suggest the level of partiality or hostility that would be required for reversal. <em>Cf. Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (stating, in a recusal case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), that bias or partiality would not be established by \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having been confirmed as federal judges, sometimes display\u201d). Where appropriate, the district court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections and overruled the prosecutor\u2019s objections. Indeed, at one point the district court chastised the prosecutor for \u201ca lack of preparation\u201d on the consequences of Thomas\u2019s plea agreement. J.A. at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Sims\u2019s base offense level was initially calculated at 34 (for at least 3000 KG but less than 10,000 KG of marijuana equivalency), and the district court made no adjustments. With a criminal history category of IV, Sims\u2019s sentencing range was 210 to 262 months. The district court sentenced him to 262 months. Sims now argues that he was sentenced in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), where the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Sims was indicted on and convicted of offenses involving specific quantities of cocaine and crack, which an expert witness confirmed. In instructing the jury, however, the district court stated that the evidence \u201cneed not establish that the amount or quantity was exactly as alleged in the indictment, but only that a measurable amount of cocaine was, in fact, the subject of the indictment.\u201d J.A. at 547-48. Because Sims did not raise an objection in the district court,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>293 F.3d 970, (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">No error occurred in this case. The statutory maximum for offenses involving an unspecified quantity of cocaine is 360 months for \u201cany person [who] commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Because Sims was convicted in 1989 for delivery of cocaine under fifty grams, which is a felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ny, <em>see </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 333.7401(2)(a)(iv) (2001 &amp; Supp.2002), his sentence of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment was not in violation of <em>Apprendi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Finally, Sims argues that the totality of errors denied him a fair trial. This claim lacks merit and need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Sims\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-11\">. As the district court observed, \"Sims made this phone call to Thomas at the Atkinson Street house at about the same time that the DEA was executing the search warrant on the Hawthorne Street house.\u201d J.A. at 100. Although the record is too spotty to support anything other than a correlation between these two events, Sims indicates in his brief that Thomas\u2019s \u201ctestimony established that [he] ... knew that federal authorities were searching locations associated with him, and that he was actively trying to hide incriminating evidence and contraband from discovery by the authorities.\u201d Appellant's Br. at 35-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-16\">. Oral argument clarified that this stove was a heating stove in the living room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-10\">. Counts Three and Four, as they related to Thomas, were later dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b858-15\">. On November 17, 2000, the district court filed an amended judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">. It seems to us that much of the confusion in this case could have been prevented if the prosecutor had simply asked the district court to instruct the jury on finding Sims guilty as a principal as well as an aider and abettor of Thomas on Counts Three and Four. The record indicates that the district court was troubled by the conceptual anomaly of Sims\u2019s conviction for aiding and abetting when the evidence at face value did not support Thomas\u2019s guilt as a principal. Indeed, Sims was initially indicted on possession with intent to distribute the cocaine and crack found in Thomas\u2019s backpack. The superseding indictment dismissed this count and charged Sims and Thomas with \u201daid[ing] and abet[ting] each other.\u201d J.A. at 25. Although we think that it would have been advisable to charge Sims and Thomas in separate counts, we can discern how the new charge still left open the possibility that Sims was guilty as a principal. The district court, however, reached a contrary conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">[T]he indictment says that on or about March 11th, in the Eastern District of Michigan, Sonya Thomas and Deshawn Sims did knowingly and intentionally and abet - aid and abet each other in knowingly and intentionally and unlawfully possessing with the intent to distribute a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Now, granted that Sonya Thomas, who's no longer an indictee in [Count 3] or Count 4 because of the Superseding Information that was filed against her and then her plea of guilty to the Superseding Information. The only way that Count 3 and Count 4 can be read is to say that Deshawn Sims did knowingly aid and abet Sonya Thomas in knowingly and intentionally and unlawfully possessing with the intent to distribute a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">J.A. at 498-99. After contending that the district court had \u201dstart[ed] out on ... an incorrect premise\u201d and stating that the charges of \u201caid[ing] and abett[ing] each other ... mean[t] either [Thomas or Sims] could be the principal,\u201d the prosecutor argued that Counts Three and Four as they related to Sims should stand because the case was one of \"classic aiding and abetting.\u201d J.A. at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">The record before us suggests that the district court\u2019s interpretation of Counts Three and Four, which was pronounced while hearing Sims\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on those counts, was the one that prevailed at trial, even when it came time to discuss the jury instructions. We recount these facts in detail to point out that the jury could have been instructed on finding Sims guilty as a principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b859-15\">. We also note that the prosecutor stated the following at Thomas's sentencing: , \"We had no evidence that [Thomas] was involved in the drug dealing activity of Deshawn Sims, during the investigation that led up to the arrest, and the day that he called her and told her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>remove the drugs from the house is the only involvement that we knew of.\u201d J.A. at 637.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">. The district court ultimately inferred Thomas\u2019s intent to distribute from the fact that she pleaded guilty to a \"drug trafficking crime.\u201d J.A. at 105. Thomas was indicted on two drug trafficking charges - specifically, violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Nabors, </em>901 F.2d 1351, 1356 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 871, 111 S.Ct. 192, 112 L.Ed.2d 154 (1990). Thomas's guilty plea, however, appears not to have specified which \"controlled substance felony\u201d was furthered by her use of a communication facility. J.A. at 108. Sims now argues that \"the [district] court's conclusion is illogical and based upon legally impossible reasoning.\u201d Appellant's Br. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Although \"drug trafficking\u201d certainly implies distribution or at least the intent to distribute, \u201ccontrolled substance felony\u201d does not necessarily do so. <em>See, e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(a)(3) and (d)(1) (making it a felony \"for any person knowingly or intentionally to acquire or obtain possession of a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge\u201d). Therefore, despite the legal maneuvering that resulted in the Government's giving Thomas \"the benefit of the least charge [it] could have her plead to and still plead to a felony and cooperate,\u201d J.A. at 510, we will not read Thomas\u2019s guilty plea to imply anything about her intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b860-10\">. We have also defined \"distribution\u201d as including \"acts perpetrated in furtherance of a transfer or sale, such as arranging or supervising the delivery.\u201d <em>United States v. Colon, </em>268 F.3d 367, 377 (6th Cir.2001). It is thus arguable that the jury inferred Thomas\u2019s intent to distribute from her attempt to further the future transfer or sale of the cocaine and crack kept in the stove at the Atkinson address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. Sims rather briefly asserts that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to use \u201crough transcripts of the[] tapes.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 43. He makes no further argument. Because the district court read the transcripts against the tapes and \"found the transcripts to be accurate and trustworthy,\" J.A. at 101; <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>707 F.2d 872, 876 (6th Cir. 1983), and also gave the required cautionary instruction to the jury, <em>see United States v. Segines, </em>17 F.3d 847, 854 (6th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 908, 117 S.Ct. 269, 136 L.Ed.2d 192 (1996), we hold that the district court did not err in allowing the jury to use the transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b861-14\">. Because the tapes at issue were admitted into evidence during Krause\u2019s testimony, the later testimony of other Government witnesses is not relevant to determining whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting the tapes when it did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">. We think that this discussion, which took place when the jury was not in the courtroom, sufficiently addresses our concern in <em>Hickman </em>about district courts that admonish counsel in front of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. At sentencing, defense counsel took issue with the fact that the presentence report held Sims accountable for \u201c354.7 grams of cocaine base.\u201d J.A. at 656, 677. His objection was to type rather than quantity: \u201c[M]y position is that, unless there is something I\u2019m missing here, I believe that the \u25a0\u2014 the chemist identified both items as containing cocaine hydrochloride,\u201d or cocaine. J.A. at 659-60. After the prosecutor quoted testimony from the chemist distinguishing the two types of cocaine that had been admitted into evidence and assured defense counsel that \u201c[t]he chemist testified as to the chemical analysis that he performed on each of those exhibits,\u201d J.A. at 664, defense counsel withdrew his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Sims argues that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object on <em>Apprendi </em>grounds denied him the right to effective assistance of counsel. However, because such a claim is reviewed more appropriately in a post-conviction proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 than on direct appeal, we will not address the merits of Sims\u2019s claim at this time. <em>See United States v. Crowe, </em>291 F.3d 884, 886 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b864-8\">STAFFORD, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AbC\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">I agree with the result reached by the majority and would affirm.
