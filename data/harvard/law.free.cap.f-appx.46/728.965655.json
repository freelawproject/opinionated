We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-12\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed.
