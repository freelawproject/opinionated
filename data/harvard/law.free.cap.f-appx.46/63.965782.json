Simms pled guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to a superseding information charging two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3). Simms was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">He did not file a timely appeal, but moved for an extension of time to file his notice of appeal. The District Court denied the motion and also denied his motion for reconsideration. Simms appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The District Court\u2019s judgment sentencing Simms to 120 months imprisonment was entered on the docket on October 16, 2000. Simms had ten days from the entry of judgment on the docket, or until October 26, in which to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)\u00ae, 4(b)(6). Simms concededly missed the deadline, and instead filed pro se a \u201cRequest for Leave to File Out of Time Appeal\u201d on November 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Under the applicable federal rule, a district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal by up to thirty days \u201c[u]pon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). In his first motion, Simms stated that he \u201cbelieves that there is excusable neglect sufficient to invoke the rule. He alleges that neglect is reflected in defense counsel\u2019s failure to file the requested notice.\u201d He requested \u201cleave in the interest of fairness and justice.\u201d On December 8, 2000, the District Court issued an order denying Simms\u2019 request \u201cfor failure to demonstrate good cause or excusable neglect\u201d (the December order).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Simms filed a notice of appeal from the December order, which was marked as filed in the District Court on December 20, 2000. On December 19, 2000, Smith, again pro se, filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider Denial of Request for Leave to File Out of Time Appeal,\u201d asserting that he was sentenced beyond the statutory maximum, that his notice of appeal was filed eleven days outside of the normal ten-day period, and that there was no potential impact on the judicial proceedings since his notice of appeal was filed within the allotted thirty-day period. Simms also included among his reasons that his \u201cNotice of Appeal was filed in good faith and the reason for the delay was beyond [his] control ... whereas [he] was being held at York County Immigration Detention Center where access to law books, typewriters, copy machines, and other necessities were unavailable making it impossible for inmates within that detention center to get to courts on a timely basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">On January 18, 2001, the District Court denied Simms\u2019 motion for reconsideration, again giving no reason (the January order). Thereafter, in denying Simms\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis, the District Court gave some indication of its view of a potential appeal, stating both that, \u201cAt sentencing, defendant did not object to the guideline range calculation of 120 months\u201d and that, \u201cThere is no good faith basis to support an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Simms filed an amended notice of appeal of the December and January orders, dated January 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. The government argues we lack jurisdiction to consider the District Court\u2019s order at all, citing <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>593 F.2d 230 (3d Cir.1979). In McKnight, this court held it was without jurisdiction to remand to the district court where that court had made no determination on good cause or excusable neglect whatsoever, despite the tardy filing of a notice of appeal. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>dismissed the case without prejudice to permit the appellant to apply to the district court for a ruling on that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 233. We were motivated by concern lest the district court on remand determine that there had been no excusable neglect, which would have led to the intolerable result that this court would have been \u201cat all times without jurisdiction over the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232 n. 6. Here by contrast, the District Court has already decided the extension issue. Furthermore, because Simms filed a timely notice of appeal following the District Court\u2019s denial of Simms\u2019 motion for reconsideration, specifying both the denial of the extension and the denial of reconsideration, the court\u2019s denial of the extension is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We review the District Court\u2019s order denying the extension for abuse of discretion. <em>Consolidated Freightways Corp. v. Larson, </em>827 F.2d 916, 918 (3d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Simms argues that we should remand to the District Court because that court\u2019s December 8 order denying his motion for an extension, which was filed within the requisite 30 days, did not make factual findings on whether the default resulted from excusable neglect or good cause. In support, he cites primarily unreported decisions of other circuits. We do not recognize unreported decisions as the basis for our rulings, even though they emanate from courts whose opinions merit respect. On the other hand, we have previously explained that we will accord more deference to discretionary decisions of the district courts when they provide a statement of reasons so that we have a basis to determine whether the district court soundly exercised its discretion. <em>See United States v. Criden, </em>648 F.2d 814, 819 (3d Cir.1981). Indeed, in <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>522 F.2d 1367, 1369 (5th Cir.1975), the court of appeals, faced with a similar situation, remanded, stating: \u201cThe record before us and the court\u2019s written order does not, however, provide us with any means of effectively reviewing the court\u2019s ultimate determination of no excusable neglect. We therefore remand this matter to the district court to conduct proceedings as to the question of excusable neglect and to make written findings supportive of its ultimate conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Nonetheless, Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4) does not require that a district court explain why it denied the motion, and we are not prepared to use this case to exercise our supervisory power to require an explanation each time a district court denies such a motion. On the other hand, if the district court based its denial on an impermissible consideration, that would be a basis to remand so that the district court can reconsider its ruling. As we previously noted, there is some indication on the record, albeit not in the District Court\u2019s brief rulings on the motion for an extension and the motion for reconsideration, that the District Court may have been influenced by its view that Simms\u2019 appeal would have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The standard in Rule 4 does not include the potential merits of the appeal in the concept of excusable neglect. The merits, if any, of the appeal are for this court to determine. Of course, it would be difficult to find that an appeal frivolous on its face is supported by good cause. In this case, however, Simms\u2019 claim that he was sentenced beyond the statutory maximum is not frivolous on its face, although it may ultimately prove meritless. We note that in our experience district courts do not generally deny pro se appellants permission for a direct appeal in a criminal case when the defendant has been sentenced to a considerable prison term and has filed the request for an extension within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>thirty days. Under our system of justice, we do not lightly pretermit a defendant\u2019s right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">For the reasons set forth, we will remand this matter to the District Court for reconsideration of the order denying Simms\u2019 motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
