We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of whether defendant is a minor or minimal participant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, <em>United States v. Madera-Gallegos, </em>945 F.2d 264, 269 (9th Cir.1991), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Gonzalez-Pena contends that the district court erred by refusing to give him a four-level downward adjustment for \u201cminimal\u201d participation, instead of the two-level downward adjustment for \u201cminor\u201d participation. \u201cThe defendant has the burden of proving that he is entitled to a downward adjustment based on his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436 (9th Cir.1994). Contrary to Gonzalez-Pena\u2019s contentions, the district court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. <em>See MaderaGallegos, 945 </em>F.2d at 269 (concluding that wife and partner of heroin dealer was a minor, but not minimal participant where she retrieved a drug sample, and gave it to her husband, who gave it to the undercover agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
