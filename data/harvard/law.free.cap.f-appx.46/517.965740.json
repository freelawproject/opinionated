We have jurisdiction pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Kovac contends that the district court erred in finding that he was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because it relied on a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) without a statutory reference to determine that he had a prior qualifying \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">We conclude, and the government concedes, that Kovac is correct. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>235 F.3d 1165, 1172-73 (9th Cir.2000) (deciding that the PSR, which did not indicate statute of conviction, was insufficient to enhance a sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)); <em>United States v. Sandovalr-Venegas, </em>292 F.3d 1101, 1109 (9th Cir. 2002) (remanding for resentencing after finding that \u201cthe record [did] not contain sufficient documentation to discern a qualifying statute of conviction, much less judicially noticeable, case-specific facts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Accordingly, we vacate Kovac\u2019s sentence and remand this case on an open record to permit the district court to determine whether Kovac\u2019s prior \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d is a qualifying felony under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (stating that \u201cif a district court errs in sentencing, [this court] will remand for resentencing on an open record that is, without limitation on the evidence that the district court may consider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
