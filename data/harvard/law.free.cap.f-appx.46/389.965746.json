Ballard appeals his 24-month sentence for conviction of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1344 (2000). Ballard contends the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> should not have held him liable for the entire amount of the loss caused by the conspiracy ($64,591.55), but only for the $7,800 loss he directly caused. We disagree. The total loss of $64,591.55 resulted from \u201creasonably foreseeable acts ... of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (2001). Ballard \u201c \u2018benefited from his co-conspirator\u2019s activities,\u2019 \u201d he \u201c \u2018demonstrated a substantial level of commitment to the conspiracy,\u2019 \u201d and he knew the \u201cacts of fraud committed by [one other co-conspirator] were remarkably similar\u201d to his own. <em>United States v. Bad Wound, </em>203 F.3d 1072, 1076-77 (8th Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>148 F.3d 1003, 1008 (8th Cir.1998)). Thus, the district court did not commit error when it held Ballard responsible for the entire loss caused by the conspiracy and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Ballard raises two additional arguments. First, he argues the district court should have sentenced him as a minor participant. Having reviewed the district court\u2019s factual findings about Ballard\u2019s role in the conspiracy, we conclude the findings are free from clear error. <em>See United States v. Fellers, </em>285 F.3d 721, 726 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review). Second, Ballard contends the district court committed error by ordering his sentence to run consecutively to-rather than concurrently with-a Missouri sentence for second-degree burglary. <em>United States v. Plumley, </em>207 F.3d 1086, 1093 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review). When Ballard participated in the bank fraud conspiracy, he was on conditional release from serving his sentence for burglary; the conspiracy conviction caused the conditional release to be revoked. In this situation, the district court acted properly when it determined the two sentences should run consecutively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, cmt. n. 6 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm Ballard\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> The Honorable Ortrie D.
