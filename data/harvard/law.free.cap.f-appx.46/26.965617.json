In return for $15,000, Matagrano entered into a stipulated order of discontinuance with the City of New York and related defendants. Then, in exchange for a payment of $10,000, Matagrano entered into a stipulated order of discontinuance with defendant-appellees Salvation Army and Sheri Hite, which the district court so-ordered on December 3,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">In August 2001, Matagrano filed a notice of appeal from the December 3,1999 stipulated order of discontinuance, alleging a due process violation because defendants did not answer his interrogatories, reasserting his allegation of deprivation of medical care, and claiming his amended complaint was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">We do not reach the merits of Matagrano\u2019s claims because they are barred by his stipulation. By its express terms, the stipulated order terminated the action and released appellees \u201cfrom any and all liability, claims, or rights of action arising out of the events alleged in the complaint in this action.\u201d Having freely entered into that bargain, Matagrano will not now be heard to reopen this litigation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
