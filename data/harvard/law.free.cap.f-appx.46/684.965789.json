The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we write only for the parties and the District Court, who are familiar with the circumstances of this litigation, we need not recite the factual or procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305; <em>see also Monsour Medical Ctr. v. Heckler, </em>806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir.1986). We have reviewed the thoughtful Report and Recommendations of the Magistrate Judge which the District Court approved and adopted, as well as the record submitted in this matter. We agree with the conclusions of the Magistrate Judge and the District Court that substantial evidence on the record supports the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusion that Jimenez is not disabled within the meaning of the Act. In particular, we believe that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that Appellant possesses the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work, and therefore has the ability to perform work as a cashier, assembler, or sorter, and the ALJ\u2019s discrediting of the Appellant\u2019s testimony and the testimony of Appellant\u2019s treating physician are all supported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Moreover, because Appellant raised the argument that she is entitled to a closed period of disability for the first time in her objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendations, and not in her opening brief, we deem this argument waived. <em>See Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of N.A. v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order granting summary judgment to the Commissioner substantially for the reasons stated in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
