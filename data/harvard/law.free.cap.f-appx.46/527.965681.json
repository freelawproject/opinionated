R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b575-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">Joe Jimenez appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of his employer and the order dismissing his claims against his union in his employment discrimination action. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">The district court did not err by dismissing Jimenez\u2019s claims against his union because it appears, beyond doubt, that Jimenez can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief on his claims of discrimination and breach of the duty of fair representation. <em>See Morley v. Walker, </em>175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-20\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Jimenez\u2019s discriminatory termination claim because he did not present sufficient evidence that his employer\u2019s reasons for terminating him were a pretext for racial discrimination. <em>See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217,1221-22 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Jimenez\u2019s discrimination in promotions claim because Jimenez failed to provide evidence that his employer denied him a promotion. <em>See Warren v. City of Carlsbad, </em>58 F.3d 439, 442 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Jimenez\u2019s hostile work environment claim because Jimenez failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment. <em>See Pavon v. Swift Transp. Co., Inc., </em>192 F.3d 902, 908 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">We deny Jimenez\u2019s motion filed April 29, 2002, seeking reconsideration of the order denying his motion for certified signatures. We also deny Jimenez\u2019s motion filed August 9, 2002, demanding a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">Jimenez\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
