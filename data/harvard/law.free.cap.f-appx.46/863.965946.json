Meister appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits. After a careful review of the record, <em>see Mittlestedt v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 847, 850-51 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-21\">Meister, whose insured status expired in September 1990, applied for benefits in May 1998, alleging disability since September 1987 from irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and pain and other symptoms related to a neck injury. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that during the relevant period (September 1987 to September 1990), Meister could not perform her past relevant work, but that she could perform the jobs identified by a vocational expert in response to a hypothetical that the ALJ posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">Meister\u2019s main argument is that she was prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s consideration of records outside the relevant period, particularly psychiatrist Steven Chang\u2019s 1998 summary of Meister\u2019s treatment and mental condition from 1989 to 1998. This argument is belied by the ALJ\u2019s specific statement that the evidence after Meister\u2019s date last insured had \u201cbeen given little notice,\u201d and there is no indication that the ALJ based his findings as to Meister\u2019s condition during the relevant period on records pertaining to Meister\u2019s condition after September 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">Meister also asserts that the ALJ improperly discredited her testimony. We defer to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tion, however, because he gave multiple valid reasons for doing so. <em>See Hogan v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 958, 962 (8th Cir.2001) (deference to ALJ\u2019s opinion is appropriate where ALJ explicitly discredits claimant and gives good reason for doing so). Among other things, neurologist Michael Laws recommended a fifteen-pound lifting restriction after (not before, as Meister contends) she unsuccessfully attempted to complete work-hardening programs; moreover, Dr. Laws made the recommendation after conducting numerous diagnostic tests and treating Meister for more than a year. <em>See Chamberlain v. Shalala, </em>47 F.3d 1489, 1494 (8th Cir.1995) (treating physician\u2019s opinion must be supported by medically accepted clinical or diagnostic data).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Meister argues that the ALJ erred by discounting Dr. Chang\u2019s 1999 opinion as to her mental residual functional capacity, but Dr. Chang did not state whether his findings related to the relevant period. Further, Dr. Chang\u2019s 1998 summary \u2014 on which the ALJ did rely to the extent that it described Meister\u2019s condition before September 1990 \u2014 indicated resolution of Meister\u2019s depression during the relevant period, whenever she took antidepressants. <em>See Roth v. Shalala, </em>45 F.3d 279, 282 (8th Cir.1995) (if impairment can be controlled by treatment or medication, it cannot be considered disabling).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We reject Meister\u2019s remaining arguments as well: the ALJ was not required to contact the lay references Meister provided or to obtain a consultative examination, <em>see Haley v. Massanari, </em>258 F.3d 742, 749-50 (8th Cir.2001) (ALJ may issue decision without obtaining added medical evidence if existing evidence provides sufficient basis for decision), and the ALJ considered the combined effect of Meister\u2019s impairments, as required, <em>see Hajek v. Shalala, </em>30 F.3d 89, 92 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-17\">. The Honorable Ronald E. Longstaff, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
