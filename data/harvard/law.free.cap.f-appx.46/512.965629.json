Alexander, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the denial of a habeas petition, <em>see Bribiesca v. Galaza, </em>215 F.3d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">Alexander contends that the trial court erred by denying his section 2254 petition because his removal from the courtroom led to the denial of his right to be present at trial and his right to counsel.1 We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">Upon review of the record, we affirm the district court because any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence against Alexander, and he has failed to demonstrated how his removal prejudiced him. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (establishing that trial errors must have had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d), <em>Bains v. Cambra, </em>204 F.3d 964, 977 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the <em>Brecht </em>harmless error applies in all federal habeas corpus cases under \u00a7 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-32\">1. We decline to address Alexander\u2019s claims that fall outside the scope of the COA issued by the district court on July 14, 2000. <em>See Hiivala </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b560-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
