We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">On February 3, 2000, a judgment was entered against Soto imposing a 169-month sentence. We subsequently dismissed his appeal as untimely on July 20, 2000. Soto then filed a pro se motion in district court captioned: <em>\u201cMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT IN THE INSTANT MATTER BASED UPON LACK OF JURISDICTION. THIS IS A CRIMINAL CASE MOTION AND IS NOT, AND SHOULD NOT, BE CONSTRUED BY THE COURT AS A PETITION FOR RELIEF PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">Soto contends the district court erred by failing to construe the filing as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. In <em>United States v. Seesing, </em>234 F.3d 456, 464 (9th Cir.2001), we stated that \u201c[w]hen presented with a pro se motion that could be recharacterized as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion a district court should not so recharacterize the motion unless: (a) the pro se prisoner, with knowledge of the potential adverse consequences of such a recharacterization, consents or (b) the district court finds that because of the relief sought that the motion should be recharacterized as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and offers the pro se prisoner the opportunity, after informing the prisoner of the consequences of recharacterization, to withdraw the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-22\">The district court was not required to engage in this inquiry, however, because Soto stated on the face of his motion that it was not to be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition. In the alternative, the district court was correct to construe the filing as a motion to arrest judgment pursuant to Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion as untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 34; <em>Baker v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 1278, 1279 (9th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-23\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b529-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
