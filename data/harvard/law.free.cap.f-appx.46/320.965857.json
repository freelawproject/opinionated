This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">On November 7, 2000, the voters of Jefferson County, Kentucky, approved House Bill 647 (\u201cHB647\u201d) merging the governments of Jefferson County and the City of Louisville. <em>See </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 67C.101. The plaintiffs bring this action against the defendant, Commonwealth of Kentucky, seeking a declaration that HB 647 is unconstitutional and in violation of certain Kentucky statutes. Plaintiff Cobble filed a similar action in Jefferson Circuit Court on September 29, 2000 (the \u201cOriginal Circuit Complaint\u201d). The Original Circuit Complaint also alleged that HB 647 is unconstitutional and in violation of various statutory provisions. Cobble later sought to amend this complaint to add two additional causes of action, three other plaintiffs, and certification as a class action (the \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d). In <em>Cobble v. Commonwealth of Ky., </em>No. 00CI6302 (Jefferson Cir. Ct. Feb. 5, 2001) <em>(\u201cCobble I </em>\u201d), the Jefferson Circuit Court dismissed with prejudice both the Original Circuit Complaint and the Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-21\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the present complaint on the grounds of res judicata and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). In a memorandum opinion and order entered July 24, 2001, the district court agreed with the defendant and dismissed all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims with the exception of Count IV which alleges a violation of the Voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973, et seq. In an order entered December 12, 2001, the district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to voluntarily dismiss Count IV. The December 12, 2001, order was corrected to reflect that the dismissal of Count IV is without prejudice. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>dismissals for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Greater Detroit Res. Recovery Auth. v. United States EPA, </em>916 F.2d 317, 319 (6th Cir.1990). A district court\u2019s decision with regard to res judicata is reviewed de novo. <em>See Black v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc., </em>15 F.3d 573, 582 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Upon review, we conclude that all of the elements of res judicata have been met in this case. <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979); <em>Yeoman v. Commonwealth, Health Policy Bd., </em>983 S.W.2d 459, 465 (Ky.1998). Further, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are also precluded by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482 &amp; n. 16; <em>Rooker, </em>263 U.S. at 415-16. A fair reading of the complaint reveals that the plaintiffs\u2019 federal case is essentially an appeal of the state court judgment as it merely raises specific claims regarding decisions of the Jefferson Circuit Court wherein the plaintiffs are the recipient of adverse rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
