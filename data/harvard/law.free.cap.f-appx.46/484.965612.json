We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s November 13, 2000, order denying Vasquez\u2019s motion to expunge because her notice of appeal, filed on November 30, 2001, was untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4. We have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Vasquez\u2019s petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-18\">Vasquez contends the district court erred in denying her petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>because she had valid reasons for not attacking her sentence earlier. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of her petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>on the basis of laches for abuse of discretion. <em>Telink, Inc. v. United States, </em>24 F.3d 42, 47-48 (9th Cir.1994). To obtain <em>coram nobis </em>relief, Vasquez must show: \u201c(1) a more usual remedy is not available; (2) valid reasons exist for not attacking the conviction earlier; (3) adverse consequences exist from the conviction sufficient to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of Article III; and (4) the error is of the most fundamental character.\u201d <em>See United States v. McClelland, </em>941 F.2d 999, 1002 (9th Cir. 1991). Upon our review of the record, we conclude that Vasquez\u2019s approximately eight-year delay was unreasonable, and the government would be sufficiently prejudiced by the delay. <em>See Telink, </em>24 F.3d at 48 (concluding that but-for the petitioner\u2019s five-year delay, the government would have preserved its case, allowing reprosecution, if necessary, to occur earlier). The district court, therefore, properly denied Vasquez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b532-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
