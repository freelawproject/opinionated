We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-28\">Lopez-Sepulveda argues that he was merely an unknowing drug courier and had little involvement or decisionmaking authority in any drug conspiracy. However, just because \u201ca defendant acted as a drug courier does not mean his role was minimal or minor.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436-37 (9th Cir. 1994); <em>see also United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 770 (9th Cir.2000). The evidence supported the district court\u2019s determination that he was more than a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>courier; at the time of his arrest he was driving alone in a truck he owned, which contained drugs concealed in a specially built compartment in the gas tank behind a trap door. The district court did not credit Lopez-Sepulveda\u2019s professions of ignorance or attempts to blame others for the drugs, and we must defer to such credibility determinations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Merino, </em>190 F.3d 956, 957 (9th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While it may not be clear precisely what LopezSepulveda\u2019s role was, he did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his role was minor. <em>See Ajala v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>997 F.2d 651, 657 (9th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err when it held he was not entitled to a minor role adjustment. <em>See Hursh, </em>217 F.3d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b935-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b936-15\">. The district court did not err in considering evidence of other non-offense conduct in determining his role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Duran, </em>15 F.3d 131, 133 (9th Cir. 1994); U.S.S.G. ch. 3, pt B, introductory cmt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
