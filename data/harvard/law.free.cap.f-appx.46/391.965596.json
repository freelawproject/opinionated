Upon our review of the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, <em>see United States v. Sturgis, </em>238 F.3d 956, 958 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2022 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 182, 151 L.Ed.2d 127 (2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The district court did not clearly err in finding, under the totality of the circumstances, that Brown\u2019s purported request to use the telephone to call counsel was not an unambiguous request for counsel to be present during Brown\u2019s subsequent interview with police, and that Brown voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during the questioning by signing a waiver-of-rights form after twice being advised of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). Nor did the court clearly err in concluding under the totality of the circumstances that Brown\u2019s consent to search was not made involuntary by his alleged use of drugs earlier in the evening. <em>See United States v. Gipp, </em>147 F.3d 680, 685-86 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Brown also argues that the search was illegal because the police officers who conducted it were acting outside their territorial jurisdiction. This argument overlooks important facts. The suppression-hearing testimony shows that a drug agent with federal authority in drug cases participated in obtaining Brown\u2019s consent to the search, he thereafter entered Brown\u2019s residence with Brown and the police officers, he actively engaged in the search, and he remained on the premises until the search was complete. Brown\u2019s lack-of-jurisdiction argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Finally, we reject Brown\u2019s cumulative-error argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\">. The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
