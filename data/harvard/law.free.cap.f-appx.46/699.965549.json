Leslie appeals the sentence of forty-six months imprisonment he received after his guilty plea to an information charging conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). He contends that the district court erred by increasing his offense level for relevant conduct, that is, additional drug quantities beyond the 25.5 grams of methamphetamine seized at his arrest. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1B1.2, 2D1.1 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Leslie received a two-level reduction in offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) because he met the criteria for a safety valve reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2000). He argues that, by enacting the safety valve provision in \u00a7 3553(f), Congress intended to limit the sentencing court\u2019s discretion to impose a sentence outside the guideline range as initially determined by the base offense level and criminal history category. Leslie asserts that a defendant who meets the criteria for a safety valve reduction must be sentenced without any increase in offense level due to consideration of relevant conduct. Because Leslie did not make this claim in the district court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Glano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Leslie relies on the language in \u00a7 3553(f) which states, \u201cthe court shall impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission under section 994 of title 28 without regard to any statutory minimum sentence\u201d if the court finds that the defendant meets the prescribed criteria. Leslie states that this language \u201cexplicitly repealed any statutory minimum based on [drug] volume,\u201d and \u201calso implicitly abolished any statutory maximum other than that specified in the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d He offers no authority for this reading of \u00a7 3553(f). Section 994 of title 28 permits a sentence within the sentencing guideline range when the range is lower than a statutory minimum, but does not suggest that the guideline range should be determined in any manner that is different from the normal operation of the sentencing guidelines, which always includes relevant conduct, where pertinent, in the calculation of the offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Leslie further argues that, for defendants who qualify for a safety valve reduction, the guideline range is the \u201csole statutory reference for sentencing.\u201d He defines the guideline range in this context as the range determined solely by the base offense level, increased for drug quantity derived from the offense of conviction and other adjustments. But he insists that any additional drug quantities that increase the offense level, i.e., that are derived from relevant conduct, must be charged in the indictment, and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Leslie\u2019s position is clearly in conflict with our precedent. <em>See United, States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that \u201cthe relevant \u2018maximum\u2019 under <em>Apprendi </em>is found on the face of the statute rather than in the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). Consequently, Leslie has not shown that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>district court\u2019s use of relevant conduct to increase his offense level and guideline range was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Leslie initially argued that the increase in his offense level based on uncharged relevant conduct violated the rule set out in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). However, in his reply brief, he concedes that the Supreme Court rejected his argument in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (holding that brandishing is sentencing factor for offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)). Therefore, we need not address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
