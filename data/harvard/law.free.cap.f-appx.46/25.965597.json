Crawford, a prison inmate, appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant-appellees on Crawford\u2019s complaint asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985. Following <em>de novo </em>review of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court adopted the report and recommendation. The court granted summary judgment to the defendants on Crawford\u2019s claim that he was denied ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>cess to the courts because defendants Lyder and Blaetz interfered with his legal mail and with his request for information about who processed his legal mail. Crawford did not claim that any meritorious pending legal action was adversely affected by Lyder\u2019s alleged interference with his mail, or by Blaetz\u2019s failure to provide him more quickly with the identity of the clerk who processed his mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The district court also granted summary judgment to the defendants on Crawford\u2019s claim that Sergeant Keyser acted with deliberate indifference to his safety by sending another inmate with whom Crawford had previously fought to Crawford\u2019s cell-block; Crawford and the other inmate subsequently got into another fight. The court found that the defendants were not on notice of any threat to Crawford\u2019s safety because the evidence showed that they were not aware of the first fight until after the second fight had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On Crawford\u2019s claim that the defendants retaliated against him for filing grievances and lawsuits, the court granted summary judgment because Crawford offered no evidence, beyond conclusory allegations, that any of the defendants\u2019 actions were motivated by retaliation. Finally, the district court granted summary judgement to the defendants on Crawford\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to violate his civil rights. The court found that Crawford\u2019s conclusory allegations were insufficient to survive defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, and that Crawford had not shown that any of his constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We affirm for substantially the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
