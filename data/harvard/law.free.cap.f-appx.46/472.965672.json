We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-27\">Lang contends that his sentence was imposed in violation of the rule announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment failed to allege a specific quantity of cocaine. Lang further contends that his motion is not time barred because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s one year statute of limitations period began to run from the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi, </em>as a newly recognized right pursuant to \u00a7 2255(3). Finally, Lang contends that his claims are not procedurally defaulted because the constitutional right recognized by <em>Apprendi </em>was so novel that he could not reasonably have been expected to raise it below or on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Lang\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664, 671 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on initial collateral review). Since <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactive on collateral review, we need not address Lang\u2019s cause and prejudice arguments or his timeliness argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b520-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
