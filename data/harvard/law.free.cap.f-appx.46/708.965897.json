Slater\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he was not aware of any meritorious issues for appeal, but raising three issues: (1) the district court abused its discretion by revoking Slater\u2019s probation and sentencing him to twenty months\u2019 imprisonment; (2) the district court committed plain error by not specifying the schedule of restitution payments in its order; and (3) the district court committed plain error by failing to give explicit notice of Slater\u2019s right to be represented by counsel at his revocation hearing. Slater has also filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging the district court erred in sentencing him and challenging the legality of his original indictment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Upon finding a probation violation, the district court may revoke probation and resentence the defendant to any sentence within the statutory maximum for the original offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>120 F.3d 505, 507 (4th Cir.1997). The uncontroverted evidence established that Slater violated several conditions of his probation. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the five-year maximum for Slater\u2019s original offense, it did not abuse its discretion in revoking his probation and sentencing him to twenty months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Next, Slater argues the district court erred in failing to specify the schedule in which restitution should be paid in its restitution order. We conclude the district court\u2019s oral restitution order in conjunction with both written judgments of conviction meets the requirements set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f) (2000) and the guidelines set forth by this Court in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71 (4th Cir.1996). Therefore, Slater\u2019s argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Counsel also asserts that the district court \u201cconceivably erred\u201d by failing to advise Slater of his right to counsel, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(a)(2). However, Slater was represented by court-appointed counsel at his revocation hearing and, therefore, any error in failing to advise him in accordance with Rule 32.1(a)(2) was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">Finally, Slater\u2019s pro se supplemental brief raises several issues challenging the legality of his original indictment and his sentence. Slater\u2019s original judgment and conviction was entered in April 2000 based upon his guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement. He did not appeal either his conviction or sentence. He has therefore waived appellate review of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and conclude that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
