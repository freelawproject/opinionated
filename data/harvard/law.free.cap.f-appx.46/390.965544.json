Bell appeals from the revocation of his supervised release and 36-month prison sentence entered in the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following his arrest for aggravated assault in Kansas City, Missouri, on November 9, 2001. Bell argues that the court abused its discretion by departing upward from the recommended 6-12 month sentencing range in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), and by failing to consider his claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">We find no abuse of discretion. We have consistently held that \u201cthe policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines regarding supervised release violations are advisory to, rather than binding on, the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>203 F.3d 557, 558 (8th Cir.2000). And although a sentencing court is required to consider the guidelines, \u201cit is entirely free to impose a revocation sentence outside of the policy statement\u2019s suggested range when, \u2018in its considered discretion,\u2019 such a sentence is warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>283 F.3d 966, 968 (8th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Carr, </em>66 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir.1995)). Ultimately, sentencing is governed by statute and, absent an abuse of discretion, \u201cwe will not disturb a sentence imposed within the bounds of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the statutory provision detailing parameters for modification or revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995)). Pursuant to that provision, the district court properly considered the seriousness of Bell\u2019s offense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> revoked the three-year supervised release based on a preponderance of evidence that he had violated its terms, and sentenced him \u201cto serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">We likewise reject Bell\u2019s self-defense argument. When the district court is the finder of fact, we must uphold its findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. R.E.J., </em>29 F.3d 375, 375 (8th Cir.1994). In order to prevail on a self-defense claim, a defendant must produce enough evidence to convince the fact finder that \u201che used that amount of force that he reasonably believed was necessary to protect himself\u2019 from the attack. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>237 F.3d 942, 945 (8th Cir.2001). The evidence presented by Bell at the sentencing hearing was insufficient to satisfy this burden. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\">. The court found, and the evidence showed, that Bell stabbed at least one nightclub bouncer with a steak-knife blade and bit another person in the back before declaring, \"I killed you. I am HIV positive.\u201d (Sen. Tr. at 27).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
