Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum, and we must uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">Lin testified that he was expelled from high school and detained by police for five days, without being physically harmed, because he posted handbills in support of the anti-government movement. He also testified that he was asked to resign from his job because he participated in a worker\u2019s strike, and had difficulty finding another job. Because this evidence does not compel the conclusion that Lin was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground, the BIA\u2019s determination that Lin failed to establish eligibility for asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Acewicz v. INS, </em>984 F.2d 1056, 1061-62 (9th Cir. 1993). It follows that he failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See id. </em>at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
