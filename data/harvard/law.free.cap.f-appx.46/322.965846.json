The parties have waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In 1999, a jury convicted Sauceda of conspiracy to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Sauceda to 240 months of imprisonment. On appeal, this court affirmed Sauceda\u2019s convictions, but vacated his sentence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>253 F.3d 251 (6th Cir.2001). On remand, the district court resentenced Sauceda to 120 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, and the court imposed a $5000 fine and a $200 special assessment. In this timely appeal, Sauceda argues that the district court erred by imposing the sentences on his two counts of conviction to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Upon review, we conclude that Sauceda\u2019s argument is without merit. It is undisputed that Sauceda had a Sentencing Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months of imprisonment. However, in the prior appeal, this court determined that, pursuant to the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, the five-year statutory maximum sentence set forth at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(B)(1)(D) was applicable to Sauceda\u2019s convictions. <em>Martinez, </em>253 F.3d at 255. Upon remand, the district court, in an effort to have Sauceda\u2019s sentence approximate the Guidelines range as closely as possible, sentenced Sauceda to five years of imprisonment on both of his convictions, with the sentences to run consecutively, for a total sentence of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">The district court did not err in imposing Sauceda\u2019s sentences to run consecutively. Under USSG \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the district court was required to run the sentences consecutively because the highest statutory maximum on one count was less than the total punishment envisioned by the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Graham, </em>275 F.3d 490, 523-24 (6th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1625, 152 L.Ed.2d 636 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Further, this court implicitly approved the imposition of consecutive sentences in its prior opinion. This court noted that, on remand, \u201cif the district court opts to run the sentences for both counts consecutively, the total punishment that will result is 10 years\u201d of imprisonment. <em>Martinez, </em>253 F.3d at 251 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Lastly, the imposition of consecutive sentences does not violate the dictates of the <em>Apprendi </em>decision. Since Sauceda was convicted of multiple counts, the prescribed statutory maximum for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the sum of the statutory maximum sentences for each of the counts upon which Sauceda was convicted. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>279 F.3d 392, 401 (6th Cir.2002). Therefore, the prescribed statutory maximum sentence for Sauceda is 120 months of imprisonment. Because his sentence did not exceed this amount, his <em>Apprendi </em>rights are not triggered. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
