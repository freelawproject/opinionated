We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Varela v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1237, 1239 (9th Cir.2000). We review issues of law de novo. <em>Id. </em>We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-24\">Mora-Flores concedes that she received two written notices of her removal hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Together the notices met all the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(l)(A)-(G), including providing the \u201ctime and place at which the proceeding will be held\u201d and a warning of the consequences for failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Mora-Flores cites no authority supporting her contention that the notice was inadequate because she received the required information in two separate documents. We therefore conclude that MoraFlores received notice in compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(l)(A)-(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We decline to hear Mora-Flores\u2019s contention that she did not understand the notice because this issue was not presented to the BIA. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
