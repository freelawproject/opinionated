We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s credibility findings for substan-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tial evidence and uphold an adverse credibility finding unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Singh-Kawr v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1999). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The inconsistencies in the record go to the heart of Xea\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination and its conclusion that Xea is ineligible for asylum is therefore supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In failing to qualify for asylum, Xea necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Because Xea did not present evidence establishing that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed\u201d to China, the BIA properly rejected his claim under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279,1284 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
