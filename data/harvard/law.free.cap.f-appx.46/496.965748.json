R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny appellant's October 11, 2001 \"motion for enlargement of time to present motion setting forth reasons why oral argument should be heard.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Isaac Griggs, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Schell v. Witek, </em>218 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Griggs contends that the trial court erred by allowing the preliminary hearing transcript of a primary witness to be read into evidence, in place of live testimony at trial, thereby violating the Confrontation Clause. We find this contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The district court concluded that the prosecution demonstrated that the witness was unavailable and her testimony bore sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (setting forth a two-part test for determining violations of the Confrontation Clause). This was based on a finding that the prosecution made a good faith effort in attempting to locate the witness, <em>see Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 74 (stating that the law does not require the performance of \u201cfutile\u201d acts to find the witness, but merely reasonable efforts); <em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 724-25, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (predicating \u201cunavailability\u201d upon prosecution\u2019s good-faith effort to obtain the witness\u2019s presence at trial), as well as a finding that the witness\u2019 prior testimony was reliable. <em>See California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 165-66, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (finding sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness in using testimony from a preliminary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">We conclude that the California trial court\u2019s admission of the witness\u2019 preliminary hearing testimony was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
