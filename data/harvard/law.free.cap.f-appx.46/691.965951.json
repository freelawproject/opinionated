Prior to trial, Walker filed a Motion in Limine which sought to preclude the testimony of Defendants\u2019 expert psychiatrist, Dr. Toborowsky, and requested a <em>Daubert </em>hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 12, 2001, after determining that the motion was comprised of objections to the evidence upon which Dr. Toborowsky based his conclusions rather than objections to the methodology employed, the District Court denied the Motion in Limine, without prejudice to Walker\u2019s right to object to specific questions at trial. The matter was tried before a jury and a verdict entered in, favor of the Defendants on October 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">Walker appeals the District Court\u2019s October 12, 2001 Order. Walker asserts that the District Court erred in admitting Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s expert report and testimony because the conclusions contained therein were unsupported. Because the District Court correctly concluded that (a) it is for the trier of fact to determine the weight to be accorded, and the sufficiency of, the evidence upon which the Defendants\u2019 expert relied; and that (b) Walker\u2019s Motion in Limine challenging the sufficiency of the evidence does not fall within the purview of a <em>Daubert </em>hearing, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">On May 8, 1998, in response to a telephone call from a store employee requesting police assistance, Walker was forcibly arrested at, or just outside, an automotive store premises<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was transported brief<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ly to the police station, where his continued erratic behavior led to his transportation to a local Crisis Center.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Walker was then involuntarily committed at the Crisis Center of Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital, where a Crisis Center psychiatrist, Dr. Silverman, made an initial mental health evaluation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, shortly thereafter, Walker was treated at the Hospital\u2019s emergency room for a broken left arm and left shoulder injuries which he alleges were caused by the Officers\u2019 actions. Walker continued to receive treatment at the Center through May 20,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. Toborowsky, a Board certified psychiatrist, was provided with all of the Crisis Center records, the Hospital emergency room records, those of the orthopaedic physician, and the Officers\u2019 depositions. In addition, Dr. Toborowksy took a complete psychiatric history from Walker,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and performed a mental status examination. Based upon the evidence considered, Dr. Toborowsky concluded that at the time of arrest Walker was \u201clikely ... grossly psychotic\u201d and that his ability to judge reality and his perception of events were markedly impaired and, therefore, unreliable. R.R. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Prior to trial, Walker filed a Motion in Limine seeking to exclude Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s testimony and requesting a Daubert hearing. The District Court denied the Motion based on its determination that \u201cwhat [Walker was] arguing in the Motion \u2014 the failure of defendants\u2019 psychiatrist to rely on all of the evidence in the case \u2014 [did] not require a <em>Daubert </em>Hearing and [was] a proper subject for cross-examination.\u201d October 12, 2001 Order. As noted above, the matter proceeded to a jury trial, with a verdict for the Defendants entered on October 22, 2001. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343, and we exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony is for abuse of discretion, as is our review of the Court\u2019s decision regarding the necessity of a <em>Daubert </em>hearing. <em>See Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">An abuse of discretion arises if the trial court\u2019s decision \u201crests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact\u201d or when \u201cno reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>adopt the district court\u2019s view.\u201d <em>Hanover Potato Prods., Inc. v. Shalala, </em>989 F.2d 123, 127 (3d Cir.1993). The District Court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, and \u201cconsiderable leeway\u201d in determining the reliability of particular expert testimony under <em>Daubert. See Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 152-53, 119 S.Ct. 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The Defendants contend that by failing to raise any specific objections to Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s trial testimony, Walker has waived his rights of appeal with respect to the District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion in Limine requesting a <em>Daubert </em>hearing on the admissibility of Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s evidence. Walker responds, citing our cases holding that when the district court has definitively denied a motion in limine, with no suggestion that the ruling was in any way tentative or subject to reconsideration at trial, an objection at trial is unnecessary. Walker argues that the District Court\u2019s recognition of his right to raise specific objections at trial did not alter the unequivocal nature of its ruling on the motion. As we have held, any objection to the evidence when introduced at trial \u201cwould have been in the nature of a formal exception and, thus, unnecessary under Rule 46.\u201d <em>Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Sunshine Supermarket, Inc., </em>753 F.2d 321, 325 (3d Cir.1985); <em>see also Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>126 F.3d 506, 517-18 (3d Cir.1997) (an unsuccessful motion in limine need not be followed by formal trial objections where (1) the party\u2019s pretrial motion sets forth the reasons and case citations in support of the request and (2) the court makes a \u201cdefinitive\u201d ruling with no suggestion of reconsideration). Although we believe that it would have been better practice to have objected to specific questions, under the circumstances of this case we are unwilling to hold that Walker waived his objection to the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\"><em>Daubert </em>requires that, when faced with a proffer of expert testimony, a trial judge determine \u201cwhether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786. These gatekeeping requirements have been extended to apply to all expert testimony. <em>See Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 147. This would include the \u201csoft sciences,\u201d such as psychiatry and psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">In accordance with <em>Daubert, </em>trial courts are required to apply a reliability analysis to an expert\u2019s opinion; that opinion is \u201creliable\u201d if it is based on the \u201cmethods and procedures of science\u201d rather than on \u201csubjective belief or unsupported speculation.\u201d <em>In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., </em>35 F.3d 717, 742 (1994) (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590). In other words, the expert must have \u201cgood grounds\u201d for his belief. <em>Id. </em>at 741-42 (explaining how Rule 702, which governs the use of expert testimony in the federal courts, embodies three distinct substantive restraints on the admission of expert testimony: qualifications, reliability and fit).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>In performing its gatekeeping function, and, in particular, in deciding whether an expert\u2019s report meets the reliability factor of a <em>Daubert </em>and Rule 702 analysis, the District Court is not to weigh the evidence relied upon or determine whether it agrees with the conclusions reached therein. To the contrary, the role of the District Court is simply to evaluate whether the <em>methodology </em>utilized by the expert is reliable, i.e., whether, when correctly employed, that methodology leads to testimony helpful to the trier in fact. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 591-93 (noting that the testimony must \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\u201d and that the trial court\u2019s determination \u201centails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Determinations regarding the weight to be accorded, and the sufficiency of, the evidence relied upon by the proffered expert, are within the sole province of the jury. <em>Cf. Breidor v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>722 F.2d 1134, 1138-39 (3d Cir.1983) (\u201cWhere there is a logical basis for an expert\u2019s opinion testimony, the credibility and weight of that testimony is to be determined by the jury, not the trial judge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">In this case, Dr. Toborowsky based his conclusions on both (a) a review of Walker\u2019s medical and psychiatric records, including evaluations of Walker\u2019s mental health within hours of the incident in question, and (b) a personal examination of Walker\u2019s mental status. <em>See </em>Paoli, 35 F.3d at 762 (concluding that either review of a patient\u2019s medical records or a personal examination provides a sufficient reliable source of information to support medical conclusions regarding a patient\u2019s status). <em>Compare Padillas v. Stork-Gamco, Inc., </em>186 F.3d 412, 418 (3d Cir.1999) (concluding that trial court erred in failing to hold <em>Daubert </em>hearing where expert failed to explain his opinions in his report); <em>Elcock v. Kmart Corp., </em>233 F.3d 734, 748 (3d Cir.2000) (concluding trial court erred in failing to hold Daubert hearing where expert employed \u201cadmittedly unique methodological approach\u201d based on apparently \u201carbitrary admixture\u201d of other methods).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Walker\u2019s objections to the admission of Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s report and testimony are expressly predicated on disagreement with the disputed evidence relied upon by the expert, and on the assertion that conclusions derived from such evidence are necessarily unreliable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An expert is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>nonetheless, permitted to base his opinion on a particular version of disputed facts and the weight to be accorded to that opinion is for the jury. It is also, as the District Court observed, a proper subject for cross-examination. <em>See Stecyk v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 408, 414 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cRule 705, together with Rule 703, places the burden of exploring the facts and assumptions underlying the testimony of an expert witness on opposing counsel during cross-examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Indeed, even if it were appropriate for the District Court to examine the sufficiency of the data to support an expert\u2019s conclusion, Walker concedes that Defendants\u2019 version of the disputed facts, such as those regarding Walker\u2019s attempted public exposure, would in fact support Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s conclusions. Again, factual disputes are for the jury, and Walker was perfectly free to explore on cross-examination the reliance placed by Dr. Toborowksy on the disputed facts and to argue to the jury that, if it rejected the underlying factual premises of his report, it should also reject Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s expert opinion on Walker\u2019s mental state. <em>See </em>Stecyk, 295 F.3d at 414 (\u201cA party confronted with an adverse expert witness who has sufficient, though perhaps not overwhelming, facts and assumptions as the basis for his opinion can highlight those weaknesses through effective cross-examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that because Walker objected to the application rather than the legitimacy of Dr. Toborowsky\u2019s methodology, such objections were more appropriately addressed on cross-examination and no <em>Daubert </em>hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-16\">. <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-19\">. The testimony of the two non-party wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>nesses was inconsistent as to the location and manner of the arrest. The Officers maintain that the degree of force used in Walker\u2019s arrest was necessitated by his mental state and volatile behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\">. A contemporaneous report prepared by one of the Officers indicates that Walker\u2019s remarks included references to supposed secret agents and to his attempts at public exposure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\">.

His preliminary diagnosis was bipolar effective disorder, manic with psychosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-15\">. Although Walker denied any significant or continuing psychiatric history, it was subsequently learned that he in fact had a history of prior admissions to the Montgomery County Emergency Services Building at Norris-town State Hospital and of mental health treatment. <em>See, e.g., </em>R.R. at 304 (Crisis Center discharge papers noting Walker\u2019s \"history of multiple psychiatric admissions\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 369 (Crisis Center Progress Notes of 5/14/98 reflecting meetings with Walker\u2019s sister and his cousin, who indicated that Walker had been \"Chronically unstable\u201d, had \"periodic bipolar episodes\u201d, had multiple admissions for mental health treatment since 1977, and been \"chronically non-compliant\u201d with his out-patient treatment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">. More specifically, Rule 702 provides that If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the tier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-5\">. <em>See also id. </em>at 594-95, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (\"The inquiry envisioned by Rule 702 is ... a flexible one ... [directed at] the scientific validity \u2014 and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability \u2014 of ... the proposed submission.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\">. Although Walker asserts that a <em>Daubert </em>hearing was required both because Dr. Toborowsky \"relied on facts that were in dispute\u201d and because \"the conclusions in the report do not flow from the evidence he relied on\u201d, Appellant's Reply Brief at 1, it is clear that Walker\u2019s assertion regarding the insufficiency of the evidence is integrally related to his disagreement with the version of the facts accepted by Dr. Toborowsky. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19 (asserting that because of the \"glaring contradiction\u201d in the officer and witness deposition testimony regarding the existence and nature of any irrational behavior on Walker\u2019s part at the time of arrest, Dr. Toborowsky \"could not have reasonably relied\u201d on an officer\u2019s account to support his conclusions regarding Walker\u2019s mental state); id. at 26 (stating that the officer\u2019s unsupported testimony \"cannot be taken seriously\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 28-29 (asserting that \u201d[i]n light of this dispute\u201d over Walker\u2019s \"behavior and state of mind at the time of the incident, it was the duty of the district court\u201d to hold a <em>Daubert </em>hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">In addition, Walker asserts that \u201d[o]f the material reviewed by Dr. Toborowsky, only [one officer's testimony regarding Walker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>indecent exposure] supports his conclusion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9. To the contrary, Dr. Toborwsky\u2019s conclusions were also supported by (a) both officers\u2019 testimony regarding Walker\u2019s erratic and incoherent behavior at the time of arrest; (b) the Crisis Center medical records, including the mental health evaluation prepared by Dr. Silverman, who interviewed Walker shortly after the arrest; and (c) the records of Walker\u2019s treating orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Hibberd, who noted on the day of the incident that \"an adequate history of physical examination was not possible at the time of the original injury owing to the patient\u2019s mental state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
