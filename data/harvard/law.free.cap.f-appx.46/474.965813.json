We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Smith contends that the district court erred by increasing his offense level two points for obstructing justice pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.1. Reviewing for clear error, <em>United States v. Lofton, </em>905 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir.1990), we are not persuaded. A review of the entire record demonstrates that the district court did not err in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Smith obstructed justice by withholding documents. <em>See United States v. Asagba, </em>77 F.3d 324, 326 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that \u201c[rjeview under the clearly erroneous standard is significantly deferential, requiring for reversal a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. The standard does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trial court simply because the reviewing court might have decided differently.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Smith\u2019s final contention is that the district court erred by refusing to allow the two point reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The district court did not commit clear error by finding that Smith\u2019s statement of responsibility was insufficient and his post-offense asset transfers were part of the scheme to defraud the government, and were inconsistent with an acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Fellows, </em>157 F.3d 1197, 1202-03 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
