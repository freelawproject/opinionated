R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b537-28\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-29\">Luis Ayala-Ayala appeals his 46-month sentence imposed following a guilty plea conviction for illegally reentering the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-30\">Ayala-Ayala contends that his Nevada gross misdemeanor battery conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony, and its use to enhance his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) therefore, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>improper. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2001), and conclude that this contention in unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">An aggravated felony is defined as \u201ca crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d 1120, 1125 (9th Cir.2001); see <em>also, </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Battery is \u201c... any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another\u201d and may result in punishment by imprisonment \u201cfor not more than one year ...\u201d <em>See </em>NEV. REV. STAT. 200.481(l)(a); NEV. REV. STAT. 193.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Because battery, as defined by Nevada law, constitutes a crime of violence, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (defining crime of violence as \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another ... \u201d), and Ayala-Ayala received a one-year term of imprisonment for that offense, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) (stating term of imprisonment includes period of incarceration ordered by court regardless of any suspension of sentence), we conclude that the district court correctly determined that Ayala-Ayala\u2019s battery conviction qualified as an aggravated felony and properly enhanced his federal sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1210 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (stating relevant question is whether crime meets the definition of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under federal sentencing law, without regard to whether the state labels offense misdemeanor or felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
