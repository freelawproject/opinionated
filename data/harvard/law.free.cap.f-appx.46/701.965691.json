Walker filed a motion to suppress, arguing the search of his vehicle for the firearm violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted Walker\u2019s motion to suppress. The Government appeals the district court\u2019s order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-27\">We review the findings of fact from the suppression hearing for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>See United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). An officer may briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes if the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual is engaged in or about to be engaged in criminal activity. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Police offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>cers may order individuals out of a vehicle during a traffic stop and may frisk those persons for weapons if there is a reasonable belief that they are armed and dangerous. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977). In <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983), the Supreme Court held police officers may search the limited area where a weapon may be hidden in the passenger compartment of an automobile \u201cif the officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the officers in believing the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1049 (quotations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s bench ruling and order. We conclude, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to search Walker\u2019s vehicle for weapons. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Walker\u2019s motion to suppress. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
