R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b590-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-22\">Byron Chapin Myers appeals pro se the district court\u2019s partial summary judgment and subsequent jury verdict for defendants in Myers\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging prison officials violated his constitutional rights when they physically forced him to leave the prison law library, interfered with his legal mail, and blocked his access to his legal materials. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment. <em>Orr v. Bank of America, </em>285 F.3d 764, 772 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-23\">The district court\u2019s partial summary judgment on Myers\u2019s access to the courts claim was proper because Myers failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he suffered injury from the defendants\u2019 actions. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). The district court\u2019s summary judgment on Myers\u2019s claim of conspiracy was proper because Myers failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an agreement between the defendants. <em>See Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 853 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-24\">This court lacks jurisdiction to consider Myers\u2019s contention that the jury verdict was tainted by seeing Myers in restraints because Myers raised the issue below only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>in his motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure 60(b) and Myers did not separately appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of that non-tolling post-judgment motion. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 403, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (\u201c[Mjotions that do not toll the time for taking an appeal give rise to two separate appellate proceedings that can be consolidated.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">This court declines to consider Myers\u2019s remaining contentions because the district court never had an opportunity to rule on them. <em>See Dodd v. Hood River County, </em>59 F.3d 852, 863 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that the court of appeals generally \u201cdoes not consider an issue not passed on below\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"AGd\">AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
