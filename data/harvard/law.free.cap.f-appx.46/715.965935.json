Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The Government did not file a reply brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">On appeal, Rice contends that the district court faded to comply with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. The record reveals that the district court conducted a thorough plea colloquy, and thus we conclude that Rice was fully aware of his rights and the consequences of his plea and that his plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Rice next contends that the district court erred in calculating his Sentencing Guidelines range. Rice faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000). The presentence report accurately calculated the guideline sentence range as 188 to 235 months based upon a total offense level of 31, after a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, with a criminal history score of VI. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>ch. 5, pt. A (2000). Further, a court\u2019s decision to sentence a defendant within a correctly calculated guideline range that is also within the statutory maximum for the offense is not renewable by this court. <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-19\">Finally, Rice raises the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must ordinarily be pursued in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception to this general rule applies when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. We conclude that the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, Rice\u2019s claim is not cognizable in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Rice\u2019s sentence and conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Rice\u2019s judgment was reentered after the district court granted in part and dismissed in part Rice\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Rice has filed a pro se notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order, and this appeal has been consolidated with Rice\u2019s direct appeal. His informal brief in the case challenges the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise a claim challenging conversion of funds to drugs on appeal. The district court properly found the claim to be premature without a decision on appeal first. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">No. <em>02-4879 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">No. <em>02-6737 </em>\u2014 DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
