Because Barnes initiated his lawsuit more than two years after the issuance of a right-to-sue letter, we conclude dismissal of his complaint was proper. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (adopting procedures of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, which requires filing discrimination suit within 90 days of receiving right-to-sue letter from Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)). We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Barnes\u2019s postjudgment motion, in which he asserted for the first time that he never received the right-to-sue letter. <em>See Moysis v. DTG Datanet, </em>278 F.3d 819, 829 n. 3 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review; arguments or evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>could and should have been presented earlier cannot be presented in Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion); <em>Cook v. Providence Hosp., </em>820 F.2d 176, 179 &amp; n. 3 (6th Cir.1987) (presuming receipt of EEOC right-to-sue letter within 5 days of mailing absent convincing denial of receipt).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
