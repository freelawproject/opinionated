Aexander\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising several potential issues. Aexander has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he contends the district court improperly relied on prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions to establish his criminal history category for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-24\">We find Aexander\u2019s sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment does not implicate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum of 480 months as set forth in \u00a7 860. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-202 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). We also reject Aexander\u2019s contention the district court improperly increased his total offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-25\">Aexander next challenges his Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. We generally re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>view the adequacy of a guilty plea de novo, but in the Rule 11 context, violations are evaluated for harmless error. <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995)). Our careful review of the record finds no error, harmless or otherwise. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117, 120 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Finally, out of an abundance of caution, Alexander\u2019s attorney notes that Alexander\u2019s guilty plea does not waive claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Counsel candidly acknowledges, however, that he cannot bring to our attention any prejudicial error by Alexander\u2019s former attorney or instances of prosecutorial misconduct. Because ineffective assistance of counsel does not conclusively appear on the face of the record, we decline to review this claim. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). We also find Alexander\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We have reviewed the arguments made in Alexander\u2019s pro se supplemental brief. As to Alexander\u2019s contention that the district court improperly used prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions to establish his criminal history category, we find no plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We therefore affirm Alexander\u2019s conviction and sentence. We also deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-18\"> The remaining contentions made in Alexander\u2019s pro se supplemental brief were raised in the brief filed by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
