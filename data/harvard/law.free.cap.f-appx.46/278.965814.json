Hubbard and Garner raise a number of challenges to their convictions and sentences. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The convictions of Hubbard and Garner stem from events occurring on May 16, 2000. Cleveland Police Officer Joseph O\u2019Neill (\u201cO\u2019Neill\u201d), a motorcycle patrolman, pulled over a 1998 Ford Expedition lacking a front license plate at approximately 11:50 a.m. (J.A. at 354-55.) Hubbard was the driver, and Garner was in the passenger seat. (J.A. at 356.) After stopping the vehicle, O\u2019Neill approached the driver and asked for his driver\u2019s license. (J.A. at 357.) Hubbard responded that he did not have a driver\u2019s license, that the vehicle belonged to Khaleel Haqq, that he was taking Garner to work, and that there was possibly a warrant for his (Hubbard\u2019s) arrest. (J.A. at 357.) Thereafter, O\u2019Neill took Hubbard\u2019s name and social security number down and returned to his motorcycle to run the vehicle plates and the driver\u2019s information. (J.A. at 358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The dispatcher informed O\u2019Neill that the vehicle belonged to Sylvester Harris, who was currently incarcerated, that Hubbard did not have a valid driver\u2019s license, and that he had no outstanding warrants. (J.A. at 358.) At this point, O\u2019Neill requested that backup be sent to assist him. (J.A. at 358-59.) O\u2019Neill testified at Hubbard\u2019s hearing on his motion to suppress that he asked the vehicle occupants to remain in the vehicle while he checked on the information he had received. While O\u2019Neill was on the radio, Hubbard stated that Garner needed to go to work. O\u2019Neill told him to wait, that \u201cit [would] only be a few more minutes.\u201d (J.A. at 232.) Hubbard began honking his horn to get the officer\u2019s attention and again requested that Garner be allowed to go to work. (J.A. at 233.) Garner attempted to get out of the car, and O\u2019Neill told him to wait in the car for a few more minutes. (J.A. at 233.) Garner again opened his door, looked back at O\u2019Neill and stated that he needed to go to work, and, again, O\u2019Neill told him to wait. Garner persisted, and O\u2019Neill testified that rather than risk a confrontation, he told Garner to go ahead and leave. (J.A. at 234.) O\u2019Neill gave similar testimony at trial, stating, \u201cThen the passenger got out of the car again, and I\u2019m by myself, behind the vehicle, and I just told them, that\u2019s fine. Just go.\u201d (J.A. at 359.) At this point, Garner exited the vehicle, grabbed a black gym bag and began to walk down the street. (J.A. at 234, 359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Hubbard\u2019s and Garner\u2019s versions of these events differ somewhat from the government\u2019s version. According to Hubbard, once O\u2019Neill returned from running the personal information and plates, Garner asked if he could get out and go to work, and O\u2019Neill responded, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d (J.A. at 286.) Garner\u2019s testimony was essentially the same. (J.A. at 294.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Shortly thereafter, Cleveland Police Officer Paul Wilson (\u2018Wilson\u201d) arrived to assist O\u2019Neill. O\u2019Neill told Wilson to go stop Garner and return him to the scene of the traffic stop. (J.A. at 360, 365.) Wilson pulled his police car alongside Garner, who was approximately 200 feet from the scene of the traffic stop, exited the vehicle and walked up to Garner. (J.A. at 366-67.) Garner was still carrying the black gym bag and, according to Wilson, visibly shaking. (J.A. at 367.) Wilson identified himself and informed Garner that O\u2019Neill wanted him back at the traffic stop. Garner did not respond. (J.A. at 367.) Again Wilson asked Garner to return to the traf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>fie stop with him, and also asked him what was in the bag. (J.A. at 367.) When asked at trial why he questioned Garner about what was in the bag, Wilson responded, \u201cI check everybody\u2019s bag, purse, that sits behind me, so I know for their safety and my safety. And plus I want to arrive home to my family. I wouldn\u2019t want to be shot in the back or nothing.\u201d (J.A. at 367-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Garner responded to the question that he had found the bag along the railroad tracks and that the bag contained jewelry or drugs. (J.A. at 368.) Wilson then grabbed Garner with his left hand around Garner\u2019s right bicep, escorted him to the car and opened the rear passenger door where Garner sat down with his feet on the sidewalk. Wilson then took the bag and stated, \u201c[L]et\u2019s open this bag and see what\u2019s in it.\u201d (J.A. at 267, 368.) Garner made no response. (J.A. at 369.) Wilson unzipped the bag in front of Garner, and both looked in the bag. There, Wilson observed seven bags vacuum-wrapped in brown packaging tape that appeared to be drug packages. Wilson advised Garner that he was under arrest at that time and not to speak to him. (J.A. at 368-69.) Wilson placed Garner in the rear of the car without handcuffing him, placed the bag in the front passenger floorboard of the car and returned to the scene of the traffic stop. (J.A. at 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">At the suppression hearing, Garner\u2019s explanation differed from that of Officer Wilson. According to Garner, he found the bag alongside the railroad tracks. He stated that he did not know the bag contained drugs. (J.A. at 303.) Garner stated that a few days prior to this incident, he was riding with Detective Johnson of the East Cleveland Police Department when they came across a Jamaican who said he had been robbed of a bag fitting the description of the bag Garner found. (J.A. at 304.) Detective Johnson reportedly told Garner that if he found the bag, to let him know. (J.A. at 304.) Garner stated that he was on his way to see a lawn care client and intended to call Johnson from there. (J.A. at 304-05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Wilson informed O\u2019Neill of what he had found. The two officers then decided to approach the vehicle. (J.A. at 370.) Because of the drug discovery, the officers drew their sidearms. (J.A. at 361-62, 370.) Wilson approached the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, and O\u2019Neill approached from the passenger\u2019s side. (J.A. at 361, 370.) Wilson opened the door to the car, asked Hubbard to step out and face the truck and get on his knees. (J.A. at 370.) O\u2019Neill came around from the other side. Hubbard stated that he was carrying a gun on his right hip. (J.A. at 362-63, 371, 398.) O\u2019Neill removed a loaded Star .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun and extra loaded magazine from a black nylon belt designed to secure a weapon underneath a person\u2019s pants. (J.A. at 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">At this point, other officers arrived at the scene. Garner and Hubbard were advised of their constitutional rights and placed under arrest. (J.A. at 273-74.) Detective Ronald Ross (\u201cRoss\u201d) of the Caribbean Gang Drug Task Force arrived and searched the truck where he found mail addressed to Khaleel Haqq. (J.A. at 375.) Garner and Hubbard were transported to Sixth District Police Department for further processing. (J.A. at 373.) At the police station, O\u2019Neill issued a ticket to Hubbard for failure to display a front license plate, not wearing a seat belt and driving without a valid license. (J.A. at 243.) He issued a ticket to Garner for failure to wear a seatbelt. (J.A. at 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">While at the station, Garner and Hubbard were again advised of their constitutional rights and interviewed. (J.A. at 280-81.) Garner waived his rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>agreed to make a statement to Ross and Detective Thomas Williams. (J.A. at 90.) Ross testified that Garner stated in that interview that he was walking by the railroad tracks and found the black duffel bag. (J.A. at 281.) Garner stated that he looked inside the bag and thought it contained either drugs or money. (J.A. at 281.) He then continued walking, carrying the bag with him, to St. Clair Avenue where he got a ride with Hubbard. (J.A. at 281.) According to Ross, Garner initially stated that they were on their way to a scrap yard, then changed his story, stating that he and Hubbard were going to the East Cleveland Police Department to turn the bag over to a Detective Brown. (J.A. at 281.) When asked why they were traveling away from the police station, Garner could not provide an explanation and ended the interview. (J.A. at 281-83.) Williams testified that the interview lasted approximately 25 minutes and that Garner never asked for a lawyer. (J.A. at 94-95.) At his suppression hearing, Garner testified that he was interviewed by six people. (J.A. at 312.) He further stated that he twice requested a lawyer and made no statement whatsoever. (J.A. at 312-315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Hubbard likewise waived his rights and made a statement to Detectives Mike Gray and Ron James in an interview that began between 5:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. and lasted approximately two hours. (J.A. at 334.) According to James, Hubbard initially denied any knowledge of Garner or the contents of the bag, but after the detectives stated that they did not believe him and gave Hubbard certain assurances that his street reputation would not be harmed, Hubbard became more cooperative. (J.A. at 379-80.) According to James, Hubbard stated that he was the \u201cnumber-two man\u201d in a much larger drug trafficking organization that included Khaleel Haqq (\u201cHaqq\u201d), Kent Harris, Leamon Eddie (\u201cEddie\u201d), also known as \u201cBuddha,\u201d and others. Hubbard identified himself as the \u201cenforcer\u201d because of his large physical size and further identified Haqq as the leader of the group. (J.A. at 380-81.) Hubbard stated he had received instructions to pick up Garner with the cocaine. Together, they met Kent Harris and gave him five kilograms of cocaine. They then were on their way to meet another man to distribute six kilograms of cocaine when they were stopped by the police. (J.A. at 382-83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">At his suppression hearing, Hubbard denied making any statement to anyone of the sort detailed above. (J.A. at 337.) He admitted knowing Kent Harris and Haqq, but denied any knowledge of drug dealing. (J.A. at 337.) Hubbard did acknowledge that both he and Garner were advised of their constitutional rights both at the scene of the traffic stop and at the police station. (J.A. at 337.) The court determined that Hubbard was not coerced in any manner and concluded that the statement made by him should not be suppressed. (J.A. at 339A0.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">On June 14, 2000, a grand jury indicted Hubbard and Garner for possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (\u201cCount One\u201d). (J.A. at 23.) Hubbard also was indicted for the use and carrying of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Garner pled guilty to the charges against him, (J.A. at 181-88), but Hubbard pled not guilty and proceeded to trial. (J.A. at 60-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Garner moved to suppress the evidence seized and the statements made during his encounter with Wilson as well as the statements made during his subsequent detention. (J.A. at 71-78.) The court denied this motion on July 19, 2000. (J.A. at 163-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>72.) It determined that Wilson had probable cause to arrest \u201cbecause [Garner] failed to comply with a lawful police order.\u201d (J.A. at 167.) The court also justified Garner\u2019s detention under the auspices of a <em>Terry </em>stop, <em>see Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), finding that Wilson had reasonable suspicion sufficient to detain Garner. (J.A. at 168-69.) Regarding the search of Garner\u2019s duffel bag, the court determined that the search was permissible as either a search incident to an arrest, (J.A. at 169), or, if the detention of Garner was viewed as less than a full custodial arrest, as a protective search under <em>Terry </em>and its progeny. (J.A. at 170-71.) Finally, the court determined that Garner\u2019s statements made while in detention were admissible. The court found that Garner\u2019s testimony at the hearing was \u201cimplausible\u201d and \u201cself-serving.\u201d (J.A. at 172.) The court, therefore, credited the testimony of the officers as being much more credible and allowed the evidence to be presented. (J.A. at 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Following Garner\u2019s motion for reconsideration, (J.A. at 194-201), the district court further clarified its previous position. Garner sought to focus the court\u2019s attention on O\u2019Neill\u2019s release of Garner from the vehicle. The court discounted this fact, however, stating that \u201cGarner fails to realize that Officer O\u2019Neill\u2019s approval did not innoculate him from liability for his earlier refusal to comply with O\u2019Neill\u2019s order to remain in the vehicle.\u201d (J.A. at 217.) The court also reiterated its previous reasoning that even if it had erred in finding probable cause, Wilson was still justified in his search under <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">At Hubbard\u2019s trial, O\u2019Neill, Wilson, Ross and James testified to the facts detailed above. In addition, Special Agent Robert Fiatal, Caribbean Gang Drug Task Force supervisor, testified that Haqq, Eddie, and Kent Harris had been under investigation by the task force since late 1999 or early 2000. (J.A. at 385-86.) Garner and Hubbard also testified, both restating their testimony substantially as given during the suppression hearings, i.e., neither was aware that the bag contained drugs, nor was either aware of any drug trafficking activity. The parties stipulated that the amount of cocaine at issue was 6,992.8 grams. (J.A. at 421-422.) The jury found Hubbard guilty on both counts. (J.A. at 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The court sentenced Hubbard to concurrent sentences of 262 months on the drug charge and 60 months on the weapons charge on October 19, 2000. (J.A. at 32.) Hubbard was given a three-level enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 301.1(a) for his aggravating role in the offense and a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 301.1(a) for giving perjured testimony. (J.A. at 436-39.) Garner was sentenced to a term of 121 months on the drug charge. (J.A. at 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Garner now appeals solely on the issue of his denied motion to suppress the cocaine seized during the search of the duffel bag he had with him. Hubbard alleges the district court erred in unconstitutionally denying him his right to counsel of choice. Hubbard also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. Hubbard further contends that he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct and the admission of evidence concerning other individuals mentioned in his confession, a confession Hubbard alleges was made as a result of undue delay in bringing him before a magistrate judge and, therefore, should have been excluded. Hubbard also argues that the government failed to produce adequate proof of an effect on interstate commerce at his trial. Hubbard also challenges the district court\u2019s instruction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>jury. Finally, Hubbard alleges that sentencing enhancements were made in violation of <em>Apprendi </em>and without any evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">We first turn to Garner\u2019s sole assignment of error, the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the cocaine discovered in the duffel bag. On appeal, the court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 560, 561 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Garner urges on appeal, as he did below, that the stop and search of his person and duffel bag were lacking the requisite probable cause. Further, he argues that the stop by Wilson lacked even the reasonable suspicion necessary to perform a stop and protective frisk. Garner relies heavily on the fact that O\u2019Neill effectively gave Garner permission to leave. Much is also made of the fact that O\u2019Neill issued a ticket for a seat belt violation well after the defendant had been taken to the police station and from a different ticket book than the one issued to Hubbard for the same offense, the inference being that the ticket was an afterthought written to justify the stop by Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The government, echoing the justifications offered by the district court, argues that O\u2019Neill was well within the limits of the law by requiring all of the passengers to remain in the car. The government cites <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), in .support of this proposition. In <em>Wilson </em>the Supreme Court held that a police officer\u2019s ordering of a driver and passengers within a car to exit during a traffic stop was not an unreasonable intrusion on Fourth Amendment rights, considering the greater danger to the officer when passengers are present. 519 U.S. at 414-15. The implication, of course, is that the reverse is true also, that requiring passengers to remain in the car for the safety of the officer is not unreasonable. The government further cites <em>United States v. Moorefield, </em>111 F.3d 10 (3d Cir.1997), in support. There, the Third Circuit, citing <em>Wilson, </em>held that a police officer\u2019s order to remain in the car was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Finally, the government cites Ohio statutes making failure to comply with the lawful order of a police officer a first degree misdemeanor and an offense for which a person may be arrested. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2921.33(A) &amp; 2935.03(A) (West 2002). The government argues that Garner\u2019s exiting the vehicle and leaving the scene gave O\u2019Neill, and through him, Wilson, the necessary probable cause to arrest Garner. Therefore, the search of the bag was incident to Garner\u2019s lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In the alternative, the government argues that the stop and search of Garner is justified under <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. The government states that Wilson had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that Garner either had been, was, or was about to be involved in criminal activity. This suspicion, according to the government, justified stopping Garner and performing a protective search.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Reasonable suspicion, just as probable cause, is determined from the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). However, in developing a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is occurring, an officer must have more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27. Furthermore, \u201cReasonable suspicion can be based upon police officers\u2019 own observations or upon the collective knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>edge of other officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Braggs, </em>23 F.3d 1047, 1049 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In <em>Terry, </em>the Court held that an individual may be stopped and frisked for weapons if an officer, based on his observations and experience, determined that an individual is, was or will be engaged in criminal activity. 392 U.S. at 30. This protective search has since been expanded to include areas within the immediate control of a suspect. <em>See Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). Areas within the immediate control of a suspect include the entire passenger area of a vehicle, including any packages or containers without regard for whom may own the packages or containers. <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 302, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. Much is made, both by the government and the district court, of Garner\u2019s departure from the scene of the traffic stop. The district court discounts the fact that O\u2019Neill gave Garner permission to leave, albeit after much badgering by Garner and after having told him three times to remain in the car. O\u2019Neill justified this action by testifying that he did not want to risk a confrontation with two suspects alone. The district court accepts this rationale, stating, \u201cGarner fails to realize that Officer O\u2019Neill\u2019s approval did not innoculate him from liability for his earlier refusal to comply with O\u2019Neill\u2019s order to remain in the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">We believe the district court\u2019s justification requires too much from a suspect. O\u2019Neill could have changed his mind and decided to let Garner go to work, as Garner claimed he needed to do. The district court would have a suspect read the inner workings of the mind of a police officer to determine the reason that officer says or does a particular thing. Therefore, the district court\u2019s reasoning that Garner had violated an Ohio statute by disobeying a lawful order of a police officer, thus, entitling the officer to place Garner under arrest, is faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">However, other facts, objectively viewed, do give rise to a finding of reasonable suspicion warranting a stop of Garner. O\u2019Neill was aware that Garner urgently wanted to leave, regardless of the reason given. He also was aware that Garner was accompanying a driver who was not the owner of the vehicle, that the vehicle\u2019s actual owner was in jail, and that the driver had no license. Also, the driver, Hubbard, had stated that there may be a warrant outstanding for his arrest. O\u2019Neill was unaware of any bag until Garner removed it from the vehicle to carry it with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Based on these facts, O\u2019Neill had reasonable suspicion sufficient to stop Garner. Furthermore, this reasonable suspicion was transferred to Wilson upon his arrival at the scene, <em>see Braggs, </em>23 F.3d at 1049, and O\u2019Neill\u2019s instruction to return Garner to the traffic stop. As Wilson approached Garner on the sidewalk, he noted that he was visibly shaking. Garner initially failed to respond to the officer. Also, when asked what was in the bag, Garner voluntarily responded jewelry or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Contrary to the district court\u2019s reasoning that the officer acquired probable cause to arrest based on Garner\u2019s departure from the scene of the traffic stop, we find that Wilson acquired probable cause to arrest Garner based on his statement concerning the contents of the bag. \u201c \u2018[Pjrobable cause\u2019 to justify an arrest means facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge that are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing, in the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>cumstanees shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979); <em>see also Sandul v. Larion, </em>119 F.3d 1250, 1256 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that \u201c[a] police officer is permitted to make an arrest if there is probable cause to believe that the arrestee has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d) Garner\u2019s statement clearly indicated that he was in possession of some sort of illegal contraband, giving the police officer probable cause to take him into custody. Wilson took possession of the bag and placed Garner in the back of his police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Because of the arrest, the search of the bag is permissible as a search incident to an arrest. This circuit has recently addressed a similar situation in <em>Northrop v. Trippett, </em>265 F.3d 372 (6th Cir.2001). In that case, the court upheld the search of a duffel bag police had observed Northrop place under a seat at a bus station. In so doing the court stated, \u201c[T]he right to search an item incident to arrest exists even if that item is no longer accessible to the defendant at the time of the search. So long as the defendant had the item within his immediate control <em>near </em>the time of his arrest, the item remains subject to a search incident to arrest.\u201d 265 F.3d at 379 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, the ruling of the district court denying Garner\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed, although based on a different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Hubbard\u2019s first assignment of error is that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice when the district court denied his motion to substitute counsel. The court reviews such claims for a district court\u2019s abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>176 F.3d 301, 314 (6th Cir.1999). In doing so, the court considers several factors: \u201ctimeliness of the motion; adequacy of the district court\u2019s inquiry into the matter; the extent of the conflict between the attorney and client and whether it resulted in a total lack of communication; and a balancing of these factors with the public\u2019s interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>176 F.3d at 314 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Hubbard was represented by attorney James C. Young (\u201cYoung\u201d) at his arraignment and through his trial. Attorney Paul Mancino (\u201cMancino\u201d) filed a conditional entry of appearance on July 25, 2000, only six days before trial, his appearance conditioned on the trial court granting a continuance to allow Mancino to properly prepare. (J.A. at 173-176.) At his suppression hearing, Hubbard told the court he wanted to fire Young and replace him with Mancino. (J.A. at 322.) He further stated that Mancino was unavailable due to other trial obligations, but that the court should have received \u201ca motion.\u201d (J.A. at 322.) The court acknowledged receipt of the conditional entry of appearance, and stated that Mancino could represent Hubbard, but that there would be no continuance based on \u201cthe fact that [Hubbard had] been through ... at least three attorneys already.\u201d (J.A. at 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">At this point, Hubbard stated that he and Young had not worked on the case together very much, only meeting two or three times. (J.A. at 323.) Young vigorously disputed this, calling it \u201ctotally untrue,\u201d (J.A. at 323.), and stating that he had met with Hubbard no less than six times. Hubbard stated that it was his belief that Young\u2019s law license had been suspended, to which the court responded, \u201cHe\u2019s not, so you are wrong. So we are going to proceed.\u201d (J.A. at 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hubbard\u2019s request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>substitute counsel. Mancino did not file his conditional entry of appearance until six days before Hubbard\u2019s trial was scheduled to begin. The district court inquired into the matter and determined Hubbard\u2019s complaints to be unfounded. Nothing in the record indicates that Hubbard suffered from any communication problems with his attorney, much less a total lack of communication. The court was even willing to allow Mancino to represent Hubbard and offered to move the suppression hearing, but only if Mancino was prepared to go to trial as scheduled. With all of these considerations, the district court appears to have weighed them properly and given due weight to the public\u2019s interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s denial of Hubbard\u2019s substitution of counsel does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Hubbard next appeals denial of his motion to suppress statements made to police while in their custody. Hubbard alleges these statements are the result of an unreasonable delay in bringing him before a magistrate judge. Hubbard further alleges that the delay was a violation of Fed. R.Crim.P. 5(a), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">[A]n officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3041.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">As in the motion to suppress above, the court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 560, 561 (6th Cir.2002). Failure to comply with the requirement of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a) that an arrested person be brought before a magistrate judge without unnecessary delay \u201crenders inadmissible statements obtained from an accused prior to his appearance before a magistrate.\u201d <em>United States v. Barlow, </em>693 F.2d 954, 958 (6th Cir.1982) (citations omitted). Delay is measured from the time federal custody begins. <em>Id. </em>Further, \u201c[f]or the purposes of Rule 5(a) the time which a defendant spends in state custody will not be attributable to federal detention in the absence of some working relationship between state and federal law enforcement personnel.\u201d 693 F.2d at 958. However, waiver of one\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights constitutes a waiver of one\u2019s rights under Rule 5(a). \u201cA valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver also waives the prompt judicial warning of one\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d 693 F.2d at 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Ross testified that he did not take Hubbard before a federal magistrate on the day of his arrest because Ross was not given permission to proceed federally until 3:30 p.m., at which time he was told by the federal prosecutor it was too late in the day to go before a magistrate. (J.A. at 332, 440P.) More importantly, Hubbard admitted that he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights both at the time of his arrest and again at the police station. (J.A. at 336-37.) There is no indication in the record that Hubbard\u2019s statements to the police during a two-hour interview were anything less than voluntary. Hubbard\u2019s voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights equates to a waiver of his rights under Rule 5. The district court, therefore, is affirmed on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Hubbard further argues that the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501(c) were violated. This argument is raised for the first time on appeal. \u201cOrdinarily, the courts of appeals do not consider claims or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>arguments that were not raised in the district court. But this is a prudential rule, not a jurisdictional one.\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>218 F.3d 615, 619 (6th Cir.2000). Because the district court was never given an opportunity to rule on this issue, this court also declines to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Hubbard next alleges multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct that deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. Claims of prosecutorial misconduct are generally mixed questions of fact and law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d 369, 384 (6th Cir.2002). However, improper comments made by the prosecutor without objection are reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>26 F.3d 1380, 1383 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of a constitutional violation only when the misconduct \u201cso infect[s] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Hill v. Brigano, </em>199 F.3d 833, 847 (6th Cir.1999). Although flagrant prosecutorial misconduct constitutes reversible error, \u201c[wjhere the error is not flagrant, reversal is inappropriate if <em>either </em>proof of defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming, <em>or </em>defense counsel failed to object to the error, <em>or </em>if the trial court cured the error with an admonishment to the jury.\u201d <em>Carroll </em>26 F.3d at 1385, n. 6 (emphasis in original). Flagrancy is determined by examining \u201c(1) the tendency of the comments to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant, (2) whether the comments were isolated or extensive, and (3) whether the comments were made deliberately.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>66 F.3d 124, 127 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Hubbard alleges that the prosecutor deprived him of a fair trial by attempting to impeach him and Garner as to inconsistencies between their trial and suppression hearing testimony without laying a proper foundation, by asking Hubbard extensively about whether he knew that Haqq, Garner, Sylvester Harris, Kent Harris, and Eddie were drug dealers, and by making improper comments during opening and closing arguments. Hubbard cites the prosecutor\u2019s statements that Hubbard was a drug dealer, that Garner lied, (J.A. at 427), and that it was a \u201ccoincidence\u201d that Haqq, Eddie, and Kent Harris also were under investigation for drug trafficking, (J.A. at 431-32.) Finally, Hubbard points to several instances in the prosecutor\u2019s opening and closing arguments where he told the jury that they would find \u201cthe truth,\u201d i.e., that Hubbard was guilty. (J.A. at 342-43, 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The majority of these statements came in without objection. Hubbard did object to the prosecutor\u2019s question, \u201cSylvester Harris is in jail, isn\u2019t he?\u201d (J.A. at 410), asked during cross-examination of Hubbard. He also objected to the prosecutor\u2019s failure to refer to the transcript of the suppression hearing during cross-examination of Garner. (J.A. at 388, 395.) The district court sustained Hubbard\u2019s objections regarding improper impeachment and instructed the jury to disregard the question and answer regarding whether Sylvester Harris was in jail. At the close of the evidence, the district court instructed the jury to base its determinations solely on the evidence before them and not the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings or the statements of counsel. (J.A. at 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Turning to the standards enumerated above, the prosecutor\u2019s statements fail to constitute flagrant behavior. Nothing in the statements, on their face, would tend to mislead the jury or unduly prejudice the defendant, and Hubbard fails to indicate how, in fact, these statements would have any prejudicial effect. The statements appear to be isolated, and none of the statements appear to be deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>made to prejudice the defendant. That being said, it is most telling that defendant\u2019s trial counsel failed to object to the majority of the statements. Those statements that were objected to were addressed by the court with instructions to the jury. Further, Hubbard\u2019s confession, the physical evidence seized, and the lack of credibility of Hubbard\u2019s and Garner\u2019s testimonies amount to overwhelming evidence supporting Hubbard\u2019s conviction. Therefore, Hubbard\u2019s challenge on this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Hubbard next argues that the district court erred in admitting testimony about other drug dealers allegedly associated with him. This court reviews admissions of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gibson v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 247, 254 (6th Cir.2001). However, \u201can abuse of discretion that does not affect substantial rights is harmless error and is to be disregarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a)). Evidence admitted without objection is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Fortson, </em>194 F.3d 730, 736 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At Hubbard\u2019s trial, several law enforcement officers testified that Haqq and Kent Harris, individuals implicated in Hubbard\u2019s confession, were currently under investigation for drug trafficking, as was Sylvester Harris, the person to whom the car Hubbard was driving was registered. However, given Hubbard\u2019s testimony at trial that he was unaware that any of the individuals were involved in trafficking drugs, it was entirely proper impeachment testimony. It is likewise important to note that defense counsel failed to object to the vast majority of this testimony. Finally, with the abundance of evidence against Hubbard, there is no evidence that this testimony substantially prejudiced Hubbard. At worst, the admission of this testimony is harmless error. The district court\u2019s admission of this evidence was not an abuse of discretion and is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Hubbard also challenges a number of the jury instructions given by the court. Jury instructions to which the defendant objects, as a question of law, are reviewed <em>de novo. Fisher v. Ford Motor Co., </em>224 F.3d 570, 576 (6th Cir.2000). However, if the defendant fails to object to an instruction given at trial, it is reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>11 F.3d 620, 629 (6th Cir.1993). In determining whether allegedly erroneous jury instructions violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, this court asks \u201cwhether the charge, taken as a whole, fairly and adequately submits the issues and applicable law to the jury.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>224 F.3d at 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Hubbard first challenges the court\u2019s instruction regarding specific intent, which was as follows: \u201cYou may consider it reasonable to draw the inference and find that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of acts knowingly done or knowingly omitted.\u201d Hubbard contends that this instruction creates an unconstitutional mandatory presumption. However, this circuit has upheld this specific instruction as permissible in <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>so long as \u201cthe charge also contains language clearly placing upon the prosecution the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt of all essential elements of the crime.\u201d 594 F.2d 536, 541 (6th Cir.1979). In this case, the jury also was instructed that the prosecution bore the burden of proof. (J.A. at 425.) Therefore, Hubbard\u2019s challenge on this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Hubbard next argues that the instructions given concerning possession were inapplicable to the facts of this particular case. Those instructions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Now, the law recognizes two types of \u2014 two kinds of possession: Actual possession and constructive possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">A person who knowingly has direct physical control of a thing at any given time is then in actual possession of it. I\u2019ve got, for instance, a pencil here. I\u2019m in actual possession of this pencil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">A person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing, either directly or through another person or persons, is then in constructive possession of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">For example, I have pencils on my desk in my chambers. My law clerk will get them for me if I want them. And that\u2019s possession, also. That\u2019s constructive possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">The law also recognizes that possession may be sole or joint. If one person alone has actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is sole. If two or more persons share actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is joint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">(J.A. at 423-24.) Hubbard claims that these instructions were misleading because \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence that he ever touched or possessed the item in question.\u201d Hubbard states that the example cited by the district judge implies that the judge at one time at least touched the pencils on his desk, which is not the case here. Hubbard further argues that the instructions constructively amended the indictment because there was no allegation that possession was constructive or that it was joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Hubbard\u2019s counsel, however, did not object to these instructions at the time they were given. Viewing the evidence given at trial, these instructions were not plainly erroneous. Furthermore, these instructions closely track the language found in the Sixth Circuit pattern instruction. Therefore, district court is affirmed on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Hubbard also argues that the district court\u2019s instruction on aiding and abetting was erroneous because the indictment did not allege aiding and abetting. However, the indictment charges Hubbard with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, which provides in part, \u201cWhoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2(a) (West 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Hubbard also argues that the district court erred in its rejection of his request for an instruction informing the jury that mere presence at the scene of a crime is not enough to convict for aiding and abetting. The record reflects, however, that Hubbard\u2019s counsel discussed and specifically agreed to the instruction given. That instruction contained language that, \u201c[pjroof that the defendant may have known about the crime, even if he was there when it was committed, is not enough for you to find him guilty. Mere association with persons committing a crime is not enough for you to find him guilty.\u201d (J.A. at 426.) Because Hubbard\u2019s counsel was complicit in the instruction, this claim should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Finally, Hubbard argues that the court erred in instructing the jury that in evaluating the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony, it should consider the same factors as it did in evaluating the credibility of other witnesses, including \u201cevidence showing that the winess has been convicted of a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Hubbard Br. at 45.) Hubbard argues that this instruction misleadingly suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Hubbard had a prior felony conviction, which he did not. There was no evidence offered at trial suggesting that Hubbard had a felony conviction. Rather, as the government argues, this instruction was most likely given because of Garner\u2019s prior felony conviction. Moreover, there is no indication that the jury was confused by this instruction, and Hubbard provides no support on appeal for a conclusion that this instruction, if erroneous, constituted plain error. The district court, therefore, is affirmed on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Hubbard next argues that the government failed to prove an interstate commerce nexus to his drug trafficking offense, thus, depriving him of due process. This issue is brought up for the first time on appeal. Hubbard cites <em>U.S. v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), in support. Normally, the court will not review challenges to constitutionality not raised before the district court. <em>United States v. Chesney, </em>86 F.3d 564, 567 (6th Cir.1996.) However, the court \u201cmay exercise [its] discretion to review an issue not raised below in exceptional cases or particular circumstances, or when the rule would produce a plain miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Chesney, </em>86 F.3d at 567-68 (internal quotations and citations omitted). As none of the foregoing conditions present themselves in this case, therefore, the court declines to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Hubbard further argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney failed to object to the admission of certain evidence and to request particular jury instructions. \u201cWe generally will not review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised by a defendant for the first time on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Steverson, </em>230 F.3d 221, 224 (6th Cir.2000). Further, \u201c[s]ueh claims are best brought by a defendant in a post-conviction proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 before the district court in which the parties \u2018can develop an adequate record on the issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>142 F.3d 305, 308 (6th Cir.1998) <em>(quoting United States v. Daniel, </em>956 F.2d 540, 543 (6th Cir.1992)). A limited exception applies when the record is sufficient to determine the merits of the defendant\u2019s allegations. <em>Id. </em>Such is not the case here. It is not readily apparent that Hubbard\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally deficient. The court, therefore, declines to address this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In his final issue on appeal, Hubbard challenges the three-level enhancement in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for his aggravating role in the offense and his two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 301.1(a) for obstruction of justice. Hubbard first argues that these enhancements are in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Hubbard\u2019s second argument is that these enhancements are not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The district court\u2019s assessment of a defendant\u2019s role in criminal activity is a factual determination reviewed on appeal for clear error. <em>United States v. Caseslorente, </em>220 F.3d 727, 734 (6th Cir.2000). In reviewing sentencing determinations, this court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Smith, </em>39 F.3d 119, 122 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\"><em>Apprendi </em>is inapplicable in this case. The Supreme Court decided in <em>Apprendi </em>that the Constitution requires any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 490. Hubbard was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute more than five kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The statutory maximum for this crime is life imprisonment. Yet, Hubbard was sentenced to 262 months. Clearly, this sentence is less than life imprisonment. A sentence increased pursuant to the sentencing guidelines based on a court\u2019s findings by a preponderance of the evidence is not improper when the defendant\u2019s sentence falls within the statutory maximum for the crime. <em>United States v. Schulte, </em>264 F.3d 656, 660 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Hubbard\u2019s claim that the enhancements are unsupported by the evidence is likewise unavailing. The district court gave the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice after determining that Hubbard perjured himself on the stand. The court further enhanced the offense level by three levels after determining that Hubbard was a manager or supervisor based on his supervisory control over Garner. A simple review of the record reveals that these findings are not in clear error. Therefore, the sentence imposed by the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment as to all issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">.
