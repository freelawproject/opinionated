Our review of the docket sheet in that action reveals Cameron\u2019s responsive pleading was received by the district court and filed no later than July 8, 2002. Accordingly, although we grant Cameron leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we dismiss the mandamus petition as moot, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
