Because Mr. Ledesma has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">The background of Mr. Ledesma\u2019s activities and the trial leading to his conviction can be found in his direct appeal. <em>United States v. Ledesma, </em>203 F.3d 836, 2000 WL 155591 (10th Cir. Feb.14, 2000) (table). After pleading guilty to one count of unlawful reentry into the United States after having been deported, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), Mr. Ledesma was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>by a jury of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of methamphetamine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846. Mr. Ledesma was sentenced to a concurrent sentence totaling 240 months, a $4,000 fine, and a $200 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Mr. Ledesma filed his \u00a7 2255 petition in the district court, claiming that his conviction should be vacated because (1) the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment failed to specify the quantity of methamphetamine; and (2) the sentencing judge determined the quantity of methamphetamine instead of the jury, thus violating the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court rejected these arguments on the following grounds: (1) Mr. Ledesma did not raise the issues in his direct appeal, and failed to show cause and resulting prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice to overcome the procedural bar; and (2) even if he had not defaulted, Mr. Ledesma\u2019s sentence was within the twenty year statutory maximum and, therefore, <em>Apprendi </em>was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We agree with the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir.2002), we held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable retroactively to initial habeas petitions. We add that even if the indictment should have included drug quantity, it does not deprive a court of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1783-85, 152 L.Ed.2d 860. Further, the Supreme Court held that no constitutional violation occurs where a judge finds \u201ca fact increasing the mandatory minimum (but not extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum).... \u201d <em>Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). In such a circumstance, \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict has authorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the jury\u2019s verdict, even without a finding regarding methamphetamine quantity, allowed the district court to sentence Mr. Ledesma within the twenty-year statutory maximum of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>237 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir. 2001) (no <em>Apprendi </em>violation where the sentence fell within the statutory range of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">Therefore, for substantially the same reasons given by the district court, we DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments;- nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. It appears from the district court docket entries that Mr. Ledesma may have filed his notice of appeal untimely. The district court, however, did not enter a separate Fed. R.Civ.P. 58 judgment. As such, we will proceed to the determination of whether to grant a COA to Mr. Ledesma. <em>See Allison v. Bank One-Denver, </em>289 F.3d 1223, 1232-33 (10th Cir.2002) (accepting jurisdiction where no Rule 58 judgment had been entered).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
