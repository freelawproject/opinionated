We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>see TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-22\">\u201cA dismissal for failure to state a claim is proper oMy if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Arpin v. Santa Clam Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 923 (9th Cir.2001)(quotations omitted). It is conceivable that Gorstein could allege facts constituting a federal claim. <em>Cf Lopez v. Washington Mutual Bank, FA, </em>302 F.3d 900, at---(9th Cir.2002) (holding that a bank does not violate 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) when it automatically applies social security funds to a debt so long as the social security recipient voluntarily agreed to directly deposit his social security funds into the account with knowledge that the funds would be applied in such a fashion). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>We therefore reverse and remand for the district court to permit Gorstein an opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Gorstein\u2019s motion to file a late reply brief is granted.
