BEEZER, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b189-15\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b189-16\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b189-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">The Marsh Group appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4, <em>et seq., </em>of its securities fraud class action claims against Prime Retail, Inc., and several of Prime Retail\u2019s senior officers and directors. For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-20\">Prime Retail is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that owns, constructs, leases, markets, and manages outlet centers throughout the nation. Between 1994 \u2014 the year of Prime Retail\u2019s first public offering of securities \u2014 and 1998, the company experienced explosive growth, with its annual funds from operations (FFO), a common indicator of REIT financial health, jumping from $25.8 million to $89 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-21\">Prime Retail earns revenues mostly from percentage lease arrangements with retailers in its outlets. As a REIT, it does not pay federal income tax, but it is required to distribute 95% of its income to share-holders as dividends. Up until the fourth quarter of 1999, the company was paying quarterly dividends in amounts representing approximately 15% growth over the same quarter in the prior year.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In 1998, Prime Retail announced two important developments: First, that it was acquiring Horizon Group Inc., another outlet center owner; and second, that it was embarking on international operations by developing an outlet center in Puerto Rico. As a result of the Horizon acquisition, consummated in June 1998, the company doubled its size and became the nation\u2019s largest outlet center owner, with 51 malls in 26 states.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The Appellants<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> allege that various company insiders were aware that the company was deteriorating during this time period. According to the Appellants, by spring 1999, it was apparent to the company\u2019s senior management that the Horizon properties needed significant improvement funds, additional personnel, and improved management expertise. Internal company reports allegedly showed that vacancies were rising, and revenues were falling. The Puerto Rico project ran into immediate problems because the company could not obtain a construction loan and had to develop the property using internal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">According to the Appellants, despite management\u2019s awareness of these problems, Prime Retail remained very optimistic in publicly describing the company\u2019s financial results and prospects. The focus of this appeal is on statements made to securities analysts, primarily David Fick of Legg Mason Wood Walker, Inc. The allegedly false statements were made in the second half of 1999 and during January of 2000, and related to the company\u2019s financial results and dividends for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On August 12, 1999, Prime Retail reported that its FFO for the second quarter of 1999 had increased by 52% ($9 million) and that its FFO for the first six months of 1999 had increased 61%, when compared to the same periods in 1998. On the strength of these results, Prime Retail declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock for the second quarter in the amount of $0.295 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">David Fick\u2019s first report was issued on August 13, 1999, the day after the company\u2019s second quarter earnings press release. Fick reaffirmed his \u201cBuy\u201d recommendation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">Management has assured the investment community repeatedly that Prime\u2019s current dividend is sacred. As noted in our previous wires, a cut in the dividend is unlikely unless the debt maturities and other capital requirements are not funded; the company has good coverage based on current and projected funds from operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Consol. Am. Compl. 1151. In a brief report on October 1, 1999, Fick reaffirmed his \u201cBuy\u201d recommendation, stating: \u201cImportantly, management stated to us this week that continued payment of the common dividend remains \u2018sacrosanct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">In addition to the Fick reports, the Appellants allege that during a meeting with analysts from Friedman Billings Ramsey, Inc. on October 15, 1999, defendants Rosenthal and Mulreany \u201cstated very clearly that [Prime Retail] is committed to the current dividend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Prime Retail announced its third quarter results and dividend on November 8, 1999. The company issued a press release, stating: \u201cFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 1999, FFO per diluted share increased 2.7% and 13.0%, respectively, compared to the same 1998 periods.\u201d Again, Prime Retail de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>dared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On November 9, 1999, Fick issued another analyst report, lowering his rating of Prime Retail to \u201cMarket Performance\u201d (i.e., performance in line with the market generally). Under the heading \u201cValuation,\u201d Fick wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Our thesis for the stock over the past year has been predicated on dividend safety. Management has repeatedly expressed confidence that there are no circumstances under which the dividend would be cut, short of the unlikely event of substantial tenant foreclosures. However, the company found itself in a position this quarter whereby it had not completed refinancing of a major debt maturity coming due October 31. The unsettled outcome of the maturity and management\u2019s resulting inability to put the dividend declaration before the board places enough evidence in front of us that the dividend is more at risk than previously acknowledged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\"><em>Id. </em>H 56; J.A. 132. On November 17, 1999, during the regular quarterly conference call with analysts and interested investors, Prime Retail\u2019s management reiterated their commitment to continuing to pay dividends. A J.P. Morgan analyst report dated November 18, 1999, summarized the conference call as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">Management is fully committed to $1.18 dividend. There were a number of questions on the conference call related to whether PRT would consider cutting its common dividend to help fund a share buyback____ Management said that this is not an option because they feel a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to their shareholders. This position is in line with previous statements on dividends and should be reassuring to investors who are attracted to PRT\u2019s high yield. Consol. Am. Compl. 1157. On December 10, 1999, an update report by Fick, which retained his current rating for Prime Retail, noted that \u201cPRT\u2019s management repeatedly has stated its commitment to paying its common dividend. However we wonder whether PRT will have the necessary funds to pay the dividend going forward ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>1158; J.A. 134.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">According to the Appellants, investors began to learn the truth about Prime Retail in mid-January 2000. On January 14, Fick issued a report stating that \u201ceven we are surprised\u201d by the results of a Legg Mason \u201cinspection\u201d at some of the company\u2019s lower-performing outlet centers, which showed \u201ceroding fundamentals.\u201d Consol. Am. Compl. 1162. The report also noted that defendant Michael Reschke (Prime Retail\u2019s board chairman) had known about these matters at least since late 1999 from an industry association\u2019s letter to him on behalf of tenants complaining about deteriorating conditions at the outlet centers. <em>Id. </em>With respect to the dividend, Fick reported that two factors\u2014 sufficient cash flow and \u201cmanagement\u2019s absolute commitment to fully fund its existing dividend\u201d \u2014 supported the market\u2019s confidence in ongoing dividend payments. \u201cOn several occasions management unequivocally stated that it staked its reputation on its commitment to continue to pay the company\u2019s dividend.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">Fick\u2019s report of January 14, 2000, had an immediate negative effect on the market price of Prime Retail\u2019s stock. On that day (a Friday), the market price dropped from $5.50 to $4.125 per share, a 25% decline, with a trading volume 18 times higher than the company\u2019s three-month average. The drop, however, was tempered by the company\u2019s strong affirmation that it was properly maintaining its properties, and that it would \u201cdecide the fate of the dividend later this month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>H 63. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the next trading day, January 18, 2000 (a Tuesday after a holiday weekend), Prime Retail announced that it would not pay a dividend for the fourth quarter of 1999. As Prime Retail would report in its annual report on Form 10-K for 1999, revenues for the fourth quarter of 1999 were only slightly lower than revenues for each of the three previous quarters of 1999. However, FFO and net income were substantially below the earlier quarters\u2019 results due to non-recurring charges and expenses of $36,359,000, as well as a loss of $15,153,000 on the sale of real estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">Prime Retail further advised investors that it believed the company\u2019s FFO for the year 2000 would be lower than originally projected, due to \u201can anticipated decline in occupancy and property level net operating income at a limited number of the Company\u2019s outlet centers in the bottom quartile of its portfolio.\u201d The market price of the company\u2019s shares dropped another 37%, to close at $2.625. <em>Id. </em>H 64.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">Later in the year, most of the company\u2019s officers left or were terminated by the board, including defendants Rosenthal, Reschke and Mulreany. <em>Id. </em>H1\u00cd 66, 67. By May 2001, the common stock\u2019s market price was only $0.36 per share. <em>Id. </em>f 68. Prime Retail\u2019s stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in September 2001, and Prime Retail did not pay any dividends in 2000 or 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">The Appellants filed a class action suit in the District of Maryland, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78t, and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, on behalf of purchasers of Prime Retail\u2019s stock between May 28, 1999, and January 18, 2000. The Appellees moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">4(a)-(c). The district court granted the motion. This appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We review dismissals pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Markari, </em>7 F.3d 1130, 1134 (4th Cir.1993). The Court presumes that the allegations in the complaint are true, and gives the plaintiff the benefit of every favorable inference that can be drawn from the allegations. <em>Id. </em>It is well settled that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [the plaintiffs] claim which would entitle [the plaintiff] to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (footnote omitted). Claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 10b and Rule 10b-5 are subject to the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA. The PSLRA requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that each statement alleged to have been misleading be identified in the complaint, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l), and that the complaint plead scienter with particularity, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The Appellants make two arguments on appeal. First, they argue that the district court erred in finding the alleged misstatements immaterial as a matter of law. Second, the Appellants argue that the district court erred when it held that Prime Retail cannot be held hable for fraudulent statements made to analysts the company did not control. We find that binding circuit precedent requires us to hold that the alleged misstatements were immaterial. We decline to reach the Appellants\u2019 second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The materiality standard for an aheged misrepresentation under \u00a7 10(b) \u201cis an ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>jective one,\u201d and the issue generally presents a question of fact involving \u201cthe significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor.\u201d <em>Gasner v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>103 F.3d 351, 356 (4th Cir.1996). In <em>Basic v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988), the Supreme Court set forth the standard for materiality: In the \u00a7 10b context, an omitted fact is material if there is \u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231-32 (quoting <em>TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The district court found that the alleged misstatements made by Prime Retail did not meet this standard of materiality, based on the line of circuit precedent starting with <em>Raab v. General Physics Corp., </em>4 F.3d 286 (4th Cir.1993). In <em>Raab, </em>General Physics, a provider of personnel training and technical support services to the domestic nuclear power industry, made the following statement in its annual report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoj\">Regulatory changes resulting from (accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl], combined with the rising importance of environmental restoration and waste management, have created a marketplace for the DOE Services Group with an expected annual growth rate of 10% to 30% over the next several years.... [T]he DOE Services Group is poised to carry the growth and success of 1991 well into the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 289. In a press release that same day, General Physics announced that first quarter earnings for 1992 were likely to be half of analysts\u2019 estimates, and also stated that \u201cconditions in the 1st quarter are temporary and that results during the remainder of the 1992[sic] should be in line with analysts\u2019 current projections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Regarding the alleged misstatements in the annual report, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">\u201cSoft,\u201d \u201cpuffing\u201d statements such as these generally lack materiality because the market price of a share is not inflated by vague statements predicting growth.... The whole discussion of growth is plainly by way of loose prediction, and both the range of rates cited, as well as the time for their achievement, are anything but definite. No reasonable investor would rely on these statements, and they are certainly not specific enough to perpetrate a fraud on the market. Analysts and arbitrageurs rely on facts in determining the value of a security, not mere expressions of optimism from company spokesmen. The market gives the most credence to those predictions supported by specific statements of fact, and those statements are, of course, actionable if false or misleading. However, \u201cprojections of future performance not worded as guarantees are generally not actionable under the federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Krim v. BancTexas Group, Inc., </em>989 F.2d 1435, 1446 (5th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Friedman v. Mohasco Corp., </em>929 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1991)). Statements such as \u201cthe DOE Services Group is poised to carry the growth and success of 1991 well into the future\u201d hardly constitute a guarantee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 290. And we further held that the statement that future results \u201cshould be in line with analysts\u2019 current projections ... [,]\u201d did not \u201cconstitute! ] a guarantee that earnings would be forthcoming in particular amounts....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291. We rested our decision in <em>Raab </em>on the difference between statements of current facts and forward-looking statements, explaining our view as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Predictions of future growth stand on a different footing, however, because they will almost always prove to be wrong in hindsight. If a company predicts twenty-five percent growth, that is simply the company\u2019s best guess as to how the future will play out. As a statistical matter, twenty percent and thirty percent growth are both nearly as likely as twenty-five. If growth proves less than predicted, buyers will sue; if growth proves greater, sellers will sue. Imposing liability would put companies in a whipsaw, - with a lawsuit almost a certainty. Such liability would deter companies from discussing their prospects, and the securities markets would be deprived of the information those predictions offer. We believe that this is contrary to the goal of full disclosure underlying the securities laws, and we decline to endorse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We reaffirmed the reasoning of <em>Raab </em>in <em>Malone v. Microdyne Corp., </em>26 F.3d 471 (4th Cir.1994), and <em>Hillson Partners Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Adage Inc., </em>42 F.3d 204 (4th Cir.1994). In <em>Malone, </em>we held that a statement of \u201ccomfort\u201d with an analyst\u2019s earnings estimate was immaterial as a matter of law, stating: \u201cMisstatements or omissions regarding actual past or present facts are far more likely to be actionable than statements regarding projections of future performance. Generally, the latter will be deemed actionable ... only if they are supported by specific statements of fact or are worded as guarantees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479-80. And in <em>Hillson, </em>we again applied <em>Raab </em>in rejecting as immaterial claims based on a number of forward-looking statements not worded as guarantees or supported by specific facts. 42 F.3d at 21-16 (statements, <em>inter alia, </em>that company was \u201con target toward achieving the most profitable year in its history,\u201d that \u201csignificant sales gains should be seen as the year progresses,\u201d and that a project was \u201con schedule\u201d were \u201cnot material as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Given the background of <em>Raab </em>and its progeny, we are constrained to find that the alleged misstatements in this case are immaterial and hence not actionable. The allegedly false forward-looking statements in this case were various permutations of management\u2019s expression of \u201ccommitment\u201d to paying the .quarterly dividend. Management alternately stated that the dividend was \u201csacred\u201d or \u201csacrosanct\u201d or that it \u201cstaked its reputation on its commitment to continue to pay the company\u2019s dividend.\u201d Finally, in response to an analyst\u2019s question regarding the possibility of a share buyback, management stated that such a buyback was not an option because its feeling of a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to continue to pay the current dividend. These projections of future performance are indistinguishable from the statements we held were non-actionable in <em>Raab, Malone, </em>and <em>Hillson. </em>Like the statements alleged to be false in those cases, the statements made by the Appellees are not guarantees and lack the factual specificity necessary to make them actionable in this circuit. Therefore, the statements are immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We also reject the Appellants\u2019 attempt to distinguish <em>Raab, Malone, </em>and <em>Hillson </em>by arguing that Prime Retail\u2019s allegedly false statements were statements of present intention to pay dividends, rather than forward-looking projections of future dividends. All projections can be characterized as presently held beliefs. The statements are forward-looking because they relate to \u201cfuture economic performance.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(i)(l)(C). The PSLRA explicitly defines forward-looking statements as including \u201ca projection of ... dividends,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 78u-5(i)(l)(A), and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>statement relating to such a projection, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 78u-5(i)(l)(D). Finally, many of the statements in our prior cases could have been characterized as statements of present belief regarding future events. <em>See, e.g., Hillson, </em>42 F.3d at 213-15 (statements that project was \u201con schedule\u201d and company was \u201con track\u201d for increased earnings were forward-looking); <em>Malone, </em>26 F.3d at 479-80 (statement of \u201ccomfort\u201d with analysts\u2019 earnings estimate was forward-looking). Accordingly, our holdings in <em>Raab, Malone, </em>and <em>Hillson </em>are fully applicable in this case. Those cases dictate that the allegedly false statements made by Prime Retail are immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">For the above stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> Appellant Marsh Group, an investor group, was appointed Lead Plaintiff pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
