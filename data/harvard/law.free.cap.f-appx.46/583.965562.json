We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 llOSaCa).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review for substantial evidence and will reverse the BIA\u2019s determination only if the petitioner shows that the evidence compels such a result. <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The harassment Garcia allegedly received from guerillas on account of his military service was limited to vague and unfulfilled threats, and therefore does not compel a fact-finder to conclude that such treatment rose to the level of persecution. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that threats standing alone generally do not constitute past persecution). Garcia\u2019s fear of future persecution is not objectively well-founded because he did not adduce \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record, of facts that would support a reasonable fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 413 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Because Garcia failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-24\">. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, deportation proceedings initiated prior to April 1, 1997, for which a final order of deportation is issued after October 30, 1996, are subject to the transitional rules. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150-51 (9th Cir.1997). Because deportation proceedings were initiated against Garcia on May 4, 1995, and a final order of deportation was issued on December 18, 2001, the transitional rules apply to his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
