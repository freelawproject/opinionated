We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Botosan v. Paul McNally Realty, </em>216 F.3d 827, 830 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment for Superior Court Judge Borst on the ground of absolute judicial immunity because presiding over McLaughlin\u2019s trial was clearly a judicial act. <em>See Rosenthal v. Justices of the Supreme Court of California, </em>910 F.2d 561, 565-66 (9th Cir.1990). County Superior Court Administrator Rendon is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity because the act of setting McLaughlin\u2019s trial dates was an integral part of the judicial process. <em>Cf. Curry v. Castillo (In re Castillo), </em>297 F.3d 940, 951-53 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that the scheduling and noticing of hearings by a bankruptcy trustee is a discretionary function protected by absolute immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-26\">We affirm summary judgment on McLaughlin\u2019s negligence claim against Ok<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>anogan County for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s October 4, 2001 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b549-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may <em>not be </em>cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
