Walker appeals from the district court\u2019s substitution of the United States as a defendant under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and dismissal of her tort claims in the action she filed against her former employer, Chugachmiut, a tribal consortium, and Robert Henrichs, a member of Chugachmiut\u2019s board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Walker contends that the district court lacked removal jurisdiction over the instant action because the United States was not a party defendant at the time of removal and she \u201cclearly chose to eschew any claims based upon federal law\u201d in her complaint. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to remand for want of removal jurisdiction. <em>Ethridge v. Harbor House Rest, </em>861 F.2d 1389,1393 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Removal of this action was mandatory. Any civil action against a tribal organization, or one of its employees acting within the scope of employment, for tort claims resulting from the carrying out of an Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cISDEA\u201d) contract \u201cshall be deemed to be an action against the United States\u201d under the FTCA. Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 101-512, Title III, \u00a7 314, 104 Stat. 1915, 1959 (Nov. 5,1990) (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450f note) [hereinafter Section 314], Any such action that is originally filed in state court therefore is removable to federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b)(1), 1441(a), 2679(d)(2) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">The FTCA, which Section 314 incorporates by reference, specifies that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-17\"><em>Upon certification by the Attorney General </em>that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, <em>any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed </em>without bond at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending. <em>Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (emphasis added). In the instant case, the United States Attorney for the District of Alaska certified on behalf of the Attorney General<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Walker\u2019s tort claims against Chugachmiut and Henrichs arose from the carrying out of an ISDEA contract and that Henrichs was acting within the scope of his employment during the relevant time period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This certification satisfied the requirements of the FTCA and Section 314. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u201cOnce certification is given in a civil action, the [FTCA] mandates both the substitution of the United States as the defendant ..., and, if initiated in state court, the removal of the action to the United States District Court.\u201d <em>Meridian Int\u2019l Logistics, Inc. v. United States, </em>939 F.2d 740, 743-44 (9th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). The district court did not err in ruling that it had removal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Walker argues the district court erred in substituting the United States as a defendant for Chugachmiut and Henrichs based on the United States Attorney\u2019s certification. We review de novo whether the United States was properly substituted as a defendant for an Indian contractor, tribal organization, or its employee. <em>Green v. Hall, </em>8 F.3d 695, 698 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam). \u201cWhere facts relevant to this inquiry are in dispute, however, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c[t]he Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding scope of employment certification is conclusive unless challenged[,] ... the party seeking review bears the burden of presenting evidence and disproving the Attorney General\u2019s decision to grant ... scope of employment certification by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Walker\u2019s argument that Chugachmiut is not covered by the FTCA because it is \u201cnot an Indian tribe\u201d is not persuasive. Chugachmiut is a tribal organization that entered into an ISDEA contract entitled Alaska Tribal Health Compact Between Certain Alaska Native Tribes and the United States of America (\u201cCompact\u201d). Pursuant to the Compact, Chugachmiut is covered by the FTCA, and its \u201cemployees ... are deemed by statute to be part of or employed by the Public Health Service ... for purposes of coverage under the [FTCA], while performing programs, activities, functions or services under this Compact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">Similarly, Henrichs is covered by the FTCA as a Chugachmiut employee. Henrichs is a member of Chugachmiut\u2019s Board of Directors. The only evidence Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>presented to contradict the certification was her conclusory affidavit: \u201cWhile I was Executive Director ... Henrichs was never an employee of Chugachmiut.\u201d The district court\u2019s finding \u201cHenrichs to have been an employee of the Government\u201d is not clearly erroneous, as it is supported by the Attorney General\u2019s certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Walker also contends that substitution of the United States was improper because Chugachmiut and Henrichs were not acting in furtherance of an ISDEA contract when she was fired. Walker has not presented any evidence to rebut the United States Attorney\u2019s certification that Chugachmiut was acting pursuant to the Compact in connection with Walker\u2019s termination. Walker merely argues that Chugachmiut could not have been acting pursuant to the Compact when she was terminated because Chugachmiut was also a party to other non-self-determination contracts. Chugachmiut\u2019s involvement in other contracts does not affect its ability to act in furtherance of the Compact by firing Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Similarly, Walker falls short of rebutting the United States Attorney\u2019s scope of employment certification as to Henrichs. To determine whether Henrichs was acting within the scope of his employment, we apply the respondeat superior principles of Alaska, the state in which the alleged tort occurred. <em>Green, </em>8 F.3d at 698-99. Walker argues that her termination could not have been in furtherance of the Compact because her employment had little connection with the business of providing services under the Compact. Walker misses the point. The issue is whether <em>Henrichs, </em>as a board member, was acting in furtherance of the Compact in connection with her termination, and whether his actions were \u201c 'actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve\u2019 \u201d Chugachmiut. <em>VECO, Inc. v. Rosebrock, </em>970 P.2d 906, 910 n. 7 (Alaska 1999) (quoting Restatement (2d) of Agency \u00a7 228(l)(c)). Walker has not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Henrichs was not acting within the scope of his employment and in furtherance of the Compact. <em>See Green, </em>8 F.3d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">, Walker asserts that the district court erred in dismissing her tort claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>211 F.3d 499, 502 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Walker\u2019s tort claims was not erroneous. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983). The FTCA specifically provides that the Government has not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of ... libel, slander, ... or interference with contract rights.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). The FTCA also bars the award of punitive damages. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. Because substitution of the United States was appropriate, the district court was correct to dismiss Walker\u2019s claims for defamation, interference with contract, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">The district court also dismissed, albeit without prejudice, Walker\u2019s claims for negligent investigation and emotional distress. A suit in which the United States is substituted for a private defendant under Section 314 is subject to the FTCA\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff file an administrative claim against the relevant federal agency before an FTCA suit may go forward. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). Walker has not filed an administrative claim regarding her tort allegations for negligent investigation and emotional distress. Therefore, the district court did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>dismissing without prejudice Walker\u2019s claims for negligent investigation and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Walker also contends: (1) that her tort claims should not have been dismissed because they are employment claims that are not subject to the FTC A; and (2) that her tort claims are not covered by the FTCA because the Government purchased private insurance for Chugachmiut. Walker cites to no legal authority, however, supporting these contentions. \u201cThe federal rules require the brief to contain \u2018the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefore, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on.\u2019 \u201d <em>Acosta-Huerta v. Estelle, </em>7 F.3d 139, 144 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(4)). Because Walker\u2019s brief does not comport with the requirements of Rule 28, these contentions are deemed abandoned. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-18\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-19\">.
