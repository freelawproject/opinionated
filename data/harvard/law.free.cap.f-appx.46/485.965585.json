We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determinations at sentencing. <em>United States v. Asagba, </em>77 F.3d 324, 325 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-21\">Contrary to Turner\u2019s contention, the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Instead, the district court\u2019s factual findings were supported by the presentence report and the declaration of an FBI Special Agent. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-22\">Turner also contends that the district court erred by enhancing his robbery sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) (providing a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f any person was physically restrained to facilitate commission of the offense\u201d). Given Turner\u2019s application of force and the sustained focus of the shotgun, the district court properly applied a two-level enhancement. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>241 F.3d 1114, 1118-119 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b533-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
