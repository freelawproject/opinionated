Norris and Ruth L. Norris (collectively, the \u201cTaxpayers\u201d) appeal pro se the tax court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination for the tax year 1995 based on the Taxpayers\u2019 failure to include as gross income Mr. Norris\u2019s disability retirement payments. We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482, and, after de novo review, <em>Take v. Commissioner, </em>804 F.2d 553, 555 (9th Cir. 1986), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Under the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), certain amounts received under statutes in the nature of workmen\u2019s compensation acts are excludable from gross income. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.104-l(b). To qualify as a workmen\u2019s compensation act under the Code, \u201ca statute must require, as a precondition to eligibility for benefits, that the injury be incurred in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Take, </em>804 F.2d at 557. If the statute does not qualify as a workmen\u2019s compensation act, then it is irrelevant whether the underlying injury was work-related. <em>See id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">The Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d) does not require that an injury be incurred in the course of employment. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8451(a)(1)(B) (employee is disabled if he is \u201cunable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee\u2019s position\u201d). Therefore, the tax court correctly concluded that Mr. Norris\u2019s FERS disability retirement benefits were not excludable from the Taxpayers\u2019 gross income. <em>See Take, </em>804 F.2d at 557-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">The Taxpayers\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
