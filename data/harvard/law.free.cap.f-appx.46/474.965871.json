We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, <em>Abboud v. INS, </em>140 F.3d 843, 846 (9th Cir.1998), and may affirm on any grounds finding support in the record, <em>Kling v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., </em>225 F.3d 1030, 1039 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">Santoso contends that defendants violated his due process rights by terminating</p>\n<p id=\"b522-19\">his removal proceedings without a hearing on his asylum claim or an opportunity to appeal. Because Santoso\u2019s asylum claim has now been adjudicated on the merits, and he has had the opportunity to appeal the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum to the Board of Immigration Appeals, Santoso\u2019s claims are moot. <em>See Di Giorgio v. Lee (In re Di Giorgio), </em>134 F.3d 971, 974 (9th Cir.1998) (qualifying for adjudication in federal court requires an actual controversy at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-20\">We reject Santoso\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b522-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
