Goodlett\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as potentially meritorious issues the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Goodlett as a career offender and its refusal to depart downward for substantial assistance without a government motion, but asserting that in his view there are no meritious issues for appeal. Goodlett has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising three additional issues and requesting leave to supplement the record. We grant Goodlett\u2019s motion to supplement and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">We find first that the district court properly sentenced Goodlett as a career offender. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). Goodlett had pri- or convictions for numerous instances of burglary and one conviction for housebreaking. He was sentenced for all these offenses on the same day in 1989. Goodlett argued at sentencing that the cases were related and should be treated as one prior offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.3). However, Goodlett was arrested for the burglaries before he committed the housebreaking. Because of this intervening arrest, the district court was required to consider the burglaries and the housebreaking as separate offenses. <em>Id. </em>We also find no error in the district court\u2019s decision not to depart under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 because a government motion for such a departure is required. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). The court found no evidence that the government\u2019s failure to move for a departure was based on an unconstitutional motive or unrelated to a legitimate government end and thus had no basis for further inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Goodlett again contests his career offender sentence and further contends that the district court lacked authority to sentence him as a career offender because the government failed to give timely notice, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000), that it would seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>an enhanced sentence. However, this notice requirement applies only to statutory sentence enhancements, not enhancements under the guidelines. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>68 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1995). Last, Goodlett maintains that the failure to include his prior convictions in the indictment as elements of the offense violated due process. He acknowledges that his position is in conflict with <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We find no error in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
