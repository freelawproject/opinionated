The parties have waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The debtors, James A. Wallace, Jr., and Judith A. Wallace, filed a Chapter 13 petition on July 10, 2000. The debtors scheduled a $4,860.00 claim owing to the Credit Union resulting from a note and security agreement dated May 11, 2000, through which the debtors borrowed $5,019.66. By the terms of the note and security agreement, the debtors granted the Credit Union a security interest in their 1996 Geo Metro. The Credit Union properly perfected its lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 plan provides that the Credit Union debt will be paid outside the plan by the debtors\u2019 daughter, who was not a party to the original loan. The Credit Union agreed to its treatment under the plan, and the plan was confirmed on September 6, 2000, without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Since confirmation, the Geo Metro experienced \u201cmajor mechanical problems\u201d and was wrecked. The Credit Union had not received a payment on its debt since September 18, 2000. Pursuant to an Agreed Order entered on November 1, 2000, the debtors surrendered the Geo Metro to the Credit Union, which then sold the car for $500.00. A balance of $4,401.22 remained on the debt, excluding interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Thereafter, the Credit Union filed a motion to dismiss the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329, asserting that a <em>de facto </em>modification of the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 plan occurred. The bankruptcy court found insufficient cause for dismissal of the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 case and denied the Credit Union\u2019s motion to dismiss. The. district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">This court reviews directly a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, not the district court\u2019s review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>Trident Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Metro Life Ins. Co. (In re Trident </em>Assocs. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship), </em>52 F.3d 127, 130 (6th Cir.1995). This court reviews the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>See Invs. Credit Corp. v. Batie (In re Batie), </em>995 F.2d 85, 88 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Whether the bankruptcy court erred when it refused to dismiss the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 case is a question of law subject to de novo review, as all material facts in this case were stipulated pursuant to a written Stipulation of Facts filed by the parties. Thus, neither party challenges any factual findings of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">Upon review, we conclude that the bankruptcy court properly denied the Credit Union\u2019s motion to dismiss the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 case for the reasons stated by that court in its well-reasoned opinion filed March 6, 2001. In this case, the Credit Union acquiesced in the Chapter 13 plan releasing the debtors\u2019 liability on the note. The Credit Union agreed to look to a third party for payment. \u201cThe provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327(a); <em>see also Cline v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Welch (In re Welch), </em>No. 97-5080, 1998 WL 773999, at <em>*2 </em>(6th Cir. Oct.ll, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Moreover, creditors are bound by the terms of a confirmed plan unless the plan is abandoned by the debtor. <em>See In re Pearson, </em>214 B.R. 156, 160 (Bankr. N.D.Ohio 1997). The <em>\u201cde facto </em>modification\u201d asserted by the Credit Union does not involve conduct of the debtors. Clearly, a third party has failed to comply with the plan\u2019s provisions. That third party\u2019s breach, however, cannot be considered a plan modification by the debtors where the Credit Union freely released the debtors from any further liability on this debt. Therefore, the bankruptcy court was correct in finding insufficient cause for dismissal of the debtors\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
