He was then deported to Mexico, where he is a citizen. Medina later reentered the United States without the permission of the Attorney General, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). While in Manhattan, Medina was arrested by Drug Enforcement Administration agents. Medina pleaded guilty to the sole charge lodged against him \u2014 illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">The United States Probation Office recommended that Medina be sentenced at the bottom of a sentencing range of 41 to 51 months. Medina did not challenge this calculation but sought a downward departure based on what he characterized as his \u201ccultural assimilation.\u201d At the same time, Medina claims to be a \u201cstranger in this land.\u201d The thrust of his argument is captured in the following paragraph from his submission to the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-17\">In the case at bar Mr. Medina illegally re-entered the United States so he could visit with his family. His understanding of American law, customs, mores, etc., is limited at best. His lack of any education above the fourth grade, his unskilled job in Mexico, his clear devotion to his family manifested by a willingness to break the law just to see his wife and two young boys, all militate in favor [of] a downward departure based upon Mr. Medina\u2019s Mexican/Hispanic heritage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-18\">We agree with the district court that the departure application, as more fully elaborated at the sentencing hearing, was essentially based on Medina\u2019s familial ties. As to that ground, the district court noted that Medina came forth with no fact that would distinguish this case from most other illegal reentry cases. On that basis, the district court refused to grant a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-19\">Ordinarily, a district court\u2019s refusal to depart from the Guidelines is not appeal-able. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 692 (2d Cir.1996) <em>(per </em>curiam). We will, however, consider appeals in cases where a judge mistakenly believed that he or she was without power to grant a departure. But in order to disturb the usual presumption against appealability, there must be clear evidence of a \u201csubstantial risk that the judge misapprehended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>scope\u201d of his or her discretion to depart. <em>See United States v. Tenzer, </em>213 F.3d 34, 42 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the instant case, while the district judge did question whether he had the authority to depart in this case, he ultimately decided that the departure should be denied \u201cboth on law and in any case in the exercise of discretion.\u201d We therefore have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We have considered all of the defendant\u2019s arguments and find them meritless. Since this case presents none of the exceptions to the rule that decisions not to depart from the Guidelines are not reviewable, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
