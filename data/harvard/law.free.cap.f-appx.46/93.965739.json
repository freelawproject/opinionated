Ward, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b143-8\">SCIRICA, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">This is an appeal by defendant Andre Wilson from a conviction for conspiracy (in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371), false statements (in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant makes five primary arguments on appeal: (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional; (2) his convictions were supported by insufficient evidence; (3) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the photographic identification; (4) the trial court erred in refusing to preclude certain testimony; and (5) his sentence was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Because defendant\u2019s arguments are without merit, we will affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">First, Wilson contends 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him because there is \u201cno evidence that the instant violation involved interstate commerce.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This argument is without merit. As we have recently stated, proof that a gun had \u201ctraveled in interstate commerce, at some point in the past, [is] sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element....\u201d <em>Singletary, </em>268 F.3d at 205. Here, it was stipulated that the firearm in question had previously traveled in interstate commerce. Thus, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional as applied to defendant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">Second, Wilson contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove he was guilty of the offenses charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, his conviction was supported by the testimony of co-defendant Kint who testified he purchased multiple firearms for Wilson (including Government Exhibit 29A, a Llama .45 firearm). Kint also testified that he showed Wilson copies of the paperwork on which Kint lied that he was the actual buyer of the firearm. In addition, another witness stated Wilson possessed the firearm in question. It is clear, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>convicted the defendant. <em>Cothran, </em>286 F.3d at 175 (\u201cIt is not our role to weigh the evidence or to determine the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Third, Wilson contends the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress a photographic identification because it was too suggestive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument is also without merit. The District Court specifically found that the eleven-picture photo array was not \u201csuggestive at all ... I\u2019ve looked through it. The people in it are all black males, appear to be of similar ages and similar physical appearance. So, I find that it was not suggestive at all and applying the seven factors from <em>[United States v. Higgins, </em>458 F.2d 461 (3d Cir. 1972) ], it seems that ... this motion should be denied.\u201d We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Fourth, Wilson contends the District Court erred in admitting evidence in violation of Rule 404(b) and Rule 403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also contends he should have been granted a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rule 404(b) \u201cproscribes the admission of evidence of other crimes when offered to prove bad character,\u201d but \u201cdoes not apply to evidence of uncharged offenses committed by a defendant when those acts are intrinsic to the proof of the charged offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 217 (3d Cir.1999). Here, the District Court allowed Adams, Wilson\u2019s childhood friend, to testify that (1) he had received a firearm from Wilson (Government Exhibit 29A); (2) he subsequently returned Government Exhibit 29A to Wilson; and (3) Wilson told him \u201cCadillac William\u201d was later arrested possessing the same gun. This testimony was evidence that Wilson possessed Government Exhibit 29A, the firearm on which his conviction was based. Thus, as the District Court observed, this testimony was not barred by Rule 404(b) because \u201cit goes directly\u201d to issues material to the indictment and therefore constitutes intrinsic, not extrinsic evidence. In addition, we agree the testimony was not unduly prejudicial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial under Fed. R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">Finally, Wilson contends his sentence was illegal because (1) certain counts were not grouped; (2) the trial court erred by \u201cdouble penalizing\u201d; (3) the trial court erred in refusing to downgrade his criminal history points; (4) the trial court did not order the federal and state sentences to run concurrently; and (5) there was an improper sentencing disparity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">A. Grouping</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Wilson contends the conspiracy and aiding and abetting counts should have been grouped with the possession of a firearm count for sentencing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. But U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c) provides that \u201c[i]f the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is adequate to achieve the total punishment, then the sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court imposed a sentence of 115 months for the firearm count (i.e., the count with the highest statutory maximum) and concurrent 60-month sentences for the other two counts. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">B. Double Penalizing</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The alleged \u201cdouble penalizing\u201d is directed by the guidelines themselves. Note 15 of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 provides that \u201c[p]ri- or felony conviction(s) resulting in an increased base offense level under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4)(A), (a)(4)(B), or (a)(6) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).\u201d Hence, we see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">C. Criminal History</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">When a trial court, knowing it may do so, refuses a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review this decision. <em>United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 729 (3d Cir.1996). At sentencing, the prosecutor informed the court that adjusting the criminal history was within the court\u2019s discretion. Similarly, defense counsel instructed the court \u201cyou could also go down to a criminal history of two or three.... \u201d After this colloquy, the trial court stated that \u201cwith respect to ... the criminal history category ... I have heard you but I must say that I think this is clearly a category VI situation\u201d because the defendant had committed \u201cvery, very serious crimes,\u201d including past crimes of violence. Because we are satisfied the District Court neither misunderstood or misapplied its ability to apply a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">D. Consecutive State and Federal Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">We review a decision to impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Spiers, </em>82 F.3d 1274, 1277 (3d Cir.1996). During sentencing, the District Court exercised its discretion and imposed a federal sentence consecutive to the state sentence Wilson is presently serving. In light of all the facts and circumstances presented, we cannot say this was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">E. Sentencing Disparity</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">We have stated that \u201c[generally, disparities in sentences among co-defendants do not constitute a valid basis for downward departure in the absence of any proof of prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeaman, </em>248 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir.2001). In this case, there has been no allegation of prosecutorial misconduct. Moreover, Wilson\u2019s co-defendant was granted a lesser sentence because of his cooperation with the government. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">. Wilson was sentenced to 115 months of imprisonment to run consecutively with his 5-10 year state sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-12\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-19\">. We exercise plenary review over this question. <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196, 198 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-20\">. Our standard of review is \" \u2018particularly deferential\u2019 when deciding whether a jury verdict is based on legally sufficient evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>286 F.3d 173, 175 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. We review a district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>264 F.3d 321, 326-27 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\">. As noted, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Mathis, </em>264 F.3d at 326-27.

We review a denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Govt, of V.I. v.
