R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b504-22\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-23\">Herman J. Blueford, a California state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the denial of a habeas corpus petition, while we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Moran v. McDaniel, </em>80 F.3d 1261,1268 (9th Cir.1996). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-24\">Blueford first contends that his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation was violated on three separate occasions by the state trial court. Athough a criminal defendant does have a right to self-representation, <em>see Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the request to proceed pro se must be timely and unequivocal, and not made for the purpose of causing delay. <em>See Jackson v. Ylst, </em>921 F.2d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-25\">The district court properly determined that Blueford\u2019s requests to represent himself were not unequivocal, and the record supports that conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 889 (concluding that an emotional request for self-representation following an adverse ruling \u201cdid not demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that he in fact wished to represent himself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-26\">Blueford\u2019s second contention is that his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>rights were violated by the introduction at trial of a deceased witness\u2019s prior statement. This was not error because the statement was made under oath, and Blue-ford had been afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>See AcostarHuerta v. Estelle, </em>7 F.3d 139, 143 (9th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez-Ramirez, 111 </em>F.2d 454, 458 (9th Cir. 1985) (rejecting challenge to attorney\u2019s decision not to cross-examine a witness as appropriate strategic decision); <em>Shaw v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 528, 529 (8th Cir. 1968) (per curiam) (rejecting defendant\u2019s complaint, which he caused by refusing to cooperate with appointed counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Accordingly, the district court appropriately denied habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b504-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
