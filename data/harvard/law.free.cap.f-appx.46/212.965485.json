Rice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed this action in the district court asserting government officials and agencies conspired to import and distribute cocaine in urban, African-American neighborhoods and subvert the profits to the Nicaraguan Contra movement. The district court, on the recommendation of the magistrate judge, dismissed the action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (2000), and revoked Rice\u2019s unvested good time credits under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1932 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rice does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims were frivolous, so that portion of the district court\u2019s order is not properly before us. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Moreover, because the district court properly concluded that this action was malicious or was intended to harass the Defendants, notwithstanding Rice\u2019s self-serving statements to the contrary, we will not disturb the revocation of good time credits. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Rice v. National Security Council, </em>No. CA-00-3937-9-17AJ (D.S.C. June 8, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-18\">. We previously dismissed the appeal of Rice\u2019s co-PIaintiff for failure to prosecute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-25\"><em>. </em>There are two statutes designated as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1932; the district court\u2019s order involved the second \u00a7 1932.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
