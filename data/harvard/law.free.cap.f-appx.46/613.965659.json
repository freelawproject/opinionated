ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Defendant Robert Lee Bryant pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced him to thirty-five months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by term of supervised release-a sentence that is near the bottom of the applicable sentencing guideline range. At sentencing, the court denied Mr. Bryant\u2019s motion for downward departure. On appeal, Mr. Bryant challenges only the court\u2019s refusal to depart downward from the sentencing guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But because the district court understood its authority to depart, we lack jurisdiction to review its discretionary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Mr. Bryant acknowledges that this court has no jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary ruling on a motion for downward departure. <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 887 (10th Cir. 1998). His argument is that we should exercise jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the guidelines in reaching its discretionary decision-a situation he claims exists here because the district court erred in concluding that his particular set of circumstances did not remove his case from the heartland of typical cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">We have jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart from the sentencing guidelines [only] in the very rare circumstance that the district court states that it does not have any authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range for the entire class of circumstances proffered by the defendant. In other words, we possess no jurisdiction when a sentencing court concludes <em>under the defendant\u2019s particular circumstances </em>that it does not have the authority to depart.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-12\"><em>United States v. Mendez-Zamora, </em>296 F.3d 1013, 1018-19 (10th Cir.2002) (quotations and citations omitted). After reviewing the sentencing transcript, it is clear that the district court understood it had authority to depart downward, but it concluded that because the circumstances of the ease were within the heartland of typical cases, departure was not warranted. Further, this court has held that we have no jurisdiction to do what Mr. Bryant urges-examine the district court\u2019s decision on whether this case fell outside the heartland of typical cases so as to warrant departure. <em>See Castillo, </em>140 F.3d at 887 (stating that reviewing \u201cthe merits of whether the defendant\u2019s proffered circumstances are appropriate grounds for departure\u201d is not prerequisite to decision that court of appeals lacks jurisdiction and, in fact, is not authorized).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">We have no jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of the departure mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>tion. Consequently, we DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">. After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
