The district court held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) (2000), requiring detention without bail of certain categories of aliens during the pendency of removal proceedings, is unconstitutional on its face. The court ordered that Kimbembe receive a bond hearing before an immigration judge. The hearing was held, bond was set, and Kimbembe posted bond and was released from custody. In a recent decision we held that \u00a7 1226(c) is not unconstitutional on its face, but that the statute violated due process as applied in that case. <em>Welch v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 213 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Because our decision in <em>Welch </em>was based on the particular facts of the case, we conclude that we must remand this case to the district court for further proceedings. After allowing any necessary development of the record, the district court should reconsider its decision under <em>Welch </em>and determine whether \u00a7 1226(c) is unconstitutional as applied to Kimbembe. We vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and with our decision in <em>Welch. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
