He contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court deprived him of due process by imposing a sentence greater than Section 1326(a)\u2019s two-year maximum based on Roman-Gutierrez\u2019s prior aggravated felony, where he did not admit to having previously committed an aggravated felony. He also contends that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement to his sentence because his 1994 assault conviction was not considered an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) at the time of its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Roman-Gutierrez, who states that he presents the issues merely to preserve them in the event of ensuing favorable Supreme Court precedent, acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001), and <em>United States v.
