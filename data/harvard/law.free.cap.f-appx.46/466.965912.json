R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b514-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Willie Fred Brady, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the judgment of the district court dismissing sua sponte his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act screening provisions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A; 42 U.S.C.1997e(c)(l). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review de novo, <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998) (order). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">The district court properly determined that Brady did not state a claim against the various prison officials involved in handling Brady\u2019s grievances against correction officer Ohelert. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989); <em>see also Mann v. Adams, </em>855 F.2d 639, 640 (9th Cir.1988) (order) (holding no constitutional right to grievance process). The district court also properly determined that the complaint did not state a claim for violation of the right of access to the courts against correction officers Pun\u00eda and Munro because Brady did not allege that he suffered any actual injury as a result of the alleged failure of Punla and Munro to log Brady\u2019s legal mail. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 358, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-21\">It is not clear, however, that Brady would be unable to amend his complaint to state an actionable claim against policy-making officials. <em>See, e.g., Gomez v. Vernon, </em>255 F.3d 1118, 1127 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied sub nom Beauclair v. Gomez, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 667, 151 L.Ed.2d 581 (2001) (holding that a prison official\u2019s failure to take remedial action after violations were committed by his subordinates is actionable under section 1983 as a policy or practice claim). Therefore, the district court should have granted Brady leave to amend the complaint. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (holding that leave to amend should be granted even when no request for amendment was made).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-24\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to grant Brady the opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-25\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
