The applicable maximum supervised release term was five years, but the plea agreements recited, and the district court reiterated during the change of plea hearings, a maximum supervised release term of three years. The sentences imposed on both defendants included a supervised release term of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-25\">The government concedes that the failure to advise the defendants correctly of the maximum term of supervised release rendered their guilty pleas involuntary, and that the error is not harmless. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>5 F.3d 365, 368-70 (9th Cir.1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We remand and instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the district court to either reimpose the sentences with three-year terms of supervised release or allow the defendants to replead. <em>Id., </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">SENTENCES VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-27\">. Because the government concedes the guilty pleas are not voluntary, we do not reach appellants' contention that imposition of the five-year supervised release term amounted to a government violation of the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
