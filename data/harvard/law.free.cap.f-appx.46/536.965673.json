We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and review for abuse of discretion the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>case. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>241 F.3d 1096,1099 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The district court correctly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine \u201crelevant conduct\u201d at sentencing because the upward adjustment did not have an extremely disproportionate effect on Arenas-Medina\u2019s sentence relative to the offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 854 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The district court correctly found that the 44 pairs of false identification documents discovered at the document mill were produced in furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by Arenas-Medina and his co-defendants and their production was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). Thus, the documents constituted relevant conduct and were properly considered at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Newland, </em>116 F.3d 400, 403-04 (9th Cir.1997). Combined with the 96 to 180 pairs of false identification documents Arenas-Medina admitted to selling, the additional 44 sets of documents brought the total number above 100, and the district court correctly determined that Arenas-Medina should receive a nine-level sentence increase. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
