We have carefully reviewed the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, the Memorandum of Opinion and Order of the district court essentially adopting that Report and Recommendation, the record and the briefs, and oral arguments of the parties. We conclude that the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge thoroughly and accurately sets out both the undisputed facts and the governing law in this case, as does the Memorandum of Opinion of the district court adopting that Report and Recommendation. Because the issuance of a full written opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose and would be duplicative, we will affirm the judgment on the reasoning of the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We note that the magistrate judge and the district court differed with regard to one aspect of this case, which Beichler characterizes on appeal as the requirement that the court \u201cview Amy Beichler\u2019s post-layoff retaliation as further evidence of a sexually hostile environment under Ohio and federal law, as is required by <em>Williams v. Gen. Motors, </em>187 F.3d 553 (6th Cir.1999).\u201d The magistrate judge concluded that neither the layoff itself nor the alleged retaliatory conduct in her subsequent position was evidence of further sexual harassment, and the district court concluded that that issue was moot because LIUNA\u2019s motion for summary judgment had expressly assumed, for purposes of that motion, that Beichler had been subjected to a hostile environment. We conclude that the district court was correct, and we therefore decline to address the implications of <em>Williams </em>or the potential impact on this issue of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
