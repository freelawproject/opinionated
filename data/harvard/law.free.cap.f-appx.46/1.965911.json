It is</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed. The district court concluded that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation canceled the position Jones sought. Based partly on this, it further concluded that Jones did not establish a prima facie case of discriminatory nonselection.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">We need not decide whether either conclusion was correct. Even if Jones had established a prima facie case, the FDIC produced evidence that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason \u2014 downsizing\u2014 for denying her the position. <em>See Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Jones did not present sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the FDIC\u2019s explanation was a pretext for discrimination, so the FDIC was entitled to summary judgment. <em>See id; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>FED. R. APP. P. 41(b); D.C. CIR. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
