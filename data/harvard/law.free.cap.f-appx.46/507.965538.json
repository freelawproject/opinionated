Vizcarra-Camacho\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw as counsel of record. VizcarraCamacho did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-21\">Counsel has raised the potential issue of whether the district court erred by applying a four-level upward adjustment for a leadership role. We agree with counsel\u2019s conclusion that the issue is without merit because the record shows that: VizcarraCamacho recruited over one-hundred drivers to smuggle marijuana across the boarder, Vizcarra-Camacho was responsible for paying the smugglers, and instructed them on how to carry out their tasks. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. note 3 (stating that a leader organizer enhancement may be appropriate where a defendant exercises decision making authority, recruits accomplices, and otherwise exercises control over others); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 977-78 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-22\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83-84, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), reveals no further issues. Accordingly we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and AFFIRM the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b555-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
