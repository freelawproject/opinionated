Because we conclude that the evidence of conspiracy was sufficient for a jury to convict Burgos, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">According to the testimony presented at trial, Francisco Burgos was a crack cocaine dealer in Allentown, Pennsylvania. For six months leading up to the police sting, Burgos had used Tomas Carresquilla, under an arrangement approximating consignment, to distribute crack cocaine to customers. Carresquilla operated on credit from Burgos. Burgos would supply crack to Carresquilla, who would in turn sell it in small doses to customers, and then \u201cafterwards\u201d Carresquilla would pay Burgos for the crack that Burgos had advanced to him. SuppApp. at 20. Burgos used Jorge Vega to collect drug debts owed to Burgos. Burgos and Vega were arrested together when they met Carresquilla (who had agreed to cooperate in the police sting) to collect on a debt for crack to Carresquilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Burgos was charged with three criminal counts. Count 1 was conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, Count 2 was distribution of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and Count 3 was use of a gun during a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c). The jury convicted Burgos on all three counts. Burgos was sentenced to \u201c186 months on each of Counts 1 and 2, to run concurrently with each other\u201d and to \u201c60 months on Count 3 to run consecutively to the terms imposed on Counts 1 and 2 for a total term of 246 months imprisonment.\u201d On appeal, Burgos contests only the conviction for conspiracy (Count l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He does not challenge the convictions for Count 2 or Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">The only issue on appeal is whether the government presented sufficient evidence such that a reasonable jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a conspiracy existed between Burgos and someone else. Appellant argues that, according to precedent in this Circuit, \u201cthe question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>then becomes whether this factor alone [that Burgos sold crack on credit to Carresquilla] was enough\u201d for the jury to find conspiracy. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 9. Even if we were to accept Appellant\u2019s characterization of the issue, we hold that the evidence of conspiracy was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The elements of conspiracy are as follows: a unity of purpose between the alleged conspirators, an intent to achieve a common goal, and an agreement to work together toward that goal. <em>See United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 197 (3d Cir.1999). Because direct evidence of a qualifying agreement is rare, conspiracy can be inferred from circumstantial evidence that the participants\u2019 activities \u201c \u2018could not have been carried on except as the result of a preconceived scheme or common understanding.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pressler, </em>256 F.3d 144, 149 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>595 F.2d 154, 160 (3d Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In <em>Gibbs, </em>this Court listed several \u201cfactors\u201d that courts consider to determine whether a buyer/seller of drugs was also part of a conspiracy: (1) the length of affiliation between the defendant and the conspiracy; (2) whether there is an established method of payment; (3) the extent to which transactions are standardized; and (4) whether there is a demonstrated level of mutual trust. <em>See </em>190 F.3d at 199 (citations omitted). The Court offered two common indicia of mutual trust, one of which was a \u201ccredit relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">The <em>Gibbs </em>Court cautioned that \u201c[tjhough no one of these factors alone will necessarily be sufficient \u2014 without more\u2014 to establish a mere buyer\u2019s agreement to join the conspiracy ..., the presence of one or more of these factors furthers the inference.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200. Seizing on the first half of this statement, Burgos argues that because the Government established only <em>one </em>of the several factors in <em>Gibbs </em>\u2014 a credit relationship between Burgos and Carresquilla \u2014 the evidence is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Recently, this Court in <em>Pressler </em>clarified that these \u201cfactors\u201d from <em>Gibbs </em>are not direct proof of conspiracy. 256 F.3d at 149. Rather, \u201cit is more accurate to say that the presence of certain facts often provides circumstantial evidence of the underlying agreement that is itself necessary to make out a conspiracy case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">In the case before us, the credit relationship between Burgos and Carresquilla was established. Because Burgos repeatedly supplied crack to Carresquilla on credit, it would be reasonable to conclude that Burgos and Carresquilla had a stake in each other\u2019s success. The pattern by which Burgos advanced crack to Carresquilla, who paid for it only after Carresquilla had resold it, connotes mutual trust. The jury was thus entitled to reasonably infer from this evidence that Burgos and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Carresquilla had entered a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s judgement is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\">. The standard of review for a challenge of insufficient evidence to support the verdict is very deferential, so Appellant has a heavy burden. This Court asks whether the record, if viewed in the light most favorable to the government, contains substantial evidence sufficient to prove the elements charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Iafelice, </em>978 F.2d 92, 94 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. The <em>Gibbs </em>Court observed the following: A credit relationship may well reflect the kind of trust that is referenced supra, and often evidences the parties' mutual stake in each other\u2019s transactions. By extending credit to a buyer, the seller risks the possibility that the buyer will be unable to resell the drugs: even if the buyer does successfully resell the drugs, in this generally thinly capitalized \"business,\u201d the seller will likely have to wait until the buyer collects the money from his resale before he can pay the seller back for the initial purchase. In addition, the buyer has a vested interest in the seller\u2019s ability to maintain a good working relationship with his supplier, since the buyer will not profit unless the drugs continue to flow from the seller\u2019s supplier to the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"AqZI\"><em>Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d at 200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ayv\">. Because a conspiracy charge need not specify the defendant\u2019s co-conspirator, Burgos\u2019s conspiracy conviction could alternatively be upheld as an agreement between Burgos and Jorge Vega. Vega testified that he collected drug debts on behalf of Burgos, and Burgos drove Vega to their final meeting with Carresquilla to collect such a debt. This relationship and their joint collection act suggest sufficient mutual trust and agreement to uphold Burgos\u2019 conviction for conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
