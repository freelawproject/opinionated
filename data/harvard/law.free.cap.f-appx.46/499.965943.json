We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815, 816 (9th Cir. 1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Because Enright failed to allege the IA-MAW participated in any acts that are the subject of this litigation, or that the Local Lodge acted as an agent of the IAMAW, the district court properly dismissed En-right\u2019s claims against the IAMAW. <em>See Laughon v. Int'l Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists &amp; Allied Crafts of the United States and Canada, </em>248 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Enright\u2019s claim that Local Lodge 389 breached its duty of fair representation because Enright failed to raise a genuine issue a material fact as to whether the Local\u2019s conduct was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith. <em>See Truesdell v. S. California Permanente Med. Group, </em>293 F.3d 1146, 1153 (9th Cir.2002), <em>Patterson v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 959, </em>121 F.3d 1345, 1349 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that a union\u2019s judgment as to how best to handle a grievance does not rise to the level of arbitrary behavior).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Summary judgment was proper on En-right\u2019s ADA claims, because Enright failed to provide evidence that the acts, delays or omissions of Local Lodge 389 subjected him to an adverse employment action on account of his disability. <em>See Hutton v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., </em>273 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Further, Enright did not provide evidence that Local Lodge 389 subjected him to a retaliatory threat. <em>See McAlindin v. County of San Diego, </em>192 F.3d 1226, 1238 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Enright\u2019s contention that the district court erred by denying oral argument before granting summary judgment is without merit because Enright failed to show he was prejudiced. <em>See Partridge v. Reich, </em>141 F.3d 920, 926 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Contrary to Enright\u2019s contention, the district court did not err by considering the arbitrator\u2019s decision. <em>See Collings v. Longview Fibre Co., </em>63 F.3d 828, 833 n. 5 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b547-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
