See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b610-27\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-28\">On this return appeal, Equilon Enterprises, LLC (Equilon) appeals the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>court\u2019s judgment and award of damages in this diversity case, and challenges the district court\u2019s decision to allow the addition of Francis &amp; Sons Enterprises, Inc. (FSEI) as a party plaintiff. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">I. Addition of FSEI as a party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Once evidence was presented showing that Francis relied on Equilon\u2019s promises when he decided to purchase the car wash, that he decided to purchase the property in FSEI\u2019s name, that he was the sole shareholder of FSEI, and that he provided all the purchase money, the district court was well within its discretion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to allow an amendment to conform to the evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Equilon\u2019s arguments for prejudice are unpersuasive. Equilon knew of the claims against it with respect to the car wash property and had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and to prepare a defense against them. Thus, this case differs materially from <em>Nelson v. Adams USA Inc., </em>529 U.S. 460, 120 S.Ct. 1579, 146 L.Ed.2d 530 (2000), in which a defendant, not a plaintiff, was added <em>after judgment, </em>giving him no opportunity to conduct discovery or defend against claims against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">We note that Equilon nowhere alleges that it did not learn during discovery that the car wash property was purchased under FSEI\u2019s name. And, indeed, it appears that it did. The proper procedure when a defendant believes that a cause of action is not being prosecuted by the real party in interest is to object under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a). This allows for the clarification of complaints for all the parties involved. Had Equilon followed this procedure, this matter would have been far simpler for all involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">II. Evidentiary support for FSEI\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">In light of the particular circumstances of this case, as well as the broad discretion California law affords courts acting in equity,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the district court was within its discretion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when it awarded damages to FSEI. As a Subchapter S corporation, FSEI was less independent of its shareholders than other corporations are.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, in this case, Francis was the sole shareholder, making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the difference between a loss to the corporation and a loss to Francis, or a promise to the corporation and a promise to Francis, so small as to be virtually indistinguishable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, precluding recovery merely because Francis elected to act through a recently-created S corporation of which he was the sole shareholder and for which he produced all the funds, instead of in his own name, would be to ignore the reality of this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">III. Computation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We reject Equilon\u2019s first argument regarding the computation of damages. The idea that a sophisticated corporation would not discount its purchase price for the risk inherent in purchasing a gas station without inspection, seems odd. And the idea that Equilon did not do so in this case, even though it knew only months before that the station likely had environmental problems, strains credulity. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it declined to subtract the sum Equilon spent to fix the environmental problems from Equilon\u2019s purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">As for Equilon\u2019s second argument, the transcript shows that the district court considered whether to offset Francis\u2019s damages in light of the loan to Buenos Aires from Texaco that would have accompanied his purchase. Although the district court briefly confused the penalty with the loan, the remainder of its discussion clearly involved the loan. And the discussion shows that the court declined to offset Francis\u2019s damages based on the loan because it lacked evidence regarding whether the grant money Equilon had promised accounted for the Texaco loan or not. Equilon points to no evidence missed by the district court on which the offset should have been based, and we agree that the evidence before the district court was insufficient. Given that Equilon bore the burden of proving offsets to damages,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">.
