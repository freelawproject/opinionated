Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The Government did not file a reply brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-21\">On appeal, Lewis contends that his plea was involuntary and unknowing. In light of the district court\u2019s thorough plea colloquy, we conclude Lewis was fully aware of his rights and the consequences of his plea, and that his plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-22\">Lewis next contends that the district court abused its discretion in accepting his plea because there was an insufficient factual basis to support it. A careful review of the record shows a sufficient factual basis for Lewis\u2019s guilty plea. Thus, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in accepting Lewis\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-23\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019s sentence and conviction. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
