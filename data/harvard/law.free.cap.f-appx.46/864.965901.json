The district court held that Lancer is obligated to provide coverage for the claim at issue, and that Lancer\u2019s policy is primary to the coverage provided through the MCS-90 endorsement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to National Indemnity Company\u2019s business auto liability policy, and to the MCS-90 endorsement to Lexington Insurance Company\u2019s excess policy. Lancer also appeals the district court\u2019s decision that it has no subrogation rights against Ozark Mountain Sightseeing, Inc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Lancer\u2019s insured, Summit Coaches,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> operated a bus tour from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Branson, Missouri in June, 1995. After arriving in Branson, the Summit tour bus had a mechanical breakdown. Summit hired a replacement bus and driver from Ozark. The Ozark replacement bus subsequently struck and injured Juanita Graham, a pedestrian. Mrs. Graham died approximately one year later, and a claim for personal injuries was brought by her estate. A $1.75 million judgment was rendered against Lancer, National, and Lexington, jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The district court found that the replacement bus provided by Ozark to Summit qualified for coverage as a temporary substitute vehicle under the terms of the Lancer policy, and that Ozark\u2019s drivers qualified for coverage as permissive drivers. Accordingly, the district court held that the Lancer policy provided coverage for Ozark and its drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Further, the district court held that the Lancer policy was primary over the National and Lexington MCS-90 endorsements, finding that MCS-90 endorsements are not treated as coverage where other insurance policies are available to provide full coverage for the victim\u2019s injuries. The district court rejected Lancer\u2019s argument that it had a right to seek reimbursement from Ozark, upholding the general rule that insurers cannot seek reimbursement from insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">Finally, the district court rejected Lancer\u2019s claim that a two-year delay in notification of the accident resulted in prejudice to Lancer. To the contrary, the record indicates that Lancer was given a chance to participate, but declined, before the 1999 and 2000 state court suits were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">We have reviewed the record and find the district court committed no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">The district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">. The Honorable Ortrie D.
