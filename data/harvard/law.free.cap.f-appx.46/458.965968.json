We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Schell v. Witek, </em>218 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Marcus first contends that he was denied the right to counsel at his plea withdrawal hearing because the trial court failed to appoint substitute counsel based on his allegations that counsel failed to properly investigate his case, failed to interview him, and was friends with the prosecutor. A review of the record shows that Marcus was represented by retained counsel at the time of the hearing and neither requested new counsel nor attempted to discharge retained counsel. Moreover, Marcus points to no Supreme Court authority supporting the proposition that informing the trial court that he is dissatisfied with his retained counsel\u2019s performance alone automatically requires the trial court to replace retained counsel. <em>Cf. Jackson v. Ylst, </em>921 F.2d 882, 887-88 (9th Cir.1990) (rejecting argument that moving for a new trial based on incompetency of counsel creates a conflict which requires the court to appoint new counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Marcus also contends that he was denied the right to counsel at the plea withdrawal hearing because the trial court created a disabling conflict of interest when it asked counsel to expound on Marcus\u2019 reasons for requesting a withdrawal of his plea. Marcus fails to demonstrate that by answering the state court\u2019s questions, counsel actively represented conflicting interests that adversely affected her performance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Mickens v. Taylor, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-- -, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1245-6, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002) (holding that absent objection asserting conflict, or inquiry into potential conflict by the trial court, petitioner must show an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance); <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348-49, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) (holding that defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate a conflict of interest actually affected counsel\u2019s representation).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\">. Marcus\u2019 \"supplemental\u201d addendum to the opening brief includes issues not certified for appeal. Because those issues are not properly before us, we decline to entertain them. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1102 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (limiting review to issues in the COA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\">. To the extent Marcus argues that <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>113 F.3d 1026 (9th Cir. 1997) mandates reversal, we disagree. <em>Gonzalez </em>is distinguishable based on the nature of the conflict alleged. Furthermore, <em>Gonzalez </em>is not \"clearly established law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v.
