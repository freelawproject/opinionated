The district court held that Plaintiffs-Appellants did not have prudential standing under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) to sue Defendants-Appellees. Because we conclude that this case is entirely governed by our recent decision in <em>Courtney v. Smith, </em>297 F.3d 455 (2002), in which we held that identically situated plaintiffs did not have prudential standing under the APA, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-19\">On March 15, 2000, the Plaintiffs-Appellants (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d), the American Federation of Government Employees (\u201cAFGE\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>AFGE Council 214, AFGE Local 916, Mark Dickinson, Kelley Cross, and John T. Stamps, brought a claim against Defendants-Appellees (\u201cdefendants\u201d), George T. Babbitt, Major General, Commander of the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and Michael E. Zettler, Major General, Commander of Oklahoma City Air Force Materiel Command at Tinker Air Force Base, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio under the APA, alleging that the defendants \u201cillegally awarded a multimillion dollar civil engineering contract to DynPar Corporation,\u201d a private contractor, that resulted in the named plaintiffs\u2019 loss of their jobs. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 8, 16 (Compl.). According to the plaintiffs, \u201cif the applicable workload competition laws had been followed, the performance of that workload would have been awarded to the federal employees at Tinker Air Force Base.\u201d J.A. at 8. On May 23, 2000, the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), claiming that the plaintiffs lacked both constitutional and prudential standing. The district court granted the motion on March 27, 2001 on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked prudential standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The APA provides that \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d 5 U.S:C. \u00a7 702. In <em>Courtney, </em>we explained that \u201c[a] plaintiff seeking judicial review of agency action under the APA, however, must not only meet the constitutional requirements of standing, but must also demonstrate prudential standing.\u201d <em>Courtney, </em>297 F.3d 455, 460-61 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin, v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>522 U.S. 479, 488, 118 S.Ct. 927, 140 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998) (\u201cWe have interpreted \u00a7 10(a) of the APA [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702] to impose a prudential standing requirement in addition to the requirement, imposed by Article III of the Constitution, that a plaintiff have suffered a sufficient injury in fact.\u201d)). \u201cPrudential standing exists if the interest that the plaintiff seeks to protect is \u2018arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin., 522 </em>U.S. at 488).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Plaintiffs-Appellants in <em>Courtney </em>(the <em>\u201cCourtney </em>plaintiffs\u201d) were, like the plaintiffs in the instant case, civil employees at an Air Force base who sought to sue their federal-agency employer for contracting out work performed at the base to a private contractor, thereby threatening the plaintiffs\u2019 jobs at the base. The <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs contended that they had prudential standing under the APA because the interests they sought to protect were in the \u201czone of interests\u201d of the following regulations and statutes: (1) Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) Circular No. A-76 and its accompanying Supplement; (2) the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, codified as amended in scattered sections of 31 U.S.C.; (3) the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 403-36; (4) the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (\u201cFAIR\u201d) Act of 1998, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 501; and (5) various federal procurement statutes, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2304, 2461-63, 2467-69. <em>See Courtney, </em>297 F.3d 455, 458-59. The plaintiffs in the instant case contend that they have prudential standing under the APA because the interests they seek to protect are in the \u201czone of interests\u201d of the same regulations and statutes. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 42-51 (claiming prudential standing under OMB Circular No. A-76 and its implementing statutes, the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979; the FAIR Act of 1998; and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2304, 2461, 2462, 2467, and 2468).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>In <em>Courtney, </em>we first concluded that the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs sought only to protect one interest \u2014 retention of their government jobs. <em>Courtney, </em>297 F.3d at 461.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We then carefully analyzed whether that interest fell within the \u201czone of interests\u201d of any of the regulations and statutes the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs had cited, and we concluded that it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 461-67. Because we so recently and completely engaged in this analysis, we need not repeat it here. In brief, we note that we held that the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs could not have prudential standing under the APA through OMB Circular No. A-76 and its accompanying Supplement in that \u201cneither the Circular nor the Supplement are statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Fed. Employees v. Cheney, </em>883 F.2d 1038, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1989)(\u201cThe Circular is not a statute, and, although promulgated pursuant to congressional authority, the Circular itself cannot grant standing.\u201d)(citation omitted)). Furthermore, we held that, based on the language of the statutes and their legislative history, the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs\u2019 interest in retaining their government jobs was not in the \u201czone of interests\u201d of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979, the FAIR Act of 1998, or the, various procurement statutes, codified in U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2304, 2461-63, 2467-69. <em>Id. </em>at 462-67. We concluded that \u201cnone of these statutes support a finding that Congress intended to protect the jobs of federal employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The plaintiffs in the instant case, as civil employees who lost them jobs at Air Force bases as a result of decisions by the bases to contract out certain work, are identically situated to the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs for the purpose of suing their employers under the APA. As described above, the plaintiffs in the instant case claim prudential standing under the APA through regulations and statutes identical to the regulations and statutes through which the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs claimed prudential standing under the APA. Applying <em>Courtney, </em>therefore, we must find that the plaintiffs in the instant case do not have prudential standing under the APA to sue the defendants. Without further discussion, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-6\">. We explained that although the <em>Courtney </em>plaintiffs also asserted \"a more general interest in ensuring that the government conforms to the applicable laws in making outsourcing decisions,\u201d such a \"generalized grievance, which presumably, would be shared by all citizens, is insufficient to satisfy the prudential standing requirements.\" <em>Courtney, </em>297 F.3d at 461</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
