Routh contends the district court abused its discretion in ruling it would admit the results of all of Routh\u2019s drug urinalysis tests or none at all. Six of the tests were negative for drug use, and one was positive. Routh sought to introduce evidence concerning only the negative results, but eventually opted not to admit any test results based upon the ditrict court\u2019s ruling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-26\">A district court\u2019s rulings on the admission and exclusion of evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995). This court will find an abuse of discretion only if the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was arbitrary or irrational. <em>United States v. Achiekwelu, </em>112 F.3d 747, 753 (4th Cir.1997). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-27\">Accordingly, we affirm Routh\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
