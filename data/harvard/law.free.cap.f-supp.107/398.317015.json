The Commission decided against suspension, and, treating the protest as a formal complaint, set the matter down for hearing and decision. Plaintiff now seeks an order of this Court to compel the Commission to suspend the schedule pending such hearing and decision. The power of suspension of new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>rates for the limited period authorized under Title 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 316(g) is vested exclusively in the Commission and the Court is without power to review the exercise of its administrative discretion.
