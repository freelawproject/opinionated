The fee requested is for services rendered one Charles H. Wilen and Alexandre Kramarenko in securing for them two patents, and for services rendered them in securing a return to them of these-patents from the Alien Property Custodian, who had seized them under the Trading* with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-24\">Plainly, the services rendered were not rendered the United States, but were rendered plaintiff\u2019s clients, Wilen and Krama-renko and, hence, plaintiff has no claim against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-25\">The paragraph in the \u201cTermination Paper\u201d issued by the Alien Property Custodian, on which plaintiff relies, does not create a claim against the United States. This reads, according to plaintiff\u2019s petition:</p>\n<p id=\"b997-26\">\u201cThe claimant\u2019s attorney has requested a fee of $300 for his services in connection with the prosecution of this claim for the return of interests in patents valued in excess of $3,000. Taking into consideration the factors bearing on reasonable compensation, it is determined that the proposed fee -is reasonable and is not in excess of 10 percent of the value of the property to be returned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-27\">This is not an assumption of liability for this fee by the United States. This state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>ment was made in view of the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, SO U.S.C. Appendix, \u00a7 20. This section requires that no property shall be returned to a claimant until the claimant has filed \u201ca schedule of the fees to be paid to all agents, attorneys at law or in fact, or representatives, for services in connection with such return or payment or judgment,\u201d and it requires the approval by the Alien Property Custodian of any fee to be paid to an attorney, etc., by the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Plaintiff has no cause of action, and his petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
