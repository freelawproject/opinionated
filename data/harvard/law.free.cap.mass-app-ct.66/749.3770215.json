Carey, a minor (employee), died as a result of an injury sustained while operating a golf cart in the course of his part-time (seasonal) employment at the Kemwood Country Club.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of his injury, he was sixteen years old, unmarried, and residing with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The claimants, the employee\u2019s parents, filed a claim with the Department of Industrial Accidents for dependency benefits; an administrative judge issued a denial of payment. The claimants then appealed and sought a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11. An administrative judge awarded the claimants compensation of $39.23 weekly, based on an average weekly wage of $58.90, up until March 2, 2002, the date on which the employee would have reached the age of eighteen, had he lived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The administrative judge denied the claimants\u2019 claim for further compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32, as well as their claim for compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. The claimants appealed to the reviewing board pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The reviewing board partially reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, ordering that Eastern Casualty Insurance Company (insurer) pay \u00a7 31 benefits until the maximum statutory entitlement is reached. As to all other issues, the reviewing board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision. Both sides appealed to a single justice of this court. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2); G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-(d), (/), (g); Appeals Court Rule 2:04 (1990); Standing Order of the Appeals Court Governing Appeals from the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board (repealed effective July 1, 2005). Subsequent to the filing of those appeals, the reviewing board amended its decision and ordered the insurer to pay the claimants\u2019 attorney a fee in the amount of $4,457.40 pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5). The insurer also sought review of this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">A single justice of this court issued a memorandum of decision and order essentially affirming the administrative judge\u2019s decision in its entirety. He reversed the reviewing board\u2019s decision to award maximum benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32 and remanded on the issue of the attorney\u2019s fees. It is from this decision that both parties appealed to a panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">There are three issues before us in this appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>: (1) whether G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62, was violated, thereby allowing the claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>to recover double compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28; (2) the correct computation of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage for purposes of determining recovery under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1); and (3) whether the claimants should receive the maximum benefits allowed by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32, based on a determination that they were dependent upon the employee at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\u201cWe review the single justice\u2019s order \u2018in the same manner as if the single justice were a lower court.\u2019 . . . Because this court is conducting \u2018an analysis of the same agency record . . . there is no reason why the view of the [single justice] should be given any special weight.\u2019 <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 897, 903 (1979).\u201d <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 587-588 (1997). Our review is de nova. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">(1) <em>Section 28. </em>The claimants contend that the employer committed \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d by violating G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62, thereby entitling them to double compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. The reviewing board and the single justice agreed with the administrative judge that, because the golf cart in this case was not used for transportation on a public way, it is not a \u201cmotor vehiclef] of any description\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62(10). General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 62, as in effect when the injury occurred, in 2000, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u201cNo person shall employ a minor under eighteen or permit him to work . . . (10) in operating motor vehicles of any description.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 28, as amended by St. 1934, c. 292, \u00a7 2, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">\u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer ... the amounts of compensation hereinafter provided shall be doubled. In case the employer is insured, he shall repay to the insurer the extra compensation paid to the employee. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>employment of any minor, known to be such, in violation of any provision of sections sixty to seventy-four, inclusive, . . . shall constitute serious and wilful misconduct under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The parties stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201c1. [The Employee\u2019s] date of birth was March 2, 1984.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u201c6. The Employee\u2019s job duties included ... the operation and use of a golf cart on the private property of the [employer].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201c7. On September 16, 2000, the Employee was asked to perform job duties which involved his operation and use of a golf cart on the private property of [the employer].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">\u201c8. The Employee died as a result of his operation and use of a battery powered golf cart during the course of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">\u201cThe purpose of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62, is to prevent minors under eighteen from being exposed to dangers which they might not fully realize on account of their youth, inexperience, lack of foresight and want of restraint.\u201d <em>Bagge\u2019s Case, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 840 (1977). It is for this reason that \u00a7 62 bars minors\u2019 operation of motor vehicles \u201cof any description.\u201d The prohibition is not limited to motor vehicles operated on public ways or highways, and the cases cited for this proposition are inapposite. See, e.g., <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vynorious, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 123-125 (1993) (snowmobile not a motor vehicle for purposes of compulsory unemployed motorist coverage); <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 870, 873 (2001) (\u201can ATV [all-terrain vehicle], not being a vehicle designed for regular use on public highways,\u201d was not subject to motor vehicle registration under G. L. c. 90).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The purpose of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62 \u2014 protecting employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>under age eighteen from harm \u2014 is quite different from deciding whether a vehicle must be registered or insured. See, e.g., <em>Berdos </em>v. <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mills, </em>209 Mass. 489, 492 (1911) (child labor laws enacted \u201cin the exercise of the police power as a humanitarian measure and in the interest of the physical well-being of the race. It prevents children of immature judgment and undeveloped bodies from working under conditions likely to endanger their health, life or limb\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]he limitations and prohibitions set by c. 149 have a beneficent purpose and should be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose.\u201d Nason, Koziol &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 20.8, at 188 (3d ed. 2003). We therefore read narrowly the statute\u2019s exceptions to prohibitions against the employment of minors. Cf. <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185, 189-190 (1974) (although accident occurred on a working farm, exception to prohibitions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62[10], for operating a tractor or trailer on a \u201cfarm\u201d did not apply where, under statutes as then in effect, employer was not a \u201cfarmer\u201d because he was not engaged \u201cprincipally in the occupation of farming\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">With this view in mind, we turn to the instant matter. The 2002 amendment to \u00a7 62, see St. 2002, c. 207,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> explicitly excluded from the prohibition of \u00a7 62(10) only the operation of golf carts on a golf course by minors licensed to drive. It is thus apparent that \u00a7 62(10), as in effect before the amendment, prohibited minors\u2019 operation of golf carts (whether on a golf course or on a way). If this were not so, no amendment would have been required to allow minors\u2019 operation of golf carts in the limited circumstances described in St. 2002. Such a reading of the statute satisfies the teaching of <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>230 Mass. 236, 237 (1918), that \u201c[t]he maxim of statutory construction that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another . . . is to be considered with regard to the object sought to be obtained by the entire legislation of which the subject matter to which it relates is but a part.\u201d See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 705, describing golf carts as \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cA motor vehicle designed for the carrying of golf clubs and not more than four persons may be operated without . . . registration [provided, inter alla, the owner has obtained a public liability policy or bond].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Additional provisions in G. L. c. 149 also demonstrate that the Legislature\u2019s protection of minor employees is not limited to prohibiting their operation of vehicles on public highways. For example, the last sentence of c. 149, \u00a7 62, contains further exclusions from the prohibition in \u00a7 62(10) against \u201coperating motor vehicles of any description\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201cThis section shall not . . . prevent the employment of ... a minor, to whom has been issued a license to operate motor vehicles, in the operation <em>on a farm, </em>or on a way for a distance not exceeding ten miles therefrom, of any truck, tractor, trailer or self-propelled agricultural instrument...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">By way of illustration: certainly no one would argue that in the text quoted above, a \u201ctruck\u201d is not a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Nor does its operation on a farm, rather than on a public way, remove it from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles of any description\u201d in \u00a7 62 \u2014 thus the need for the explicit exclusion of trucks, among other things, from the prohibition of \u00a7 62(10), whether operated on a farm or on a public way, if operated by a minor licensed to drive. If a truck operated on a farm only (and not on a way) were not a \u201cmotor vehicle of any description,\u201d there would be no need for the exclusionary language quoted above. In a similar vein, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62A, as amended through St. 1983, c. 173: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">\u201cThe provisions of sections sixty-one and sixty-two prohibiting the employment of certain minors shall not prohibit the employment of minors fourteen years of age and older to operate, . . . small power equipment of the kind utilized by home gardeners nor shall it prohibit the operation of a farm tractor operated <em>on a </em>farm; provided, that such minors under the age of sixteen have been certified as having satisfactorily completed a training program in vocational agriculture . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>We therefore conclude that a golf cart is a \u201cmotor vehicle [] of any description\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62(10), and, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulations, double damages are due under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">(2) <em>Average weekly wage. </em>The administrative judge, the reviewing board, and the single justice agreed that the correct calculation of the average weekly wage was $58.90, based on the fact that the employee was a seasonal employee whose wage should be determined by that of comparable employees. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1). This average weekly wage resulted in a compensation rate of $39.23 per week pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, less than what the insurer had paid to the claimants \u2014 the insurer based the compensation rate on an average weekly wage of $69.22. The single justice reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201cThe treatment of the administrative judge and the summary affirmance thereof by the reviewing board were correct. Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), the administrative judge reasonably determined that the employee\u2019s work experience of four weeks was too limited to compute the average weekly wage, and he instead applied a rate earned by a similar employee (giving the claimants the benefit of the doubt by selecting the highest rate among the similar employees in question).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We agree with the single justice\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">(3) <em>Dependency benefits. </em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 32(e), inserted by St. 1926, c. 190, sets out the standard for when a parent is presumed to be dependent upon his or her child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">\u201cThe following persons shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\"><em>\u201c(e) </em>A parent upon an unmarried child under the age of eighteen years; provided, that such child was living with the parent at the time of the injury resulting in death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">Before subsection <em>(e) </em>was added to the statute, parents could establish their dependence on their children as matter of fact. See St. 1911, c. 751, pt. 2, \u00a7 7, now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32, as amended by St. 1950, c. 738, \u00a7 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u201cIn all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the fact as the fact may be at the time of the injury, or at the time of [the employee\u2019s] death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">When such dependency was established as matter of fact, the parent-claimants received the maximum benefit set out in the statute, regardless of whether the benefit period extended beyond the deceased child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. See, e.g., <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 278, 279-280 (1914) (son injured at age fifteen; father received benefits for 300 weeks).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The administrative judge opined that, pursuant to c. 152, \u00a7 32(e), the presumption of dependence ends on the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, and the parents must prove that their dependency continues after that date: \u201cCertainly, the parents are entitled to the presumption of dependence until the employee\u2019s eighteenth birthday. Thereafter, they would have to bring forward facts that would support a finding that further dependence, either total or partial, still existed.\u201d The board disagreed, holding that \u201cthe conclusive presumption of parental dependency . . . continues past the decedent\u2019s unattained eighteenth birthday, until the maximum statutory entitlement under \u00a7 31 is reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">We agree with the single justice and the administrative judge that, in both \u00a7\u00a731 and 32, presumed eligibility in relation to children \u2014 whether they or their parents are the claimants \u2014 is generally confined to minors. See, e.g., \u00a7 31; \u00a7 32(c), <em>(d), </em>(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to the termination of children\u2019s eligibility as claimants upon their eighteenth birthday, see <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 444, 448 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The single justice observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201cthe concept of parental dependency comes about by virtue of the parent\u2019s obligation to support the minor child and the concomitant right of the parent to receive any earnings of the child to assist in defraying the support obligation. See <em>Dembinksi\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 261, 263 (1918); Nason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Koziol &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 22.2 (3d ed. 2003).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The presumption of parental dependency in c. 152, \u00a7 32(e), however, applies only to situations in which an unmarried child, under the age of eighteen and living at home, is working. There is nothing in that statutory provision to suggest the Legislature intended that a child support his parents indefinitely. It was merely to defray the parents\u2019 own support obligations. Therefore, any compensation due under subsection <em>(e) </em>ends at eighteen, unless a parent proves that he or she was, in fact, dependent upon the child. We agree with the single justice\u2019s reasoning that the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation is to replace income that individuals would otherwise receive; its purpose is not to \u201cconfer windfalls.\u201d \u201cAbsent proof of an actual dependency, prolongation of the presumption beyond what would have been the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday \u2018replaces\u2019 income that the parents would not have received had there been no injury\u201d and is contrary to the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">However, we also agree with the board that by creating a conclusive presumption of dependence for parents of minors living at home, the Legislature did not thereby preclude parents from receiving benefits past the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, as they could before subsection <em>(e) </em>was added to the statute. The administrative judge suggested that, to continue receiving benefits after the deceased child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, parent-claimants would have to establish their continuing dependency after that date. His conclusion conflicts with the terms of the statute. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32 (\u201cIn all other cases questions of dependency . . . shall be determined in accordance with the fact as the fact may be <em>at the time of the injury, or at the time of [the employee\u2019s] death\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]). Moreover, we think proof of future dependence would often be well-nigh impossible, and most likely would be based upon speculation and conjecture. Compare <em>Freeman\u2019s Case, </em>233 Mass. 287, 291 (1919) (\u201cA simple expression of purpose to contribute to support, unaccompanied by any actual contribution after reasonable opportunity, would not constitute dependency.\u201d). Instead, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>read \u00a7 32 to mean that, if parent-claimants are content to receive benefits only up to their deceased child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, they may rely exclusively upon the conclusive presumption of subsection <em>(e). </em>If, however, they wish to obtain the maximum benefit, and such benefit would necessarily extend beyond the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday, the parent-claimants may, pursuant to the last paragraph of \u00a7 32, submit to an administrative judge facts substantiating their dependence upon the child \u201cat the time of the injury, or at the time of [the employee\u2019s] death.\u201d This practice is well-established, as prior to the insertion of subsection <em>(e), </em>it was the only avenue of recovery for parent-claimants. See, e.g., <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 278 (1914); <em>Gove\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 187 (1916); <em>McMahon\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 48 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment is affirmed as to the computation of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage. The judgment is reversed as to the violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 62, and the claimants\u2019 entitlement to double compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. The judgment is vacated as to the claimants\u2019 entitlement to the maximum benefits allowed by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32. The matter is remanded to the reviewing board, where a new decision shall enter remanding to the administrative judge for a determination as to the claimants\u2019 entitlement to maximum benefits, and a recalculation of compensation due the claimants in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The administrative judge may take new evidence as to the claimants\u2019 dependence upon the employee at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-16\">The deceased was earning seven dollars per hour, and had been working for only four weeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The insurer, Eastern Casualty Insurance Company, paid total benefits of $3,507.40 to the claimants, based on a calculated average weekly wage of $69.22, until the employee\u2019s eighteenth birthday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">After remand, the reviewing board vacated its award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 13A(5).
