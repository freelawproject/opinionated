L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, and fashion its own remedy even if it theoretically fully compensates the injured employee. When faced with the situation in which it found itself, the employer, rather than unilaterally imposing its own payment plan, in contravention of a clear and unequivocal order, should have presented its alternate plan to the administrative judge for his consideration. Its failure to do so has resulted in adverse rulings before all tribunals, including ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\"><em>Background. </em>The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the employer and self-insurer herein, appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), from a decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (reviewing board) affirming the decision of an administrative judge, including the imposition of a penalty, under the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), for the employer\u2019s late payment of benefits awarded pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The employee, Christopher McCarthy, a forty-six year old father of five, has worked for the MBTA since 1982 and is a track maintenance supervisor for the Green Line. On September 6, 2002, while working the night shift, around 1:00 a.m., McCarthy fell, twisted his knee, and hit it on a railroad tie. Although his knee became sore and swollen, he continued his shift in pain before reporting the injury to the clerk and his supervisor in the morning. Several days later, he sought medical attention from his orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Lester Sheehan. Despite his ongoing discomfort, McCarthy continued to work. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed that McCarthy suffered a tom cartilage, for which Dr. Sheehan recommended surgery. McCarthy applied to the MBTA for coverage for the procedure, but his request was denied based upon an independent medical evaluation by Dr. Robert Chemack that concluded that the injury was not work related, but caused by an underlying arthritic condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Despite this stance, on February 12, 2003, McCarthy elected to have the surgery. As a result, he remained out of work from that date until May 7, 2003, returning to work on May 8, 2003, without further incident. While recovering from surgery, he filed, on April 18, 2003, a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which was denied by the MBTA on April 24. While he remained out of work, he used sick leave and vacation days to maintain his income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On July 16, 2003, after a conciliation and a conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, the administrative judge issued an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>order of payment instructing the MBTA to pay McCarthy temporary total incapacity compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, for the period of February 12 to May 7, 2003,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the rate of $815.91 per week, based upon McCarthy\u2019s average weekly wage of $1,359.85, for a total of $10,132.19, including interest. In addition, the judge ordered the payment of medical benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30, as well as counsel fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In response to the order of payment, the MBTA\u2019s payroll department informed its workers\u2019 compensation department that McCarthy had already been paid in full for the period in question in that he had used his sick and vacation time to maintain his income.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">At this point, a dilemma presented itself. On the one hand there was an order to pay McCarthy a set amount of money (sixty percent of his salary). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. However, that money and more (his full salary) had already been paid to McCarthy. Rather than return to the administrative judge to address the issue,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Kevin Sullivan, the MBTA\u2019s senior manager of payroll accounting instructed the workers\u2019 compensation depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ment (1) to withhold $9,596.65 or sixty percent of what the employee had received from the workers\u2019 compensation payment; and (2) in return, to reimburse McCarthy\u2019s sick bank for that same amount, $9,596.65 (35.14 sick days). This procedure was followed, and within fourteen days of the conference order McCarthy received a check for $535.54, which represented a small discrepancy in the payments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The MBTA appealed the conference order for a de nova determination. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A(3). A hearing was held before the same administrative judge on January 22, 2004, followed by the deposition of Dr. Sheehan on February 27, 2004. Prior to the hearing, McCarthy was permitted to request the assessment of a penalty against the MBTA, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In his decision issued on June 24, 2004, the administrative judge affirmed his order of \u00a7 34 temporary total disability compensation from February 12 to May 7, 2003, and for payment of all reasonable and necessary medical expenses. In addition, the judge awarded McCarthy a penalty of $10,000 for the MBTA\u2019s late payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and awarded McCarthy\u2019s counsel $4,467 in attorney\u2019s fees, plus reasonable expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">On June 28, 2004, the MBTA appealed this decision to the reviewing board, arguing that the benefits ordered by the judge pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, would be sixty percent over and above the payments the employee already received during his period of incapacity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The MBTA further stated that \u201c[t]he Self-Insurer perceived the Conference Order as merely awarding a credit for payments it already forwarded on account of, or in lieu of, the worker\u2019s compensation benefits.\u201d Thus, the MBTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>claims, it complied with the administrative judge\u2019s order, and consequently, the $10,000 penalty pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The reviewing board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, ruling that \u201c[w]e need not review the detailed discussion of \u2018double recovery\u2019 set out in the decision, because we consider the topic and premise to be wholly beside the point. This is a straightforward \u00a7 8(1) case about the failure of the self-insurer to make \u2018all payments due an employee\u2019 under the explicit terms of a conference order.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On appeal, the MBTA again argues that allowing McCarthy to receive an excessive recovery would allow him to profit from his injury, contrary to public policy, and sets a bad precedent. Further, it asserts that McCarthy was made whole when his sick time was credited, and he received a check for $535.54 in response to the judge\u2019s conference order. Lastly, the MBTA claims that it is entitled to different treatment, because as a self-insurer, \u201csick pay benefits at the MBTA are not derived from a source other than the insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, the MBTA challenges the reviewing board\u2019s determination that the issue of excessive recovery is irrelevant as against the weight of the evidence. Likewise, it challenges the imposition of the $10,000 penalty pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), as its actions complied with the judge\u2019s order within the fourteen-day period required under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not distinguish between self-insurers and those employers covered by third-party insurance companies. \u201cThe term \u2018insurer\u2019 . . . shall include, wherever applicable, a self-insurer . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7), as amended by St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 5. Moreover, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25E, as amended through St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 21, states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[wjorkers\u2019 compensation self-insurance groups shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and all regulations promulgated hereunder governing the conduct of insurers with respect to the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and shall be subject to all fees, fines, penalties and assessments levied upon insurers for failure to comply with the claim procedures of this chapter.\u201d Thus, the assertion that the MBTA is entitled to different treatment because of its status as a self-insurer fails by reason of the explicit language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Next we address whether the MBTA complied with the order issued by the administrative judge on July 16, 2003, in such a way that the statutory penalty pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), was not triggered. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 23, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny failure of an insurer to make all payments due an employee under the terms of an order . . . shall result in a penalty of . . . ten thousand dollars if not made within ninety days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The MBTA does not dispute that it did not pay McCarthy the amount ordered, $10,132.19. Instead, the MBTA claims that it complied with the order when, as its senior manager of payroll accounting, Kevin Sullivan, testified, \u201cI took the liberty of saying that [McCarthy] was prepaid out of the judge\u2019s order and basically what I did was I requested [the workers\u2019 compensation department] to pay me back that money. And, in turn I credited Mr. McCarthy\u2019s sick bank for 34.15 days, not the actual money, but the actual days which he could use [at] a later date in his career.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">This form of \u201cself-reimbursement\u201d did not comply with the terms of the administrative judge\u2019s unequivocal order that \u201cthe insurer . . . pay the claimant temporary total incapacity compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, the administrative judge and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>reviewing board did not commit error in ruling that the employer failed to comply with the administrative judge\u2019s order of July 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The MBTA\u2019s failure \u201cto make all payments due an employee under the terms of an order,\u201d triggered the statutory penalty set forth in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1). See <em>Eastern Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 621 (2001) (\u201cEffective December 24, 1991, ... the Legislature amended G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), thereby providing a statutory penalty for certain late payments\u201d). The language of \u00a7 8(1) is clear and does not need to be \u201cenlarged or limited by construction.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). As per that statute, the $10,000 penalty was triggered when the MBTA failed, for more than ninety days, to pay the McCarthy the amount specified in the administrative judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Decision of the reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The administrative judge ultimately decided that the injury was work related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">In his decision, the administrative judge noted that McCarthy used forty-seven sick days and twenty-five vacation days. McCarthy\u2019s payroll records indicate, however, that from February 12 to May 7, 2003, he used thirty-nine sick days and twenty-one vacation days. As the parties do not dispute the figures the judge used, we need not address any discrepancies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">There is some inconsistency as to the dates in question. The administrative judge, in his original July 16, 2003, order, authorized G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, benefits from February 11 to May 8, 2003. In his findings of June 24, 2004, the pertinent period is noted as February 12 to May 7, 2003. In his findings, the administrative judge found that McCarthy had surgery on February 12 and was totally disabled until May 8. However, he notes elsewhere that McCarthy returned to work May 8. McCarthy\u2019s payroll records indicate that his first day of absence was February 12 and that he returned to work on May 8, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">McCarthy collected $16,590.06 in sick and vacation time for the period, accounting for 100% of his salary. The judge\u2019s order of workers\u2019 compensation benefits amounted to $10,132.19, including interest. Thus, the MBTA contends that McCarthy was overpaid. The MBTA acknowledges that it allows employees who receive workers\u2019 compensation to supplement the sixty percent of their salary received through workers\u2019 compensation with sick time (but not vacation time) for the remaining forty percent, resulting in an injured employee recovering his full salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Months later, on November 19, 2003, the MBTA requested an emergency status conference with the administrative judge to address its problem with the July 16, 2003, order. The MBTA also sent a letter to McCarthy\u2019s counsel addressing the \u201cdouble recovery\u201d issue, indicating that the \u201cdouble\u201d recovery ordered in this case was contrary to MBTA payroll procedure, although it is not addressed in the collective bargaining agreement. The MBTA indicated to McCarthy\u2019s counsel that it was willing to enter into a \u00a7 19 agreement pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 19, with McCarthy or it would initiate recoupment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>proceedings, which it never did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\">This sum represented the $10,132.19 ordered minus the $9,596.65 reimbursed to the payroll department. We are unable to reproduce exactly the calculations that led to the said amounts in this case, but note again that these are not challenged by the parties. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b572-13\">The MBTA reasoned that by utilizing his sick time and vacation time, McCarthy had already received 100% of his salary during the period he was incapacitated. If he additionally was paid \u00a7 34 benefits, as per the order of the judge, McCarthy would receive an additional sixty percent of his salary, amounting to a total recovery of 160% of his salary for the period of his absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Concerning the MBTA\u2019s perception of the conference order as a \u201ccredit for payments it already forwarded,\u201d the reviewing board opined, correctly in our view, that \u201cnothing of the sort was ordered therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\">In a case involving an employer that purchases workers\u2019 compensation insurance through a third-party insurance company, a workers\u2019 compensation award is paid by the insurance company, not the employer, as in the present case involving a self-insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201csets up a system of money payments for the loss of earning capacity sustained by an employee by reason of a work-connected injury.\u201d <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, </em>423 Mass. 642, 644 (1996), quoting from Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 301, at 344 (2d ed. 1981). See <em>Gillen\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 96, 99 (1913); <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 141, 143 (1914) (objective of the workers\u2019 compensation act is to \u201cgive compensation for a total or partial loss of the capacity to earn wages\u201d). As such, it may be asserted that the MBTA\u2019s solution, which did not provide a cash payment, was improper. Regardless, the proper avenue was presenting its plan to the judge, not implementing it in contravention of his order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Whether McCarthy was entitled by statute or through his collective bargaining agreement to retain the funds previously received during his incapacity, or whether the MBTA may have recouped all or some of this money, is not before us. It does not appear from the record that the MBTA attempted to recover these funds in any way other than through the course of its unilateral self-reimbursement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
