The denial was based on a determination that the provision of inpatient services was not \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d as required by the regulations governing Medicaid reimbursement. MGH sought review in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), and moved for judgment on the pleadings to vacate the Division\u2019s decision. A judge of the Superior Court granted the motion and reversed the Division\u2019s decision on the basis that the Division\u2019s regulations violated MGH\u2019s due process rights because they failed to provide the plaintiff with sufficient \u201cguidance for determining whether a patient admission is appropriate.\u201d The judge also determined that the Division \u201cimproperly relied upon hindsight\u201d in making its determinations. The Division appeals from the Superior Court judgment. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The patients. </em>The reimbursements at issue were sought by MGH for services provided to three Medicaid patients, whom we call AC, DH, and EQ. In conjunction with making his determination that denial of reimbursement for inpatient services was appropriate, the Division\u2019s hearing officer made the following findings of fact as to these patients.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cMember AC, a 58 year-old female with a history of asthma, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and status post an atrial septal defect repair, was admitted to the emergency room with low back pain after a fall. . . . [Her] X-rays showed a compression fracture at L2. . . . [She] had no concerning neurological signs, a temperature of 101 degrees, a pulse of 95, a respiratory rate of 24, a blood pressure of 136/82, and an oxygen saturation of 94%. She had mild left lower quadrant tenderness and expiratory wheezes. A chest X-ray was normal, and urinalysis was positive for white blood cells. . . . [She] was treated with oral antibiotics, oral pain medications, and nebulizers. . . . Compression fractures are usually managed in an outpatient setting. . . . Member AC had limited social supports.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cMember PH, a 61 year-old male, presented to the hospital with a bulge in the left inguinal area. He underwent an elective hernia repair on November 7, 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>in the outpatient setting. . . . [He] emerged from surgery without complications .... [He] was upgraded to the inpatient setting on November 8 and discharged on November 9. He had some nausea and one episode of vomiting following IV hydration. . . . [I]n 1998 [he] also experienced nausea following general anesthesia.... IV fluids, antiemetics and antibiotics are routine following surgery and could have been provided to P.H. in an outpatient setting. ... In Dr. Hopkins\u2019 [MGH\u2019s expert witness\u2019s] opinion, member PH\u2019s vomiting 24 hours after surgery warranted his admission as an inpatient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cMember EQ, a 52 year-old male with [a] history of diabetes, presented to the emergency room on February 2, 2002 following a two-day history of vomiting. . . . [He] was admitted on February 2 and discharged on February 6 . . . [His] tests were within normal limits, and there was no concern of intra-abdominal issues. . . [He] was improving each day. In Dr. Siegel\u2019s [the Division\u2019s expert witness\u2019s] opinion, the care provided to [him], while appropriate, could have been provided to him in a specially designated hospital observation bed. . . . Member EQ was a brittle diabetic. In Dr. Hopkinsf] opinion, his condition necessitated active management of his glucose and insulin levels. However, [his] condition did not require active intervention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">b. <em>The regulations. </em>The Division is responsible for administering the Massachusetts Medicaid program. Medicaid \u201cis a joint Federal and State program established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act designed to provide medical services to those in financial need.\u201d <em>Athol Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>437 Mass. 417, 418 n.3 (2002). In order to receive Federal funds, the Division is required by Federal law to establish administrative mechanisms to \u201csafeguard against unnecessary utilization of . . . care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care. . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">To comply with this requirement, the Division issued 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 450.204 (2001), which provides that only \u201cmedically necessary\u201d services will be reimbursed. A service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>is medically necessary if it is (1) reasonably appropriate to the patient\u2019s medical needs (i.e., medically appropriate) and (2) provided in the appropriate setting (i.e., outpatient or inpatient).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Division has also established a utilization management program to conduct reviews of hospital admissions. This program is based on peer review and is designed to ensure that the requirements of 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 450.204 are met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 450.206, 450.207 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Division denied reimbursement for services provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>MGH in the three cases currently at issue based on MGH\u2019s failure to show that the services it provided were \u201cmedically necessary\u201d within the meaning of 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 450.204. In each case, the Division determined that the services provided to the patients satisfied the first prong of the test, as they were \u201cmedically appropriate,\u201d but did not satisfy the second prong of the test because they should have been provided in an outpatient, rather than an inpatient, setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">MGH appealed from these determinations, arguing that the Division\u2019s regulations governing the utilization management program do not provide sufficient guidance on when inpatient services are appropriate and allow the Division to make arbitrary decisions. The Superior Court judge reversed the Division\u2019s decision based on her determination that the regulations violated due process because they do not provide hospitals with adequate guidance on the appropriate standards applying to inpatient admissions. The judge also determined that the Division\u2019s hearing officer improperly relied on hindsight in making his determination. The Division contests both of these determinations on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">2. <em>Validity of regulations. </em>On appeal, MGH relies on two legal theories to support its argument that the Division\u2019s regulations are invalid. First, it argues that the regulations are impermissibly vague, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Second, it argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>regulations, as administered, are in conflict with the Federal legislative mandate under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">a. <em>Due process. </em>We begin by reviewing MGH\u2019s due process argument. \u201cA law is void for vagueness if persons \u2018of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,\u2019 \u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 873 (1983), quoting from <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926), or if it \u201csubjects people to an unascertainable standard.\u201d <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>387 Mass. 372, 378 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Challenges for vagueness are usually raised in the criminal context. See <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 780 (2002). While civil statutes are also subject to scrutiny for vagueness, \u201c[t]he test is less strict when the law involves the regulation of business and economic activity and does not inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We also limit our analysis \u201cto whether [the regulations are] unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case,\u201d without considering its constitutionality as applied to other cases. <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brock-ton, </em>387 Mass. at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In addition, we recognize that \u201cthe practical necessities of discharging the business of government inevitably limit the specificity with which [a regulatory agency] can spell out prohibitions.\u201d <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. Of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>387 Mass. at 378, quoting from <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 340 (1952). We also recognize that the \u201csubject matter and the circumstances\u201d will affect the degree of certainty to which standards can be established. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114, 118 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The Division\u2019s regulations, as applied to the present case, do not fall below this standard. In addition to defining the term \u201cmedically necessary\u201d in 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 450.204, the regulations provide hospitals with several sources of guidance in interpreting this definition. Title 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 415.402 (1999) provides definitions related to inpatient and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>outpatient services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Title 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 415.414(C) (2000) provides a list of factors that doctors should consider when deciding whether to admit an individual as an inpatient.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And the acute inpatient admission guidelines, to which reference is made in 130 C.F.R. \u00a7 415.414(C)(7), provide concrete examples of situations in which inpatient hospital admission would generally <em>not </em>be medically necessary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The guidelines read in conjunction with the regulations do not present an \u201cunascertainable standard,\u201d nor do they require \u201cpersons \u2018of common intelligence [to] necessarily guess at [their] meaning and differ as to [their] application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. at 873, quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572 n.8 (1974). See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>387 Mass. at 387. See also <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 126-130 (1985) (finding that regulation disciplining accountants for acts \u201cdiscreditable to the profession\u201d was not impermissibly vague); <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>403 Mass. 350, 356-358 (1988) (finding that regulation disciplining chiropractor for \u201c[o]verutilization of practice\u201d was not impermissibly vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">b. <em>Compliance with Federal mandate. </em>We now address the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Division\u2019s regulations were inconsistent with the Federal legislative mandate. When reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Division\u2019s regulations \u201cwe must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). However, \u201ca regulation that is irreconcilable with an agency\u2019s enabling legislation cannot stand.\u201d <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Water Resources Authy., </em>421 Mass. 463, 468 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In determining \u201cwhether the agency conformed with the controlling statute[,] .... [w]e are limited to a determination whether the State action is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>419 Mass. 644, 652 (1995). See <em>Tarin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 743, 750 (1997). \u201c[A] court cannot \u2018substitute [its] judgment as to the need for a regulation, or the propriety of the means chosen to implement the statutory goals, for that of the agency, so long as the regulation is rationally related to those goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 772 (2002), quoting from <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 477, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Both the plaintiff and the judge below rely on the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s holding in <em>Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>428 Mass. 805 (1999) <em>(Mass. Eye &amp; Ear), </em>to support their position that the Division\u2019s regulations are \u201cso lacking in standards as to be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814. In <em>Mass. Eye &amp; Ear, </em>the court held that a prior version of the presently disputed regulations did not \u201ccomport with the mandate of the Federal statute\u201d that they implemented. <em>Id. </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The court in <em>Mass. Eye &amp; Ear </em>identified three areas where the regulatory regime fell short: (1) the regulations \u201cfail[ed] to define \u2018[m]edical [necessity\u2019 in any meaningful manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 813; (2) the review process improperly relied on hindsight in determining the appropriateness of a doctor\u2019s decision to admit, rather than \u201ctak[ing] into account the physician-assessed risk to the particular patient at the time of admission,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 814-815; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>and (3) the Division imposed a \u201csevere all-or-nothing penalty on providers who render appropriate treatment in the \u2018wrong\u2019 setting,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 816.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court then gave two alternatives for remedying the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201cThe division may operate on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate level of care, defined in some meaningful way, and allow reimbursement at that level, provided there is adequate review of its decision. Or it may promulgate clear rules and deny all reimbursement to providers who seek reimbursement at levels not in compliance with those rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 817. A thorough review of the Division\u2019s regulations, considered in conjunction with the inpatient guidelines, note 7, <em>supra, </em>convinces us that the current regulations comply with the requirements set out by <em>Mass. Eye &amp; Ear.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">As discussed, for purposes of authorizing reimbursement for inpatient services, the regulations essentially define \u201cmedical necessity\u201d as a medically appropriate service that cannot effectively be provided in a less costly outpatient setting. In view of the specificity provided by the appropriate factors and the guidelines (see notes 5-7, <em>supra), </em>we conclude that the regulations sufficiently define \u201cmedical necessity\u201d to allow providers to determine in what circumstances an inpatient admission is appropriate. In particular, we point to the inclusion of \u201cObservation Services\u201d as defined in 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 415.402 (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>and the evident thrust of the regulatory scheme favoring what might best be termed an intermediate level of care, \u201coutpatient hospital services provided ... in an acute inpatient hospital,\u201d affording a closer clinical observation and monitoring of patients who may need it without the need (or cost) of an inpatient admission, before resort to inpatient services. See guidelines at note 7, <em>supra. </em>This thread runs throughout the regulations and guidelines, which strike a balance between the need for medically appropriate care and the use of the least expensive setting to provide that care.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The plaintiff next asserts, and the judge concluded, that the review process improperly relies upon hindsight. This is facially incorrect. \u201cReviewers consider the medical-record documentation of clinical information available to the admitting provider at the time the decision to admit was made. Reviewers do not deny admissions based on what happened to the member after the admission.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 415.414(B)(1) (2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Unlike in <em>Mass. Eye &amp; Ear, </em>the Division has \u201ccompl[ied] with the Federal statutory mandate to provide utilization review that \u2018assure[s] that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mass. Eye &amp; Ear, supra </em>at 814, quoting from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A). The regulatory scheme is sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in <em>Mass. Eye &amp; Ear, </em>and is not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law\u201d as the plaintiff suggests. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>419 Mass. at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">3. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>MGH asserted below that the Division\u2019s decision to deny reimbursement in each of the three cases was not supported by substantial evidence. In light of her decision on constitutional grounds, the Superior Court judge did not reach the issue. Neither party addresses the issue before us,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which we do not reach in the first instance on appeal. We remand this matter to the Superior Court for a determination whether there is substantial evidence to support the Division\u2019s decision in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-15\">In 2003, the Division of Medical Assistance was renamed the Office of Medicaid.

The review occurs in several stages and is based on the medical records submitted by the hospital to the Division, pursuant to 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 450.209(B) (1999). A registered nurse conducts an initial screening of the records; the nurse may either approve a claim or refer it to a physician reviewer, but may not independently deny a claim. The referred claims are then reviewed by a licensed physician actively practicing in the same clinical discipline as the care in question. If the reviewing physician determines that reimbursement should be denied, a proposed initial determination is sent to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">If the hospital disagrees with the determination, it must respond by submitting additional documentation or by a teleconference with the reviewing physician.

The Division\u2019s hearing officer specifically noted in his decision that he did not \u201cconsider!] the response times of the patients in their inpatient settings.\u201d Rather, he looked at the patients\u2019 medical information as \u201cnoted in their medical records at the time the respective decisions to admit were made.\u201d Nothing in the hearing officer\u2019s decision indicates that he did otherwise. We also find no support for the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the nature of the review process makes it impossible for evaluating physicians to make unbiased evaluations once they are aware of the patients\u2019 outcomes. There is nothing in the record before us to indicate that the plaintiff has been denied due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We do not regard the Division\u2019s bald assertion, in one line of the conclusion of its appellate brief, that its decision was supported by substantial evidence as rising to the level of appellate argument.
