In 1994, the decedent requested that the attorney prepare his last will and testament. In accordance with the decedent\u2019s instructions, the attorney drafted a will that bequeathed the decedent\u2019s stock in General Electric Company to Bentley College, the decedent\u2019s alma mater, and named the attorney as executor and residuary legatee of the remainder of the estate. The decedent, whose competence is not at issue, executed the will on June 18, 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He died on May 18, 2000, leaving no known heirs at law or next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">On June 26, 2000, the attorney petitioned for probate of the will without sureties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The probate judge allowed the will and appointed the attorney executor, without objection, on September 25, 2000. On October 15, 2001, the attorney filed an affidavit of notice to devisees and legatees that listed Bentley College and the attorney as the only beneficiaries under the will. On September 5, 2002, the attorney filed a first and final accounting, together with a release of all demands and general assent to the accounting of Bentley College. The Attorney General\u2019s office, division of public charities, also filed a general assent to the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Among other disbursements, the accounting showed two payments to the attorney \u2014 one for $50,000 represented executor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>and attorney\u2019s fees; the other, in the amount of $791,150.58, represented the residue of the estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the first and final accounting came before the court for approval in October, 2003, the judge, sua sponte, entered an order (with notice to the Attorney General\u2019s office, division of public charities) for the attorney to appear and explain the executor\u2019s and attorney\u2019s fees charged, as well as the distribution to himself as residuary legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">An evidentiary hearing followed at which the judge inquired into the circumstances surrounding the drafting and execution of the will and the events that followed until the testator\u2019s death. In particular, the judge inquired whether the attorney had taken any action vis-a-vis the testator after the adoption of Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.8(c), 426 Mass. 1339 (effective January 1, 1998), which provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer . . . any substantial gift from a chent, including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The judge made findings of fact that we summarize as follows. The attorney is not related to the decedent. He first met the decedent in 1986 when he represented the decedent in a real estate purchase. They had no further contact until 1991, when the decedent\u2019s neighbors contacted the attorney and informed him that the decedent had been admitted to Cape Cod Hospital. The attorney visited him in the hospital and, at the decedent\u2019s request, became his attorney-in-fact. The attorney assisted the decedent in recovering the proceeds of a travel insurance policy and arranged for his discharge from the hospital to a nursing facility. The decedent remained in the nursing facility for twenty-one months, where the attorney visited him as frequently as twice per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">With the attorney\u2019s assistance, the decedent was able to move from the nursing facility to his own home. With the decedent\u2019s funds, the attorney arranged for renovations to make the decedent\u2019s home handicapped accessible and permit the decedent to five independently. The attorney also purchased a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>motorized device that enabled the decedent to move around his neighborhood and visit neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In 1994, the decedent asked the attorney to draft his will and expressed his desire to name Bentley College and the attorney as the sole beneficiaries. In response to this request, the attorney did not recommend that the decedent seek independent legal advice. Rather, he asked the decedent, \u201cAre you sure? Isn\u2019t there somebody else out there that you want to remember?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">When the attorney drafted the will in 1994, the Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules Regulating the Practice of Law provided that, \u201cexcept with the consent of his client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not accept employment if the exercise of his professional judgment on behalf of his client will be or reasonably may be affected by his own financial, business, property, or personal interests.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon Five, DR 5-101(A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981). The attorney was not familiar with that disciplinary rule (or, we assume, with American Bar Association Ethical Consideration 5-5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">On February 1, 1995, subsequent to execution of the will, the Supreme Judicial Court adopted Canon Five, DR 5-108(A), 419 Mass. 1302, prohibiting a lawyer from drafting any instrument that gave the lawyer \u201cany substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee.\u201d The attorney was unfamiliar with that disciplinary rule when enacted in 1995, or as codified thereafter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">From 1996 until the decedent\u2019s death, the attorney coordinated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the various medical and social services that were necessary to permit the decedent to live independently. The attorney or members of his office staff would visit the decedent\u2019s home at least weekly to check on his well-being and to perform chores such as grocery shopping and trash disposal. The attorney also attended to other matters, including tax preparation and prepayment of the decedent\u2019s funeral and burial expenses. At the decedent\u2019s interment, only the attorney and the funeral director were present. After the decedent\u2019s death, the attorney attempted to locate possible heirs through the death records of the decedent\u2019s parents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He also reviewed the decedent\u2019s correspondence. In offering the will for probate, the attorney followed all legal requirements for publication, and two months\u2019 notice failed to elicit any responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Based on the foregoing factual findings, the judge concluded that the changes in bar disciplinary rules subsequent to execution of the decedent\u2019s will imposed a duty on the attorney to contact his client, advise him of the change, and notify him that if he still wished to benefit the attorney on his death, he should seek out independent counsel and draft a new will to that effect. Predicated on this finding, and the implicit conclusion that the attorney\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of professional duty, the judge reported the question whether that breach of duty rises to such level as to invalidate the residuary bequest to the attorney and preclude approval of the first and final accounting. Because the decedent apparently died leaving no heirs at law and next of kin, the residuary estate would escheat to the Commonwealth should the decedent\u2019s bequest of the residue to the attorney be invalidated. See G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 3(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The matter comes before us in a peculiar posture. The question reported by the judge, and the underlying examination of the attorney\u2019s conduct, does not arise in the context of an adversary proceeding. This is not a case in which heirs at law and next of kin, or other natural objects of the testator\u2019s bounty, contest his will as being the product of undue influence. See, e.g., <em>Tarricone </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>340 Mass. 758, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>762 (1960). See also <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>324 Mass. 685, 687-688 (1949), <em>S.C., </em>327 Mass. 760 (1951). Nor is there any suggestion whatsoever that the testator was not fully competent. Indeed, no one, other than the judge, sua sponte, has questioned the executor\u2019s accounting. The Attorney General\u2019s office declined a request from this court to file a brief and participate in this proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We assume, without deciding, that even absent objection by any party, a probate judge to whom an account is presented for allowance has the authority to undertake the inquiry that the judge did here. See G. L. c. 206, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 24 (setting forth the powers of a probate judge in allowance of accounts, and notice requirements); <em>Matter of the Trusts Under the Will of Crabtree, </em>440 Mass. 177, 189-190 (2003) (under G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 1, Probate and Family Court retains supervisory control over trustee it has appointed and may examine him under oath on matters relative to his accounts under G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 3). We note that a number of thorny questions arise when a judge undertakes both an inquisitory and fact-finding role without the traditional safeguards of adversary presentation. We need not resolve these difficulties, however, because we conclude that the judge\u2019s report is procedurally deficient and must be discharged. See <em>Dorfman </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>386 Mass. 136, 138 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 215, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1975, c. 400, \u00a7 59, . . . states that \u2018[a] judge of the probate court by whom a case or matter is heard for final determination may reserve and report the evidence and all questions of law therein for consideration of the appeals court.\u2019 It also permits him to report questions following an interlocutory judgment, decree, or order. However, in the absence of a judgment, decree, or order, as here, \u00a7 13 \u2018does not authorize a report of a part of a case or of specific questions of law arising therein. The report must be of the entire case and in such form that this court can enter or order the entry of a final decree disposing of the case.\u2019 <em>Curran, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>petitioner, </em>314 Mass. 91, 94 (1943).\u201d <em>Dorfman </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>386 Mass. at 138. Here, the judge reported a specific question of law. He did not report the entire case, nor did he make, or report, an interlocutory decree, order, or judgment. Rather, he posed to us an abstract question of law. See <em>Cusic </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>412 Mass. 291, 293-294 (1992) (discharging report that presents abstract question of law for decision). Thus, his report must be discharged. See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>422 Mass. 666, 667-668 (1996) (authority of probate judge to report case derives from G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, and absent interlocutory ruling or order, report must be of entire case or case must be discharged). See also <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>413 Mass. 1003, 1004 (1992) (second sentence of G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, permits report only where interlocutory order so affects merits of controversy that matter ought to be determined by Appeals Court before further proceedings). Because of the peculiar procedural posture of the case and the absence, at present, of objection by anyone other than the judge, we are unable to resolve definitively whether the judge would be warranted in refusing to allow the account and invalidating the bequests to the attorney under the will. Nevertheless, because we consider the reported question to rest on a flawed premise, we state our views on whether the enactment of Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.8(c) imposed a retroactive obligation on the attorney, the violation of which would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty that would invalidate the residuary bequest to the attorney.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Dorfman </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>386 Mass. at 138; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>422 Mass. at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Underlying the reported question are subsidiary determinations that (1) amendments to the Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules and the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct in 1995 and 1998 imposed a duty on the attorney to advise the testator to seek out independent counsel to redraft his previously executed will; and (2) failure to do so amounted to a breach of the attorney\u2019s professional duty. Conspicuously absent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>however, is any citation to legal authority supporting the judge\u2019s subsidiary determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Disciplinary rules operate prospectively, not retroactively. See Mass.R.Prof.C. Scope [5], as appearing in 426 Mass. 1307 (1998) (assessment of lawyer\u2019s conduct made on basis of facts and circumstances existing at time of conduct in question). Prior to 1995, no disciplinary rule specifically prohibited a lawyer from drafting an instrument that gave the lawyer a substantial gift. The conflict of interest arising from such representation fell within the ambit of former Canon Five, DR 5-101, as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981), which \u201cprohibited lawyers from accepting employment if the lawyer\u2019s professional judgment on behalf of the client would or reasonably might have been affected by her own financial or personal interests unless she had obtained the Ghent\u2019s informed consent.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nancy Kaufman, Where There\u2019s a Will . . . (April 2001), at http:// www.mass.gov/obcbbo/will.htm (last visited July 13, 2006). Nothing in the amendments to the disciplinary rules or rules of professional conduct suggests or imposes a retroactive prohibition on the attorney\u2019s drafting of such an instrument or an obligation to revisit with the client the circumstances of an already executed document. Moreover, even if the attorney\u2019s conduct and failure to advise the client subsequently regarding an already-executed will may be said to have violated an applicable disciplinary rule, such a violation is only evidence of a breach of professional duty, not, ipso facto, a determination that the lawyer has breached his professional duty and that the transaction must be undone. See <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 649 (1986) (\u201cA violation of a canon of ethics or a disciplinary rule ... is not itself an actionable breach of duty to a client\u201d). As noted previously, this is not a case where an adversary is challenging the testator\u2019s will as the product of the fraud or undue influence of the attorney. Were that so, there would be clear basis for imposing on the attorney the burden of establishing that the transaction did not violate his professional obligations. See <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>427 Mass. 286, 290-291 (1998). However, even in the context of a challenge to a will on the ground of undue influence where a fiduciary such as an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>tomey benefits, there was in 1994 \u201cno per se rule that an attorney must advise his client to seek independent advice in such circumstances. Instead, his failure to do so is merely evidence that the transaction was not fair and that the attorney violated his fiduciary duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291. See <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>391 Mass. 543, 555-557 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Absent a challenge by an adversary party, on the present record and the facts found here, we discern no basis for concluding that the testator did not make the bequest with full knowledge and intent. See <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>427 Mass. at 291. However, we are also unable to conclude that he did. We would have greater confidence that there is no basis for such a challenge were a disinterested neutral without a direct financial interest in the estate to have made the determination that there are no heirs at law or next of kin who wish to challenge the attorney\u2019s status as executor and residuary beneficiary. See G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 24; <em>Matter of the Trusts Under the Will of Crabtree, </em>440 Mass. at 190-194 &amp; n.30 (discussing judge\u2019s statutory authority to order notice and appoint a guardian ad litem in certain circumstances). See also <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>326 Mass. 621, 623 (1951) (improper to appoint guardian ad litem to represent interests of deceased person). Such a determination would provide assurance to the judge considering allowance of the account, and to this court, that reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain whether a potential challenger exists by a disinterested person who, unlike the attorney here, has no direct financial interest in the estate. On the other hand, the alternative suggested by the judge, invalidating a residuary bequest and escheating the residue to the Commonwealth, risks operating in derogation of the expressed wishes of a competent testator.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\n<em>Report discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The will was a so-called \u201cself-proving\u201d will signed by the testator and the witnesses in the presence of each other, and sworn before a notary public.
