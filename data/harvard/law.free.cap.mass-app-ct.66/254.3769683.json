L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), and negligent operation of a motor vehicle, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(\u00ab). He appeals only from his conviction of negligent operation of a motor vehicle, claiming that (1) the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty; and (2) the prosecutor made improper comments in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">We conclude that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s erratic driving, combined with evidence of his intoxication, was sufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty. We also conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in closing argument did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>1. <em>Denial of motion for required finding of not guilty. </em>To establish guilt under the negligent operation statute, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a), \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the defendant (1) operated a motor vehicle, (2) upon a public way, and (3) (recklessly or) negligently so that the lives or safety of the public might be endangered.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duffy, 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 921, 921 (2004). The defendant claims that there was a failure of proof as to the third factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 190 (2006). The defendant was stopped in moderate to light traffic on Route 3 by State Trooper William Tarbokas after Trooper Tarbokas observed him (1) drive his vehicle over the fog line on the left hand side of the road three or four times; (2) travel from the passing lane through the travel lane and into the breakdown lane; and (3) straddle the breakdown lane for approximately 300 feet, where he narrowly missed a four foot square orange reflective sign warning drivers of road work ahead. The defendant was driving fifty miles per hour (the posted speed limit was sixty miles per hour) and was using his windshield wipers even though it was a clear night. In addition, once the defendant pulled his car to the side of the road, he placed it in reverse rather than placing it in park.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Upon approaching the defendant, Trooper Tarbokas detected a moderate odor of alcohol and noted that the defendant\u2019s speech was \u201cthick tongued.\u201d The defendant did not have his driver\u2019s license on his person and was unsure of his whereabouts or the time. In response to the trooper\u2019s inquiry if the defendant knew where he was, the defendant responded, \u201cKind of Route 3.\u201d He further stated that it was \u201c1:30\u201d when it was approximately 11:10 p.m. After conducting field sobriety tests and determining that the defendant was intoxicated, Trooper Tarbokas placed the defendant under arrest and transported him to the State police barracks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>There is sufficient support for a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty when \u201cthe Commonwealth produce[s] enough evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, to satisfy any rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that each element of the crime [is] present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siciliano, </em>420 Mass. 303, 307 (1995), quoting from <em>Aucella </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 415, 416 (1990). Here, the Commonwealth produced evidence that the defendant drove while intoxicated, meandered back and forth over the fog line on the left hand side of the road, crossed over two lanes of traffic, straddled the breakdown lane for approximately 300 feet, and nearly struck a large road sign before swerving back into the travel lane. It was both reasonable and permissible for the trier of fact to infer that the defendant operated his motor vehicle in a negligent manner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 403 (2003), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swartz, </em>343 Mass. 709, 713 (1962) (\u201cinference of defendant\u2019s guilt from all circumstances, \u2018while not compelling, was at least permissible\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty because he was not speeding and was not involved in an accident. This argument misses the point. The statute only requires proof that the lives or safety of the public <em>might </em>be endangered, not that they <em>were </em>endangered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 923. The facts were sufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siciliano, </em>420 Mass. at 307-308 (erratic operation and nearly striking traffic island sufficient evidence of negligently driving to endanger).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant argues that the prosecutor misstated the evidence on three occasions. As the defendant did not object to the contested remarks, our review is limited to determining whether there was error and, if so, whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delong, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 122, 132 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The first two remarks the defendant challenges related to the defendant\u2019s driving. The prosecutor argued that the defendant drove \u201coff the road in the left hand lane\u201d and that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>was in the breakdown lane for \u201chundreds of feet.\u201d \u201c \u2018[Prosecutors are entitled to marshal the evidence and suggest inferences that the jury may draw from it.\u2019. . . The inferences suggested by the prosecutor need only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>415 Mass. 715, 725 (1993). The argument was a fair statement based on the evidence. Trooper Tarbokas testified without objection that the defendant \u201ccross[ed] over the left hand fog line of the roadway\u201d several times. He further testified that the defendant straddled the breakdown lane for \u201ca few hundred feet.\u201d On this record, we cannot say with confidence that the challenged remarks were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor further misstated the evidence when he said that Trooper Tarbokas detected a \u201cstrong\u201d odor of alcohol when he approached the defendant. The defendant contends correctly that Trooper Tarbokas testified that he detected a \u201cmoderate\u201d odor of alcohol. The prosecutor did overstate the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201c[I]t is presumed that the judge as trier of fact applies correct legal principles.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milo M., </em>433 Mass. 149, 152 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Colon, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308 (1992). \u201c[T]he law is that the fact finder is to rely on his memory of the evidence, not that of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>439 Mass. 441, 452 (2003). Furthermore, because this was a jury-waived trial, we are not concerned with the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement on a jury. In sum, the error did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The defendant subsequently agreed to a breathalyzer test which showed a blood alcohol level of .07 per cent. Trooper Tarbokas, who remained with the defendant for approximately one and one-half hours, testified that the defendant Had some difficulty responding to routine questions during the booking process and opined that the defendant\u2019s level of sobriety (or lack thereof) did not change during that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
