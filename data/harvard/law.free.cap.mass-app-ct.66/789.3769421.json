Mankewich to the planning board of Scituate (board), seeking endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8 IP, that approval of the plan was not required under the subdivision control law, requires an affirmative vote by a majority of the members of the board or whether a majority of a quorum of the board will suffice. We conclude that the former is required; therefore, in the absence of the requisite vote, Mankewich\u2019s plan was disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">1. <em>Background. </em>Mankewich and the plaintiffs, John R. and Kathleen A. Duddy and Richard M. and Shirley Golder, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>owners of lots formerly owned by William and Sarah Davidson; all of the lots have frontage on a private way called Harbor Heights Road.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Harbor Heights Road was established by the Davidsons prior to subdividing the land. According to subdivision plans recorded by the Davidsons in 1942 and 1945, the road was forty feet wide and extended from Front Street on the east to Hazel Avenue on the west.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Harbor Heights Road, as depicted on the plans, would provide the lots fronting it with adequate access to two public roads,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it does not appear from the record that the Davidsons actually built any part of Harbor Heights Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">As of October, 1945, the Davidson property had been divided into thirty different lots, most of which were conveyed between 1942 and 1945 to several different grantees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In August, 1998, Mankewich obtained the disputed lots. The deeds conveying those lots did not grant Mankewich a right of way over Harbor Heights Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In May, 2001, Mankewich filed a plan with the board, seeking endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8 IP, that approval of the plan was not required under the subdivision control law (ANR endorsement). The plan depicted two lots, which were to be created by merging four existing lots into two.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time the plan was submitted, only the eastern portion of Harbor Heights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Road had been constructed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The portion of Harbor Heights Road adjacent to Mankewich\u2019s lots and continuing west remained unimproved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The board rejected this plan, in part because the lots had \u201cinadequate access and lack of frontage,\u201d both of which are required for ANR endorsement under \u00a7 8 IP.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Mankewich filed an identical plan with the board in 2004, after making improvements to the portion of Harbor Heights Road immediately adjacent to the four lots at issue and creating a narrow dirt and gravel road leading west of the lots. Three members of the five-member board were present at the February 26, 2004, meeting at which Mankewich\u2019s second plan was addressed. At the meeting, the plaintiffs argued that Mankewich did not have a legal right to access the portion of Harbor Heights Road leading east from his property and that the portion of Harbor Heights Road leading to the west did not provide adequate physical access. Prior to making a determination, the board reviewed materials relating to the condition of Harbor Heights Road leading from Mankewich\u2019s property in both directions and Mankewich\u2019s legal right to use the portion of Harbor Heights Road to the east of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Based on the information presented at the meeting, two of the three board members who were present voted in favor of Mankewich\u2019s motion for ANR endorsement under \u00a7 8 IP. One voted against. While the votes in favor constituted a majority of the quorum, they represented a minority of the five-member panel. The plaintiffs sought review of the board\u2019s ANR endorsement in the Land Court. Acting on cross motions for summary judgment, a judge of that court concluded that the board\u2019s ANR endorsement \u201cwas lawful and did not exceed its authority.\u201d Judgment entered accordingly, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that endorsement of a plan under \u00a7 8IP requires votes from a full majority of the board members, and that the board exceeded its authority in endorsing the plan without such a majority. The plaintiffs request, therefore, that the Land Court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor be vacated and that summary judgment be entered in their favor on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s subdivision control law, as set forth in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K-81GG, requires that any person intending to make a subdivision of land in a city or town where the subdivision control law is in effect must first submit a plan of the proposed subdivision to the planning board of that city or town. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 810. Section 81P of the subdivision control law provides an expedited process for persons seeking to record a plan if they believe the plan does not constitute a subdivision as it is defined in \u00a7 81L of the subdivision control law. Accordingly, if a planning board determines that a plan does not require approval under the subdivision control law, \u201cit shall forthwith, without a public hearing, endorse thereon ... the words \u2018approval under the subdivision control law not required ....\u2019\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, as amended by St. 1961, c. 332. The question posed to us is whether the votes of two members out of a five-member panel are enough to support the board\u2019s endorsement under \u00a7 8IP.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\u201cIn the absence of statutory restriction the general rule is that a majority of a council or board is a quorum and a majority of the quorum can act.\u201d <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>236 Mass. 463, 467 (1920). <em>Clark </em>v. <em>City Council of Waltham, </em>328 Mass. 40, 41 (1951). In <em>McElderry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>431 Mass. 722, 725-726 (2000), the Supreme Judicial Court determined that there is a \u201cstatutory restriction\u201d in the subdivision control law that makes this general rule inapplicable. This determination was based on language in \u00a7\u00a7 81L, 81U, 81V, and 81X of the subdivision control law. Based on a reading of these sections, the court concluded that approval of a definitive subdivision plan under \u00a7 81U requires votes in favor of the plan by a majority of all the board\u2019s members. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Mankewich argues that the <em>McElderry </em>holding does not apply to ANR endorsements made under \u00a7 8 IP because this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>provides \u201cno \u2018statutory restriction\u2019 or other ground for requiring that such a vote be by a majority of the entire board.\u201d To support this argument, Mankewich distinguishes the \u201cministerial\u201d nature of the board\u2019s actions under \u00a7 8IP from the \u201cdetailed procedure\u201d described in <em>McElderry </em>for approving definitive subdivision plans under \u00a7\u00a7 81T, 81U, and 81V.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 725. While it is true that procedures differ for these two types of determinations,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mankewich\u2019s argument does not comport with the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>McElderry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The conclusion in <em>McElderry </em>rests on the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 81L, which defines the term \u201cCertified by [or endorsed by] a planning board,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as it is used in the remainder of the subdivision control law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court interpreted this language as requiring an endorsement to be supported by votes from a majority of the members of the board, \u201cor such representative of the board as \u2018its chairman or clerk or any other person\u2019 so authorized by a majority of the board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726. That statutory requirement appears to apply to ANR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>endorsement by the board under \u00a7 8 IP just as much as it does to a definitive plan under \u00a7\u00a7 81U and 81V.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In other words, although the procedures for a definitive plan are more elaborate than those for ANR endorsement, the requirement for board action \u2014 as specified under \u00a7 81L \u2014 is the same in both situations. We, therefore, find no basis for Mankewich\u2019s argument that separate voting standards should be applied to these two procedures. See <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 873 (1985) (\u201ca statute should be read as a whole to produce an internal consistency\u201d); <em>Acting Superintendent of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 104 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we vacate the judgment entered on April 15, 2005, in favor of the defendants and order entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Harbor Heights Road was first depicted on two subdivision plans filed by the Davidsons simultaneously in 1942. These plans subdivided the land into several lots, all of which fronted on Harbor Heights Road. William Davidson further subdivided the land in 1945 through the submission of four additional plans. Like the lots in the 1942 plans, these lots contained frontage on Harbor Heights Road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">In 1942, the Davidsons simultaneously filed Land Court Plans No. 14568B (B Plan) and No. 14568D (D Plan). The B plan, which divided the easterly portion of the property into lots numbered 1 to 5, also showed a forty-foot wide private way that extended from Front Street to the northwest boundary of lot 4, a distance of 468 feet. The D plan depicted lots 6 through 19 and showed Harbor Heights Road extending beyond the northwesterly boundary of lot 11, but not all the way to Hazel Avenue. Land Court Plan No. 145681 (I plan), which was filed in 1945, was the first plan that showed Harbor Heights Road extending all the way to Hazel Avenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\">Front Street and Hazel Avenue are both public roads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b818-11\">While some of the deeds contained a right of way over Harbor Heights Road, a number of them did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Specifically, the plan would merge lot 25 with lot 26 and lot 28 with lot 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">This portion of Harbor Heights Road started just east of Mankewich\u2019s property line and continued to its intersection with Front Street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">This portion of Harbor Heights Road, if constructed, would provide access to Hazel Avenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The board stated three reasons for denying endorsement under \u00a7 8 IP: inadequate access and lack of frontage, the inability to show that Harbor Heights Road existed prior to the effective date of the subdivision control law in Scituate, and the failure to construct Harbor Heights Road or guarantee such construction by posting security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The procedures for approving and endorsing definitive subdivision plans are contained in \u00a7\u00a7 81T, 81U, and 81V of the subdivision control law: \u00a7 81T provides that a public hearing must be held before the board makes its determination regarding the plan and sets forth the notice requirements and procedures for the hearing; \u00a7 81U sets forth the standards and procedures for approval, modification, or disapproval of proposed plans; and \u00a7 81V sets forth the procedures for endorsing a proposed plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We note that \u201cthe role of a planning board in acting on an application for an ANR endorsement is not so mechanical.\u201d <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Dighton, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 394, 395-396 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">For example, while approval of definitive subdivision plans under \u00a7 81U requires a public hearing before a board makes its determination, no such hearing is required for ANR endorsements under \u00a7 81R See G.
