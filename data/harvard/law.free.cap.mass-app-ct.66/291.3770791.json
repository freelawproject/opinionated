Leneski appeals from his conviction for larceny of property valued at over $250. On appeal, he claims (1) that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting a \u201cvideo CD\u201d (compact disc or CD) of digitally recorded surveillance of a convenience store in which the defendant was working; (2) that the trial judge committed error in fading to give, sua sponte, a \u201climiting\u201d instruction; and (3) that the CD should not have been admitted as its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Facts. </em>Charles Mabardy, the owner of the Salisbury Mini-Mart (store) in Salisbury, testified that on November 7, 2002, he went to the store and reviewed images produced by surveillance cameras monitoring his store on the night and early morning hours of November 6 and 7, 2002. The defendant, who had worked at the store for roughly one year, typically worked the third shift, from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. and always did so alone. In viewing images from 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., Mabardy observed the defendant \u201cgrabbing [lottery scratch] tickets out of the area where the tickets are.\u201d He pulled \u201c[o]ver 20; 10 or 20\u201d lottery scratch tickets, \u201c[r]ight hand, left hand, one over the other.\u201d Further review of the surveillance system images revealed that no one else was in the store at the time. The defendant then disappeared from the camera\u2019s view, and the power went off. The only power outage in the store was to the \u201crecording devices\u201d and cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Mabardy testified that two days prior to the incident he had installed a new surveillance system that consisted of motion sensitive cameras that connected to his computer; the cameras were activated by motion in the store, and the images they captured were recorded on the computer\u2019s \u201chard drive.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The images thus captured could be viewed on the computer, or transferred to a compact disc for viewing on another computer or by means of a video player.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mabardy testified that he had viewed the video images of the defendant on his computer, that he had transferred the pertinent portions of the images to a CD, and that he had reviewed the CD and recognized it as \u201ca fair and accurate representation of the film that [he] viewed of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>store premises the night that [the defendant] worked starting on the 6th and ending on the 7th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The defendant objected to the introduction of the CD, arguing that he understood there had been a videotape, not a CD, and that the CD had been \u201cmanufactured.\u201d The judge overruled the objection, stating that, \u201cIf it\u2019s a copy just like any other video tape the fact that it\u2019s in DVD or CD form as opposed to VHS form\u201d made no difference. The CD was admitted into evidence, and was later played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">At trial, the defendant contended that he had removed twenty ten-dollar lottery scratch tickets at the request of a customer, but that the sale was ultimately not made. He testified that on the night in question, someone came in and said, \u201cgive me ten of one and ten of two,\u201d meaning, inferentially, ten ten-dollar lottery scratch tickets from dispenser number one and ten ten-dollar lottery scratch tickets from dispenser number two. The customer \u201chollered out the tickets\u201d without stopping while on the way to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts counter in another part of the store. The defendant testified that the customer also went to the automated teller machine, which \u201cwouldn\u2019t take his credit card.\u201d The defendant further testified that the customer then went to another cash register that was not shown on the surveillance system and said that he would come back later. The defendant \u201cput [the lottery scratch tickets] back in when the guy didn\u2019t buy them\u201d and that was why his \u201cnumbers c[a]me out right.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant also testified that he was not in the store at \u201c18:55,\u201d the time displayed on the CD when it depicted the defendant removing the lottery scratch tickets, but that there was \u201cno question\u201d in his mind that he was shown on the CD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>that was played to the jury. He also claimed to know nothing of a power failure that night, but acknowledged knowing where the circuit breakers were, and that if he tripped one of them, something would happen, depending on which one was tripped.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The defendant\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the CD in evidence, contending that, as he argued at trial, it was untrustworthy and incomplete. He also claims, for the first time on appeal, that the judge committed error in not giving, sua sponte, a limiting instruction, and that the CD\u2019s probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Admissibility of evidence \u201cis largely committed to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Annolfo, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 413, 429 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noxon, </em>319 Mass. 495, 536-537 (1946) (admission of photographs in evidence rests largely in discretion of trial judge and whether photographs are sufficiently verified is preliminary question of fact to be decided by him).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Our courts have held that videotapes are \u201con balance, a reliable evidentiary resource,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>397 Mass. 351, 359 (1986), and that they \u201cshould be admissible as evidence if they are relevant, they provide a fair representation of that which they purport to depict, and they are not otherwise barred by an exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>400 Mass. 524, 527 (1987). There are ordinarily no constitutional prohibitions requiring the exclusion of videotapes. See <em>id. </em>at 527-528. \u201cIt was within the judge\u2019s discretion to admit the videotape.\u201d <em>Viveiros\u2019s Case, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 301 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Videotapes, like photographs, are not subject to the best evidence rule. \u201cThe best evidence rule is applicable to only those situations where the contents of a writing are sought to be proved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balukonis, </em>357 Mass. 721, 725 (1970), citing <em>Fauci </em>v. <em>Mulready, </em>337 Mass. 532, 540-542 (1958). The best evidence rule would not apply to a videotape recorded by a store\u2019s security system, and a properly authenticated copy would be admissible if otherwise relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">For similar reasons, we hold that digital images placed and stored in a computer hard drive and transferred to a compact disc are subject to the same rules of evidence as videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In other contexts our courts have deemed that digital images on a hard drive are appropriate evidence even though not specifically provided by statute. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>438 Mass. 282, 285-286 (2002). As with videotapes, we think that digital image evidence is not subject to the best evidence rule, as such images are not writings, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balukonis, supra. </em>Further, according to rule 1001(3) of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence, the images copied to a CD would be originals, and thus in full compliance with the best evidence rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Here, the CD was properly authenticated by Mabardy, who viewed the images on the computer and \u201cburned\u201d the CD copy; he testified as to the procedure he used in the surveillance process, the copying process, and to the contents of the CD. This testimony was sufficient to authenticate the CD, and to render it admissible as evidence. Any concerns that the defendant had regarding the surveillance procedures, and the method of storing and reproducing the video material, \u201cwere properly the subject of cross-examination and affected the weight, not the admissibility, of the\u201d CD. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>400 Mass. at 529-530.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The defendant argues for the first time on appeal that the CD was \u201cincomplete,\u201d and that the judge should have given, sua sponte, a limiting instruction to that effect. \u201cA party \u2018is not permitted to raise an issue before the trial court on a specific ground, and then to present that issue to [the reviewing] court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>on a different ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lauzier, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 633 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 483 (2001). Even were we to consider the arguments, the defendant would fare no better. Any issue as to the incompleteness of the CD would go to the weight and not the admissibility of the evidence, and nothing has been made to appear in the record of a need for a limiting instruction, even if one had been requested. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>421 Mass. 357, 364-365 (1995) (judge gave strong limiting instruction where videotape showed defendant committing robbery for which he was not being prosecuted; videotape bore on reliability of identification); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>397 Mass. at 358-359 (appropriate limiting instruction where videotape used to show victim\u2019s state of sobriety).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendant further argues that the prejudicial effect of the compact disc outweighed its probative value. \u201cIt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge to determine whether the inflammatory nature of the evidence, including photographs and videotapes, outweighs its probative force.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>435 Mass. 509, 519 (2001) (no error in admitting videotape of defendant\u2019s brother beating victim with baseball bat several months before victim was killed). No abuse of discretion has been shown in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Mabardy testified: \u201cIt\u2019s actually a computer, so it\u2019s all on hard drive. It was a DVR, what they call a digital video recorder so it doesn\u2019t actually \u2014 the old system before I changed it would do tapes and you\u2019d have to change the tape on a daily basis. . . . This particular system which I just changed two days before, has this where it\u2019s burned onto the hard drive. It saves it for like eight weeks, but you can actually just take the mouse and drop it on top of the CD and it bums it right on the CD so you can give it to the police. . . . That\u2019s the procedure that went through for that, absolutely.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\">A compact disc is \u201ca small optical disk usu[ally] containing recorded music or computer data.\u201d Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 198, 252 (11th ed. 2004).

As the parties refer to the DVD here as a CD, we shall retain their nomenclature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Mabardy testified that he examined the defendant\u2019s \u201cshift sheet,\u201d on which employees were required to enter what scratch tickets had been sold during their shifts. The defendant\u2019s sheet showed that he had sold \u201czero\u201d tickets of the particular ten-dollar game that the CD showed him taking. In addition, Mabardy testified that he examined the shift sheet of \u201cDee,\u201d the person who worked the shift before that of the defendant, and determined that the numbers she had provided concerning the number of tickets she sold had been altered to reflect that the missing tickets had been sold during her shift. However, her receipts from her shift\u2019s sales matched the number of tickets she entered as having sold, prior to the sheet being altered. The defendant had access to Dee\u2019s shift sheet. In all, the numbers for five scratch ticket games had been altered on Dee\u2019s sheet, thereby hiding $1,400 or 320 tickets that were missing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Rule 1001(3) of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cAn \u2018original\u2019 of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it.
