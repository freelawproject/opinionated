L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Larry, the first complainant, testified at trial that when he was five years old and a student at Piccolo Mondo, Frank Garcia, one of his teachers, made him rub Frank\u2019s penis with his hand on about three occasions. He also testified that twice he touched tongues with Frank.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He said that when the penis touching occurred, another female teacher was present in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Larry\u2019s father testified as a fresh complaint witness. He recalled that while he was playing with his son at home, the child said: \u201cLet\u2019s touch tongues like me and Frank do.\u201d He said that after further inquiry, the child told him that sometimes Garcia would take off his (the child\u2019s) shoes and \u201chave him rub his wiener.\u201d The family then contacted the police. The defendant acknowledged that on one occasion he and the child accidentally touched tongues, but said that he told the child afterwards this was \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t do that again.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant denied he ever made the child \u201crub\u201d his penis. He was interviewed and booked by the police on May 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">On June 4, 2002, the mother of the second complainant, David, then aged six, became aware of the allegations against the defendant. One day later, she reported to the school and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>police that her son had told her on May 30, 2002, that the defendant had also touched tongues with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">David testified at trial that he and \u201cFrank\u201d touched tongues in the classroom,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that \u201cFrank,\u201d on more than one occasion, rubbed \u201cmy crotch.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant, in his testimony, denied all the allegations with regard to David.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The third complainant, Victor, testified at trial that when he was six years old and a student at Piccolo Mondo, the defendant played with his privates after Victor had a bout of diarrhea and the defendant had cleaned him up in the bathroom. He further said that he knew the defendant was playing with his privates because he could see no more diarrhea on himself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Victor\u2019s mother confirmed that her son had soiled himself with diarrhea at school on or about April 11, 2002. She said that Victor had not revealed to her that the defendant allegedly played with her son\u2019s privates until June 4. On that date, she questioned her son regarding any inappropriate touching at school, after she had received a note from the school regarding other allegations against the defendant. The defendant confirmed that he cleaned Victor in the bathroom and agreed that he had to touch the boy\u2019s penis and scrotum in the process. He was wearing rubber gloves at the time and denied touching the boy for any purpose other than to clean him.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In his motion for a new trial, the defendant alleged numerous shortcomings of trial counsel, including failure (1) to retain an investigator; (2) to interview prospective trial witnesses; (3) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>obtain the necessary services of an expert<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (4) to call exculpatory witnesses; (5) to present prior inconsistent statements and other evidence casting doubt on the credibility of the complainants; and (6) to raise an important variance between the bill of particulars and the evidence presented at trial as to one of the complainants (David). In addition, the defendant alleges that counsel introduced \u201cphotographs during Garcia\u2019s direct examination, which Garcia had never seen before and which had been taken after important physical alterations had been made to the classroom where the charged abuse allegedly occurred. To make matters worse, defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of suiprise photographs, not disclosed prior to trial, in cross-examining Garcia, further damaging his credibility in the eyes of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In his decision on the motion for a new trial, the judge, who was also the trial judge, ruled that counsel was indeed ineffective. Specifically, the judge focused upon defense attorney\u2019s failure to conduct adequate pretrial investigation and preparation as a major shortcoming with regard to Karen Crumbley, not only a teacher at the school, but also David\u2019s babysitter since 1998. The judge criticized counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to interview [her as] a prospective witness\u201d and to \u201cinvestigate a defense\u201d that would have resulted from that interview as well as from the attorney\u2019s consideration of reports by the police and the Department of Social Services (DSS) that were provided to him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge also noted that, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertions, these omissions could not be justified as reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tactical decisions because the attorney\u2019s failure even to interview Crumbley as a potential witness did not put him in a position to make a tactical decision with regard to her testimony. In addition, the judge said that the attorney\u2019s unjustified failure to retain the services of an investigator contributed to his ineffective assistance of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Law. </em>\u201cOn the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal of the grant of a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, we consider whether the judge committed a significant error of law or abuse of discretion in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 817-818 &amp; n.2 (1998).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>433 Mass. 93, 100-101 (2000). The appellate court \u201cpay[s] special deference to a decision on a motion for new trial where the motion judge was also the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 356 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 632 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 441-442 (2006).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>While the lack of adequate investigation can form the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrios, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 549-550 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>433 Mass. at 102,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it appears here that counsel already had in his possession exculpatory evidence that he inexplicably failed to use. It was revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>at the evidentiary hearing that, prior to trial, counsel had received documents containing Crumbley\u2019s statements, which were of clear significance to the defense. Had she been called as a witness, Crumbley would have testified that David, despite her coaxing, did not implicate the defendant, and that he did so only after his mother appeared, which supported a defense theory of parental influence and pressure. Counsel\u2019s failure even to attempt to speak with Crumbley was a grievous shortcoming, especially in a case that lacked any physical evidence or injury, and where credibility was the sole issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Commonwealth contends that counsel\u2019s choice not to call Crumbley was a reasonable tactical decision in that she would have testified that David ultimately did accuse the defendant. The judge discounted this argument because counsel not only never spoke with Crumbley, but failed to review her statements that had been provided to him in pretrial discovery. As a result, he was never in a decision-making position with regard to her testimony, and he could not weigh the benefits of her trial testimony against the harm it could potentially cause the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We discern no error in the judge\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Counsel conceded that \u201cif I knew that the child had made a statement to Karen Crumbley denying an incident, then I probably would have put her on the witness list. . . yes, an ordinary diligent lawyer would summons a witness with a contradictory statement. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Unfortunately, this omission fell within counsel\u2019s general strategy of \u201cpreparing\u201d for trial. He acknowledged that it was not his practice to speak to witnesses before trial, saying, \u201cI usually try to put them on cold. If I talk to them at all, it\u2019s [sic] fundamentals of testifying.\u201d Asked how he would know whom to call as a witness in the absence of any investigation on his part, he answered, \u201cI always interview my client.\u201d On its face, this view of pretrial investigation is manifestly unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>and, in this case, resulted in the \u201cforfeiture of a substantial defense.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Lastly, the Commonwealth asserts that the bulk of the judge\u2019s disapproval of counsel\u2019s performance centered around David; as such, even if it were permissible to allow the motion for a new trial as to the count concerning that child, it should not affect the convictions concerning the other two children. The judge disagreed, reasoning that \u201c[i]f a reasonable doubt had been successfully raised regarding one of the children, this could have affected the jury\u2019s perspective on the testimony of the two other child witnesses.\u201d Given the flaws and defenses in those cases, e.g., Larry\u2019s failure of identification and his tendency to lick others, and the plausible explanation (diarrhea) for touching Victor, not to mention the contradictory statements of the two young witnesses, we cannot say that the judge abused his discretion by ordering a new trial on all three complaints.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-14\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) (to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention . . . fall[s] measurably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d resulting in a likely deprivation to \u201cthe defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\">At trial, which took place about fourteen months after the alleged incidents, the young witness was unable to identify the defendant. He testified about incidents involving \u201cFrank,\u201d a \u201cgrown up\u201d at his school. The second complainant, David, who was also unable to identify the defendant in court, also testified about events involving \u201cFrank,\u201d an \u201cafter school teacher.\u201d David testified he saw Frank earlier in the courthouse, but when asked if he saw him in the courtroom, he indicated he did not. The third complainant, Victor, identified the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Evidence was introduced concerning Larry\u2019s habit of trying to lick others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">As per a bill of particulars, a June 25, 2002, Department of Social Services (DSS) investigative report, and his sexual abuse intervention network (SAIN) interview, these were David\u2019s sole allegations against the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">A doctor\u2019s report, written after a medical examination on June 17, 2002, mentioned that the mother called the doctor after the examination and told her about David\u2019s additional disclosure. A police report, which was made available to counsel, made no mention of this disclosure. The police report indicated, however, that on September 4, 2002, the mother called Detective Aubuchon and informed him that (1) her son had recently disclosed that one day at school Garcia asked him to see his private area, to which David responded \u201cno\u201d; and (2) David further told her that he informed Karen Crumbley, his babysitter and a teacher at the school, about this alleged incident. Crumbley, however, in an investigative DSS interview pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, denied that David ever told her of this incident. Counsel did not exploit these inconsistencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\">As with David\u2019s and Larry\u2019s SAIN interviews, Victor\u2019s also contained inconsistencies which counsel, as before, did not exploit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Appellate counsel retained the services of an expert who opined that the case was characterized by biased investigation and suggestive questioning, and that the parents\u2019 reports were unreliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">With his 2004 motion for a new trial, the defendant filed an affidavit by Karen Crumbley, in which she stated that she has known David as a preschool teacher and babysitter since 1998; she babysat him on June 4, 2002, the day his mother informed the school about the allegations David had made against the defendant several days before on May 30, 2002; on June 4, she took a long walk with David and the family dog and \u201casked every way I could think of about the allegation without using leading questions. David stated over and over again that nothing had happened\u201d; that after David\u2019s mother came home, David disclosed to them both that last Thursday \u201c[he had] kicked a classmate in the privates while [they] were playing\u201d; that, with his mother present, and further questioning as to whether anything else had occurred on Thursday regarding David\u2019s head, face, and mouth, he responded that \u201cFrank put his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tongue on my tongue\u201d; and that \u201c[a]t this point, [the mother] was right in front of David\u2019s face nodding her head up and down, encouraging him to talk.\u201d She lastly averred that David told her that \u201cprobably two of his friends\u201d were present at the time. The next day, Karen Crumbley said she related the entire story to a Leominster police detective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The law concerning ineffective assistance of counsel is well known.
