She did so solely because of the conflict between her work hours and her child care responsibilities. Her application for unemployment benefits was initially denied by the Division of Employment and Training (division) because the division viewed her departure as voluntary and without good cause attributable to her employer. She appealed, and after an evidentiary hearing at which the claimant and her supervisor testified to essentially undisputed facts, the review examiner determined that the claimant was entitled to benefits because her departure from work was rendered involuntary by \u201curgent, compelling and necessitous reasons within the meaning of [G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7] 25(e)(1).\u201d The division\u2019s board of review denied the employer\u2019s application for review, thus adopting the review examiner\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 41(c). The employer\u2019s appeal to the District Court met with more success, with the judge setting aside the board of review\u2019s decision as unsupported by substantial evidence. The claimant now appeals from the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The uncontroverted facts are these. The claimant worked as a full-time employee of the county for sixteen years, the last four as a bookkeeper for the defendant employer. She was valued as an employee who did \u201cgood work.\u201d While employed by the county, the claimant also worked nights for more than ten years waitressing at different restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In connection with the birth of her first child, the claimant requested and was granted a paid six-month maternity leave, which began November 18, 2001. She returned to her job part-time in April, 2002, six weeks earlier than required, in order to accommodate her employer\u2019s needs; she worked two days per week until mid-May, when her maternity leave was exhausted. For a brief time after that, she resumed her former full-time schedule (forty hours per week, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) but could not sustain it. Because of child care responsibilities for her six month old daughter, she asked for a three day per week schedule. The employer reluctantly acquiesced on a temporary basis, choosing to pay the claimant as a full-time employee while deducting two days a week from her accrued vacation time. In the fall, when the claimant\u2019s accrued vacation time was nearly used up, the employer advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>her that she would soon be required to return to a full-time schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The claimant told her employer that she could not work her former full-time schedule because she was unable to find suitable day care for her baby for more than three days a week. Her husband was a self-employed electrician working days who was unavailable until late in the afternoons to care for their child. Her mother and mother-in-law also worked, as did close friends, and all were unavailable. The claimant\u2019s sister was willing to watch the baby but, because of her own child care obligations and pregnancy, could not do so more than three days a week. The claimant also looked into commercial day care,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but in addition to being unable to find affordable care, she did not want to put her then ten month old child in care of that type: \u201cShe was too little.\u201d In addition, the claimant had a one-hour commute each way between her home in Mention and her job in Canton.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The claimant offered to work three days a week at her employer\u2019s office and two other days from home, or in the evenings, or on weekends. The employer declined. Feeling that she \u201chad to leave\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t want to leave\u201d her job so that she could take care of her child, the claimant gave her employer six weeks\u2019 notice and left on November 29, 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In concluding that the claimant was entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), the review examiner reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">\u201cThe claimant was not discharged. She initiated this separation. Whether she is entitled to benefits will therefore be determined in accord with the provisions of \u00a7 25(e)(1). Section 25(e)(2) is not applicable in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 25(e)(1), the claimant has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>proof. She must show by substantial and credible evidence either that her voluntary leaving was for good cause attributable to the employer or that her leaving was rendered involuntary due to urgent, compelling and necessitous reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201cIt is clear that the employer acted reasonably in this case. The employer has the right to operate its business as it sees fit. It hired the claimant to fill a full time position. It was under no obligation to modify the hours of that position to accommodate the claimant\u2019s changed circumstances. Although the employer chose to modify her hours for a period of time, it was not required to continue to do so. The parties agreed that no new contract of hire was negotiated when the claimant\u2019s hours were temporarily changed; no new promises were made. The claimant\u2019s leaving was not for good cause attributable to the employer within the meaning of \u00a7 25(e)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">\u201cThe claimant did meet her burden of proof in showing that her leaving was rendered involuntary due to urgent, compelling and necessitous reasons. The claimant was unable to locate any daycare that was satisfactory within her personal standards that would have permitted her to work the full time hours the employer demanded that she work. There were no alternative shifts or flex hours within the employer\u2019s organization that would have permitted her to put in a full time workweek. Her leaving work was therefore rendered involuntary due to urgent, compelling and necessitous reasons within the meaning of \u00a7 25(e)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">\u201cThis review examiner did not feel it was necessary to address the issue of whether the claimant had a right to make the choices that she made. Whether the claimant has the right to restrict the hours when she makes herself available to work is an independent and separate issue from the one posed by the determination at hand. See the second \u2018Note to Local Office\u2019 below.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\u201cThe claimant is therefore not subject to disqualification and she is entitled to benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">On appeal, the claimant maintains that the District Court judge erred in concluding that the board of review\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. She contends that the review examiner had before him uncontroverted evidence that she left her job for compelling personal reasons \u2014 to fulfil child care responsibilities \u2014 after having first taken reasonable steps to preserve her employment, which the review examiner was entitled to accept as such. This met her burden of proving that her work separation was involuntary and that she was entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The employer takes the opposite view, maintaining that the claimant had not shown her work separation to be anything but a purely voluntary choice on her part, a product of her subjective belief that commercial day care was not suitable in the circumstances and a mere personal preference that her baby be cared for by family members or close friends. The employer contends that the claimant failed to show that she \u201chad no choice but to leave work\u201d and did not offer \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d reasons of an urgent, compelling or necessitous nature for leaving her job. In view of this, as well as the review examiner\u2019s failure to make findings as to the \u201cobjective reasonability\u201d of the claimant\u2019s conduct, the employer argues that the judge was correct to set aside the review examiner\u2019s decision as being unsupported by substantial evidence. The employer also contends that, even if we conclude that the review examiner\u2019s decision as to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), was supported by substantial evidence, it nonetheless cannot stand because the review examiner failed to address the question of the claimant\u2019s availability for work under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 24(h), given the restrictions she has placed on her work hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Our review of the board\u2019s decision must \u201cgive due weight to the [agency\u2019s] experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge^] ... as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. 482, 486 (1984), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). We do not act as a fact finder in employment security cases, because it remains \u201cthe agency\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence, find the facts, and decide the issues.\u201d <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>388 Mass. 201, 205 (1983). See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). Our limited function is to determine whether the board of review applied correct legal principles in reaching its decision, whether the decision contains sufficient findings to demonstrate that the correct legal principles were applied, and whether those findings were supported by substantial evidence within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e). See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 92-93; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We begin by reviewing the fundamental legal principles the board of review must apply. The unemployment compensation statute in general, and the element of voluntariness included in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), in particular, serve the purpose of \u201cavoiding temporary disqualification for persons who for compelling personal reasons are forced to give up an otherwise available position. . . . The grant of benefits to unemployed persons is not premised on the concept of employer fault.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>364 Mass. 593, 596 (1974). \u201cThe broader purpose of the law is to provide temporary relief for those who are realistically compelled to leave work through no \u2018fault\u2019 of their own, whatever the source of the compulsion, personal or employer-initiated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The \u201cdominant policy of the statute ... is simply to allow benefits to an employee who is unwillingly out of work and without current earnings and unable to find work appropriate to his employment capacity.\u201d <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>382 Mass. 159, 164 (1980). The statute itself provides that it is to \u201cbe construed liberally in aid of its purpose, which purpose is to lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his family.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74, inserted by St. 1949, c. 290. <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>412 Mass. 845, 847 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Accordingly, a \u201cwide variety of personal circumstances,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>have been recognized as constituting \u201curgent, compelling and necessitous\u201d reasons under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), which may render involuntary a claimant\u2019s departure from work. These include family ties that cause a married spouse or nonmarital partner to leave her employment in order to relocate with her spouse or partner, see, e.g., <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fingerman, </em>378 Mass. 461, 464 (1979); <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 849-852; pregnancy or pregnancy-related disability, see, e.g., <em>Dohoney </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. 333, 335-336 (1979); <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 161 &amp; n.6; and domestic responsibilities including child care, see, e.g., <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>388 Mass. at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In determining, pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e), whether a claimant\u2019s personal reasons for leaving a job are so compelling as to make the departure involuntary, the inquiry proceeds on a case-by-case basis. \u201cThe nature of the circumstances in each individual case, the strength and the effect of the compulsive pressure of external and objective forces must be evaluated, and if they are sufficiently potent, they become relevant and controlling factors.\u201d <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 848, quoting from <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>344 Mass. 369, 373-374 (1962), quoting from <em>Sturdevant Unemployment Compensation Case, </em>158 Pa. Super. 548, 557-558 (1946). There should not be \u201ctoo narrow a view [taken] of the factors entering into the determination whether reasons are \u2018urgent, compelling and necessitous\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fingerman, </em>378 Mass. at 464. Benefits are not to be denied to those \u201cwho can prove they acted reasonably, based on pressing circumstances, in leaving employment.\u201d <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Because G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e), third par., as amended through St. 1990, c. 177, \u00a7 280, provides that a claimant is not to be disqualified from receiving benefits pursuant to \u00a7 25(e)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>if she \u201cestablishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that [her] reasons for leaving were for such an urgent, compelling and necessitous nature as to make [her] separation involuntary,\u201d considerable deference is accorded the agency\u2019s determination in this regard. \u201cThe statutory exception to disqualification sets a standard calling for an exercise of judgment which is not purely factual. Such a determination, involving the application of the standard to the facts found, brings into play the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency.\u201d <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fingerman, supra </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Prominent among the factors that will often figure in the mix when the agency determines whether a claimant\u2019s personal reasons for leaving a job are so compelling as to make the departure involuntary is whether the claimant had taken such \u201creasonable means to preserve her employment\u201d as would indicate the claimant\u2019s \u201cdesire and willingness to continue her employment.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>364 Mass. at 597-598. See <em>Dohoney </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 336. Contrary to the employer\u2019s suggestion, it is not necessary that a claimant seeking to prove that she left her job involuntarily establish that she had \u201cno choice to do otherwise.\u201d \u201cThis statement disregards our cases which recognize that unemployment compensation benefits should not be denied to one who leaves her employment for what she reasonably believes are compelling reasons . . . .\u201d <em>Fergione </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>396 Mass. 281, 284 (1985). The relevant standard is the claimant\u2019s \u201creasonable belief,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and \u201cordinarily the agency must make findings as to the reasonableness of a claimant\u2019s belief that she left her employment for a compelling reason.\u201d <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>397 Mass. 728, 732 n.4 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Turning to the matter at hand, the District Court judge concluded, without explanation, that the board of review\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. The employer echoes this view, suggesting that the claimant failed to meet her purported burden of establishing that, before leaving her job, she had sufficiently explored commercial day care options. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>employer dwells on the claimant\u2019s testimony that she preferred to have her baby cared for by family and friends because she thought the child \u201ctoo little\u201d for commercial day care. Downplaying the claimant\u2019s testimony, albeit of a general nature, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>that she had looked into commercial day care and found it very expensive, the employer instead maintains that the claimant \u201ccategorically refused to consider commercial day care for her child . . . and insisted on remaining home with the child at all times when family members were unavailable\u201d and, further, that her \u201cself imposed refusal to consider commercial day care\u201d before leaving her job was a decision based on \u201cpreference, not economic necessity.\u201d Characterizing this variously as a \u201csubjective\u201d decision based on the claimant\u2019s \u201cchild rearing preferences, not economics,\u201d the employer urges that her conduct cannot be thought \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d because, by not pursuing \u2014 and, if available, securing \u2014 a commercial day care alternative, the claimant has simply not shown that she was \u201ccompelled\u201d to stay home with her child and that she had \u201cno choice but to leave work.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">There is a sense in which many of the \u201cpersonal circumstances\u201d recognized as constituting \u201curgent, compelling and necessitous\u201d reasons under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e), have subjective aspects and implicate personal preferences that may trump purely economic considerations. When, for example, a married spouse or nonmarital partner leaves his or her job to relocate in order to remain with the spouse or partner who has moved, the choice is a personal one, subjectively valuing the relationship over the employment situation, even if a lucrative one. When the work one does is perceived as endangering one\u2019s unborn child, the mother\u2019s decision to leave her job elevates the well-being of the fetus over the paycheck. How, responsibly, to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the important obligation of caring for one\u2019s child is no different in implicating personal reasons and personal choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The key, for benefit eligibility, lies not in characterizing the decision as personal or subjective rather than as economic or objective, but in ascertaining whether the claimant \u201cacted reasonably, based on pressing circumstances, in leaving employment.\u201d <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 851. Not all personal reasons involving perceived family responsibilities will be seen as creating \u201csufficiently compelling circumstance[s] to render . . . unemployment involuntary.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Uvello </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>396 Mass. 812, 815 (1986) (\u201c[a] reasonable person could conclude . . . that [the claimant\u2019s] responsibility for preparing dinner for her husband, forty-three year old daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter was not an obligation compelling [the claimant] to reject a shift ending at 6 p.m.\u201d). \u201cThe nature of the circumstances of each individual case, and the degree of compulsion that such circumstances exert on a claimant, must be objectively evaluated\u201d on a case-by-case basis. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>414 Mass. 658, 661 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We agree with the employer, however, that the board of review\u2019s decision is deficient. Nevertheless, we disagree that the problem has to do with a lack of substantial evidence. The deficiency lies instead in the review examiner\u2019s findings and rationale. The review examiner found that, given the claimant\u2019s inability to locate day care \u201csatisfactory within her personal standards,\u201d the claimant left her job due to the conflict between work hours and child care responsibilities. The review examiner concluded that this constituted an urgent, compelling and necessitous reason for her having done so. The review examiner also stated, however, that he \u201cdid not feel it was necessary to address the issue of whether the claimant had a right to make the choices that she made.\u201d The result is a decision that fails to address certain core matters that are committed to the agency\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment.\u201d <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fingerman, supra </em>at 464. For example, did the claimant prove that she \u201cacted reasonably, based on pressing circumstances\u201d in leaving her job? <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number><em>Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 851. See <em>Fergione </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 284; <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 732 n.4. It is the agency\u2019s responsibility expressly to decide this, not ours. <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">While the evidence at the hearing before him was undisputed, the review examiner nonetheless had the benefit of observing the claimant as she gave testimony. Her demeanor may of course factor into the \u201cexercise of judgment which is not purely factual\u201d that the review examiner is called upon to make, set as it is against the backdrop of \u201cthe experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency.\u201d <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security </em>v. <em>Fingerman, supra </em>at 463. Although it is not made clear in the decision, it may be that the review examiner took into account when reaching his decision the claimant\u2019s longstanding employment history as a valued employee, her accommodation of the employer by returning early from her maternity leave, and her willingness to exhaust accrued vacation time to juggle work and child care responsibilities. The reasonableness of the claimant\u2019s efforts should be evaluated in light of the relevant circumstances, and the foregoing could well be relevant considerations in determining whether the claimant had taken reasonable steps to preserve her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">It may also be, though not so stated in the decision, that the review examiner took into account the age of the child in evaluating the reasonableness of this claimant\u2019s efforts to locate suitable child care. The circumstances of each case must be individually assessed; the needs and demands of children and the employment circumstances of their parents vary so greatly that universally applicable rules defy easy formulation. In any event, the extent to which the mother of a baby must, in order to preserve her job, investigate and accept commercial day care in addition to ascertaining the availability of family and friends is a question the board of review, not the court, should determine in the first instance. The distance between home and work and the affordability of available commercial day care could also be factored into the requisite assessment whether the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>reasonably believed that she left her job for compelling reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The review examiner did not make all requisite findings and did not sufficiently explain his reasons or the evidence underlying his decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWithout findings on all material issues, this court cannot exercise its appellate function.\u201d <em>Uvello </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 816. In the absence of \u201csufficient subsidiary findings to demonstrate that correct legal principles were applied,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>391 Mass. 623, 626-627 (1984), the decision cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In view of this, we think the proper course is to remand the matter to the board of review for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42. See <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>382 Mass. 19, 24-25 (1980); <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 205-206. The board of review may rest on the record in considering both the reasonableness of the claimant\u2019s conduct for purposes of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), and her availability for work under \u00a7 <em>24(b), </em>and in articulating what it concludes as to both and why. \u201cAlternatively, the board of review may [take additional evidence or] send this matter back to the review examiner for findings and a determination on the evidence in the record or for an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We therefore reverse the order of the District Court. A new order shall enter remanding this matter to the board of review for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The claimant provided no details as to what commercial day care alternatives she had explored or as to the quality, availability, and cost of local day care for infants. The employer, however, did not cross-examine the claimant as to such matters and did not argue the point to the review examiner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Thereafter the claimant sought full-time work as a waitress or as a clerical person with a flexible schedule that would not require her to work daytime hours more than three weekdays per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">In the \u201cNote to Local Office,\u201d the review examiner indicated that the claimant had testified to self-imposed limits on availability that prevented her from accepting employment requiring her to work a daytime shift more than three weekdays per week. The review examiner referred to the local office for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>investigation and determination the matter of the claimant\u2019s eligibility under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 <em>24(b).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The employer calls our attention in this regard to decisions in certain other jurisdictions that have held claimants ineligible for benefits who failed to seek and, if available, secure commercial child care before resigning their jobs. We observe that State statutes and decisional law differ considerably as to the extent to which family responsibilities are recognized as relevant factors in ascertaining eligibility for unemployment benefits. This being said, the decisions cited \u201care distinguishable and of no assistance in resolving the issue. We shall not belabor this opinion by discussing the decisions.\u201d <em>McElderry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>431 Mass. 722, 725 n.6 (2000). Neither our statute nor our case law have conditioned eligibility in this fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\">This is true as to the determination of both the involuntariness of the claimant\u2019s separation from employment pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), and the claimant\u2019s availability for work pursuant to \u00a7 24(6). In order to obtain unemployment compensation, the claimant must satisfy both requirements. The review examiner was seemingly reluctant to receive evidence on the latter issue at the hearing for reasons that are not clear to us, though some evidence was nonetheless taken. He thereafter declined to make a determination on the matter, referring it to a \u201clocal office.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
