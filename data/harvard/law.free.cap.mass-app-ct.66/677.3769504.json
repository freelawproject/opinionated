L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A), and one count of unlawful possession of ammunition without an FID card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A). During the investigation of a shooting incident in which the victim identified the defendant as the shooter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the police discovered two firearms and some ammunition in two closets in an apartment occasionally occupied by the defendant. There was no claim that these items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>had any connection to the shooting incident. The appeals of the convictions on those other indictments relating to the shooting do not present any remarkable appellate issues and are disposed of in a memorandum and order pursuant to rule 1:28 also issued this day. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frongillo (No. 2), post </em>1115 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge denied motions for a required finding of not guilty on the three indictments charging violations of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 <em>10(h). </em>The issue we review in this opinion is whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to permit any rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had constructive possession of the firearms and ammunition discovered by the police inside two closets. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sespedes, </em>442 Mass. 95, 96 (2004). We conclude that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a finding of constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The evidence relating to constructive possession was as follows. The police, who were looking for the defendant and for evidence relating to a shooting, went to an apartment located at 428 Revere Street in Winthrop.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lisa Carrozza, the woman who was renting the Winthrop apartment, answered the door, allowed the police to enter, and consented to a search. Carrozza was the defendant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e at that time. The defendant was not present in the apartment. In response to questions from the police, Carrozza led them to two closets. In a bedroom closet, the police found a .22 caliber revolver, which was not stored in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>a case, and a locked gun case that was later found to contain ammunition, but no firearm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were not found on the revolver. The closet, which had a door but no locks, contained both men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, as well as towels and videotapes. There was no evidence as to the size or other identifying information of the men\u2019s clothing relative to either the defendant or Carrozza\u2019s husband, who had been living in the apartment before he moved out several months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In a second closet located in a common area near the living room, the police recovered another firearm case containing a shotgun and shotgun ammunition. The shotgun case was \u201cbeing blocked by something,\u201d apparently a plastic bag that, upon removal, revealed the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This closet also contained unidentified men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as a mop and other household items. Neither the defendant nor Carrozza had a license to carry a firearm or an FID card.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The apartment is located on the first floor of a two-family house and includes a finished basement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The landlord, who occupied the upstairs unit, testified that he frequently saw the defendant at the apartment after Carrozza\u2019s husband left. The landlord had not seen the estranged husband in more than three months prior to the night of the shooting. Two to four weeks after the husband moved out, the landlord observed the defendant at the apartment at all hours of the day, even when Carrozza was not there. The landlord often saw a car driven by the defendant parked in the driveway in the daytime and overnight. He saw the defendant daily at the apartment after the shooting incident and observed him moving things out on the last day he was seen there. After her husband moved out, Carrozza paid the rent in cash or, occasionally, by check. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>defendant did not pay rent to the landlord and was not listed on the lease. There was no evidence that any personal belongings or other items containing the defendant\u2019s name, such as bills, letters, or identification, were found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>To permit a finding of constructive possession there must be evidence sufficient to infer<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the defendant not only had knowledge of the items, but also had the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over them. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sann Than, </em>442 Mass. 748, 751 (2004). Our review of the evidence persuades us that, although the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that the defendant had knowledge of the items and an ability to control them, there was insufficient evidence on the element of his intent to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The jury could reasonably infer that the defendant resided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the apartment or at least spent a great deal of time there. He and his car were frequently sighted by the landlord<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; the closets contained men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing; and Carrozza\u2019s husband had moved out, permitting a reasonable inference that the clothes did not belong to him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although not overwhelming, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, this evidence provided a sufficient basis for a juror to infer that the defendant knew about and had the ability to exercise dominion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>and control over the guns and ammunition discovered in the bedroom and common area closets. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 613 (1976) (heroin, found in various generally inaccessible locations in the defendant\u2019s apartment, warranted an inference that the defendant had placed it there or had at least known of its existence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 237 (1997) (ability to exercise control is apparent from the defendant\u2019s right of access).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">However, proof of the defendant\u2019s intent to exercise dominion and control is substantially weaker. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 628 (2000). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Navarro, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 161, 168 (1995) (reasonable inference that the defendant was aware of the presence of drugs discovered in the apartment, but insufficient to show that the defendant had the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over the drugs). In general, intent to exercise control \u201cis not easily susceptible of proof and is a close question.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sadberry, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 936 (1998). In <em>Delarosa, </em>the court affirmed the conviction of possession of cocaine, but reversed the conviction of possession of a firearm, even though the drugs and gun were discovered in the same hidden compartment of a closet. Although \u201cnot overwhelming,\u201d the court determined there was sufficient evidence connecting the defendant to the apartment<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to infer that the defendant <em>knew </em>there was a substantial amount of high quality cocaine in the closet and that he <em>exercised </em>dominion and control over the cocaine by removing seventy grams, putting it into a McDonald\u2019s bag that he also removed from the hidden compartment, and then leaving the apartment with it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 628. The court reasoned, however, that the evidence relating to the gun found in the same closet was \u201csubstantially weaker,\u201d and although \u201cit seems likely\u201d that the defendant knew the gun was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>in the closet, the evidence was not sufficient to establish \u201cthat he intended to or did exercise dominion or control over it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court observed that the gun \u201cwas not in the Honda [which the defendant was driving when stopped by the police] or on the defendant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest. Nor was there evidence ... of a personal connection between the defendant and the room in which the stash was located.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Similar to the situation in <em>Delarosa, </em>here the guns and ammunition discovered in the Winthrop apartment were not found on the defendant\u2019s person. Indeed, the defendant was not present at (or in the vicinity of) the apartment at the time of the search.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although he had access to the closets, and thus knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the items and the ability to control them could be inferred, such evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable inference that he intended to exercise dominion and control over them. See <em>ibid. </em>Except for the unidentified men\u2019s clothing, there were no other personal effects connecting the defendant to the guns and ammunition found in the closets. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 912 (1986) (possession may be inferred \u201cfrom evidence that the contraband was found in proximity to personal effects of the defendant in areas of the dwelling, such as a bedroom or closet, to which other evidence indicates the defendant has a particular relationship\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was also no other evidence connecting the defendant to the guns and ammunition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 257 (2000) (no direct evidence of possession, \u201csuch as by observation, fingerprints, or paraffin tests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Furthermore, evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in a shooting is insufficient in this case to permit an inference that he had constructive possession of unrelated firearms and ammunition found in the apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caterino, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689 &amp; n.8 (1991) (\u201cbehavior suggesting that the defendant may have been guilty of some of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>fense [including carrying large amounts of cash, suspicious remarks to police, and possession of a single lorazepam pill] does not show that he had the ability and intent to control the drugs seized from [the] apartment\u201d; evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior drug dealing and other narcotics related activity could not be considered \u201cas evidence of his commission or propensity to commit the crime for which he [stood] charged\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blevins, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 212 (2002), in which the defendant, using a handgun, assaulted a woman and then left the scene of the assault in a car. The police stopped the car and found a gun on the floor. The court stated that \u201cevidence of the defendant\u2019s prior assault with a gun and the presence of a gun in the car was sufficient to support a reasonable inference of the defendant\u2019s intent to exercise control over the gun that was found in plain view.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Contrary to the situation in <em>Blevins, </em>in the present case, the guns found in the Winthrop apartment closets were not affiliated with the gun used in the unrelated shooting, which was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">While spending a great deal of time in the apartment may be a relevant inculpatory factor, it is not sufficient on the facts of this case, even combined with the unidentified men\u2019s clothing (and the use of a gun in an unrelated shooting), to support a finding of intent to exercise dominion and control over the contraband found in the apartment closets. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. 416, 418-419 (2003) (evidence of a connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tian to the apartment, including the defendant\u2019s statements that she lived there and discovery of her personal identification papers, did not demonstrate constructive possession of drugs where there was no evidence linking the defendant to the cocaine or other drug paraphernalia); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 622 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 437-438 (1991) (possession is not proved \u201cby sharing the premises where the narcotics were found\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 652 (1990) (ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over a large amount of drugs was shown from evidence of defendant\u2019s residency in a small one-room cottage; police also found personal papers, drug paraphernalia in plain view, and a drug transaction sheet near the telephone in close proximity to the defendant, and the defendant only began to speak as the police got closer to the shelf that contained the drugs); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fennell, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 911 (1982) (\u201cin addition to evidence indicating that the defendant was a \u2018current tenant\u2019 . . . , there was considerable additional evidence connecting the defendant with the controlled substances found in the apartment\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913 (jury could infer defendant was in possession of marijuana found in bedroom of shared dwelling where marijuana was discovered near defendant\u2019s personal belongings, including personal identification papers and a personalized roach clip); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 554, 556-557 (1991) (ample circumstantial evidence from which jury could infer constructive possession of the contraband found in the closet where the defendant, who was present during the search, lived in the apartment and had personal belongings in various locations throughout the bedroom in which the closet was located).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The judgments of conviction on the three indictments for possession of a firearm and ammunition pursuant to G.

Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s case did not deteriorate, so we need not consider the state of all the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 404 &amp; n.9 (2003).

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 618 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>410 Mass. 1005 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 240 (1997). The Commonwealth is not required to \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d since an inference \u201cneed not be necessary and inescapable,\u201d but only \u201creasonable and possible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. at 618, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989). However, \u201c[suspicion alone ... is not enough\u201d to establish the defendant\u2019s relationship to contraband. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. 416, 421 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>30 Mass.

App. Ct. 253, 258 (2000). \u201cWhen the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caraballo, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 616, 619 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eramo, </em>377 Mass. 912, 913 (1979). Furthermore, \u201cit is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense. . . . Nor may a conviction rest upon the piling of inference upon inference or conjecture and speculation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caterino, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689-690 (1991), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, </em>411 Mass. 167, 170 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Because possession cases carry an element of intent and thus are heavily dependent upon the specific facts of the case, \u201cprecedent [is] a somewhat imperfect guide.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caraballo, </em>33 Mass.

However, certain general principles have emerged. Residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>status is a \u201crelevant inculpatory factor\u201d to be considered, since it indicates more than mere presence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 781 n.5. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 505 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, </em>29 Mass.
