(Cadwell), to the roads of the Falcon Heights subdivision, they brought this action in the Land Court. A sketch showing a portion of the plan of the Falcon Heights subdivision and a portion of the Cadwell land is attached hereto as an appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The sole issue before us is whether the plaintiffs or Cadwell owns lot A. The plaintiffs claim that lot A was a contemplated way at the time they purchased their lots and that they now own the fee as abutters pursuant to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58, the derelict fee statute. A judge of the Land Court disagreed and granted Cadwell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that there was no ambiguity in the relevant documents, that none of the recorded documents made any reference to lot A as a proposed way and, as a consequence, the plaintiffs did not own lot A. He refused to allow the plaintiffs to introduce extrinsic evidence to support their claim that lot A was intended as a future way. A judgment entered declaring that G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58, does not apply to lot A and that Cadwell is its owner. This appeal by the plaintiffs followed. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">1. <em>Deeds and plans for Falcon Heights and Cadwell Crossing subdivisions. </em>The deed to the Hansons, dated December 28, 1999 from Gregory A. Coons and Amy B. Coons, describes their lot as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cthe land situated in Wilbraham, Hampden County, Massachusetts, described as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u201cBeing Lot No. 4 on a plan of land entitled \u2018Falcon Heights\u2019 Definitive Subdivision of Land in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, Hampden County, prepared for Gregory A. Coons &amp; Amy B. Coons dated February 18, 1998, and prepared by Aimer Huntly, Jr. &amp; Associates, Inc., recorded with the Hampden County Registry of Deeds in Plan Book 309, Page 41.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u201cThe Grantors herein reserve the fee interest in the roadways known as Autumn Road and Falcon Heights Road, both as shown on the aforementioned subdivision plan recorded in said Registry of Deeds in Plan Book 309, Page 41, and grant to the grantees herein their heirs, sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>cessors and/or assigns, rights of ingress and egress over said roadways for all purposes for which a roadway is traditionally used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The deed to the other plaintiff-abutter of lot A, Joseph Gormley, is dated December 17, 2003<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and is virtually identical to the Hanson deed except that the land conveyed is described as lot 3 on the same plan. The deeds make no mention of lot A. The plan referred to in the deeds describes lot A as fifty feet wide and containing approximately 5,202 square feet, and labeled \u201cNot a Building Lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On January 8, 2004, Cadwell purchased lot A, and on January 9, 2004, Cadwell purchased several parcels north of the Falcon Heights subdivision. It sought approval for a subdivision of its own, and on August 26, 2004, the planning board filed its approval of Cadwell\u2019s definitive subdivision plan. The approved plan shows that Cadwell\u2019s subdivision is located on approximately 50.6 acres of land and that lot A will become an extension of Falcon Heights Road into Cadwell\u2019s subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Four days after the planning board filed its approval, the plaintiffs filed this action claiming, as previously indicated, that they own lot A by the application of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58. That statute is set out in full in the margin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and its effect is to strengthen \u201cthe common law . . . presumption that \u2018a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>deed bounding on a way conveys the title to the centre of the way if the grantor owns so far.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>438 Mass. 798, 803 (2003) <em>(Rowley), </em>quoting from <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>196 Mass. 270, 275 (1907).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Relying on <em>Rowley, supra </em>at 805, the plaintiffs claim that G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58, applies to every deed conveying property which in fact is bounded by a way, \u201cregardless of how it is described in the instrument of its conveyance.\u201d They claim, therefore, that the judge erroneously restricted the inquiry to the conveyancing instruments and did not allow them to introduce evidence that lot A was a contemplated way.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Rowley, </em>however, as the motion judge ruled, is not apposite. In that case, the defendant, Massachusetts Electric Company, had acquired the interests of a former railroad and proposed building a bicycle path on the railroad bed. The plaintiffs, whose land abutted on the railway, objected and claimed title within it pursuant to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58. In upholding the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the court rejected the necessity of using prescribed words for the statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>application. The defendant, apparently relying on language in <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>371 Mass 489, 493-495 (1976) (see <em>Rowley, supra </em>at 805 n. 11), had argued that because the language of the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds described their properties either as \u201cbounded by land of the [railroad]\u2019 or as land now or formerly of said [railroad],\u2019 and not as bounded by the \u2018railway,\u2019 \u00a7 58 simply [did] not apply.\u201d <em>Rowley, supra </em>at 801. In response to this argument, the <em>Rowley </em>court noted that if \u00a7 58 were construed as only applying to instruments specifically describing parcels as abutting ways, such construction would defeat the object of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 804. It was for this reason that the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201ca plain reading of the statute is that it applies to instruments that convey real estate that in fact has frontage along the length of a way or other similar linear monument. There is nothing in the statutory language itself that suggests that its effect is limited only to instruments that describe the real estate conveyed as bounded by a \u2018way\u2019 or other similar linear monument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 802. That the court was directing its attention to the form of words used is apparent from its subsequent statements indicating that if the legislative intent had been to limit the statute\u2019s effect, that purpose could have been easily accomplished by providing that \u201c[e]very instrument passing title to real estate <em>described in such instrument as </em>abutting a way\u201d instead of the language as enacted. <em>Id. </em>at 802 &amp; n.9.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Moreover, the facts of <em>Rowley </em>were far different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>present case. The former railroad had, by filing its location plan, effected \u201cwritten, permanent record evidence\u201d of the easement acquired. <em>Id. </em>at 799, quoting from <em>Hazen </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>2 Gray 574, 580 (1854). Moreover, the railroad\u2019s former route was visible on the ground. The \u201cway\u201d (or \u201cother similar monument\u201d) was clearly defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">For G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58, to apply, the way need not be in existence on the ground, as long as it is contemplated and sufficiently designated. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, it is not enough that the metes and bounds of a strip are described; \u201cthe strip has [to be] sufficiently defined as a proposed street.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Mart Realty of Brockton, Inc., </em>348 Mass. 675, 678 (1965). In mating that determination, reference may be made to the plan.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In contrast to the record evidence in <em>Rowley, </em>the documents of record here (deeds and plan) designate no proposed way. They do not indicate that lot A was intended as anything other than a small lot retained by the developer for any number of possible purposes such as open land, additional parting, a road, or other permissible use.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Thus, at the time of the deeds to the plaintiffs, there was neither any suggestion of record nor any indication on the ground to support the claim that lot A was intended as a street or that the plaintiffs had \u201cany interest in [lot A].\u201d See <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>371 Mass. at 493. There was no ambiguity in the documents and we see nothing in <em>Rowley, supra, </em>that supports the need for paroi evidence. Accordingly we follow \u201c[t]he basic principle governing the interpretation of deeds [namely] that their meaning, derived from the presumed intent of the grantor, is to be ascertained from the words used in the written instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ment[s], construed when necessary in the light of the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Sheftel </em>v. <em>Lebel, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 179 (1998). Here there is no such necessity. \u201cWe are able to begin and end our inquiry here by reference to the . . . language . . . as set forth in all the relevant deeds\u201d and plan. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Gormley acquired his interest from Todd and Renee Lisowski, who in turn, had acquired the property by deed dated September 20, 2002 from the Coonses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">General Laws c. 183, \u00a7 58, as amended through St. 1990, c. 378, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">\u201cEvery instrument passing title to real estate abutting a way, whether public or private, watercourse, wall, fence or other similar linear monument, shall be construed to include any fee interest of the grantor in such way, watercourse or monument, unless (a) the grantor retains other real estate abutting such way, watercourse or monument, in which case, (i) if the retained real estate is on the same side, the division line between the land granted and the land retained shah be continued into such way, watercourse or monument as far as the grantor owns, or (ii) if the retained real estate is on the other side of such way, watercourse or monument between the division hnes extended, the title conveyed shah be to the center hne of such way, watercourse or monument as far as the grantor owns, or (b) the instrument evidences a different intent by an express exception or reservation and not alone by bounding by a side hne.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> \u201cIn contrast to the common law, the presumption applies unless the instrument . . . \u2018evidences a different intent [of the grantor] by an express [exception or] reservation\u2019 and extrinsic evidence may not be used\u201d to counter the presumption. Rowley, 438 Mass. at 804, quoting from <em>Tattan </em>v. <em>Kurlan, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 243-244 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The plaintiffs wanted to introduce the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">1. An affidavit of Paul R. Lussier, a surveyor who participated in the Falcon Heights project, stating that his employer had prepared work plans showing lot A as a future connection from the northerly terminus of Falcon Heights Road to land abutting the subdivision to the north.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">2. An affidavit of Robert E. Long, an attendee at the July 21, 2004 public meeting of the planning board (stating that his recollection was refreshed by a transcript of that meeting) who reported that the chairman of the planning board said that lot A \u201cwas put there with the potential of becoming a road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">3. A letter dated April 9, 2004 from Cadwell\u2019s counsel to Cadwell containing an opinion concerning a waiver of a by-law requirement limiting the lengths of dead-end streets. Counsel wrote: \u201cIn apparent anticipation of the necessity for future access to Cadwell, the Wilbraham Planning Board approved the Falcon Heights plan with a fifty (50\u2019) foot right of way leading to Cadwell from the road also known as \u2018Falcon Heights.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Cadwell argues that the material the plaintiffs seek to introduce is, for various reasons, not admissible and, in any event, is so tenuous that there is no genuine issue of material fact. We need not reach these questions in view of our decision that extrinsic evidence is not called for in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The court quoted a letter from Governor Sargent to the Legislature at the time of passage of the statute indicating that the object of the statute was \u201cto meet a situation where a grantor has conveyed away all of his land abutting a way or stream, but has unknowingly failed to convey any interest he may have in land under the way or stream, thus apparently retaining his ownership of a strip of the way or stream.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>438 Mass. at 803, quoting from 1971 House Doc. No. 5307. The effect of the statute was to quiet the title to such strips. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Similarly, the following conclusion of the court in <em>Rowley </em>must be interpreted in light of the issue before the court and in the context of the facts of the case: \u201cWe conclude that the plain meaning of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58, consistent with the words used, and considered in connection with the imperfection to be remedied, applies to real estate, such as the plaintiffs\u2019, that in fact abuts a \u2018public or private [way] ... or other similar linear monu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ment,\u2019 regardless of how it is described in the instrument of its conveyance.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>438 Mass. at 805.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the position of lot A on the plan, considered in light of regulation \u00a7 5.1.1.3 of Wilbraham subdivision regulations, creates an inference that lot A is to be a street. That section states: \u201cProvision satisfactory to the Planning Board shall be made for . . . access to property which is not yet subdivided.\u201d Nothing in the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds or the plan, however, suggests that the property which Cadwell later bought did not have access to a public way. In any event, it was for the planning board to determine whether such access was necessary prior to approving the Falcon Heights subdivision. Even if an error would be relevant, there is no showing in the record that the planning board erred in its determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
