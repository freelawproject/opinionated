Carter held a section 8 voucher administered by the LHA, and the remainder of her rent was paid pursuant to a contract between Ryan and the LHA. Prior to Carter\u2019s occupancy of the apartment, and again on or about April 1, 2001, and February 26, 2002, the apartment was inspected by an LHA inspector, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(8)(C). It was found to be free from violations of the housing quality standards (HQS), as established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(8)(B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 982.401.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The record is unclear as to why, in early 2002, Ryan brought a summary process action against Carter in the Housing Court. What is known is that on June 26, 2002, the parties entered into an agreement for judgment signed by Carter, Ryan, and the court\u2019s housing specialist. The parties mutually agreed to terminate the existing lease, and Ryan agreed to return Carter\u2019s security deposit by July 5, 2002, and to return to her $1,005 in rent overcharge payments; Carter, in turn, agreed to vacate the apartment on or before September 2, 2002. In addition, each party waived all then-existing claims against the other with prejudice. On or about September 2, 2002, Carter and one of her children, then age seventeen, moved to a new apartment in Lynn.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On or about November 26, 2002, Ryan filed suit against Carter, claiming that Carter had caused substantial damage to the apartment, and seeking $2,000. On February 12, 2003, after conducting a hearing in which she viewed a video of the apartment provided by Ryan, the Housing Court clerk-magistrate found for Ryan and granted him $1,440 in damages for waste exceeding normal wear and tear. Judgment entered on February 13, 2003. This decision apparently was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">On April 11, 2003, the LHA formally notified Carter of its decision to terminate her section 8 subsidy, effective May 31, 2003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Carter then sought review of the LHA\u2019s decision. After a hearing on May 8, 2003, during which Carter presented wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>nesses and evidence on her behalf, the hearing officer affirmed the LHA\u2019s decision to terminate Carter\u2019s section 8 assistance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In conjunction with cross motions for summary judgment, the LHA provided the affidavit of David Moore, the LHA\u2019s rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>assistance program manager who terminated Carter\u2019s section 8 eligibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his affidavit Moore averred that he had determined that Carter and/or her family had \u201cbreached their obligations under the rent subsidy program and that the appropriate remedy was to terminate assistance to the family.\u201d He further stated that he had \u201creviewed the facts, and considered the factors set forth in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ava\">The motion judge, on summary judgment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concluded that the termination of assistance was not in accordance with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552, because the LHA\u2019s decision did not show that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>properly considered \u201c \u2018all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure\u2019 as required by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In addition, the motion judge stated that \u201c[tjhere is also no indication that the LHA considered its other remedies as provided by relevant HUD regulations.\u201d The judge ruled that the LHA had abused its discretion in terminating Carter\u2019s benefits and ordered that the termination of her section 8 assistance be annulled and that her rent assistance be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201c \u2018The standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. R 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). \u2018An order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992), citing <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556 (1976).\u201d <em>Anderson St. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>442 Mass. 812, 816 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">It was error for the judge to engage in fact finding. See note 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cWhen considering a motion for summary judgment, the judge should not consider the credibility of the witnesses or the weight of the evidence, nor should the judge make findings of fact.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 244 (1991), citing <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 370 (1982). We also conclude that the judge\u2019s rulings on the undisputed material facts were incorrect as matter of law, and we therefore reverse the judgment in favor of Carter and order the entry of judgment for the LHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>HUD regulations. </em>Section 982.551(c) of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides that \u201c[t]he family is responsible for an HQS breach caused by the family as described in \u00a7 982.404(b).\u201d Section 982.404(b) addresses those family obligations of a section 8 tenant, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201c(1) The family is responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following: . . . (iii) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201c(2) If an HQS breach caused by the family is life threatening, the family must correct the defect within no more than 24 hours. For other family-caused defects, the family must correct the defect within not more than 30 calendar days ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201c(3) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS, the PHA [Public Housing Authority] must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for the family in accordance with \u00a7 982.552.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The termination process is addressed by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552. It provides that: \u201cThe PHA may at any time . . . terminate program assistance for a participant, for any of the following grounds: (i) If the family violates any family obligations under the program (see \u00a7 982.551).\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">With regard to the circumstances to be considered, subsection (2) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">\u201cIn determining whether to . . . terminate assistance because of action or failure to act by members of the family: (i) The PHA <em>may </em>consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, Carter is not contesting that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>breached the HQS in the apartment at 20 Wyman Street, no. 2. The decision of the Housing Court clerk-magistrate in the earlier case found that Carter had committed waste in the apartment and awarded damages in the amount of $1,440 to the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The key regulatory provision in this case is 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i). The motion judge determined that the termination of Carter\u2019s section 8 voucher was \u201cnot \u2018in accordance with Sec. 982.552\u2019 \u201d because of the LHA\u2019s failure to consider all relevant circumstances. While Carter agrees and urges us to interpret the language beginning with \u201c[t]he PHA may consider all relevant circumstances\u201d to mean that the PHA is required to consider all relevant circumstances, the LHA emphasizes that the consideration of these circumstances is within the LHA\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The \u201cmandatory informal hearing procedure is . . . founded on due process principles.\u201d <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., ante </em>103, 109 (2006). The due process requirements are carefully spelled out in the HUD regulations, see <em>id. </em>at 109-111, and were satisfied in this case. In accordance with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(c)(2)(i), the termination letter gave Carter adequate notice of why her benefits were being terminated. And, as required by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(a)(l)(v), the LHA granted Carter the opportunity for an informal hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At this hearing, and pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(5), Carter and the LHA were allowed to present evidence. Unlike in <em>Wojcik, supra, </em>however, Carter presented no evidence of mitigating circumstances. She simply denied that she had caused any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear. See notes 5 &amp; 6, <em>supra. </em>The hearing officer was not required to give credence to her denial that she had committed waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The language in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i), \u201c[t]he PHA may consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of . . . termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure,\u201d must be interpreted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>vesting with the PHA the discretion as how to utilize, if at all, those factors. Thus, as <em>Wojcik, supra, </em>indicates, while a party must be allowed to present evidence on this point, what credence, if any, the PHA chooses to place upon those factors is entirely within its discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, Carter presented no mitigating evidence to the hearing officer; she merely denied having committed waste in the apartment. While termination of section 8 benefits for breach of the HQS is optional, not mandatory, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>Carter presented no evidence to the hearing officer in support of a lesser sanction. The LHA acted within the scope of the HUD regulations when it terminated Carter\u2019s section 8 voucher; Carter\u2019s termination was in accordance with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552, and the motion judge\u2019s ruling to the contrary was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It was also improper to rule that the LHA termination letter and the hearing officer\u2019s decision should have recited that remedies other than termination had been considered. The hearing officer\u2019s decision need only demonstrate that he exercised his discretion. See, e.g., <em>Lonergan-Gillen </em>v. <em>Gillen, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 749 (2003) (\u201csuch consideration [need not] be extensive or formal . . . [but] only . . . conscientious\u201d). As Carter had presented no evidence arguing for a lesser sanction, there were no mitigating circumstances for the hearing officer to consider. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 666 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>400 Mass. 52, 57 (1987) (\u201c[w]here the record shows that the judge has failed to exercise discretion, there exists an error of law requiring reversal\u201d); <em>Lonergan-Gillen </em>v. <em>Gillen, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 571 (1982) (\u201c[i]t is one thing to consider [a] right [to make an evidentiary ruling] and exercise it either way, but having been given that right, analogous to discretion, it is the duty of the judge to exercise it, and it is error as a matter of law to refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to exercise it\u201d). As for the termination letter, it satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 982.555(c)(2)(i) by providing Carter adequate notice of why her benefits were being terminated. Nothing more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">As noted above, upon violation of the HQS, the PHA has the discretion to terminate a tenant\u2019s section 8 voucher. See \u00a7 982.404(b)(3). That authority is not curtailed by the language of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.404(b)(2), providing that \u201c[i]f an HQS breach caused by the family is life threatening, the family must correct the defect within no more than 24 hours. For other family-caused defects, the family must correct the defect within no more than 30 calendar days . . . .\u201d This requirement that the apartment be returned to its prior condition by those responsible for the damage stands side by side with and independently of any consequences the PHA may impose on a tenant who caused a breach of the HQS. Any other interpretation would fail to give meaning to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.404(b)(3). Furthermore, our reading of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.404(b) is underscored by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(1), which provides that \u201c[t]he PHA may at any time . . . terminate program assistance for a participant. . . (i) [i]f the family violates any family obligations under the program (see \u00a7 982.551).\u201d As in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.404(b), the PHA\u2019s authority to terminate a section 8 housing voucher is again phrased independently of any condition that the tenant repair the damage done.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The termination letter sufficiently placed Carter on notice of the reason for the decision to terminate her section 8 benefits. Further, there was no error or abuse of discretion in the hearing officer\u2019s decision to uphold the LHA\u2019s termination of Carter\u2019s benefits. Pursuant to the HUD regulations, causing damage \u201cbeyond reasonable wear and tear\u201d is a sufficient reason for termination of section 8 benefits. At her hearing, rather than providing mitigating evidence, Carter denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>she had committed waste, an assertion the hearing officer was not required to credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We recognize that the LHA acted harshly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It did, however, also act permissibly within the bounds of its discretion. If the result is unfair, it is for Congress, not this court, to correct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judgment for the plaintiff is reversed, and a new judgment is to enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">For background on the Housing Choice Voucher (\u201csection 8\u201d) Program, see <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous.

Carter apparently attempted to lessen the impact of that judgment by noting that she had no legal representation at the earlier proceeding. The hearing officer\u2019s decision additionally notes Carter\u2019s testimony, in which \u201c[s]he denied leaving the apartment in any disrepair or with any damages beyond reasonable wear and tear.\u201d Carter also presented the testimony of two witnesses who \u201cvouched for her as someone who constantly cleaned and kept up her unit.\u201d A number of exhibits presented by Carter at the termination hearing are listed in the hearing officer\u2019s decision, although they do not appear in the record on appeal. It is not clear from their description whether the exhibits would have proved helpful to Carter in arguing her case, and in any event, Carter did not seek to supplement the appellate record with the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">It is apparent from the hearing officer\u2019s decision that he did not credit Carter\u2019s testimony denying that she had committed waste. The hearing officer\u2019s findings are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">\u201c1. HUD regulations are clear and unequivocal that a family is responsible for a breach caused by the family as described in Section 982.404(b)(iii) (see Section 982.552[b][4][c]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">\u201c2. Section 982.404(b)(iii) says that it is a breach if any member of a household causes damages beyond reasonable wear and tear to a dwelling unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-15\">\u201c3. There is a court decision against Ms. Carter awarding her former landlord damages in the sum of $1,440.00 <em>for waste </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-16\">\u201c4. Accordingly, the housing authority proceeding under the relevant HUD regulations has grounds to terminate Ms. Carter\u2019s rental subsidy assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-17\">\u201c5. In fact, Section 982.404(3) states that if a family has caused such a breach, the housing authority \u2018must take prompt and vigorous action . . .\u2019 and may terminate assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-18\">\u201c6. The housing authority has proceeded to terminate rental subsidy assistance and Ms. Carter IS AND IS HEREBY FOUND TO BE TERMINATED.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Carter also submitted affidavits in conjunction with her motion for summary judgment, one of which contained both of the following somewhat contradictory statements: \u201cI did not cause most of the damage alleged in the complaint,\u201d and \u201cAt the hearing held by the Lynn Housing Authority to terminate my subsidy, I testified that I did not cause the damage . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Moore\u2019s affidavit was not before the hearing officer, and we need not consider it. Moreover, as discussed more fully in <em>Wojcik, supra, </em>the HUD regulations are designed to afford the tenant who has received a termination notice a \u201cpretermination\u201d hearing \u2022\u2014 which occurs after receipt of the notice, but before benefits are actually terminated \u2014 that satisfies due process principles. No such opportunity is afforded (or expected) at the first stage, when the initial decision to terminate is made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The motion judge, at the summary judgment stage, apparently made additional findings of fact based on (a) materials and evidence neither reproduced in the record on appeal nor, apparently, in the record before the hearing officer (e.g., that Carter makes payments of $20 per month to her former landlord on the judgment for waste, and that, apart from the matter at issue, Carter had been a section 8 tenant in good standing for ten years and was in good standing with her present landlord); and (b) the judge\u2019s own observations (e.g., \u201cThe tenant also is clearly disabled [she has a significant hearing impairment that is obvious to this court]\u201d). As to the latter point, Carter mentions it only in passing in her brief on appeal and makes no argument concerning 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(2)(iv) (\u201c[i]f the family includes a person with disabilities, the PHA decision concerning [termination of benefits] is subject to consideration of reasonable accommodation . . .\u201d). See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Carter\u2019s memorandum in support of her motion for summary judgment does not mention her disability, nor does she contend on appeal that she placed the issue before the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We note that, to the extent that the record appendix submitted by the LHA lacked pertinent information, such as the documents that were before the motion judge, Carter\u2019s recourse was to settle the record on appeal in the Housing Court, see Mass.R.A.P. 18(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 941 (1979), or to move this court for leave to refer to parts of the record not included in the appendix, see Mass.R.A.P. 18(b), as amended, 417 Mass. 1602 (1994). Carter exercised her options to a limited extent, submitting as a supplemental appendix in her brief her memorandum of law on motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">If Carter wished to call to the judge\u2019s attention mitigating evidence she had submitted to the hearing officer, but which did not appear in his decision, she could have submitted an affidavit to that effect to the judge in conjunction with her motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Section 982.555(a)(l)(v) provides that an informal hearing is required for \u201c[a] determination to terminate assistance for a participant family because of the family\u2019s action or failure to act (see \u00a7 982.552).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We agree with Carter that, under the HUD regulations, the termination of her benefits was discretionary, not mandatory. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.404(b)(3) (\u201cIf the family has caused a breach of the HQS, the PHA . . . may terminate assistance for the family . . .\u201d). We also agree with the LHA in its observation that 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(ii) permits it to consider lesser alternatives. Nevertheless, although the LHA\u2019s decision not to implement a lesser sanction may seem harsh, that choice falls within the discretion afforded the LHA under the HUD regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Carter also contests the LHA\u2019s authority to terminate her section 8 assistance on the grounds that the termination was issued after she had already vacated the apartment, and that a PHA can issue a termination only for an ongoing violation of the HQS. To do so would allow anyone breaching the HQS by damaging the apartment to evade responsibility in conjunction with section 8 eligibility by vacating the apartment before the landlord or the housing authority becomes aware of the problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\">For another example of a harsh result, see <em>Department of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev. </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>535 U.S. 125 (2002) (amendments to Federal statute permit local housing authorities to evict entire households in Federal public housing for drug-related criminal activity of individual household members or guests, including situations in which the tenant did not know about, or could not foresee or control the behavior).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">We also agree with the LHA that the Housing Court judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Aguirre </em>v. <em>Aurora Hous. Authy., </em>1991 WL 287109 (N.D. Ill. 1991), was misplaced. First, the unpublished decision, stemming from a Federal District Court in another State, is not binding on us. Second, and more significantly, the case stood in a different procedural posture; the court granted the tenant a preliminary injunction enjoining the housing authority from terminating her section 8 benefits because the housing authority failed to provide her a proper pretermination hearing as required under the predecessor to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-8\">Duffly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYy\">(dissenting). I dissent because in my view the motion judge correctly ruled that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was defective for failing to reflect consideration of \u201call relevant circumstances\u201d as specified in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i). As we held in <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., ante </em>103, 112 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201ca decision whether to terminate [housing] benefits because of action or inaction of a family member must involve a process in which the affected family at least has an opportunity to present evidence and arguments about circumstances that might move the decision maker to impose a penalty less severe than termination. Thus the hearing officer must hear evidence and find facts relating to \u2018all relevant circumstances.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">That the hearing officer has considered such circumstances must be reflected in a written decision setting forth both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127a\">*127a</page-number>reasons for the decision and his factual determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 113-114. See, e.g., <em>Edgecomb </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Vernon, </em>824 F. Supp. 312, 316 (D. Conn. 1993); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Olmsted County Hous. &amp; Redev. Authy., </em>574 N.W.2d 725, 730 (Minn. Ct. App. 1998). The circumstances that may be considered include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201call relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of . . . termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The hearing officer\u2019s decision here reflects no such consideration, and the appellant, Lynn Housing Authority\u2019s (LHA\u2019s), argument in this appeal, in accordance with the position it maintained in <em>Wojcik, supra, </em>fails to acknowledge that the hearing officer has authority to exercise discretion in determining whether a section 8 tenant\u2019s benefits should be terminated. LHA thus makes no argument that the motion judge erred in concluding that the hearing officer\u2019s decision failed to indicate that \u201call relevant circumstances\u201d had been considered, instead arguing that its own consideration of circumstances, prior to issuing the termination notice, sufficed \u2014 a view we rejected in <em>Wojcik. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 112-113; <em>ante </em>at 121 n.7. Neither does LHA argue that no evidence of mitigating circumstances had been presented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Absent such arguments by LHA, there would have been no reason for Carter, as appellee, to supplement the record on appeal to reflect that this evidence had been presented below. It is her failure to do so that provides support for the court\u2019s view that Carter presented no evidence of mitigating circumstances to the hearing officer. See <em>ante </em>at 122 n.9. In any case, the record reflects that Carter \u2014 by reference to her poverty and impending homelessness and assertions that she was not the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127b\">*127b</page-number>any damage \u2014 did present evidence of \u201cthe effects of . . . termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">I do not agree that, on this record, summary judgment in favor of LHA should enter. In its brief, LHA states that, even if the hearing officer was required to consider mitigating factors, \u201csummary judgment for each party should have been denied.\u201d I would have granted the requested relief, reversed the judgment, and remanded the matter to the hearing officer for hearing and reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>Wojcik.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">LHA\u2019s sole challenge to the factual basis for the Housing Court decision was that Carter\u2019s \u201calleged payment of $20 per month to the landlord ... is not in the summary judgment record.\u201d LHA makes no claim that evidence that Carter is poor and has a hearing impairment was not in the summary judgment record and had not been presented to the hearing officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"pAmD\">Her affidavit states: \u201cI did not cause the damage .... If I lose my subsidy I believe it is unlikely that I will be able to find an apartment that I can afford for myself and my child. I am terrified that we will become homeless.\u201d It is undisputed that the decision to terminate benefits was not based on the conclusion that Carter caused the damage but that it was caused, after she and her son had vacated the apartment, by someone in her household.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
