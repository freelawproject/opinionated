SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Defendants appeal a remand to state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court decided that it had no jurisdiction because defendants had granted \u201csole and exclusive\u201d jurisdiction to the state courts. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Plaintiff Grand View PV Solar Two, L.L.C. (\u201cGrand View\u201d), owns a solar power project in Idaho. A second plaintiff, Cen-tauras Renewable Energy, L.L.C. (\u201cCen-tauras\u201d), is a producer of renewable energy. In the first half of 2015, Grand View entered into two contracts with the Helix Entities, which have expertise in designing, equipping, and constructing solar power plants. In August 2015, Centauras and Helix Electric, L.L.C., entered into a third agreement, the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement (\u201cMCA\u201d). At the time, Centau-ras was in the process of acquiring Grand View, which occurred in September 2015. Centauras signed the MCA in anticipation of acquiring Grand View and entering into a final agreement with the Helix Entities to construct the solar power plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The MCA requires the parties to maintain the confidentiality of certain project-related materials. The parties and their \u201csubsidiaries and affiliated companies\u201d consented to the following forum-selection clause (\u201cFSC\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">The Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Harris County in the State of Texas for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Proposed Transaction, and agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding related thereto except in such courts. The Parties hereto further hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the courts of Harris County in the State of Texas, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Negotiations between Centauras and-the Helix Entities soon broke down. In October 2015, Helix Electric\u2019s president accused Centauras of breaching the MCA. Centauras denied that charge. In November 2015, Centauras and Grand View sued the Helix Entities in Harris County state court, alleging that the Helix Entities had breached their earlier contracts with Grand View and, among other things, requesting a declaratory judgment to determine rights under the MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">In December 2015, the Helix Entities sued Grand View and Centauras in California federal court and removed the Texas state suit to the federal court <em>a quo. </em>In January 2016, Centauras and Grand View moved to remand, and the district court agreed. The Helix Entities appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">A contractual clause prevents removal where the clause amounts to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d waiver of removal rights. <em>City of New Orleans v. Mun. Admin. Servs., Inc., </em>376 F.3d 501, 504 (5th Cir. 2004). \u201cA party may waive its rights by explicitly stating that it is doing so, by allowing the other party the right to choose venue, or by establishing an exclusive venue within the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ambiguous language cannot constitute a \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06. Under Texas law, a contract \u201cis ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Coker v. Coker, </em>650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983) (citation omitted). Because removal must be unanimous, a single defendant\u2019s waiver of its removal rights is enough to defeat removal. <em>Brown v. Demco, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 478, 481 (5th Cir. 1986). \u201c[A]ny doubt about the propriety of removal must be resolved in favor of remand.\u201d <em>Gasch v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>491 F.3d 278, 281-82 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Plaintiffs correctly allege that Helix Electric waived its removal rights by agreeing in the MCA to \u201cthe sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Harris County in the State of Texas for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Proposed Transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The MCA\u2019s FSC is \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d: It gives Harris County state courts exclusive jurisdiction over disputes such as the one plaintiffs brought in that county. Because Helix Electric, L.L.C., agreed to the MCA\u2019s terms, it cannot remove, and neither can its co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The Helix Entities claim that the MCA\u2019s FSC does not bar them from removing. They advance two theories. The first is that the words of the FSC are ambiguous. The Helix Entities cite three grounds: (1) It is not clear what \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d means; (2) it is not evident whether Grand View qualifies as a subsidiary or affiliated company under the MCA; and (3) the FSC omits the term \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d from its waiver-of-objection sentence. In fact, none of this renders the FSC ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Texas courts determine whether a clause is ambiguous \u201cby looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered.\u201d <em>Coker, </em>650 S.W.2d at 394 (citation omitted). It is obvious from the context that \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d refers to the solar-power-plant project \u2014 the proposed transaction that the parties were contemplating when the MCA was drafted. Likewise, it is clear from the context that Grand View is a subsidiary or affiliated company of Centauras under the MCA. Though Centauras had not yet acquired Grand View when the parties entered into the MCA, the contract was drafted in anticipation of Centauras\u2019s acquisition of Grand View.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The Helix Entities draw the negative inference that the omission of \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d from one sentence of the FSC was meant to contradict the previous sentence\u2019s explicit statement vesting \u201csole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>and exclusive jurisdiction ... for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of ... the Proposed Transaction.\u201d But this is not a reasonable interpretation. The Helix Entities read clear language out of the contract on the basis of a negative inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Helix Entities\u2019 second argument is that the FSC does not cover Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. They reason that those claims derive from the two contracts Grand View entered into before the MCA took effect and therefore should be governed by those contracts\u2019 California FSCs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Again, we disagree. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims relate to the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d \u2014 the plan to build a solar power plant in the Idaho desert. Moreover, the lawsuit also relates to the MCA because plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory judgment to establish an affirmative defense that Centauras did not breach the agreement. Accordingly, those claims are governed by the MCA\u2019s broadly worded FSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Plaintiffs petition for attorneys\u2019 fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The usual rule is that courts can award fees under that subsection only where \u201cthe removing defendant lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper.\u201d <em>Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>385 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Garcia v. Amfels, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 585, 587 (5th Cir. 2001). The court did not abuse its discretion. In fact, the Helix Entities had an- objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal even if, in our view, that effort was ultimately misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">This FSC is similar to the one we examined in <em>Ensco Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>579 F.3d 442, 448-49 (5th Cir. 2009), in which we held that where a FSC is unambiguous, language vesting \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d in a state court constitutes a waiver of removal rights. We reach the same conclusion here. The judgment of remand is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">. There are four defendants: Helix Electric, Incorporated/Helix Electric of Nevada, L.L.C., J.V., a California Partnership (\u201cHelix Partnership\u2019\u2019); Helix Electric, Inc. (\u201cHelix Electric\u201d); Helix Renewables, a California Joint Venture (\"Helix J.V.\u201d); and Helix Electric of Nevada, L.L.C., a Nevada Limited Liability Company (\"Helix Electric, L.L.C.\u201d). We refer to defendants collectively as \"the Helix Entities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-17\">. We have jurisdiction to review remand orders that are based on FSCs. <em>Waters v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., </em>252 F.3d 796, 797 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">. Where an FSC grants exclusive jurisdiction to the \"the Courts of Texas,\u201d it is referring to Texas state courts, not just courts located in Texas. <em>Dixon v. TSE Int'l, Inc., </em>330 F.3d 396, 398 (5th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). This FSC therefore refers to state courts in Harris County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\">. The Helix Entities cite <em>VKK Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Football League, </em>244 F.3d 114, 130 (2d Cir. 2001), for the proposition that \"affiliate\u201d when used in a contract does not include companies that became affiliated after the contract took effect. But the contract in that case explicitly tied its operation to \"the date of this Release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The instant FSC does not include similar time-limited language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\">. The California FSCs in the earlier contracts bind only the Helix Entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
