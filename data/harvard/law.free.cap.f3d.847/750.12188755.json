SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Hang Thuy Nguyen appeals a summary judgment upholding the denial of her application for naturalization because, under state law, she had not received a \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon\u201d for her conviction of an aggravated felony. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Nguyen, a lawful permanent resident, was convicted in 2004 of the state crime of conspiracy to commit false or altered lottery tickets and received a suspended sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 active probation. After completing probation, she was granted an automatic first-offender pardon. <em>See </em>La. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 5(E)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:572(B)(1). Nguyen applied for naturalization. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) denied the application and stated in its reaffirmance of the denial that her conviction, an aggravated felony, permanently prevented her from demonstrating good moral character and thus from being naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Nguyen sought judicial review. The district court granted summary judgment on the ground that Louisiana\u2019s automatic first-offender pardon is not a \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon\u201d as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10. Nguyen appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">Nguyen contests USCIS\u2019s interpretation of its regulation. She asserts that the Louisiana statute implementing the first-offender pardon demonstrates that this is a full pardon such that it falls within the regulation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Among the requirements to become a naturalized citizen is to have been a \u201cperson of good moral character\u201d during the proscribed five-year waiting period as a lawful permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a). An applicant for naturalization is permanently barred from demonstrating good moral character if convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), any time on or after November 29, 1990. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(8); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10 \u2014 (b)(l)(ii). The regulations allow an exception for those who have received a \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10(c)(2)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Louisiana\u2019s constitution provides for two different sorts of pardon. The first is a discretionary pardon or commutation issued by the governor. La. Const, art. TV, \u00a7 5(E)(1). The second is a pardon for first-time offenders issued \u201cautomatically upon completion of his sentence, without a recommendation of the Board of Pardons and without action by the governor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>US-CIS has interpreted the second automatic first-offender pardon not to be a \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon.\u201d We need not consider whether USCIS\u2019s interpretation is entitled to <em>Auer </em>deference,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because its interpretation of \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon\u201d is otherwise persuasive. <em>See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., </em>567 U.S. 142, 132 S.Ct. 2156, 2168-69, 183 L.Ed.2d 153 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Louisiana distinguishes between the effects of its two types of pardons. A gubernatorial pardon \u201cprecludes the use of a pardoned offense to enhance punishment\u201d and restores the individual to \u201ca status of innocence.\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>355 So.2d 917, 921-22 (La. 1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). An automatic first offender pardon does not restore \u201ca status of innocence\u201d and, accordingly, \u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>preclude consideration of a first felony conviction in adjudicating a person as a habitual offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Nguyen urges that there is no such distinction because the Louisiana statute implementing these pardons does not distinguish between them for purposes of considering pardoned offenses under habitual-offender statutes. The implementing statute states that \u201cany person receiving a pardon under the provisions of [\u00a7 5(E)(1)] and this Section may be charged and punished as a second or multiple offender as provided in R.S. 15:529.1.\u201d La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:572(E). But the Louisiana Supreme Court has maintained the distinction between gubernatorial and automatic first-offender pardons in this context. <em>See Touchet v. Broussard, </em>31 So.3d 986, 993-94 (La. 2010). Given that Louisiana does not consider the automatic first-offender pardon to restore \u201ca status of innocence,\u201d as does a gubernatorial pardon, USCIS\u2019s interpretation that an automatic first-offender pardon is not a \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon\u201d is permissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-11\">. <em>See Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-5\">. USCIS\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfull and unconditional executive pardon\u201d in <em>Sharma v. Taylor, </em>50 F.Supp.3d 749, 754 (E.D. Va. 2014)\u2014 to include discretionary gubernatorial commutations that eliminate naturalization consequences \u2014 is substantively distinct and thus inapplicable. It does not demonstrate that USCIS\u2019s interpretation of Louisiana's automatic first-offender pardons is invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">.
