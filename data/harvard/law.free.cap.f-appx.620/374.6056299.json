His original sentence in 2010 of life imprisonment was reduced in 2013 to 230 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">Kilcrease contests the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Because <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993), we understand his claim to be: based on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>his statutory minimum sentence was unconstitutionally increased based on facts not admitted or proved before a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and, therefore, he is entitled to a sentence reduction. - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-24\">The dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Ordinarily, a collateral attack on claimed errors at trial or sentencing is through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>In that regard, a federal prisoner may challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition only when the remedy in \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). To meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255(e), Kilcrease must demonstrate his claim was \u201c(i) ... based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-25\">Alleyne is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Olvera, </em>775 F.3d 726, 730 (5th Cir.2015). Kilcrease maintains <em>Persaud v. United States </em>announced Alleyne and its progeny applied retroactively to such cases. - U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014). The <em>Persaud </em>Court, however, remanded the matter \u201cfor further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <em>Persaud </em>is not a substantive decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
