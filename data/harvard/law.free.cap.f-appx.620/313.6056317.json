California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Apar-icioabarca has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Aparicioabarca\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. If Aparicioabarca wishes to challenge the Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding the calculation of his sentence, he must first exhaust his administrative remedies through the Bureau of Prisons and then may file a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1990). Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AyN\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
