Doc. 61. Plaintiffs admitted many of the material facts in the case when they failed to respond in any way to defendants\u2019 requests for admissions. In opposing defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs filed declarations containing assertions purportedly contrary to their earlier admissions, but they did not explain why the assertions were contrary to such admissions or seek any relief from their admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">Plaintiffs contend that they did seek relief from their admissions in their response to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Their response, they submit, \u201cconstituted a valid request to withdraw or amend any facts that had been automatically deemed admitted pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 36,\u201d and the \u201cDistrict Court Vas required to analyze Plaintiffs\u2019 request as to whether withdrawal or amendment [of the admitted facts] would have subserved the presentation of the case\u2019s merits, and whether it would have prejudiced Defendants.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at. 12. Plaintiffs seek the vacation of the summary judgment and a remand of the case so that the District Court can conduct such analysis. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-19\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s consideration of the facts admitted via plaintiffs\u2019 failure to respond to the requests for admissions. There is no material issue of fact for submission to a jury in this case. Summary judgment was appropriate and was due to be granted. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b895-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
