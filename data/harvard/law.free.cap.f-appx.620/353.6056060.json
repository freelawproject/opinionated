HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">The attorney appointed to represent Pablo Edmundo Herrera-Espinosa. (\u201cHerrera-Espinosa\u201d) has moved for leave to withdraw and has-filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Herrera-Espinosa filed a timely response.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">Herrera-Espinosa pled guilty to illegally re-entering the United States following deportation after a felony conviction. On September 6, 2013, the district court sentenced him to thirty (30) months imprisonment followed by three (3) years of supervised release. Herrera-Espinosa was removed from the United States on June 30, 2015. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Herrera-Es-pinosa\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Because Herrera-Espinosa has completed the confinement portion of his sentence, any argument that the prison term should be reduced is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the. APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2, and in part as moot. <em>See Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d at 382-83.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
