After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"Am6\">A. Insurance Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">In 2008, GCB obtained a banker\u2019s professional liability policy from Federal Insurance covering any claim by a customer for a wrongful act while performing \u201cProfessional Services.\u201d The policy required Federal Insurance to defend any claim covered under the policy, even if any of the allegations were groundless, false or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Relevant to this appeal, an amendment to the policy defined \u201cProfessional Services\u201d to mean \u201cLending Services.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And \u201cLending Services\u201d was then defined as \u201cany act performed by an Insured for a Lending Customer of [GCB] in the course of extending or refusing to extend credit or granting or refusing to grant a loan or any transaction in the nature of a loan, including any act of restructure, termination, transfer, repossession or foreclo-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sure.\u201d A lending customer was a \u201cperson or entity\u201d to whom \u201can extension of credit, an agreement to extend credit, or a refusal to extend credit was made or negotiated on behalf of\u2019 GCB.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">B. Underlying Bankruptcy Adversary Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">In 2010, GCB was named as a defendant in an adversary proceeding filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Idaho. In the Chapter 7 bankruptcy adversary proceeding, the trustee for Payroll America Inc. (\u201cPayroll America\u201d) sued GCB.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">According to the adversary complaint, Payroll America contracted with one of GCB\u2019s bank account holders, Lori Duke d/b/a Data Processing Services (\u201cDPS\u201d), to complete certain payroll transactions, such as withholding taxes and then depositing those tax withholdings with the appropriate government agency. Using the Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) network and the Federal Reserve banking system, DPS collected funds from Payroll America\u2019s client accounts and transferred them to the relevant taxing authority. Pursuant to a written agreement, GCB, the \u201cSending Bank,\u201d allowed DPS, as the \u201cThird-Party Sender,\u201d to use GCB\u2019s Originating Depository Financial Institution routing number to obtain direct access to the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta and perform these payroll functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">The bankruptcy trustee\u2019s initial complaint sought only an accounting, but sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>sequent amendments added claims of fraudulent transfers by Payroll America through GCB\u2019s bank. Specifically, the trustee\u2019s second amended complaint alleged that Payroll America had operated a fraudulent scheme similar to a Ponzi scheme that robbed \u201cPeter to pay Paul,\u201d and had used DPS\u2019s money transfers made through GCB\u2019s bank to hide Payroll America\u2019s insolvency and defraud its creditors. The trustee\u2019s second amended complaint alleged that these money transfers made at Payroll America\u2019s instruction were fraudulent transactions under federal and Idaho and Georgia law, that GCB and DPS knew or should have known the transfers were fraudulent, and that GCB was liable for DPS\u2019s actions because they were engaged in an agency relationship or a joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The trustee\u2019s second amended complaint also alleged that when Payroll America had \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d- for some of these ACH money transfers, GCB \u201cpaid out\u201d those -funds on Payroll America\u2019s behalf, obligating Payroll America to repay GCB for the \u201cadvance.\u201d DPS, on GCB\u2019s behalf, then demanded \u201crepayment\u201d from Payroll America to satisfy the \u201cobligation,\u201d which Payroll America did with commingled funds. The second amended complaint alleged that when these insufficient-funds transfers occurred, GCB knew or should have known that Payroll America \u201cwas incurring debt to\u201d GCB. The second amended complaint sought, among other things, to recover the full amount of the money transfers from GCB and DPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">C. Defendant Federal Insurance\u2019s Refusal to Defend</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Based on the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s initial complaint for an accounting, GCB filed a claim with Federal Insurance. Federal Insurance denied coverage and refused to defend GCB.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">After the bankruptcy trustee amended the complaint to allege the fraudulent transfer claims, GCB resubmitted its claim to Federal Insurance. Federal Insurance again denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis that the trustee and Payroll America were not GCB\u2019s customers and because the factual allegations in the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s second amended complaint did not involve professional services, i.e., loan servicing or lending services, as defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">GCB defended itself in the bankruptcy-adversary proceedings, ultimately winning summary judgment. In opposing summary judgment, the bankruptcy trustee (orally and in writing) argued unsuccessfully that Payroll America was a customer of GCB and that when DPS\u2019s debit transactions on behalf of Payroll America failed and GCB temporarily covered the shortfall, Payroll America briefly owed GCB a debt, which it then repaid through DPS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal to the district court, the bankruptcy trustee renewed this argument, claiming that Payroll America in effect obtained \u201cshort-term loans\u201d from GCB. The district court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, rejecting, <em>inter alia, </em>the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s theory that GCB lent money to Payroll America.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>D. Breach of Contract Action</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Plaintiff GCB filed this diversity action against Defendant Federal Insurance, alleging a breach of its insurance contract under Georgia law. The district court granted Federal Insurance\u2019s motion to dismiss GCB\u2019s amended complaint because the underlying fraud claims in the bankruptcy-adversary proceeding did not fall, or even arguably fall, within the policy\u2019s coverage. The district court concluded that the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s second amended complaint contained no allegations of loan servicing or lending services as defined in the policy, and GCB did not claim that it \u201cin fact gave loans to\u201d Payroll America. The district, court looked to the pleadings \u2014 the second amended complaint \u2014 and explained that it would not consider the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s later arguments to the bankruptcy court and on appeal about short-term loans because GCB did \u201cnot claim that [Payroll America] was in fact a customer of [GCB] or that a loan agreement existed between [Payroll America] and [GCB].\u201d The district court dismissed GCB\u2019s amended complaint without prejudice and denied without prejudice GCB\u2019s pending motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">GCB filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the district court had not addressed the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s allegations that Payroll America owed GCB a debt. The district court denied the motion. The district court explained that none of the second amended complaint\u2019s factual allegations indicated that Payroll America\u2019s \u201cdebt\u201d to GCB \u201ccould reasonably be understood as a loan or extension of credit: there is no claim of a loqn agreement, an interest [r]ate, or even a due date. Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence suggesting that a reasonable insured bank would have believed that it was engaged in either Loan Servicing or Lending Services, as defined by the Policy, when it processed ACH transactions. In fact, it is clear that Plaintiffs knew that they did not provide Professional Services to [Payroll America].\u201d (footnote omitted). The district court denied GCB\u2019s motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Under Georgia law, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by comparing the language of the policy with the allegations in the underlying complaint against the insured. <em>Hoover v. Maxum Indem. Co., </em>291 Ga. 402, 407-08, 730 S.E.2d 413 (2012). The ordinary rules of contract construction apply to insurance contracts, and policy terms are given their ordinary and common meaning unless otherwise defined in the contract. <em>Boardman Petroleum, Inc. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>269 Ga. 326, 327-28, 498 S.E.2d 492 (1998). \u201cIf the facts as alleged in the complaint even arguably bring the occurrence within the pokey\u2019s coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend the action.\u201d <em>Hoover, </em>291 Ga. at 408, 730 S.E.2d 413 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Where the policy requires the insurer to defend groundless, false, or fraudulent claims, \u201cthe insurer has a duty to defend even where the complaint against the insured sets forth false factual allegations which would bring the claim within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Penn-Am. Ins. Co. v. Disabled Am. Veterans, Inc., </em>268 Ga. 564, 564, 490 S.E.2d 374 (1997). Moreover, \u201cin making a determination of wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>er to provide a defense, the insurer is entitled to base its decision on the complaint and the facts presented by its insured.\u201d <em>Colonial Oil Indus., Inc. v. Underwriters Subscribing to Policy Nos. TO31504670 and TO31504671, </em>268 Ga. 561, 562, 491 S.E.2d 387 (1997). For this reason, the insurer has a duty to defend even where \u201cthe complaint against the insured falsely indicates non-coverage\u201d but the insurer knows of or can ascertain \u201ctrue facts showing coverage.\u201d <em>Penn-Am., </em>268 Ga. at 565, 490 S.E.2d 374 (citing <em>Loftin v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>106 Ga.App. 287, 294-97, 127 S.E.2d 53 (1962)). Likewise, the insurer has a duty to defend where \u201cthe allegations of the complaint against the insured are ambiguous or incomplete with respect to the issue of insurance coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, it is only where the complaint sets forth true factual allegations showing no coverage that the suit is one for which liability coverage is not afforded and for which the insurer need not provide a defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Great Am. Ins. Co. v. McKemie, </em>244 Ga. 84, 85, 259 S.E.2d 39 (1979), and <em>Loftin, </em>106 Ga.App. at 291, 127 S.E.2d 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Here, the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s second amended complaint alleged that Payroll America conducted a Ponzi-like scheme using ACH money transfers it instructed DPS to make through GCB as the \u201cSending Bank.\u201d During this process, GCB sometimes briefly covered Payroll America\u2019s shortfalls due to differences between ACH debits and credits or to insufficient funds, which Payroll America then repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We agree with the district court that, when read in context, the debt allegations in the second amended complaint do not refer to the kind of activities that constitute \u201cLending Services,\u201d as defined in the policy The terms \u201cloan\u201d and \u201cextension of credit\u201d do not appear in the second amended complaint. The term \u201cdebt\u201d does appear in the second amended complaint, as do the terms \u201cadvance\u201d and \u201cobligation.\u201d However, none of the factual allegations suggest that the kind of \u201cdebt\u201d Payroll America was alleged to have briefly incurred when it initiated ACH money transfers involved a \u201cloan\u201d or an \u201cextension of credit\u201d by GCB to Payroll America. As the district court explained, there are no allegations of a loan agreement, an interest rate, or a term, or any other indications of a conventional bank \u201cloan\u201d or \u201cextension of credit.\u201d As the district court further noted, the \u201cdebt\u201d as alleged appears at most to be some form of overdraft protection, rather than a loan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, GCB\u2019s alleged role as the \u201cSending Bank\u201d in Payroll America\u2019s ACH money transfers was not a \u201cloan\u201d or the \u201cextension of credit\u201d as those terms are commonly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Moreover, GCB agrees that in fact Payroll America was never GCB\u2019s customer and that GCB did not give a loan or extend credit to Payroll America.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, GCB has repeatedly prevailed on this point in the underlying bankruptcy litigation. In other words, GCB\u2019s claim as alleged did not show coverage, and the \u201ctrue facts\u201d confirm that the claim was not covered. Under such circumstances, Georgia law does not require the insurer to defend against the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>to Federal Insurance. GCB\u2019s request to certify a question to the Georgia Supreme Court is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\">. We review the grant of summary judgment, as well as the interpretation of an insurance contract, <em>de novo. See James River Ins. Co. v. Ground Down Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). In this diversity case, Georgia law governs as to the insurance policy. <em>See Dempsey v. Auto Owners Ins. Co., </em>717 F.2d 556, 559 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-16\">. The policy\u2019s definition of \u201cProfessional Services\u201d also included \u201cLoan Servicing,\u201d but on appeal, GCB does 'not argue that its claim to Federal Insurance satisfied this part of the definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\">. The trustee made this argument to try to persuade the bankruptcy court that GCB was liable for Payroll America\u2019s fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550(a)(1) as an \"entity for whose benefit\u201d the transfers were made. The trustee contended that some of Payroll America's fraudulent wire transfers to DPS, as a third party, were in exchange for DPS\u2019s payment of Payroll America's short-term debt to GCB and thus were \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d GCB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b831-12\">. When this breach of contract action was filed, an appeal of the district court\u2019s order affirming summary judgment was pending in the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit recently affirmed and, like the bankruptcy court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the district court before it, rejected the bankruptcy trustee's argument that some of the DPS money transfers (called cure wires) were to repay a debt to GCB. <em>See In re: Payroll Am., Inc., </em>609 Fed.Appx. 367 (9th Cir.2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">. GBC\u2019s reliance on <em>Synovus Bank v. Griner, </em>321 Ga.App. 359, 739 S.E.2d 504 (2013), is misplaced. <em>Griner </em>addressed only whether bank overdraft fees constituted interest for purposes of Georgia\u2019s usury laws. <em>See id. </em>at 367-69, 739 S.E.2d 504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b833-11\">. For this reason, the district court also correctly concluded that the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s \u2022 subsequent legal arguments in opposing, and then appealing, summary judgment do not determine coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
