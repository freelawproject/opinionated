Wright\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action was dismissed for failure to timely serve process on the named defendants under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m). Wright failed to serve the defendants within 120 days of filing his lawsuit, as demanded by Rule 4(m), or within the 14-day extension ordered by the district court. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of a plaintiffs complaint for failure to timely serve a defendant under Rule 4(m). <em>Lepone-Dempsey v. Carroll Cty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>476 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007). We also review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to extend time to serve process for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, we must affirm \"unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">On or after filing a complaint, \u201cthe plaintiff may present a summons \u2018to the clerk for signature and seal.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(b). However, the plaintiff is responsible for ensuring that the summons and complaint are served within the time required by Rule 4(m). Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(1). Pursuant to Rule 4(m),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-12\">If a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed, the court \u2014 on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff \u2014 must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause .for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). Good cause exists \u201cwhen some outside factor, such as reliance on faulty advice, rather than inadvertence or negligence, prevented service.\u201d <em>Lepone-Dempsey, </em>476 F.3d at 1281 (quotation omitted). But Rule 4(m) grants a district court the discretion to extend the time for service of process even absent a showing of good cause. <em>Horenkamp v. Van Winkle &amp; Co., </em>402 F.3d 1129, 1132 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">On appeal, Wright makes two \u201cgood cause\u201d arguments. Wright first claims that he kept in touch with the clerk\u2019s office and was never informed that he needed to take further steps. However, Wright does not say that the clerk\u2019s office in any way impeded his serving process or that he failed to effect service because he relied on faulty advice from the clerk\u2019s office. Wright next claims that Central State Hospital, the facility at which he is committed, did not help him get his paperwork notarized or make copies. However, Rule 4 does not require notarization of a summons. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(a)(1) (describing the required contents of a summons). And once the district court granted him a 14-day extension, Wright was on notice of his responsibility to find a means to copy his documents. Although Wright eventually requested an extension to comply with the 14-day deadline, he did so only after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>that time period had lapsed. Wright has not shown good cause for his failure to serve the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">A district court may extend the time for service of process even absent a showing of good cause.' However, Wright had already been given a 14-day extension after the initial 120 days had passed. The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Wright\u2019s complaint without prejudice after he failed once again to serve the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
