No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Luft filed a two-count complaint against Defendants Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corporation and Citi Property Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCiti Defendants\u201d). After Citi Defendants moved to dismiss, Luft filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint, also requesting that the court relax the federal pleading standards. The district court granted Luft leave to amend. her complaint but explained that Luft was required to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 and with the pleading standards set out in <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Luft then filed a four-count first amended complaint against five named defendants, including both Citi Defendants. The district court dismissed the complaint <em>without </em>prejudice for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The district court granted Luft leave to file a second amended complaint. In doing so, the district court described Luft\u2019s complaint as a \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d and instructed Luft to \u201creplead each of her claims and to specify which factual allegations are relevant to each count,\u201d in accordance with the federal pleading standards. In a later order (ruling on Luft\u2019s motion for clarification and for an extension of time) the district court explained again the pleading requirements of Rule 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Luft filed a 117-page second amended complaint, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated. This second amended .complaint purpgrts to allege 7 claims against 13 named defendants, including both Citi Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Citi Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because Citi Defendants relied in part on documents outside the pleadings, Luft moved \u2014 and Citi Defendants agreed \u2014 to have the court convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. As a result, the district court denied Citi Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss; and Citi Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. Luft responded, opposing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">By a thorough written opinion, the district court then dismissed <em>with </em>prejudice \u2022Luft\u2019s second amended complaint, concluding that \u2014 despite the court\u2019s repeated and detailed instructions about how to cure the deficiencies in her complaint \u2014 Luft still failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rules 8 and 10. The district court described Luft\u2019s second amended complaint as \u201ca quintessential \u2018shotgun\u2019 pleading replete with factual allegations and rambling legal conclusions.\u201d In the alternative, the district court also concluded that each of Luft\u2019s seven claims should be dismissed either for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court then denied as moot Citi Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order dismissing a complaint with preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>dice, \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in- the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010). Although we construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>pro se </em>litigants must still conform to procedural rules. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Construed liberally, Luft raises four arguments on appeal: (1) that the district court erred in concluding that Luft failed to satisfy the federal pleading requirements; (2) that the district court erred in dismissing Count 4 for failure to identify a governmental actor; (3) that the district court erred in dismissing Luffs complaint before ruling on Citi Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment; and (4) that the district court erred in refusing to admit into evidence Exhibit Ml.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">As an initial matter, because Luft failed to challenge the district court\u2019s independent, alternative reasons \u2014 no jurisdiction or failure to state a claim \u2014 for dismissing Counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, she has abandoned those arguments. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, we focus on the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Count 4, in which Luft purports to assert a civil rights violation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">To comply with the federal pleading standards, Luft is required to, among other things, provide \u201ca short and plain statement\u201d of her claims showing that she is entitled to relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). She is also required to present each of her claims in a separate numbered paragraph, with each paragraph \u201climited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">A complaint that fails to comply with Rules 8 and 10 may be classified as a \u201cshotgun pleading.\u201d <em>See Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1129-30 (11th Cir.2001). When faced with a shotgun pleading, a district court must order a litigant to re-plead for a more definite statement of the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1133. When the amended complaint still fails to cure the deficiency, the complaint may be subject to dismissal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Here, the district court determined expressly that Luffs first amended complaint was a \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d and twice granted Luft leave to amend her complaint to satisfy the federal pleading requirements. Despite the court\u2019s detailed and repeated instructions, Luffs second amended complaint still failed to provide a \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d of her claims. Instead of clarifying and providing factual support for her existing claims, Luft amended her complaint by adding several new defendants, several new causes of action, and by seeking class certification. In the light of Luffs continued failure to comply with Rules 8 and 10 and of Luffs failure to comply with the court\u2019s repeated orders to cure the deficiencies in her complaint, the district court committed no error in dismissing with prejudice Luffs second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">To be more specific about the district court\u2019s alternative ground for dismissing Count 4, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Luft failed to allege sufficiently that Citi Defendants were governmental actors or that a conspiracy existed. Luffs argument that Citi Defendants acted under color of law by using the state judicial system to effectuate the foreclosure proceedings is without merit. Moreover, because Luffs Count 4 consists only of conclusory allegations with no pertinent factual support, she has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>We reject Luft\u2019s contention that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint without first ruling on Citi Defendants\u2019 pending motion for summary judgment. Luft\u2019s complaint was insufficient on its face; so the district court was under no obligation to consider the merits of Luft\u2019s claims by ruling on Citi Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. <em>See Johnson Enters. of Jacksonville v. FPL Grp., </em>162 F.3d 1290, 1333 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cdistrict courts have the power and the duty to define the issues at the earliest stages of litigation\u201d); <em>Byrne, </em>261 F.3d at 1129-34 (discussing the importance of a district court\u2019s early <em>sua sponte </em>intervention to ensure compliance with the federal pleading requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In dismissing with prejudice Luft\u2019s complaint, the district court ordered terminated all pending motions, including implicitly Luft\u2019s outstanding motion to admit Exhibit Ml into evidence. Because the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Luft\u2019s complaint rendered Luft\u2019s discovery motion moot, the district court committed no error in terminating the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
