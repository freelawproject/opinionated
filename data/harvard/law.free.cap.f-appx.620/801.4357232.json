Lample/s 75-month total sentence consists of a 51-month sentence for her conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, and a 24-month consecutive sentence for her conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-25\">On appeal, Lampley argues that the district court erred by enhancing her offense level after finding that the victims of her crimes \u2014 who were deceased by the time the offenses began \u2014 were vulnerable victims, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1. However, we find that the enhancement did not affect the total sentence imposed and that the sentence imposed is reasonable. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>even if the district court erred by applying the vulnerable victim enhancement, this does not constitute reversible error. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Our review of the district court\u2019s application of a vulnerable victim enhancement under U.S.S.G \u00a7 3Al.l(b) is de novo, \u201cas it presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2009). The vulnerable victim enhancement is found in \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which provides for a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d A \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is defined as a person \u201cwho is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Even if the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 3A1.1 enhancement, remand is unnecessary if such error did not affect the overall sentence imposed: \u201cit would make no sense to set aside [a] reasonable sentence and send the case back to the district court [where] it has already told us that it would impqse exactly the same sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, we assume a guideline error has occurred and then ask if the overall sentence is still reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1349. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need for the sentence to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d and deter criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Accepting for the purposes of review that the district court erred by applying the enhancement for vulnerable victims, remand is nevertheless unnecessary. <em>See Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349-50. The district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Further, Lampley\u2019s to-' tal sentence of incarceration is substantively reasonable. If the two-level enhancement for vulnerable victims did not apply, Lampley\u2019s guideline range would be 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. Therefore, even without the vulnerable victim enhancement, Lampley\u2019s 51-month sentence would be within the guideline range and well below the statutory maximum of 10 years, both of which are indicia of its reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (noting that we ordinarily expect a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable, and a sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is another indication of its reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">When the district court stated that it would impose the same sentence, regardless of the applicability of an enhancement, it focused on Lampley\u2019s \u201catrocious\u201d criminal history. By the time Lampley was 32 years\u2019 old, she had 27 adult criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>victions, with many involving fraudulent checks.- Lample/s criminal history was an appropriate consideration under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the weight given to any factor was within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (finding that prior offenses are' part of the history of the defendant and are plainly within \u00a7 3553(a)(1), which includes the history and characteristics of the defendant); see <em>also United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (weight given to any particular factor is committed to district court\u2019s sound discretion). Further, the district court demonstrated that it considered the need for deterrence, pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), when it observed that Lampley returned to her fraudulent criminal behavior less than one year after being released following three years in state prison for similar convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Thus, even if the district court erred by applying the \u00a7 3A1.1 enhancement, remand is unnecessary, because the error did not affect the overall sentence imposed and that sentence was reasonable. <em>See Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349-50. Accordingly, after review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Lampley\u2019s total sentence of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
