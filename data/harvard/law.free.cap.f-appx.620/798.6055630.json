The District Court thereafter sentenced Thetford to concurrent prison sentences as follows: 318 months under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), for the f\u00edre-arm and child-coercion offenses and 240 months for the wire-fraud and child-pornography offenses. Thetford appeals his convictions on the ground that the Magistrate Judge denied him the ability to represent himself because he was unable to access a law library. He appeals his sentences on the ground that he was improperly sentenced under the ACCA. We address these appeals in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">During trial, Thetford repeatedly expressed his desire to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Concerned by .the perils of <em>pro se </em>representation but cognizant of Thetford\u2019s constitutional right to represent himself, the Magistrate Judge fashioned a compromise. The judge allowed Thetford to proceed <em>pro se, </em>but arranged for a Federal Public Defender to assist him as stand-by counsel. Thetford subsequently filed a \u201cMotion for Disposition of all Cases,\u201d in which he stated that he had been unable to access a law library in order to represent himself. The Magistrate Judge denied the motion, explaining in the process that Thetford had no right to access a law library since he had been given the option of being represented by counsel but had rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Although Thetford now challenges the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling, he failed to appeal that ruling to-the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore lack jurisdiction to review Thet-ford\u2019s claim regarding access to a law library. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1352 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(b)(2) (stating that the failure to timely object to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommended disposition \u201cwaives a party\u2019s right to review\u201d that disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The ACCA provides that a person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous violent felony convictions (each committed on occasions different from one another) is subject to a minimum term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines a violent felony as: -</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The final clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) \u2014 crimes that \u201cotherwise involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d \u2014 is known as the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1349 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s determination that a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1341. At issue here is Thetford\u2019s prior Alabama conviction for third-degree burglary. Under Alabama law, \u201c[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the third degree if he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-7-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The District Court found that the third-degree burglary conviction was a generic burglary conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held recently, though, that a \u00a7 13A-7-7 burglary does not qualify as a generic burglary, and therefore does not constitute a \u201cburglary\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1349. The District Court therefore erred in relying on Thetford\u2019s \u00a7 13A-7-7 conviction in sentencing him under the ACCA. And, while the government presented an alternative argument that Thetford\u2019s offense qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, it has since withdrawn that argument based upon that clause\u2019s unconstitutionality. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) (holding that \u201cimposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">Accordingly, we vacate Thetford\u2019s sentences and remand the cases for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-12\">. As it turned out \u2014 and at Thetford's request \u2014 the Magistrate Judge re-appointed the assistant public defender. A few days later Thetford entered into a plea agreement with the Government and tendered the guilty pleas indicated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-9\">. The Supreme Court has held that the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cburglary\u201d encompasses \"only a special subclass of burglaries\u201d' containing \"at least the following elements: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). We refer to such a burglary as a \"generic burglary.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1343 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
