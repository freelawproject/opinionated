His 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was denied in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">While detained in the Western District of Texas in 2015, Griffin filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition containing numerous claims, which he conceded were intended to collaterally challenge his underlying convictions. Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Griffin challenges the denial and dismissal of that petition, as well as denial of his motion to reconsider, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">The denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Griffin contends our decision in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001), was both wrongly decided and is inapplicable here. In <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>our court held that, in order to pursue a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), the petitioner must state a claim: based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense; and was foreclosed by circuit law when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">Despite Griffin\u2019s assertion to the contrary, <em>Reyes-Requena </em>does not state prisoners may only use \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause to pursue actual-innocence claims. Griffin does not contend any of his claims may proceed under that savings clause, and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>not shown <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>was misapplied. Absent a change in law, an en-banc decision by this court, or an intervening Supreme Court decision overruling <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>we are bound by a prior panel\u2019s decision. <em>E.g., United States v. Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 425 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In his Rule 59(e) motion, Griffin agreed with the court\u2019s factual findings regarding his claims, and asserted only that it erred in applying <em>Reyes-Requena </em>to dismiss his \u00a7 2241 petition. The motion sought review of a purely legal issue; accordingly, our review is <em>de novo. E.g., Potts v. Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., </em>760 F.3d 470, 473 (5th Cir.2014). For the reasons stated above, the court did not err in denying Griffin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
