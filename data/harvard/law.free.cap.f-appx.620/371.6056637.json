Pete was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He did not appeal and did not seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In July 2014, Pete initiated this proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas, where he is imprisoned. The district court dismissed the petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Pete\u2019s challenge to his sentence and conviction implicates \u00a7 2255. Ordinarily, a petition filed under \u00a7 2241 that raises errors \u201cthat oceur[red] at trial or sentencing is properly construed under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). However, a \u00a7 2255 motion may be adjudicated by the sentencing court only. \u00a7 2255(a); <em>see Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 895 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001); Solsona <em>v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987). Because Pete was not sentenced in the Eastern District of Texas, he may not seek \u00a7 2255 relief there. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a). Nevertheless, he may avoid the jurisdictional stricture of \u00a7 2255(a) by proceeding under \u00a7 2241 if he shows \u00a7 2255 offers no adequate or effec-five relief. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Pete fails to make the required showing. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. He does not cite a retroactively applicable Supreme Court ruling establishing that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense, and he does not argue that his claims were foreclosed at the time when they should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.2010). Additionally, Pete\u2019s actual innocence argument is unavailing. <em>See McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1928, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); <em>Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 367-68 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">It \u201cwas not error\u201d for the district court to conclude that \u00a7 2241 relief was unavailable to Pete. <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 831; <em>see Garland, </em>615 F.3d at 394. And because it was not the sentencing court, \u201cthe district court did not have jurisdiction to treat\u201d Pete\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Solsona, </em>821 F.2d at 1132. Consequently, the district court was correct in dismissing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
