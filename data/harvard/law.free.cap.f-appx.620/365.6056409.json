On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by imposing a supervised release condition which would allow a probation officer to search Anderson, his residence, and his effects \u201cat a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Because Anderson failed to object below, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To demonstrate plain error, Anderson must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 114, 121, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), the Supreme Court upheld a warrantless search which was conducted pursuant to the terms of the defendant\u2019s state probation where law enforcement had reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was occurring. The Court subsequently held in <em>Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 846, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006), that a suspicionless search, conducted pursuant to a state statute which required that prisoners eligible for release on parole agree to be subject to a search regardless of whether law enforcement had a search warrant or cause, did not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Here, Anderson challenges a suspicion-less search supervised release condition imposed following his conviction under federal law. We have never found that such a search condition violates the Fourth Amendment. Given that the \u201claw is unsettled within the circuit, any error cannot be plain.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>777 F.3d 799, 805 (5th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
