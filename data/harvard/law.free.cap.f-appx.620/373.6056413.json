By moving to proceed IFP, Torres is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">As Torres notes, the district court found him eligible for the reduction but declined to exercise its discretion to reduce the sentence, determining that relief was unwarranted based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Torres contends that the court abused its discretion in denying a reduction based solely on petty disciplinary reports during his nine years of incarceration for nonviolent marihuana offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-23\">The record reflects that in deciding not to exercise its discretion, the court considered Torres\u2019s motion as a whole, the probation officer\u2019s addendum, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Torres does not claim that the court abused its discretion by basing its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts. Thus, he cannot show an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-24\">Torres has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. Additionally, because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under \u25a0 the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
