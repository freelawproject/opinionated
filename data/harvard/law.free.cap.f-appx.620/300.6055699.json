Because the district court correctly concluded that Mid-Continent has no duty to indemnify the Feasters under the terms of their commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">I. Factual <em>&amp; </em>Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"AAv\">The Feasters purchased a home built and owned by Kingwood Estate Homes, L.L.C. (\u201cKingwood\u201d), on January 25, 2006. During the construction of the property, Kingwood was insured under a CGL policy with Mid-Continent. . The policy was renewed annually and expired in April of 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The Feasters started noticing structural and cosmetic damage to their home after purchasing the property. They attributed these defects to \u201cfoundation deflection,\u201d a problem with the home\u2019s foundation, and in 2012, they filed suit against Kingwood, among others, in Texas state court for violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, negligence, breach of warranty, and fraud. Kingwood forwarded the lawsuit to Mid-Continent, seeking to invoke the CGL\u2019s duty to. defend. Mid-Continent demurred, citing several policy exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Kingwood did not answer the suit, and default judgment was entered against Kingwood. The judgment found King-wood liable for damage to the property arising from Kingwood\u2019s negligent supervision and construction of the property. The court held Kingwood liable for $305,130.00 in actual and consequential-damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">When the Feasters were unable to collect against Kingwood, they obtained a turnover order granting them Kingwood\u2019s interest in the Mid-Continent CGL policy. The Feasters then sued Mid-Continent in state court on a variety of claims stemming from Mid-Continent\u2019s refusal to indemnify Kingwood. Mid-Continent removed the suit- to federal court. Subsequently, the parties flled-cross motions for summary judgment. Mid-Continent argued that the damages incurred by the Feasters were not covered due to the CGL\u2019s policy exclusions and therefore Mid-Continent had no duty to indemnify. On January 13, 2015, the district court granted Mid-Continent\u2019s motion and denied the Feasters\u2019, reasoning that the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion applied. The Feasters timely appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Mid-Continent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">II. . Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A8sJ\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuM\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>same standard as the district court. <em>Performance Autoplex II Ltd. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is warranted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). While we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, a party cannot defeat summary judgment with \u201ccon-clusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We may affirm summary judgment on any legal ground raised before the district court. <em>Performance Autoplex, </em>322 F.3d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The parties agree that Texas insurance law governs this dispute. <em>See id. </em>Texas courts construe insurance policies using the same rules of interpretation applicable to contracts generally. <em>See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. CBI Indus., Inc., </em>907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995). If an insurance contract \u201ccan be given a definite and certain legal meaning, then it is not ambiguous.\u201d <em>Performance Autoplex, </em>322 F.3d at 854. If a provision is ambiguous, the policy is interpreted in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>While \u201cthe insured carries the burden to establish the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify by presenting facts sufficient to demonstrate coverage,\u201d the burden is on the insurer to prove that an exclusion precludes coverage. <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Puget Plastics Corp., </em>532 F.3d 398, 401, 404 (5th Cir.2008). The duty to indemnify is invoked \u201cbased on the \u2018actual facts\u2019 brought out in the underlying action. Thus, an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify typically can be resolved only after the conclusion of the underlying action.\u201d <em>VRV Dev. L.P. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>630 F.3d 451, 459 (5th Cir.2011). Because the underlying case does not always resolve all questions relevant to the scope of coverage, we also look to the facts developed in the evidence before the district court. <em>See Puget Plastics Corp., </em>532 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">2. <em>\u201cYour Work\u201d Exclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u201cA CGL policy generally protects the insured when his work damages someone else\u2019s property. The \u2018your work\u2019 exclusion prevents a CGL policy from morphing into a performance bond covering an insured\u2019s own work.\u201d <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. v. RJT Const., LLC, </em>581 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.2009). Mid-Continent argues, and the district court held, that the \u201cyour work\u201d provision of the CGL policy bars coverage for the Feasters\u2019 damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The provision at issue here excludes coverage for: \u201cProperty damage to your [Kingwood\u2019s] work arising out of it or any part of it and included in the products-completed operations hazard.\u201d The policy defines \u201cyour work,\u201d in part, as \u201c[wjork or operations performed by you or on your behalf.\u201d Or, as the Texas Supreme Court interpreted it, the \u201cyour work\u201d provision \u201cgenerally excludes coverage for \u2018property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>damage\u2019 to the insured\u2019s completed work.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">On appeal, the Feasters argue that the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion is inapplicable because there was no damage to Kingwood\u2019s work. They maintain that heaving soil\u2014 due to Kingwood\u2019s inadequate preparation of the lot \u2014 eventually caused problems with the property\u2019s foundation, which in turn caused cosmetic and structural damage. The Feasters argue that the house itself, and not the soil, was Kingwood\u2019s work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In <em>Wilshire Ins. Co., </em>we assessed whether a \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion applied when an insured was hired by a homeowner to repair the foundation of a house. 581 F.3d at 226. While we concluded that the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion \u201cprecludes coverage for the cost of repairing [the insured\u2019s] own work, the foundation,\u201d we clarified that the exclusion did \u201cnot exclude coverage for damage to other property resulting from the defective work,\u201d such as walls and ceilings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Unlike in <em>Wilshire, </em>Kingwood was contracted to build the entire house, not merely repair the foundation. The Texas Supreme Court has held that in the context of the \u201cyour work\u201d exception, a \u201chome-builder\u2019s work extend[s] to the entire house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226 (interpreting <em>Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>242 S.W.3d 1, 11 (Tex.2007)). The underlying state court documents, coupled with the Feasters\u2019 own statements and expert\u2019s report, make clear that constructing the foundation, which includes preparation of the soil, was part of Kingwood\u2019s responsibilities in constructing the house. <em>See Stoner v. Thompson, 578 </em>S.W.2d 679, 684 (Tex.1979) (\u201cA default judgment admits facts which are properly alleged.\u201d). For instance, in the Feasters\u2019 state court suit against Kingwood for damage to their property, the Feasters explicitly argued that \u201cfoundation deflection of a substantial and unacceptable degree\u201d was due to Kingwood\u2019s negligent construction and supervision of subcontractors, and the Feast-ers obtained a judgment to that effect. Moreover, the Feasters concede on appeal that preparation of the soil was King-wood\u2019s responsibility. They note that the \u201chighly plastic soil ... expanded [due to] an excess of water resulting from poor lot preparation by Kingwood and its subcontractors.\u201d The Feasters\u2019 expert also stated that the inadequacies with the soil were due to Kingwood\u2019s failure to abide by \u201cthe engineers [sic] plans and specifications\u201d when constructing the foundation. <em>See Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Cat Tech L.L.C., </em>660 F.3d 216, 222 (5th Cir.2011) (citing with approval <em>Eulich v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>503 S.W.2d 846, 849 (Tex.Civ. App.\u2014Dallas 1974) (noting that \u201c[l]iability for damage to the building resulting from [the failure to] comply with specifications is exactly the type of liability which the [exclusion] was evidently intended to exclude\u201d)). As such, there is no dispute that the preparation of the soil, the foundation, and the house itself constituted King-wood\u2019s work. The Feasters do not appear to contest whether the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d requirement is satis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>fled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in applying the \u201cyour work\u201d exception in this case, and we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">. The Feasters incorrectly maintain that the district court granted summary judgment on the grounds that the damages to the Feasters\u2019 property did not occur during the CGL\u2019s policy period. While this initially served as the district court\u2019s basis for granting summary judgment, the district court vacated that opinion and later held that summary judgment was warranted because the \"your work\u201d exclusion applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\">. The Feasters appear to argue that the \"your work\" provision is unconscionable. However, they fail to cite to any authority supporting their argument. As such, we consider this argument abandoned for being inadequately briefed. <em>See L &amp; A Contracting Co. v. S. Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir.1994) (citation omitted); Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(a). The Feasters likewise argue that the policy is a \"farce\" because Mid-Continent did not exercise ordinary care, presumably in rejecting the Feasters' claim for indemnification. Because we conclude that the \"your work\u201d exclusion applies, we reject this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. To the extent the Feasters argue the \u201cyou work\u201d provision is ambiguous, we disagree. The policy\u2019s language is clear, and the Feast-ers\u2019 \u201d[m]ere disagreement over the interpretation of [the] provision does not make the provision ambiguous or create a question of fact.\u201d <em>Performance Autoplex, </em>322 F.3d at 854 (citing <em>D.E.W., Inc. v. Local 93, Laborers' Int'l Union of N. Am., </em>957 F.2d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1992) (interpreting Texas law)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">. This argument is somewhat illogical as Kingwood could be liable only if it did something wrong. If forces outside its control caused the harm, there would be no liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AH0\">. Even if the Feasters produced evidence that the property damage arose prior to the Feast-ers\u2019 purchase of the property, this fact dispute would not be material. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\"Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d). As the district court noted, the CGL policy includes a separate provision excluding coverage for \"[p]roperty damage to ... [p]roperty you own.\u201d Kingwood owned the property prior to the Feasters\u2019 purchase of the property. Thus, damage that occurred during construction would not be covered under this exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
