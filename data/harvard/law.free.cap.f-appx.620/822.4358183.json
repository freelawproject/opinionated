After they defaulted on the loan, Aurora filed a mortgage foreclosure action in Florida state court and obtained' a final judgment in December 2011. The property was then sold in a public sale in late October 2012.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly before the sale, in early October, the homeowners filed a lawsuit against the lenders. They primarily alleged that the lenders should have granted a loan modification request they made in September 2012 \u2014 nine months after the foreclosure judgment. The homeowners alleged that in failing to grant the loan modification request, the lenders neglected their duty under TARP and HAMP to provide loan modifications and rendered unfair and deceptive their public representations that they were committed to providing loan modifications, in violation of the FDUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">The lenders removed the case to federal district court and then moved to dismiss. The district court granted the motion on several grounds: (1) the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction; (2) the doctrine of res judicata also barred the suit; (3) neither TARP nor HAMP creates a private right of action; and (4) the complaint failed to state a claim under the FDUTPA. After careful review, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars the FDUTPA claim as pled in the complaint, but it does not bar the putative claims under TARP and HAMP. Nevertheless, we agree that the homeowners failed to state claims under those programs. Thus, we affirm the dismissal of the action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">To determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal, we review <em>de novo </em>the application of the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>713 F.3d 1066, 1069 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e ... give liberal construction to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants\u201d but require them always \u201cto conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We first consider the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The district court concluded that the December 2011 forfeiture judgment in Florida state court precluded the instant action. We agree only with respect to the FDUTPA claim. Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, federal district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to review final state court decisions. <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, 558 </em>F.3d 1266, 1270-72 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe doctrine applies both to federal claims raised in the state court and to those inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment,\u201d meaning that the district court may not entertain claims that \u201cwould effectively nullify the state court judgment or ... suceeed[ ] only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, 558 </em>F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (per cu-riam) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Here, we note that, in asserting claims under TARP and HAMP, the homeowners neither seek to undo the effect of the foreclosure judgment nor make arguments that would have undermined its validity. First, the homeowners seek only damages, which, if awarded, would not nullify the state court judgment because the instant action does not challenge the transfer of the real property effectuated by the foreclosure. Second, the success of putative claims under TARP or HAMP would not require a determination that the state court erroneously entered the foreclosure judgment. In concluding otherwise, the district court relied on <em>Figueroa v. Merscorp, Inc., </em>766 F.Supp.2d 1305 (S.D.Fla.2011) aff<em>'d, </em>477 Fed.Appx. 558 (11th Cir.2012), in which a district court found that it lacked jurisdiction over federal RICO claims because their success would have required the court to \u201cfind that wire and mail fraud occurred in [the] prosecution of [the] foreclosures\u201d at issue, which \u201cwould [have] effectively declare[d] the state court [foreclosure] judgments] fraudulently procured and thus void.\u201d 766 F.Supp.2d at 1324 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, however, the homeowners\u2019 challenge to the lenders\u2019 denial of their modification request has no bearing on the legal validity of the state court\u2019s foreclosure judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ment. The homeowners alleged only that the lenders failed to respond adequately to their September 2012 request for a loan modification, which could not have been at issue in the foreclosure proceeding that concluded in December 2011. Further, and more importantly, there is no authority for the proposition that a lender\u2019s failure to fulfill any duties under TARP or HAMP invalidates a foreclosure resulting from that failure as a matter of law. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>inquiry is not whether a claim for damages is based to any degree on harm resulting from a valid state court judgment, as is the case here. The inquiry is whether either the damages award would annul the effect of the state court judgment or the state court\u2019s adoption of the legal theory supporting <em>the </em>award would have produced a different result. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. Neither is the case here. For these reasons, the putative claims under TARP and HAMP are not barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">With respect to the district court\u2019s application of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>to the FDUTPA claim, in support of this claim the homeowners alleged more broadly that the lenders failed to \u201chelp [them] to modify their loan[,] denying them any possibility to cure their default, which constitutes a deceptive practice to the public\u201d in the light of the lenders\u2019 public representations that loan modifications were generally available. Am. Compl. at 7 \u00b6 21. We construe this allegation to extend beyond the \u25a0lenders\u2019 denial of the September 2012 loan modification request and to include conduct before the foreclosure judgment. In effect, the homeowners\u2019 claim amounts to an equitable defense to foreclosure that they failed to raise before the state court. <em>See Shahar v. Green Tree Servicing LLC, </em>125 <em>So.3d 251, </em>252-54 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2013) (finding unclean hands to be \u00e1 sufficiently pled affirmative defense to foreclosure where a lender made material misrepresentations in connection with the mortgage). Consequently, we agree with the district court that success on the merits of the FDUTPA claim would require a determination that the state court entered the forfeiture judgment \u201cwrongly,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that the judgment was legally invalid. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. \u201cBy failing to raise [their] claim[] in state court[,] [the homeowners] forfeited] [their] right to obtain review of the state court decision in any federal court.\u201d <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). The district court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the FDUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Next, we review whether the homeowners\u2019 allegations that the lenders failed to comply with TARP and HAMP stated a claim. These claims fail because no private right of action is available under TARP or HAMP. We previously have held that there is no express or implied private right of action against loan servicers under HAMP. <em>Miller v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, </em>677 F.3d 1113, 1116 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Although we have never held in a published opinion that TARP provides no private right of action against private entities, we reach that conclusion here. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish TARP, under which it may \u201cpurchase ... troubled assets from any financial institution\u201d and take other necessary actions. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5211. The Act provides for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s actions, but nowhere does it mention a private right of action against private entities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5229. We can thus infer that Congress did not intend to create a private right of action for borrowers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>to sue lenders' under TARP. <em>See Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 290, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (providing that \u201c[t]he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others\u201d); <em>see also Wachovia Bank, Nat\u2019l Assoc. v. Lone Pine, Inc., </em>No. 1:09-CV-02983-JOF, 2010 WL 2553880, at *2 (N.D.Ga. June 15, 2010) (collecting cases recognizing no private right of action under TARP).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Because we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the FDUT-PA claim and that the homeowners failed to state cognizable claims under TARP or HAMP, we need not address the district court\u2019s discussion of res judicata or whether they stated a claim under the FDUTPA. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the action is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-12\">.
