The defendant acknowledged that this argument was foreclosed by existing circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>636 F.3d 728, 742 (5th Cir.2011). We thus rejected his argument and affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">The defendant then filed a petition for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted after its decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (June 26, 2015). The Supreme Court vacated our previous ruling and remanded for consideration in light of <em>Johnson, </em>which concluded that the residual clause is vague and thus void.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-28\">The Armed Career Criminal Act was applied to the defendant based on a finding that a prior conviction qualified under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>residual clause. That resulted in application of a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. Absent application of the Armed Career Criminal Act, the defendant faced a statutory maximum of ten years. In this direct appeal, we therefore VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for resentencing in light of <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-17\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
