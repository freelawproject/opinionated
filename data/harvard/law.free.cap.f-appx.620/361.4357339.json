This appeal arises from the foreclosure sale of Bailey\u2019s real property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">Although timely filed, Bailey\u2019s brief contains no record citations to support its statement of facts or the legal arguments challenging the district court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Federal Appellate Rule of Procedure 28(a)(6), an appellant\u2019s brief must include \u201ca concise statement of the case setting out the facts ... with appropriate references to the record.\u201d Rule 28(a)(8)(a) requires that the brief contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-23\">Although pro' se briefs are construed liberally and this Court \u201capplies] less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than parties represented by counsel,\u201d pro se litigants still must reasonably comply with Rule 28. <em>Haase v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>748 F.3d 624, 629 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995)). Because Bailey has failed to provide any record citations to support her statement of the case or contention that the district court erred in granting summary judgment, she has abandoned this issue by failing to properly brief it. <em>See Murphy v. Andrews, </em>609 Fed.Appx. 222, 223 (5th Cir.2015) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>466 Fed.Appx. 340, 341 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam); <em>Hernandez v. Grubbs, </em>82 Fed.Appx. 866, 867 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Under limited circumstances, this Court may exercise its discretion to consider pro se briefs that fail to comply with Rule 28 when doing so does not prejudice the ap-pellee. <em>See Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988) (reaching the merits of a noneompliant pro se brief when \u201cwell-settled law\u201d applied, there were no \u201cdisputed facts,\u201d and the appellee fully briefed the issue.). As demonstrated by U.S. Bank\u2019s brief, Bailey\u2019s failure to reasonably comply with Rule 28 left U.S. Bank to speculate and deduce both the factual basis of her challenge and her specific arguments on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, Bailey\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 28 prejudiced U.S. Bank. <em>See Toala v. Marriott White Lodging Corp., </em>456 Fed.Appx. 476, 477 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (dismissing a pro se litigant\u2019s appeal because his failure to comply with Rule 28 and \u201carticulate the basis of his challenge prejudiced [defendant-appellee]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Bailey\u2019s appeal for want of prosecution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-16\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
