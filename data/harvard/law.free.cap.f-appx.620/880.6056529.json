Hopkins complained about discrimination based on her race and her gender and of retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a), and in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10, and about discrimination based on her age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-19\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed with prejudice Hopkins\u2019s third amended complaint. That pleading, as the district court stated, \u201cconsisted] of stream of consciousness narrative\u201d and \u201cundecipherable language.\u201d The district co.urt allowed Hopkins to amend her complaint three times and, in its orders, the district court identified specific defects in the pleadings, described the elements for Hopkins\u2019s putative claims, and instructed her to file a complaint containing a short and simple statement of her claims and her demand for relief, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a), in separately numbered paragraphs, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b). Hopkins disregarded those instructions and filed a third amended complaint consisting of selected pages from her earlier complaints, a statement of facts from her original complaint, which the district court had described as an \u201cincoherent narrative\u201d for which it was \u201cimpossible ... to formulate a response,\u201d her charge of discrimination, and the dismissal form issued by the Commission. The district court reasonably decided to dismiss Hopkins\u2019s third amended complaint with prejudice when she failed repeatedly to amend her complaint in compliance with the rules of procedure. <em>See Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006). And the district court correctly determined that Hopkins\u2019s claims against Enz and Logsdon failed to state a claim, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), because employers, not individual employees, are liable for violations of Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act. <em>See Smith v. Lomax, </em>45 F.3d 402, 403 n. 4 (11th Cir.1995) (Employees \u201ccannot be held liable under the ADEA or Title VII.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Hopkins challenges the judgment on five grounds, all of which fail. First, Hopkins mentions in her statement of jurisdiction that her \u201caction is brought for discrimination in employment pursuant to ... [the] Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\u201d but she acknowledges that she did \u201c[n]ot mention [the Act] in [her] original complaint or amended complaints.\u201d Second, Hopkins argues that she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, but no hearing is required to dismiss a defective pleading. Third, Hopkins argues that her motion for spoliation is still pending, but the district court denied her motion before dismissing the complaint. Fourth, Hopkins argues that two district court judges violated ethical rules by participating in the case, but both judges recused before Hopkins filed her third amended complaint. Fifth, Hopkins accuses a magistrate judge of judicial misconduct, but we will not consider an issue that she failed to raise below and argues for the first time in her reply brief. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AJPT\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Hopkins\u2019s third amended complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
