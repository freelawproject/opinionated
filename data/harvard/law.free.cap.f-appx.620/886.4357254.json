No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). We construe liberally pro <em>se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-24\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission later lowered and (2) a reduction is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is inconsistent with the guidelines\u2019 policy statements if the guidelines amendment does not lower. the defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the guideline range determined based on a defendant\u2019s offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>level and criminal history category <em>before </em>the application of departures or variances. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The district court lacked the authority to reduce Mathis\u2019s sentence, pursuant to section 3582(c)(2), because Mathis\u2019s applicable guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 782. Although retroactive application of Amendment 782 would reduce Mathis\u2019s base offense level from 24 to 22, Mathis\u2019s adjusted offense level would still be 34 based on the operation of the career-offender guideline in section 4B1.1. Thus, Mathis\u2019s applicable guideline range remains unchanged. The district court committed no error in concluding that Mathis is ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">On appeal, Mathis argues, for the first time, that the commentary to section 1B1.10 (defining the term \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d) violates the Equal Protection Clause and is inconsistent with section 1B1.10 and with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s statutory authority. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir.2005). Because Mathis has identified no controlling precedent from the Supreme Court or from this Court establishing that the commentary violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is otherwise inconsistent with the guidelines, his argument fails: error, if any, is not plain. <em>See Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1917-18, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993); <em>United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 822 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-26\"> Mathis also argues on appeal that the district court erred in classifying him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument in this section 3582(c)(2) appeal. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (in section 3582(c) proceedings, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider collateral attacks on a sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
