This court has jurisdiction of her appeal only if she has exhausted her claim before the Railroad Retirement Board. She has failed to do so and this court must dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">She presented her claim in 2009 and it was denied and reconsidered but denied again by the Bureau of Hearings and- Appeals on November 23, 2009. In response, to her letter that she disagreed, the Agency informed her that an appeal had to be filed on HA-1 form before January 22, 2010. The form was enclosed in a return envelope. But she failed to file the appeal until June 28, 2013. Having no final decision by the three-member Board, this court has no jurisdiction to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A5r\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
