(\u2018Winn-Dixie\u201d) in his employment discrimination action brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h). On appeal, Reynolds argues that the district court erred by finding that Reynolds failed to establish prima facie cases of gender discrimination under Title VII and retaliation under the FCA. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">A. Reynolds\u2019s Concerns About Possible False Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Plaintiff Reynolds worked as a pharmacist in a Winn-Dixie store in Columbus, Georgia. Reynolds worked with Georgia Todd, a female pharmacist. Todd was the pharmacist in charge, meaning she oversaw pharmacy operations and personnel, but she did not discipline or terminate other pharmacists. Instead, the pharmacy district manager, Chad Brabston, was the immediate supervisor for both Plaintiff Reynolds and Todd.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Plaintiff Reynolds became concerned about the way Todd handled some pharmacy tasks, such as performing \u201cpartial fills\u201d of prescriptions, billing for medications purchased using Winn-Dixie\u2019s prescription card, returning patients\u2019 prescriptions to stock, and obtaining credit from vendors for medications already billed. Plaintiff Reynolds told Todd and their pharmacy technician about his concerns and warned Todd that her actions could result in a false claim. Reynolds, however, did not report his concerns to anyone else. Plaintiff Reynolds did not file a complaint or lawsuit with the government about any of his false-claims concerns because he wanted to correct the problems internally.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">A few weeks before the events giving rise to this lawsuit, Plaintiff Reynolds reported to his supervisor Brabston that he had discovered some missing Xanax pills. After conducting recounts and examining documents, Brabston and Todd concluded some of the Xanax was double-counted, and there was no discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">B. Reynolds\u2019s \u201cBackdating\u201d of a Prescription for Medicaid Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">On January 14, 2013, the sister of a pharmacy customer came to fill a prescription for her brother, referred to as C.J. On December 30, 2012, C.J. had undergone hip replacement surgery and was prescribed five post-operative medications, including Lovenox injections and Furosem-ide tablets. The written prescription for the five medications was dated January 14, 2013, and was signed by a nurse practitioner at C.J.\u2019s post-operative rehabilitation center. C.J. was discharged from the rehabilitation center on January 13, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Todd, rather than Plaintiff Reynolds, was on duty on January 14, 2013. Todd entered the prescription, dated January 14, 2013, into the pharmacy\u2019s computer system and learned that CJ.\u2019s Medicaid coverage had expired at the end of December 2012. Because C.J.\u2019s sister could not pay for the medications, especially the most expensive medication Lovenox, she left without receiving them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">The next day, Plaintiff Reynolds was the pharmacist on duty and received a phone call from C.J.\u2019s sister about the medications. C.J. was a long-term customer of Plaintiff Reynolds. After investigating, Plaintiff Reynolds understood what Todd had done (i.e., entered the January 14, 2013 date of the hard copy prescription). But Reynolds thought that C.J.\u2019s medications would be covered by Medicaid and could be entered into the computer system with the surgery date of December 30, 2012, because the doctor\u2019s surgical plan for the hip surgery would have included an order for post-op medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Plaintiff Reynolds made a notation by circling the surgery date of December 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>2012 that appeared on the hospital label at the top of the written prescription and writing the words \u201chip replacement\u201d next to it, which he thought was sufficient. To be thorough, however, Reynolds also called the doctor\u2019s office to request that the hip surgeon send documentation for the Love-nox \u201cthat was written in December from the surgical planning\u201d that reflected the surgeon\u2019s \u201corder for all incidentals required for the surgery.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reynolds did not believe his request was improper because a prescription is made when the doctor orders it (i.e., back on December 30, 2012), even if it is reduced to writing at a later date (i.e., on January 14, 2013). The surgeon\u2019s office advised Reynolds that C.J. had a follow-up appointment the next day,' and the surgeon would give C.J. a new hard copy of a prescription for Lovenox with a December 30, 2012 date.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Expecting the surgeon to provide the documentation, Reynolds re-entered the prescription into the computer, using the December 30, 2012 date for only the Love-nox and the Furosemide. This process adjudicated the claim through Medicaid and generated labels for the medications. Reynolds filled some of the medications in the prescription, including the Furosemide. The pharmacy, however, did not have Lo-venox in stock, so Reynolds ordered it for delivery the following day. Plaintiff Reynolds placed the Lovenox label in an \u201cowe\u201d basket for Todd to complete and dispense to C.J.\u2019s sister the next day. Because Plaintiff Reynolds was very busy, he did not have time to leave a note for Todd about what had happened with C.J.\u2019s prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The next day, Todd was on duty when C.J.\u2019s sister returned to pick up the medications. Todd finished filling the prescription, including dispensing the Lovenox, without examining the paperwork or obtaining the updated prescription, and gave the medications to C.J.\u2019s sister. Although Todd did not recall dispensing the medication, she admitted that she may have given the medication thinking it was part of an \u201cowe,\u201d and thus she would not have looked at the original prescription. Afterward, however, Todd examined the paperwork and concluded that Plaintiff Reynolds\u2019s \u201cbackdating\u201d of C.J.\u2019s prescription in the computer system to the surgery date in December 2012 was not .acceptable pharmacy practice and perhaps Medicaid fraud. For this reason, on January 18, Todd reported Plaintiff Reynolds\u2019s handling of C.J.\u2019s medications to their supervisor Brabston.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">C. Reynolds\u2019s Suspension and Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Brabston, who is not a pharmacist, forwarded Todd\u2019s report and supporting documentation to Winn-Dixie officials John Fegan and B.J. Cobb, who were pharmacists, and Bill Bandy, Brabston\u2019s direct supervisor. Either Bandy or Cobb instructed Brabston to suspend Plaintiff Reynolds and obtain a statement from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">On January 24, Brabston met with Todd and Plaintiff Reynolds to gather the facts, obtained Reynolds\u2019s written statement, and informed Reynolds he was suspended. During the meeting, Brabston asked Plaintiff Reynolds to handwrite a statement simply admitting to backdating C.J.\u2019s prescription by adjudicating it with Medicaid using the December 30, 2012 date. Reynolds refused and instead prepared a typewritten statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Reynolds\u2019s typewritten statement explained what happened from Reynolds\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>perspective. Reynolds believed C.J.\u2019s prescription \u201ccould legally have a service date of December 2012, incident to the surgery.\u201d Brabston forwarded Reynolds\u2019s statement to Fegan, Cobb, and Bandy, who were investigating the report. Brab-ston also coached Todd about the need to double check a prescription started by another pharmacist, but other than this warning, Todd was not disciplined for dispensing C.J.\u2019s medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">While on suspension, Plaintiff Reynolds obtained a hard copy of the \u201cupdated\u201d prescription for Lovenox from C.J.\u2019s hip surgeon with a December 30, 2012 date, which Reynolds forwarded to Todd. Todd gave the updated prescription to Brabston, who forwarded the document to Cobb on January 28. In addition, Plaintiff Reynolds complained to Brabston that he (Brabston) favored Todd by paying more attention to her and failing to \u201cdevelop [Reynolds] as a Winn-Dixie employee\u201d by coming to observe and evaluate Reynolds at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On January 25, 2013, Plaintiff Reynolds sent a \u201cfollow-up statement\u201d to Brabston further defending his actions. Reynolds pointed out that under Georgia law, a pharmacy may use records of a doctor\u2019s drug orders \u201ctransmitted by any means of communication for purposes of validating the pharmacy record\u201d and that no fraud claim was \u201csubject to criminal penalties without <em>proof of intent </em>to commit fraud.\u201d Reynolds further stated that \u201cthe publicly posted best practices from UW Physicians regarding dates of service [was], \u2018... if assigning the completion date as the date for any service will cause problems for reimbursement, the start date may be used instead.\u2019 \u201d Brabston forwarded Plaintiff Reynolds\u2019s follow-up statement to Fe-gan, Cobb, and Bandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">On January 28, 2013, Plaintiff Reynolds also sent an email directly to Fegan and Cobb, requesting a peer review by a pharmacist because Brabston was not a pharmacist. Reynolds attached both of his pri- or statements, again explained his view of the situation, and expressed consternation that he was the only one suspended when Todd was the pharmacist who ultimately dispensed the medication to C.J.\u2019s sister without collecting the updated December 30, 2012 prescription written by the hip surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">D. Reynolds\u2019s Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">On January 28, 2013, Fegan, Cobb, Bandy, and Victoria Wellstead in Winn-Dixie\u2019s legal department made the joint decision to terminate Reynolds. The reason for terminating Reynolds was his \u201cbackdating\u201d of C.J.\u2019s prescription in the pharmacy\u2019s computer system. In an email, Cobb instructed Brabston to explain to Plaintiff Reynolds that Winn-Dixie \u201cbelieve[d] that fraud was intended\u201d because the only medication filled using the December 30, 2012 surgery date was the expensive Lovenox in the middle of the sequence of medications and that the other medications were filled with the January 15, 2013 date. Cobb stated that he had \u201cdiscussed this with Medicaid and [Winn-Dixie is] responsible for reimbursing the cost of this prescription due to this infraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Brabston was not involved in the termination decision, except to inform Plaintiff Reynolds of the outcome. Likewise, while Todd made the initial report to Brabston, Todd was not involved in the decision to terminate Plaintiff Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">A. Gender Discrimination Under Title VII</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">When, as here, a Title VII plaintiffs employment discrimination claim is based on circumstantial evidence, courts apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the burden-shifting framework set out in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Kidd v. Mando Am. Corp., </em>731 F.3d 1196, 1202 (11th Cir.2013). Under this framework, the plaintiff must first set out a prima facie case of disparate treatment by showing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he held; (3) he was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his class more, favorably. <em>Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">If the plaintiff presents evidence of a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). If the defendant satisfies this burden, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the articulated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Here, the district court concluded that Reynolds failed to establish the fourth prong of his prima facie case. Generally, when a plaintiff alleges discriminatory discipline, the plaintiff must show that the employer disciplined the similarly situated employee differently, and to be considered similarly situated, the comparator employee must have been \u201c \u2018involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1326 n. 17 (quoting <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997)). This Court\u2019s \u201csame or similar conduct\u201d standard is high, requiring that \u201cthe quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>71 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999)). .</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The district court correctly found that Todd was not a sufficient comparator to establish the fourth prong of Reynolds\u2019s prima facie case. First, Reynolds and Todd did not engage in \u201cnearly identical\u201d misconduct. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Reynolds, shows that Reynolds believed that Medicaid would cover all incidentals related to surgery performed during the coverage period. Based on this belief, Reynolds changed the date of C.J'.\u2019s prescription in the pharmacy\u2019s computer system from January 14, 2013 to December 30, 2012 to ensure coverage. Once the Medicaid claim was adjudicated, Reynolds then printed labels for the medications, ordered the out-of-stock medication, and left the task of dispensing the medications to C.J.\u2019s sister for Todd to complete the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Todd, on the other hand, simply finished what Reynolds had started and handed the medications to C.J.\u2019s sister without realizing what Reynolds had done. Arguably, Todd should have been more aware of the prescription, given that two days earlier she had told C.J.\u2019s sister that the medications were not covered by Medicaid. Nonetheless, Todd\u2019s dispensing medication for which coverage has already been adjudicated ' (as evidenced by the printed labels) and Reynolds\u2019s changing the date of the prescription in the computer system to ensure coverage are not the same conduct. Reynolds\u2019s assertions that Todd was equally culpable are unavailing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Also unavailing is Reynolds\u2019s argument that he, unlike Todd, did not actually engage in any misconduct at all. The question is not whether Reynolds\u2019s conduct was in fact wrong, but whether WinnDixie in good faith believed that it was wrong. <em>See Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1266 (stating that the \u201cquestion is whether her employers were dissatisfied with her for ... non-discriminatory reasons, even if mistakenly or unfairly so\u201d); <em>Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir.1991) (limiting the inquiry to whether the employer believed the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct and if so, whether that was the reason behind the discharge and concluding that whether the employee actually engaged in the misconduct is irrelevant). Accordingly, even if Winn-Dixie wrongly believed that Reynolds\u2019s handling of the prescription constituted misconduct, the district court properly found that Reynolds did not satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Winn-Dixie on Reynolds\u2019s Title VII gender discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">B. Retaliation Under the FCA</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The F'CA\u2019s whistleblower provision provides relief to an employee who was \u201cdischarged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms or conditions of employment <em>because of </em>lawful acts done by the employee ... in furtherance of an action under this section or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of [the FCA].\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h)(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, protection under this provision requires a showing that the plaintiff was engaged in protected conduct and that the employer retaliated against him \u201cbecause of\u2019 that protected conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">The district court concluded that Reynolds\u2019s evidence created a genuine factual dispute as to whether he engaged in protected activity when he raised concerns with Todd about possible false claims,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but Reynolds did not present evidence showing a causal connection between his protected activity and his termination. On appeal, the parties continue to dispute whether Reynolds\u2019s conversations with Todd constituted protected activity. We need not resolve this issue, however, because even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Reynolds engaged in protected conduct, we agree with the district court that Reynolds did not present evidence from which a jury reasonably could find that Reynolds\u2019s suspension and termination were \u201cbecause of\u2019 that protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>To establish the necessary causal connection under \u00a7 3730(h)(1), the plaintiff must show that the employer was at least aware of the protected activity. <em>See U.S. ex rel. Sanchez v. Lymphatx, Inc., </em>596 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that the plaintiffs allegations in her complaint that she complained to her employer about unlawful actions that would incur significant civil and criminal hability were sufficient, if proven, \u201cto support a reasonable conclusion that the defendants were aware of the possibility of litigation under the False Claims Act\u201d); <em>see also U.S. ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard Univ., </em>153 F.3d 731, 736 (D.C.Cir.1998) (stating that the \u201cbecause of\u2019 language in \u00a7 3730(h)(1) requires the employee to prove that the employer had knowledge of the protected activity and was motivated to retaliate, at least in part, by the protected activity); <em>Zahodnick v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>135 F.3d 911, 914 (4th Cir.1997) (stating that the plaintiff must present evidence that the employer was aware of the protected activity to show the requisite causal connection).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Here, Reynolds failed to establish causation because he did not present any evidence that the decision makers \u2014 Cobb, Bandy, and Fegan \u2014 knew that Reynolds had spoken to Todd about potential false claims. In fact, Reynolds admitted he only talked with Todd and their pharmacy technician about his concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Reynolds cannot avoid this result by relying upon a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory. This Court has not yet applied the cat\u2019s paw theory in an FCA retaliation case. Furthermore, this Court has indicated that while the theory may be appropriate in cases in which the plaintiff is required to prove only that the protected characteristic was a motivating factor, such as in Title VII disparate treatment claims, the theory is inappropriate when the statute requires \u201cbut-for\u201d causation. <em>See Sims v. MVM, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 1327, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2013) (concluding that \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d liability does not apply to Age Discrimination in Employment Act retaliation claims). Nonetheless, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the cat\u2019s paw theory applies to FCA retaliation claims, Reynolds did not present evidence to support the theory in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In other employment contexts, discriminatory animus may be imputed to a neutral decision maker under a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory if: (1) a supervisor performed an act motivated by animus that was intended to cause an adverse employment action; and (2) the act was a proximate cause of the adverse employment action. <em>See Staub v. Proctor Hosp., </em>562 U.S. 411, 422, 131 S.Ct. 1186, 1194, 179 L.Ed.2d 144 (2011). A plaintiff may establish causation under this theory if the decision maker either followed another supervisor\u2019s biased l-ecommendation without independently investigating the complaint or conducted an independent investigation but relied on facts provided by the biased supervisor. <em>See id. </em>at 420-21, 131 S.Ct. at 1193; <em>Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Reynolds contends that Todd may have had a retaliatory motive. In the district court, however, Reynolds offered nothing but his own conjecture that Todd was retaliating against him. Moreover, Reynolds did not present any evidence that Todd had any input in the decision to suspend and then terminate him. To the contrary, the undisputed evidence is that Todd played no role in the employment decisions except to initially report Reynolds\u2019s \u201cbackdating\u201d of the prescription to Brabston. Brabston then gathered the facts and documents, including multiple statements from Reynolds. Brabston then forwarded the evidence to Cobb, Bandy, and Fegan, who reviewed it and made their own decision. Furthermore, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>statements, Reynolds admitted changing the January 14, 2013 date of C.J.\u2019s prescription in the computer system to December 30, 2012. Even if the decision makers wrongly believed Reynolds\u2019s conduct was either illegal or unprofessional, Reynolds\u2019s own admission to the conduct supports their independent determination that Reynolds should be discharged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Winn-Dixie on Reynolds\u2019s Title VII. gender discrimination and FCA retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-14\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to. the non-moving party. <em>Owen v. I.C. Sys., Inc., </em>629 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-14\">. The retail cost of the Lovenox was apparently $494.34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\">. Reynolds explained that he was most concerned about the Lovenox because it was a very expensive drug and also important for post-op recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">. In the district court, Reynolds alternatively argued that, even if Todd was not a proper comparator, he could still prevail on his Title VII gender discrimination claim because he presented \u201ca convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence\u201d from which a jury could infer intentional discrimination. <em>See Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328. The district court rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>this argument. On appeal, Reynolds does not advance this alternative \"convincing mosaic\u201d argument with respect to his Title VII gender discrimination claim. Thus, we do not address it. See <em>Holland v. Gee, </em>677 F.3d 1047, 1066 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that issues not briefed before this Court are deemed abandoned and are not addressed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\">. Because we affirm the district court's ruling that Reynolds failed to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, we need not address Reynolds\u2019s argument that he presented evidence that Winn-Dixie\u2019s reason for terminating him was pretext,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\">. On appeal, Reynolds does not challenge the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment on his Title VII retaliation claim, and thus has abandoned it. <em>See Holland, </em>677 F.3d at 1066. Reynolds does, however, still argue his FCA retaliation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\">. We decline to address Reynolds\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in this Court and only in his reply brief, that the relevant statute is the Georgia False Claims Act rather than the FCA. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., 385 F.3d </em>1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-15\">. The district court concluded, however, that Reynolds\u2019s report to Brabston about the missing Xanax was not protected activity under the FCA. Reynolds does not challenge this ruling on appeal, and we do not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b805-16\">. Reynolds also contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to compel discovery related to his FCA claim. We conclude, however, that Reynolds waived this issue for appellate purposes by responding to the summary judgment motion on the merits rather than accepting the district court's invitation to explain why he needed additional discovery as to his FCA claim. In any event, there was no abuse of discretion because none of the evidence Reynolds sought would have shown that the decision makers knew of Reynolds's protected FCA activities or that Todd manipulated the decision makers into terminating Reynolds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
