Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Before Stokes was served with Denton\u2019s complaint, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed it without prejudice for fading to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (requiring district courts to screen civil actions filed by prisoners against government officers). Denton appeals that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">We take the allegations in Denton\u2019s complaint as true. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1251-52 (11th Cir.2008). A federal bank robbery investigation led to Den-ton\u2019s convictions for armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). After the investigation had begun but before his convictions, he was incarcerated in the county jail for a probation violation. During that incarceration, Stokes seized Denton\u2019s nonlegal correspondence, photocopied it, and showed the copies to Denton\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and his son. The correspondence included letters to women other than Denton\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and letters that made unflattering comments about his son. According to Denton, Stokes hoped the letters would encourage them to testify for the government at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Denton\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim against Stokes. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). Construing the complaint liberally, <em>see Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006), it sought damages from Stokes in both his official and individual capacities. By seeking official capacity damages, Denton is actually seeking to impose liability on Stokes\u2019 employer, the FBI, for Stokes\u2019 allegedly unconstitutional actions. <em>See Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). The <em>Bivens </em>theory of liability does not allow Denton to recover damages from the FBI. <em>Dalrymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 995 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 70, 122 S.Ct. 515, 521, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001) (\u201c[T]he threat of suit against an individual\u2019s employer was not the kind of deterrence contemplated by <em>Bivens.\u201d). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Denton may seek damages against Stokes only in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Such damages \u00e1re available as a general matter, but Denton must overcome qualified immunity to get them. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(2) (requiring dismissal of prisoner complaints that \u201cseek[ ] monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief\u2019); <em>Wilson v. Blankenship, </em>163 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.1998) (applying our qualified immunity precedent under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and <em>Bivens </em>interchangeably). He may receive damages only if he can show that Stokes violated clearly established Fourth Amendment law by seizing Denton\u2019s nonlegal correspondence, photocopying it, and disclosing the copies to third parties as part of the ongoing federal investigation. Otherwise, Stokes is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Coffin v. Brandau, </em>642 F.3d 999, 1013 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">At the time that Stokes seized, photocopied, and disclosed Denton\u2019s nonlegal correspondence, it was not clearly established that doing so violated the Fourth Amendment. We had held that both the Sixth Amendment and the \u201cright of access to the courts\u201d limit the reading of correspondence from inmates with their attorneys. <em>See Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>532 F.2d 462, 472-75 (5th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We had also held that the First Amendment limits efforts to control of the volume of nonlegal, \u201cgeneral correspondence\u201d that inmates send and receive. <em>Guajardo v. Estelle, </em>580 F.2d 748, 753-56 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But we had not held (and still have not held) that the Fourth Amendment bars the reading, photocopying, and disclosing of inmates\u2019 nonlegal correspondence as part of an ongoing investigation. There are some indications that it may not. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 526, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3200, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (\u201cThe recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in their individual cells simply cannot be reconciled with the concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of penal institutions.\u201d); Gas<em>sler v. Wood, </em>14 F.3d 406, 408-10 (8th Cir.1994) (finding no First Amendment violation where prison officials seized a prisoner\u2019s nonlegal correspondence, photocopied it, and disclosed the copies to law enforcement as part of an ongoing investigation); <em>cf. United States v. Wilson, </em>671 F.2d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.1982) (distinguishing <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Guajardo </em>because neither case involved the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">In any event, we need -not decide the merits of Denton\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim to resolve this appeal, so we express no view on it. It is enough that no precedent of the Supreme Court or this Court would have put Stokes on notice that the Fourth Amendment prohibited him from seizing Denton\u2019s nonlegal correspondence while he was incarcerated, photocopying it, and showing those copies to others as part of an ongoing investigation. <em>See Coffin, </em>642 F.3d at 1013. That being the case, Stokes is entitled to qualified immunity from Denton\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\">. Denton\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim is the only one that he has properly raised on appeal. He raised several other constitutional claims in the district court, but he has expressly abandoned those claims. Additionally, he attempts to add a First Amendment claim, but we do not consider it because he did not raise it before the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\">. Both <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Guajardo </em>are still the law of this Circuit, but we have read them in light of more recent Supreme Court decisions. <em>See Al-Amin v. Smith, </em>511 F.3d 1317, 1330-32 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b726-13\">.Although \u00a7 1915A(b)(2) required dismissal of Denton\u2019s complaint, he still had a right to amend it under Federal Rule of Civil Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>dure 15. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2004). He does not argue on appeal that the district court should have granted him leave to amend his complaint, so we do not consider that argument. <em>See Tim-son v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
