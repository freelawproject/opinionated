After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-27\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b743-28\">In 2009, Defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. In the plea agreement, Defendant and the Government agreed that Defendant\u2019s offense involved at least 50 grams, but less than 150 grams, of cocaine base, and at least 500 grams, but less than 2 kilograms, of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">After he entered his guilty plea, the probation office prepared Defendant\u2019s Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR indicated that Defendant was a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, because he had one prior conviction for a crime of violence and three prior convictions for controlled substance offenses. Because the statutory maximum penalty for the present offense was life imprisonment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s career offender status resulted in an offense level of 87. The PSR then applied a three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), yielding a total offense level of 34. Defendant qualified for a criminal history category of VI, based on both his numerous criminal convictions and on his career offender criminal status. With a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Defendant\u2019s objection to the career offender enhancement, but nonetheless varied downward and sentenced him to 216 months\u2019 imprisonment. In January 2012, Defendant moved for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which amendment had retroactively reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. App. C (Nov. 2011), Amend. 750, 759. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, finding that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction because his offense level had been dictated by his status as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not by the quantity of drugs attributed to him. Accordingly, Amendment 750, which operated only to reduce an offense level calculated based on drug quantity, had no effect on Defendant\u2019s Guidelines\u2019 calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">In November 2014, Defendant moved for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Defendant argued that the district court was free to disagree with the application of the career offender guideline to his case and had the full discretion to reduce his sentence by whatever amount it deemed appropriate. The district court deni\u00e9d Defendant\u2019s motion ruling again that, as a career offender, Defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Defendant now appeals from that decision, arguing that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 759, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because the definition \u25a0 of \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d completely eliminates his ability to obtain a sentence reduction and because the district court erred by treating the \u00a7 1B1.10 policy statements as binding authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2013). We are bound by the opinion of a prior panel unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc overrules that opinion. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). . To be eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). A defendant is not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). The defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the guideline range that exists before any departure or variances have been applied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). The application of \u00a7 1B1.10 does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause so long as the effect of the post-conduct Guidelines amendment does not increase the defendant\u2019s punishment beyond what it would have been without the amendment. <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Amendment 782, which is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d) and which became effective November 1, 2014, reduced by two levels the base offense level for most drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 782 (2014). Amendment 782 did not make any changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., Amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under the Drug Quantity Table set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which like Amendment 782, lowered the \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) base offense levels for certain quantities of-'crack cocaine. 541 F.3d at 1325. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their applicable guideline ranges, which had been calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1 <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330. Likewise, in <em>Lawson, </em>we concluded that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent and that Amendment 750 did not lower the guideline range for career offenders. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Based on our precedent, the district court did not err here when it denied Defendant\u2019s motion 'for a sentence reduction. To recap, Defendant\u2019s total offense level and applicable guideline range were not based on the drug quantity offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, but instead were based on the career offender level in \u00a7 4B1.1. Because his guideline range was not based on the drug quantity guidelines, Amendment 782 did not lower the sentencing range upon which Defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Defendant\u2019s challenges to \u00a7 1B1.10 are unavailing. His claim that \u00a7 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 759, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause is foreclosed by our precedent. Section 3582(c)(2) explicitly incorporates applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, and we have previously rejected the argument that the amendments to \u00a7 1B1.10 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-59. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Like <em>Colon, </em>the effect of Amendments 759 and 782 do not increase Defendant\u2019s range of punishment above what it was at the time he committed his crime. <em>See Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-59. Defendant\u2019s argument that the policy statements in \u00a7 1B1.10 are not binding authority in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is likewise foreclosed by precedent. The Supreme Court has concluded that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not require a district court to treat \u00a7 1B1.10 as nonbinding, and we have previously relied on that Supreme Court precedent to indicate that \u00a7 1B1.10 is binding in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United </em>States, 560 U.S. 817, 821, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 538 n. 11 (11th Cir.2013). Accordingly, the district court committed no error by complying with \u00a7 1B1.10 when denying Defendant\u2019s motion, and we affirm the denial of Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\">. Had Defendant not been a career offender, the PSR indicated that Defendant's base offense level would have been 30, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) &amp; 2D1.1, comment. (n. 10(D)(0), and that Defendant would have been subject to a three-level manager or supervisor enhancement, yielding an adjusted offense level of 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\">.
