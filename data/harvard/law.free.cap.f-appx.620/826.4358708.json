The district court denied Sudderth\u2019s and granted First Mercury\u2019s. This is Sudderth\u2019s appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and view the evidence in the light most favorable to Sudderth. <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Nw. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1334 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Sudderth\u2019s right foot was injured as she and several friends were about to leave the Soho Grand, a nightclub in McDonough, Georgia. She and one of her friends were at the bar paying their tabs when they heard a noise from behind them. According to Sudderth\u2019s deposition testimony, she turned around just in time to see one of the bouncers, Eric Perkins, throw a chair. The next thing she remembers is falling to the floor because of an excruciating pain in her right foot. Sudderth\u2019s friends helped her leave the Soho Grand and sit on the sidewalk, where she waited until an ambulance arrived and took her to the hospital. She has suffered pain in her right foot and other problems since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">The depositions of other witnesses describe the incident in greater detail. Sud-derth\u2019s friend remembered hearing a noise and then turning to see Perkins set a chair in motion. Although the friend could not remember whether the chair was \u201ckicked or thrown or pushed, [or] knocked,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she testified that Perkins moved the chair while he was \u201cpulling a guy out\u201d of the Soho Grand who \u201cwas drunk and causing a scene.\u201d R. at 646-47. That \u201cguy\u201d was Marcus Majano.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">Neither Perkins nor Majano were deposed, but two other security guards were. One of them, a second bouncer, was inside the Soho Grand with Perkins. The second bouncer testified that \u201cPerkins had to grab [Majano] physically and get [him] out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. He remembers Perkins putting Majano in a \u201cbearhug\u201d and \u201cdragging\u201d Majano across the dance floor. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 701. The last thing the second bouncer saw was Majano going \u201climp\u201d and \u201ckind of calm[ing] down\u201d as Perkins dragged him towards the door and out of sight. <em>Id. </em>at 701. The other security-guard who was deposed, an off-duty police officer, was standing outside the Soho Grand during the incident. He testified that he opened the front door to see \u201cPerkins carrying Majano\u201d \u2014 who was at this point \u201ckicking and flailing\u201d \u2014 \u201cout from the bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666. As Perkins dragged Majano out of the bar, a second man attacked Perkins, and the off-duty officer had to physically restrain the second man. The off-duty officer then arrested both Majano and the second man.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">After the incident, Sudderth filed a lawsuit in Georgia state court to recover for the injuries to her right foot caused by the chair that Perkins threw. In that lawsuit she sought to hold Perkins and several other defendants jointly and severally liable for her injuries. First Mercury defended the state court lawsuit according to the terms of the general liability insurance policy that it had issued to the Soho Grand. While the state court lawsuit was pending, First Mercury filed this declaratory judgment action in the district court, in which it asked the court to construe the Soho Grand\u2019s insurance policy. The parties then settled the state court lawsuit and made its outcome contingent on the outcome of this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The insurance policy at the center of this action provides coverage to the Soho Grand for \u201cbodily injury\u201d claims up to a \u201cgeneral aggregate limit\u201d of $2 million. But the policy also contains an \u201cAssault '&amp; Battery Coverage Endorsement.\u201d The assault and battery endorsement lowers the coverage limit to $100,000 for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">Claims or suits to recover damages for bodily injury or property damage based upon, related to, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, in any way connected to, or in the sequence of events involving any actual or alleged assault and/or battery, as those terms are defined herein....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3J6\">R. at 72 (emphasis and quotation marks omitted). It then defines a \u201cbattery\u201d as \u201ca harmful or offensive contact by a person or thing, or a harmful or offensive contact between or among two or more persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">In the district court, First Mercury and Sudderth stipulated that this case presents only one question: Does the assault and battery endorsement apply to Sudderth\u2019s claim? First Mercury contends that it does, and Sudderth contends that it does not. They each filed motions for summary judgment. The district court agreed with First Mercury and entered an order granting its motion for summary judgment and denying Sudderth\u2019s. She appeals that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Sudderth contends that the assault and battery endorsement does not apply to her claim for the injuries she suffered during Perkins\u2019 removal of Majano from the Soho Grand. She is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">The record shows that Perkins committed a battery \u2014 as defined by the assault and battery endorsement in the Soho Grand\u2019s insurance policy \u2014 on Majano. The endorsement defines a \u201cbattery\u201d as \u201ca harmful or offensive contact between or among two or more persons.\u201d Sudderth concedes that there was \u201ccontact\u201d between Perkins and Majano; she disputes that it was \u201charmful or offensive.\u201d Perkins forcibly removed Majano from the Soho Grand. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>He placed Majano in a \u201cbearhug.\u201d And as he \u201cdraggled]\u201d Majano out the front door, Majano began \u201ckicking and flailing.\u201d Then another man attacked Perkins. An off-duty police officer had to help Perkins physically restrain both Majano and the other man. In Georgia, \u201ceven minimal touching\u201d can support a cause of action for battery. <em>Darnell v. Houston Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>234 Ga.App. 488, 506 S.E.2d 385, 388 (1998); <em>see Jarrett v. Butts, </em>190 Ga.App. 703, 379 S.E.2d 583, 585-86 (1989) (holding that \u201ctouch[ing the] wrists and hair\u201d of a student to pose her for a picture at a school dance could constitute a battery). Perkins\u2019 touching of Majano was nothing if not \u201cminimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Sudderth disputes none of that. Instead, she argues that the record contains no evidence that Majano himself found his contact with Perkins to be offensive. But she misunderstands the objective nature of the offensiveness inquiry. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 19 (1965) (\u201cA bodily contact is offensive if it offends a <em>reasonable </em>sense of personal dignity.\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>cited with approval by Vasquez v. Smith, </em>259 Ga.App. 79, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2003). In other words, the question is not whether Majano in fact found his contact with Perkins to be offensive, but instead whether a reasonable person would have done so. <em>See Lawson v. Bloodsworth, </em>313 Ga.App. 616, 722 S.E.2d 358, 359-60 (2012) (\u201cThe test is what would be offensive to an ordinary person not unduly sensitive as to his dignity.\u201d). A reasonable person would find it offensive to be placed in a bearhug and dragged out of a nightclub.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Despite that, Sudderth argues that Perkins did not commit a battery because Majano \u201cwas submitting\u201d to being removed from the bar. She never uses the word \u201cconsent,\u201d but her argument seems to be that Perkins\u2019 removal of Majano could not have been a battery because Majano consented to it. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7' 51-11-2 (\u201cAs a general rule no tort can be committed against a person consenting thereto-\u201d). She is right that another bouncer testified that he saw Majano go \u201climp\u201d and \u201ckind of calm down\u201d as Perkins dragged him towards the front door. She cites no Georgia law, however, for the proposition that going \u201climp\u201d during the commission of a battery amounts to consent to it. In any event, there is a bigger problem with her consent argument. The record shows that Majano did not start limp or calm and did not stay limp or calm. Just after Perkins dragged him out of the other bouncer\u2019s line of sight and into the line of sight of the off-duty police officer, Majano began kicking and flailing and was eventually physically restrained again.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">A reasonable person would have found it offensive to be forcibly removed from the Soho Grand in the manner that Perkins removed Majano, and there is no evidence that Majano consented to his removal. The contact between the two of them was therefore a battery within the meaning of the assault and battery endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">The endorsement applies to Sudderth\u2019s claim if the injuries she suffered were \u201cbased upon, related to, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, in any way connected to, or in the sequence of events involving\u201d Perkins\u2019 battery of Majano. While Perkins was removing Majano from the Soho Grand, Perkins threw a chair, which hit Sudderth and caused her injuries. To use the endorsement\u2019s language, she suffered those injuries \u201cin the sequence of events involving\u201d Perkins\u2019 removal of Majano, which was a battery. Because of that, the assault and battery endorsement applies to Sudderth\u2019s claim unless Georgia law prevents us from applying it as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Sudderth contends that if the text of the assault and battery endorsement applies to her claim, Georgia\u2019s rules for construing insurance contracts prevent us from applying it as written. She supports that contention with two arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">First, she argues that no reasonable layman would read the assault and battery endorsement to apply to her claim. <em>See York Ins. Co. v. Williams Seafood of Albany, Inc., </em>223 F.3d 1253, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2000) (describing the Georgia rule that the terms of an insurance policy mean \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the insured would understand them to mean\u201d and are \u201cread as a layman would read\u201d them) (quotation marks omitted). Recall\u2019 the endorsement\u2019s definition of a \u201cbattery\u201d: \u201ca harmful or offensive contact by a person or thing, or a harmful or offensive contact between or among two or more persons.\u201d Sudderth asserts that a reasonable layman would read that definition and understand that it defines a battery as \u201ca violent act that intentionally causes substantial harm.\u201d The problem with her assertion is that it is inconsistent with the endorsement\u2019s unambiguous definition of battery. <em>See Furgerson v. Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>237 Ga.App. 637, 516 S.E.2d 350, 352 (1999) (\u201cPolicy terms cannot be ignored or rewritten to provide coverage where there is none.\u201d); <em>Burnette v. Ga. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., </em>190 Ga.App. 485, 379 S.E.2d 188, 189 (1989) (\u201cCourts have no more right by strained construction to make an insurance policy more beneficial by extending the coverage contracted for than they would have to increase the amount of coverage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Second, Sudderth argues that applying the assault and battery endorsement as written- would violate Georgia\u2019s prohibition on \u201cillusory\u201d coverage in insurance policies, which is violated when a policy \u201cpurports] to offer coverage that inevitably will be defeated by one of the policy\u2019s exclusions.\u201d <em>Cynergy, LLC v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>706 F.3d 1321, 1327 (11th Cir.2013). Coverage in one part of an insurance policy is illusory when an exclusion in another part \u201ccompletely nullifies\u201d the coverage. <em>Id. </em>Exclusions that make coverage illusory are ineffectual. <em>See, e.g., Transp. Ins. Co. v. Piedmont Constr. Grp., LLC, </em>301 Ga.App. 17, 686 S.E.2d 824, 828 (2009); <em>see also Maxum Indent. Co. v. Jimenez, </em>318 Ga.App. 669, 734 S.E.2d 499, 505 (2012) (\u201cWhen the provisions of an insurance contract are repugnant to one another, the provision most favorable to the insured will be applied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">According to Sudderth, applying the definition of battery as written would completely nullify the policy\u2019s coverage for \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The assault and battery endorsement nullifies nothing, however. It applies only to claims connected with assault or battery, and it does not nullify all coverage of those claims but only reduces the amount of the coverage. Sud-derth\u2019s \u201cunhappiness that the [endorsement] is triggered by the undisputed facts underlying this particular case does not transform\u201d it into a violation of the prohibition against illusory coverage. <em>Cynergy, </em>706 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">For the reasons discussed, the district court properly granted summary judgment to First Mercury. Because of that holding, we do not address Sudderth\u2019s additional argument that the district court erred by denying her own motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\">. To the extent that this testimony contradicts Sudderth\u2019s own testimony that Perkins <em>threw </em>the chair, we must accept Sudderth\u2019s testimony and reject her friend's. Our duty to read the record in the light most favorable <em>to </em>Sud-derth does not include a \u201cduty to disbelieve' [her] sworn testimony.\u201d <em>Evans v. Stephens, </em>407 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc). Because Sudderth is the nonmoving party, we must accept her testimony even if other evidence in the record is \"more favorable on a factual issue than [her] own testimony.\u201d <em>Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, </em>683 F.3d 1283, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see id. </em>at 1296 n. 38 (discussing the \"good reason\u201d for this rule). Accepting Sudderth\u2019s testimony means that it is a fact for purposes of this appeal that Perkins threw the chair that hit her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
