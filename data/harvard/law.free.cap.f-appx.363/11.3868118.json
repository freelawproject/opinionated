On appeal, Walker argues that the district court erred in finding that he was proceeding <em>in forma pauperis. </em>He also argues that the court erred in determining that his complaint included a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that the court should have converted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) into motions for summary judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. He asserts that the court should have provided him with a jury trial and the opportunity to submit evidence in support of his claims. Walker further contends that the court violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by dismissing his complaint. Finally, Walker argues that the district court judge should have recused himself from consideration of his case due to his bias against Walker. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-17\">Walker, a resident of Thomasville, Georgia, filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint, naming the following defendants: (1) SunTrust Bank of Thomasville, Georgia (\u201cSunTrust\u201d); (2) Forrest Monroe, of Thomasville, Georgia; (3) Joseph Pogue, of Thomasville, Georgia; (4) Jean Pogue, of Thomasville, Georgia; (5) Cassandra Montgomery, of Thomas-ville, Georgia; (6) Everett Montgomery, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Thomasville, Georgia; (7) Mary Rolling, of Thomasville, Georgia; (8) the estate of Howard Brooks, located in Coolidge, Georgia; (9) the City of Thomasville, Georgia (\u201cThomasville\u201d); (10) the Thomas County Superior Court (\u201cSuperior Court\u201d); (11) the Magistrate Court of Thomas County (\u201cMagistrate Court\u201d); (12) the Tax Assessor\u2019s Office of Thomasville, Georgia (\u201cTax Assessor\u2019s Office\u201d); (18) the Humane Society of Thomas County (\u201cHumane Society\u201d); (14) the Department of Transportation, Atlanta, Georgia (\u201cGeorgia DOT\u201d); (15) Barbara Monroe, of Thomasville, Georgia; (16) Roosevelt Williams, of Thomasville, Georgia; (17) the Thomas County Federal Bank; (18) the Thomas County Sheriffs Department (\u201cSheriffs Department\u201d); (19) Latesha Bradley, of Valdosta, Georgia; (20) Judge Harry Jay Altman II, of the Superior Court; and (21) David Hutchings, Clerk of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In his complaint, Walker asserted that he was bringing claims for felony fraud, property fraud, embezzlement, falsified documents, fraudulent deeds, and bank fraud. Walker did not set forth the elements of these offenses, nor did he explain why the defendants were liable for these offenses. In addition, Walker alleged that \u201cThomasville City officials\u201d violated his due process rights. Specifically, Walker asserted that Thomasville officials permitted a third party to knock down houses and cut down trees on his property due to his African-American race. In his request for relief, Walker stated that he hoped to successfully prove his \u201ccriminal case\u201d and garner civil judgments compensating him and his family members for physical and emotional damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Walker attached a letter to his complaint. In this letter, Walker stated that he wished to bring criminal charges against Forrest and Barbara Monroe, Jean and Joseph Pogue, Cassandra and Everett Montgomery, and SunTrust for conspiring to defraud him and deprive him of his real property. He also asserted that he sought criminal charges related to the killing of animals on his property. Walker alleged that he had purchased Lots 102 and 129 of Thomas County\u2019s 13th district from William MeMath in 1976. First National Bank of Thomasville, which was now known as SunTrust, had financed the transaction. Despite the fact that Walker paid back the bank loan in full, the bank, together with Monroe, conspired to hide the property deed from Walker and deprive him of his rights as a property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Apart from asserting that Thomasville officials violated his constitutional rights by permitting third parties to knock down houses and cut down trees on his property, Walker did not assert that any particular defendant took a specific act that deprived him of his constitutional rights. Walker did not mention the following defendants in the body of the complaint: (1) Rolling; (2) Howard Brooks; (3) the Superior Court; (4) the Sheriffs Department; (5) the Magistrate Court; (6) the Tax Assessor\u2019s Office; (7) the Humane Society; (8) the Georgia DOT; (9) the Thomas County Federal Bank; (10) Bradley; (11) Altman; and (12) Hutchings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The docket entry for the filing of Walker\u2019s complaint indicates that he received a receipt for paying a filing fee of $350. The record does not indicate that Walker sought or received permission to proceed <em>informa pawperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The following defendants responded to Walker\u2019s complaint by filing motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6): (1) the Magistrate Court; (2) the Sheriffs Department; (3) the Tax Assessor\u2019s Office; (4) Hutchings; (5) the Thomas County Federal Savings and Loan Association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>(\u201cTCFSLA\u201d), which Walker had misidentified as the \u201cThomas County Federal Bank\u201d; (6) Thomasville; (7) Judge Altman; (8) the Superior Court; (9) the Georgia DOT; (10) the Humane Society; and (11) SunTrust. These defendants generally argued that Walker\u2019s complaint should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) because he failed to make a short and plain statement showing that he was entitled to relief, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Jean Pogue, Joseph Pogue, Cassandra Montgomery, and Everett Montgomery filed a <em>pro se </em>responsive pleading, in which they asserted that Walker\u2019s claims against them were too vague to permit them to properly answer the complaint. The Po-gues and the Montgomerys did not, however, indicate that they were seeking dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Walker responded to the above defendants\u2019 motions by generally reasserting his contention that they were liable to him for fraud or, in the case of Thomasville, for the violation of his constitutional rights. In each of his responses to the motions for dismissal, Walker requested that the court convert these motions into motions for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. In addition, he asserted that the court should provide him with the opportunity to submit evidence in support of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The Monroes, Bradley, Rolling, Williams, and the estate of Howard Brooks did not file responses to Walker\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The district court entered an order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The court found that Walker had failed to make specific allegations against: (1) the Magistrate Court; (2) the Sheriffs Department; (3) the Tax Assessor\u2019s Office; (4) TCFSLA; (5) Hutchings; (6) the Humane Society; (7) Judge Altman; (8) the Superior Court; and (9) the Georgia DOT. Accordingly, the court determined that Walker\u2019s claims against these defendants did not satisfy the pleading requirements set forth in Rule 8(a)(2), and dismissed his complaint as to these defendants under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Addressing the claims against Thomas-ville, the court determined that, construing the complaint liberally, Walker\u2019s claims against the city were brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The court noted that \u201cmunicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 exists only when a municipal policy, practice, or the decision of a final municipal policy maker caused the deprivation of [the] plaintiffs federally protected right.\u201d The court determined that Walker\u2019s \u201cvague and conclusory allegations\u201d failed to implicate such a policy. Accordingly, the court concluded that Walker\u2019s claims against Thomasville did not rise above the speculative level, and granted the city\u2019s motion to dismiss. Addressing SunTrust\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court determined that, while Walker made allegations against SunTrust, these allegations were \u201cambiguous, conclu-sory, and unintelligible.\u201d The court thus found that Walker\u2019s claims against Sun-Trust failed to satisfy the pleading requirements set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The court further reasoned that, even though several defendants had not filed motions to dismiss, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) required it to <em>sua sponte </em>review Walker\u2019s claims because he was proceeding <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Thus, the court considered whether dismissal was appropriate as to those defendants who had not filed motions to dismiss. The court dismissed the claims against Williams, the Brooks estate, Rolling, and Bradley because Walker failed to make any specific allegations against them in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Regarding the Monroes, the Pogues, and the Montgomerys, the court noted that Walker had made allegations against these defendants in the letter attached to his complaint. The court determined, however, that these \u201cambiguous and con-clusory\u201d allegations failed to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. In addition, the court determined that it did not possess subject matter jurisdiction over Walker\u2019s claims against the Monroes, the Pogues, and the Montgomerys because these were state law claims, and Walker did not allege facts indicating that the court had diversity jurisdiction. Moreover, because the court had dismissed Walker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Walker\u2019s state law claims against the Mon-roes, the Pogues, and the Montgomerys. Accordingly, the court dismissed Walker\u2019s complaint as to all of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Walker filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint. Thereafter, Walker filed numerous pleadings requesting that the district court permit him to engage in discovery. In these pleadings, Walker asserted that the district court judge who had considered his case was biased against him, and had violated his constitutional rights by dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">We liberally construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Daewoo Motor Am., Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>459 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a claim. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). We review for abuse of discretion, however, a district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim. <em>Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d 733, 738 (11th Cir. 2006). We may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment based on any ground supported by the record. <em>Koziara v. City of Casselberry, </em>392 F.3d 1302, 1306 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Where a plaintiff is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>a district court is required to <em>sua sponte </em>determine whether the complaint: (1) is frivolous or malicious; (2) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; or (3) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B); <em>See Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1251-52 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 632, 172 L.Ed.2d 619 (2008). In addition, a district court may <em>sua sponte </em>consider whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs claims. Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3); <em>Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1293. A defendant may assert the defense that the plaintiffs complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted by filing a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Subject matter jurisdiction in a federal court may be based upon federal question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332. Diversity jurisdiction exists where the plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; <em>MacGinnitie v. Hobbs Group, LLC, </em>420 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201c[cjomplete diversity requires that no defendant in a diversity action be a citizen of the same state as any plaintiff\u2019). \u201cAbsent diversity of citizenship, a plaintiff must present a substantial federal question in order to invoke the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Wyke v. Polk County School Bd., </em>129 F.3d 560, 566 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Where a district court possesses original jurisdiction over a plaintiffs claim under \u00a7 1331, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those state law claims \u201cthat are so related to claims in the action within [the court\u2019s] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). \u201cThe constitutional \u2018case or controversy\u2019 standard confers supplemental jurisdiction over all state claims which arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact with a substantial federal claim.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>468 F.3d at 743. Even if a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over state law claims by virtue of their close connection to a federal claim, the court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction over the state law claims where, among other things, the court has dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Parker, </em>468 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff may sue an individual who, while acting under color of state law, deprived him of a constitutional right. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Collier v. Dickinson, </em>477 F.3d 1306, 1307 (11th Cir.2007). Municipalities and other local government entities are \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). In order \u201cto impose \u00a7 1983 liability on a municipality, a plaintiff must show that: (1) his constitutional rights were violated; (2) the municipality had a custom or policy that constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right; and (3) that the policy or custom caused the violation.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Here, the record provides no support for the district court\u2019s determination that Walker was proceeding <em>informa pauperis, </em>because the docket entry for the filing of his complaint indicates that he paid the filing fee, and the record does not reflect that he sought or received permission to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Accordingly, it appears that the district court clearly erred in finding that Walker was proceeding <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Based on its erroneous determination of Walker\u2019s filing status, the court applied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss his claims against those defendants who did not file motions to dismiss- \u2014 Williams, Brooks, Rolling, Bradley, the Monroes, the Pogues, and the Montgomerys. Because Walker was not proceeding <em>in forma pau-peris, </em>however, dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) was improper. Moreover, there is no indication that a court may <em>sua sponte </em>determine whether a complaint is subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) where the plaintiff is not proceeding <em>in forma pauperis. </em>We note that, while the Pogues and the Montgomerys filed a <em>pro se </em>responsive pleading, they did not indicate that they sought dismissal of the complaint. As a result, it does not appear that their motion could be construed as a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Nevertheless, we may affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Walker\u2019s claims against these defendants who did not file a motion to dismiss on the alternative ground that the court could properly <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because Walker and the defendants were from Georgia, there was no diversity jurisdiction in this case. Moreover, because Walker\u2019s complaint primarily asserted only state law fraud claims, the only basis for federal question jurisdiction in this case was Walker\u2019s claim that Thomasville city officials violated his constitutional rights. Construing Walker\u2019s complaint liberally, the court properly determined that this allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>constituted a \u00a7 1988 claim against a municipality, which provided the court with federal question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331. The court, however, dismissed this claim because Walker failed to allege that Thom-asville employed a custom or policy that resulted in the deprivation of his constitutional rights. Because the court dismissed the only claim over which it had original jurisdiction, it then had discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Walker\u2019s state law claims against the other defendants who did not file a motion to dismiss. As a result, even if the court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing these claims under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), these claims were still subject to <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and we affirm on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d), if a district court considers matters outside of the pleadings when ruling on a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), then the motion to dismiss must be treated as a motion for summary judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. <em>Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1371 (11th Cir.1997). Where a district court considers matters outside the pleadings, thereby converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the court must provide all parties with a reasonable opportunity to present all material that is pertinent to the decision of whether summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder most circumstances, such material would not be part of the record underpinning a Rule 12(b)(6) ruling.\u201d <em>Daewoo Motor Am., Inc., </em>459 F.3d at 1266 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Here, the district court based its dismissal on its determination that Walker\u2019s complaint, on its face, did not satisfy the pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), and could not withstand a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The court did not consider any matters beyond the pleadings in making this determination. Accordingly, the court did not err by failing to convert the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss to motions for summary judgment. For this same reason, the court did not err by failing to grant Walker a jury trial or otherwise provide him with the opportunity to submit evidence in support of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">In order to prevail on a claim that his right to equal protection has been violated, a plaintiff must show that he has been treated differently on account of some form of invidious discrimination. <em>City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439-40, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s substantive and procedural rights. <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1555 (11th Cir.1994) <em>(en </em>banc). A violation of substantive due process rights occurs where an individual\u2019s fundamental rights, those \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d are infringed. <em>Id. </em>at 1556 (quotation omitted). Procedural due process rules, on the other hand, protect an individual from the unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 259, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1050, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">Walker\u2019s arguments that the court violated his rights to due process and equal protection lack merit. The court\u2019s judgment in this case provide no indication that the court discriminated against Walker on the basis of his race. In addition, Walker does not otherwise explain how the court violated his constitutional rights, and the record provides no indication that the court violated Walker\u2019s fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>rights, or that its actions resulted in the unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Finally, we do not consider Walker\u2019s argument that the district court judge should have recused himself from consideration of Walker\u2019s case, because Walker did not raise this argument to the district court until after he filed a notice of appeal. <em>See Ledford v. Peeples, </em>568 F.3d 1258, 1298 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that we generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal); <em>Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that, \u201c[a]s a general matter, the filing of a notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over all issues involved in the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
