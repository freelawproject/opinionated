Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for failure to state a claim. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding that Messier\u2019s federal claims all were barred by either the applicable statute of limitations or <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and that the remaining state law claims were due to be dismissed so that they could be adjudicated in state court. On appeal, Messier has not addressed any of the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, but simply has reiterated his underlying substantive claims raised in his complaint. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and view the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). Issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). Further, a party may not \u201cincorporate by reference\u201d arguments presented to the district court, but must specifically and clearly identify the issues presented for review, with citations to the authorities and portions of the record on which the appellant relies. <em>Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, B.V. v. Consorcio Barr S.A., </em>377 F.3d 1164, 1167 n. 4 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On appeal, Messier has not argued that the district court erred by (1) finding that his claims were barred by the statute of limitations or <em>Heck, </em>or (2) dismissing his state law claims so that they could be adjudicated in state court. Because Messier does not address any of the distinct court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint, he has abandoned any relevant argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
