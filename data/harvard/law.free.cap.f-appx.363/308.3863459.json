He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and gives excessive weight to a defendant\u2019s prior convictions in setting the offense level, thereby effectively double-counting the defendant\u2019s criminal record via his offense level and his criminal history score. He contends that the sentence fails to take into account his benign motive for returning to the United States. Arroyo asserts, in addition, that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). Although Arroyo acknowledges that plain error review applies, he has preserved the issue whether a failure to object to the reasonableness of a sentence upon its imposition requires plain error review. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>To show plain error, Arroyo must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We have rejected Arroyo\u2019s argument that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), dictates that the appellate presumption of reasonableness we accord to sentences imposed within a properly calculated advisory sentencing guidelines range should not apply to sentences that were calculated under Guidelines not derived from empirical data and national experience. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). We have also rejected Arroyo\u2019s double-counting argument. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31 &amp; n. 11; <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The record shows that the district court based Arroyo\u2019s sentence on the advisory sentencing guidelines range, the information in the presentence report, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court judge implicitly considered the arguments Arroyo presented at sentencing and determined that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. Arroyo has not shown error, much less plain error, in the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence, and he has not rebutted the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
