The BIA issued its decision and order on remand from the Second Circuit, which previously found Poole\u2019s petition for review time-barred except with respect to his claim of derivative citizenship. <em>See Poole v. Mt\u00fccasey, </em>522 F.3d 259 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-22\">Petitioner argues that the BIA incorrectly held that it does not have the power to grant derivative citizenship <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the BIA does have this power, however, petitioner has presented no evidence that the delay in processing his mother\u2019s naturalization application was \u201cuntoward\u201d or that his mother took any action to expedite the application in light of petitioner\u2019s age. <em>See also Calix-Chavarria v. Att\u2019y General, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 72, 76 (3d Cir.2006) (noting circumstances in which it might be appropriate to grant derivative citizenship <em>nunc pro tunc </em>).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore DENY the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tion for review. The previously granted stay of deportation is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-23\">. The government has presented a naturalization application that purports to establish that petitioner\u2019s mother applied for naturalization after petitioner's eighteenth birthday, making him ineligible for derivative citizenship even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>were the BIA to possess <em>nunc pro tunc </em>power to grant it. As the naturalization application is not in the administrative record, we do not consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\"[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative recox-d on which the order of removal is based.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
