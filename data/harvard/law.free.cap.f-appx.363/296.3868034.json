In 2005, Harcourt filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a sentence reduction based in part on Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court ruled that Amendment 599 was inapplicable to Harc-ourt\u2019s sentence. In 2008, Harcourt filed a second motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a sentence reduction based on Amendment 599. Harcourt now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">The doctrine of res judicata applies to criminal cases as well as civil ones. <em>Wingate v. Wainwright, </em>464 F.2d 209, 211 (5th Cir.1972). We may raise the doctrine of res judicata sua sponte \u201cas a means to affirm the district court decision below.\u201d <em>Russell v. SunAmerica Securities, Inc., </em>962 F.2d 1169, 1172 (5th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">The district court\u2019s order denying Harcourt\u2019s 2005 motion is res judicata as to Harcourt\u2019s instant motion. The parties are identical; the judgment in the prior action was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; the prior action concluded to a final judgment on the merits; and the same cause of action was involved in both actions. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>484 F.3d 321, 325 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Musgrave, </em>483 F.2d 327, 332 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">Furthermore, Harcourt\u2019s motion is meritless. Amendment 599 amended the application notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>which applies to the use of firearms or explosives during or in relation to certain crimes. The amendment and the guideline specifically apply to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c) and 929(a). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599; \u00a7 2K2.4. Harcourt was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and Amendment 599 is not applicable. The district court\u2019s denial of Harc-ourt\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, - L.Ed.2d - (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Harcourt\u2019s appeal lacks any issue arguable on its merits. The appeal is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Harcourt is warned that future filings of repetitious or frivolous appeals may result in the imposition of sanctions. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, an extension is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
