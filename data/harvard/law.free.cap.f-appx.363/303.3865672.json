By the time Appellant\u2019s case had reached the summary judgment stage, Appellant\u2019s pleadings contained claims that Appellees had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Texas Labor Code, and various provisions of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Appellant also claimed that Appellees had slandered him and invaded his privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">In its orders dismissing Appellant\u2019s claims, the district court held that all of Appellant\u2019s claims were either legally barred because they did not contain private rights of action, or the claims lacked any evidence to support them. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>now argues that the district court erred because Appellees allegedly breached a collective bargaining agreement with the union to which Appellant belonged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant also argues that the evidence is sufficient for a claim of hostile work environment under the ADA. Finally, Appellant argues that Appellees \u201cpossessed an evil intent and gross disregard for [Appellant\u2019s] civil rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Because we find no error in the district court\u2019s orders, and because we find no proof of Appellant\u2019s claims on the record, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">. Defendant/Appellee First Transit Inc. first referred Appellant to the company doctor after Appellant brought allegations against his co-workers that they were involved in a vast conspiracy run by the Roman Catholic Church to monitor and perhaps murder Appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Agd\">. Appellant also now argues the union breached this agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
