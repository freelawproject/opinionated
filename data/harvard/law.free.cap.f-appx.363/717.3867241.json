Andrews, the County Manager of Fulton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>County, Georgia, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil action against him for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Ronald Edwards, an African-American male employed as a Community Development Specialist in Fulton County\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development, filed a \u00a7 1988 complaint against Fulton County and defendant-appellant Thomas Andrews, individually, alleging pay discrepancies. In the complaint, Edwards specifically alleged that he was paid less than women and white employees who performed the same duties, and that Andrews, as the County Manager, ignored memoranda notifying him of the discrepancies and continued the discriminatory practice. According to the complaint, Andrews\u2019s actions constituted violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Andrews moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion, assuming that Edwards had alleged a constitutional violation and finding that (1) Andrews acted within the scope of his discretionary authority and (2) the right was clearly established. Andrews now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction of this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Dalrymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 994 (11th Cir.2003). We review the denial of qualified immunity on a motion to dismiss <em>de .novo, </em>\u201caccepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (quotation omitted). Thus, when evaluating whether a claim for qualified immunity is appropriate, a court must determine (1) whether the facts, as alleged, showed that the individual\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right, and (2) whether that violation was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the alleged deprivation. <em>See id. </em>at 815-16. Although courts are no longer required to address these two prongs in order, it is \u201coften beneficial\u201d to do so. <em>See Fennell v. Gilstrap, </em>559 F.3d 1212, 1216 n. 6 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Here, Edwards alleged that Andrews personally made the decision to continue discriminatory pay practices after these practices were repeatedly brought to his attention. Taking this allegation as true, which we must at this stage of the proceedings, the complaint sufficiently alleges that Andrews\u2019s actions violated Edwards\u2019s clearly established constitutional right to equal protection and equal pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Moreover, we disagree with Andrews\u2019s argument that the complaint failed to meet the heightened pleading requirement. The complaint contains \u201ca claim for relief, that is plausible on its face,\u201d and not merely \u201can unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
