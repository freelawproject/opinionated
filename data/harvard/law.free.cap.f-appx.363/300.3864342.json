Williams pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced to 51 months of imprisonment after receiving a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Williams sought the reduction based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that reduced the offense levels for crimes involving crack cocaine. His 51-month sentence was at the top of the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-24\">Williams contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the court gave inadequate weight to his post-incarceration conduct and overstated the seriousness of his offense, his criminal history, and his potential danger to society. The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2009). Under that well-established standard, we may not simply substitute our judgment for that of the sentencing court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 364, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion but gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir. 1994) (affirming the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion where \u201cimplicitly, the district court considered at least some of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d). Williams merely asks us to substitute his opinion of the sentence for the district court\u2019s opinion. We may not do so. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 364, 127 S.Ct. 2456. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
