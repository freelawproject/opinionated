Gardner argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was imposed consecutively to his 151-month sentence for a bank robbery that was used to revoke his supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">In 1998, Gardner pleaded guilty to two counts of bank robbery. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The district court sentenced Gardner to 66 months of imprisonment followed by 36 months of supervised release. On October 20, 2005, Gardner was released from prison, and in early December 2005, he robbed two banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The government petitioned to revoke Gardner\u2019s supervised release. The government alleged that Gardner violated three conditions of his release: Gardner failed to participate in mental health counseling and take his medication; he failed to report to his probation officer within 72 hours after he was released from prison; and Gardner had been arrested for robbing two banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Gardner was indicted for two counts of bank robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon during the robberies. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d). Gardner later pleaded guilty to one count of unarmed bank robbery. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2113(a). The district court sentenced Gardner to 151 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">At a revocation hearing, Gardner admitted violating the three conditions of his supervised release. The district court advised Gardner that he faced a sentence between 18 and 24 months of imprisonment, and Gardner requested that the court run his sentence concurrent with his sentence of 151 months of imprisonment. Gardner denied robbing the bank, argued no physical evidence tied him to the crime, and asked the district court to \u201cdrop[ ]\u201d his conviction to \u201cpanhandling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">The district court stated it was concerned about \u201cwhat to do with [Gardner] because [he] couldn\u2019t be trusted to be on supervised release.\u201d The court expressed frustration with Gardner\u2019s \u201cimmediate\u201d commission of another bank robbery and his denial of guilt, and stated there was a need to satisfy the \u201cgoal of incapacitation.\u201d The district court sentenced Gardner to 18 months of imprisonment \u201cto follow the sentence imposed in the bank robbery case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201c \u2018The reasonableness of a final sentence is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008)). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering that Gardner\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tence for violating his supervised release run consecutive to the term imposed for the bank robbery. Although Gardner had pleaded guilty to bank robbery, he denied his guilt at his revocation hearing. The district court reasonably concluded that a sentence of 169 months of imprisonment was necessary to deter Gardner from future similar crimes, reflect the seriousness of his offenses, promote respect for the law, and provide a just punishment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Gardner complains that the district court \u201cplaced too much emphasis on incapacitation,\u201d but \u201c \u2018we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006)). Gardner\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Gardner\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
