Bekou alleges that his waiver of appeal of the IJ\u2019s December 15, 2008 decision was ineffective, and even if the waiver was effective, this court should find that he is a citizen by birth of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-21\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">Bekou entered the United States on July 21, 1998 on a J-l non-immigrant visa, with authorization to remain in the United States for a temporary period not to exceed October 17, 1998, in order to teach French at the Concordia Language Villages in Hackensack, Minnesota. Bekou has remained in the United States beyond October 17, 1998 without authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS). Accordingly, on July 21, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a Notice to Appear to petitioner charging him with removability under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). During the removal proceedings, Bekou argued that he had dual citizenship in both the United States and Togo based on his alleged birth at Niagara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Falls, New York and his Togolese passport allegedly obtained in 2006 by his mother in Togo.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">After holding four hearings on the charge of removability and offering several opportunities for Bekou to obtain counsel, the IJ found that Bekou was not born in the United States and accordingly was removable as charged. Bekou indicated his acceptance of the decision and stated \u201cI don\u2019t want to appeal anything.\u201d Accordingly, the IJ entered a final removal to Germany, Bekou\u2019s designated removal destination, with an alternate order of removal to Togo. Notwithstanding his waiver of appeal, on January 5, 2009, Bekou filed a timely appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision before the BIA. On March 4, 2009, the BIA found that Bekou had waived his appeal and therefore found it lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal. On March 23, 2009, Be-kou filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA, and on June 30, 2009, the BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s motion after determining that reconsideration of the March 4, 2009 decision was not warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">II. Claim of Ineffective Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">Jurisdiction to review Bekou\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s March 4, 2009 order is proper in this court under section 242(a)(1) of the INA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), <em>amended by </em>the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, \u00a7 106, 119 Stat. 231. With respect to Bekou\u2019s claim that his waiver of appeal of the IJ\u2019s final order was ineffective, jurisdiction in this court is proper even though Bekou failed to specifically raise the issue on appeal to the BIA. While \u201cwe refuse to saddle the BIA with the burden of identifying the substance of an immigration appeal[,] ... [tjhis is not to preclude the BIA from raising issues that the parties have seemingly abandoned, and should the BIA choose to do so, our exhaustion inquiry might be much different.\u201d <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 322 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Lin v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>543 F.3d 114, 122-26 (3d Cir.2008) (discussing the circuit split on the issue of exhaustion)). Furthermore, the exhaustion requirement \u201cis not needlessly technical or formalistic[,]\u201d and \u201crequiring the fair presentation of a contested issue is sound policy.\u201d Oman, 562 F.3d at 321.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">With respect to Bekou\u2019s waiver, we shall make our determination \u201conly on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based,\u201d and \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A)-(B). In addition, we review factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard and will not reverse the BIA\u2019s findings \u201cunless the evidence is so compelling that no reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>able fact finder could fail to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The BIA found that Bekou had \u201cnot made an effective argument that his decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one,\u201d and accordingly, \u201cthe Immigration Judge\u2019s decision became administratively final upon the respondent\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal.... \u201d Particularly, the BIA found that \u201c[t]he hearing transcript includes the respondent\u2019s testimony that he accepted the removal order and did not want to appeal with regard to any issue[,]\u201d and \u201cthe Immigration Judge noted the appeal waiver at the bottom of his decision.\u201d Moreover, because the waiver of appeal was plain on the record, the BIA was entitled to summarily dismiss his appeal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(G), (e)(3). Because Bekou has failed to introduce any evidence that his decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one, we find that no \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d and accordingly, we affirm the decision of the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">III. Claim of U.S. Citizenship by Birth</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We shall review Bekou\u2019s claim of United States citizenship de novo unless we find that \u201ca genuine issue of material fact about [Bekou\u2019s] nationality\u201d has been presented to the court, in which case we \u201cshall transfer the proceeding to the district court ... for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought in the district court.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A)-(B). <em>See Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 107, 110 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A] court of appeals is directed to conduct a de novo determination based on the record, of an alien\u2019s claim of nationality.\u201d (citing <em>Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 554 (5th Cir.2006))); <em>see also Bustamante-Barrera v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 388, 393 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cUnder the plain words of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A), we are empowered to \u2018decide [a putative citizen\u2019s] nationality claim\u2019 if we \u2018find[ ] from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about [his] nationality is presented.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Ahuan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 510 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he INA explicitly places the determination of nationality claims in the hands of the courts.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Here, transfer to the district court is inappropriate because Bekou has failed to present \u201ca genuine issue of material fact\u201d as to his citizenship. At the proceedings below, the IJ found that \u201call of the evidence indieate[d] that [Bekou was] born in Togo.\u201d In particular, DHS presented the following evidence establishing that Bekou was a native and citizen of Togo: (1) Bekou\u2019s Togo passport which was issued on March 14, 2006 and lists his nationality as Togolaise, his birth place as Atakpame, Togo, and his date of birth as March 25, 1968; (2) Bekou\u2019s prior Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal, which was signed by Bekou on April 16, 1999 and lists his present nationality as Togolese, his nationality at birth as Togolese, his city of birth as Atakpame, Togo, his birth date as March 25,1968, and the expiration date of his authorized stay as October 17, 1998; (3) Bekou\u2019s signed and notarized affidavit in support of his Application for Asylum, wherein Bekou states he was born in Atakpame, Togo on March 25, 1968 and is a native and citizen of Togo; (4) an attestation by Komla Clement Nyamikou, the Federal President of the Union of Forces for Change Federation of Wawa (a political organization in which Bekou was active) stating that Bekou was born on March 25, 1968 in Atakpame, Togo; (5) US-Visit records listing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Bekou\u2019s nationality and birthplace as Togo; and a November 7, 2008 memorandum from Bryan Firmin, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deportation Officer stating that \u201cthere is no doubt\u201d that the fingerprints submitted with Bekou\u2019s 1-589 Asylum Application match a 2008 sample taken while he was in DHS custody. In contrast, nothing in the record supports Bekou\u2019s claim that he was born in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In his petition before this court, Bekou has introduced additional evidentiary documents, such as college transcripts, receipts for tax preparation services, a United States Treasury tax return check, and medical records; however, none of the additional evidence presented is sufficient to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to Bekou\u2019s nationality by birth. Bekou\u2019s conclusory allegations that he was born in the United States are insufficient, and \u201c[s]omething more than a fanciful allegation is required ... when the moving party has met its burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Paul Kadair, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of Am., </em>694 F.2d 1017, 1080 (5th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, this court shall retain jurisdiction and determine his claim of citizenship by birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">When, as in this case, an alien \u201casks the [government to endow him with all the advantages of citizenship[,]\u201d \u201cthe burden is on the alien applicant to show his eligibility for citizenship in every respect.\u201d <em>Berenyi v. Dist. Dir., Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>385 U.S. 630, 636-37, 87 S.Ct. 666, 17 L.Ed.2d 656 (1967). Because citizenship, \u201conce granted, cannot lightly be taken away,\u201d all \u201cdoubts \u2018should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 87 S.Ct. 666 (citing <em>United States v. Macintosh, </em>283 U.S. 605, 625, 51 S.Ct. 570, 75 L.Ed. 1302 (1931) <em>overruled on other grounds by Girouard v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 61, 66 S.Ct. 826, 90 L.Ed. 1084 (1946)). In addition, \u201cthe burden of proof shall be upon the claimant ... to establish the claimed citizenship by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 341.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Bekou has failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is a citizen of the United States. We agree with the IJ\u2019s determination that the evidence points towards the conclusion that Bekou was born in Atakpame, Togo on March 25,1968 and therefore not a citizen by birth of the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Bekou\u2019s petition for review and claim of United States citizenship are each hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. Because Bekou did not seek judicial review of the BIA's June 30, 2009 order, we shall not consider it. <em>See United States v. Narviz-Guerra, </em>148 F.3d 530, 537 (5th Cir.1998) (\"[A]ll issues not briefed are waived.\u201d (citation omitted)). For final removal orders, section 242(b)(1) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), provides that a petition for judicial review \"must be filed not later than thirty days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d <em>See also Stone v.

The Third Circuit has held that \"[wjhile we would usually hold that a petitioner's failure to present an issue to the BIA constituted a failure to exhaust, thus depriving us of jurisdiction to consider it,\u201d where the BIA addresses and rules on the unraised issue <em>sua sponte, </em>we have jurisdiction to consider the petition for review because the BIA addressed the issue on the merits \"thereby exhausting the issue.\u201d <em>Lin, </em>543 F.3d at 126.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">.
