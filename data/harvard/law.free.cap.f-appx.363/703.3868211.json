On appeal, Marquez-Leon argues that his 36-month sentence is substantively unreasonable based upon the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b730-23\">On the evening of 10 January 2008, the Coast Guard cutter <em>Drummond </em>spotted a small go-fast vessel operating without navigation lights and traveling southbound, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>roughly 60 miles south of Marathon, Florida. R2 at 6. The crew drew the <em>Drum-mond, </em>within a hundred yards of the vessel, activated their blue law enforcement lights, and, using VHF radio, ordered the vessel to stop in English and Spanish. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The driver of the go-fast boat, later identified as co-defendant Ismael Pe-drosa-Garcia, failed to stop the vessel and, in an effort to evade the <em>Drummond, </em>increased speed and executed high-risk maneuvers that nearly caused a collision. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Law enforcement aboard the <em>Drum-mond </em>observed that Marquez-Leon was standing near the boat\u2019s controls and that he made no visible effort to stop the boat. <em>Id. </em>The go-fast vessel continued southbound for over an hour before coming to a stop. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">After being given his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Marquez-Leon said that his role on the boat was to navigate with a GPS device. <em>Id. </em>The two men had set out to find a boat filled with migrants from Cuba, including family members. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 8. Marquez-Leon was also to refuel the migrants\u2019 boat so that he and Pedrosa-Garcia could escort the migrants into the United States illegally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Marquez-Leon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit alien smuggling, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I). His base offense level was 12. He received a two-point enhancement for reckless endangerment, for the high-risk maneuvers executed by the go-fast during the pursuit, and a two-point enhancement for a prior felony immigration offense. He received a three-point reduction because the smuggling was not for profit and a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total of 11. His criminal history level was II. The according guideline sentence was 10-16 months. Upon consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Marquez-Leon to 36 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Marquez-Leon, having objected to the reckless endangerment enhancement, appealed on the basis that it wrongly punished him for Pedrosa-Gareia\u2019s operation of the boat. We held that Marquez-Leon should not be held accountable for the reckless endangerment and remanded. At resentencing, with a new offense level of nine, and a guideline range of 6-12 months, the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and again imposed a 36-month sentence. Marquez-Leon appeals the sentence as substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We have \u201crecognize[d] that there is a range of reasonable sentences from-which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Even if the district court \u201cimpose[d] a sentence that is either more severe or lenient than the sentence we would have imposed,\u201d we must still affirm if we find that sentence reasonable. <em>Id. </em>The burden of proof lies with the party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we normally ensure, first, that the district court did not make a significant procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court is not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor specifically, provided that it acknowledges that it considered all of the factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Marquez-Leon does not challenge the sentence as procedurally unreasonable. Nonetheless, we note that, at the resentencing hearing, the court explicitly referred to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, listing and considering each individually in light of the relevant facts. R4 at 5-9. The guideline range, on remand, was calculated correctly, with the reckless endangerment enhancement properly removed. The court also adequately explained the basis for its reasoning. We find no procedural errors in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Having so found, we must next consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 596-597. These factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need <em>for </em>a sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need to deter criminal conduct; and (5) the advisory guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Another relevant factor is the relationship between the defendant\u2019s sentence and the applicable statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (noting, as one indication of reasonableness, that a defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cwell below\u201d the applicable statutory maximum). \u201cA sentence may be substantively unreasonable if a district court unjustifiably relied on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201cWe will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unless the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court must provide \u201csufficient justifications\u201d for \u201can unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. at 594. \u201c[I]n reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may therefore take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court rejected the idea that a variance from the guideline range must be supported by extraordinary circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Marquez-Leon argues that some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors weigh against the upward variance imposed by the district court. As to the nature and circumstances of the offense, he was searching for distressed family members and did vocally instruct Pedrosa-Garcia to stop the boat during the pursuit. But Marquez-Leon does not meet his burden for establishing that this sentence is substantively unreasonable. The nature and circumstances of the offense were aggravated by the fact that he and Pedrosa-Garcia nearly rammed the go-fast vessel, with over 100 gallons of gasoline onboard, into the <em>Drummond. </em>The defendant himself entered the United States illegally and participated, after his entry, in a for-profit alien smuggling conspiracy. These facts speak to the characteristics of the defendant and the need to promote respect for the law under \u00a7 3553(a). A longer sentence promotes general deterrence by discouraging others from committing similar offenses. And the three-year sentence, only six months longer than what Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>quez-Leon sought at at resentencing, is well below the ten-year statutory maximum for the offense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(i); <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The district court sufficiently articulated the reasons for its above-guidelines sentence in this case. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. at 594. We conclude that the sentence falls within the \u201crange of reasonable sentences\u201d from which the court could choose. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in Marquez-Leon\u2019s resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Marquez-Leon appeals his sentence imposed on remand as unreasonable. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upward based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
