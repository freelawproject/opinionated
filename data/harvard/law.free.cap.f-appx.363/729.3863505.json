Richards challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">Richards and 21 other individuals were charged in an eleven count indictment for money laundering and drug crimes. Richards was indicted for three crimes: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 5 kilograms of cocaine between April 2007 and December 6, 2007, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II), 846; conspiracy to launder money, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841, 846; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h); and laundering money, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2, 1956(a)(2)(A); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, 846. Richards entered a blind plea of guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine, and he waived his right to a trial by jury for the money laundering charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-23\">Before trial, the parties submitted a stipulation of facts. Richards admitted that between August 2007 and December 2007 he had worked as a truck driver for Troy Palmer, the owner of Palmer Trucking. Richards also admitted that he had transported cocaine and money that \u201cconsist[ed] of drug proceeds and a fee for transporting the cocaine.\u201d Richards knew that Palmer had transported the cocaine for Ramiro Campuzano-Velasco, the \u201cleader of the Atlanta cell of a drug trafficking organization,\u201d and the cocaine was supplied by \u201cRamon Madrigal-Moreno in Mexico.\u201d Although \u201cRichards did not have any direct contact with\u201d Madrigal, Richards knew that Palmer talked to Madrigal \u201cthrough a cell phone, to which a Mexican telephone number was assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Richards admitted that he had transported cocaine to Atlanta, Georgia, on three occasions. During the first trip, Richards obtained 60 kilograms of cocaine from an \u201cunknown Hispanic male in Col-ton, southern California,\u201d delivered it to an \u201cHispanic male in a Wal-Mart parking lot\u201d in Atlanta, Georgia, and received $48,000 from \u201canother Hispanic male\u201d to transport to California. During the second trip, Richards obtained 60 kilograms of cocaine \u201conce again from an unknown Hispanic male(s) in Colton, California,\u201d delivered the cocaine to Rigoberto Sanchez ... in a Costco parking lot\u201d in Atlanta, and received two deliveries of $50,000 and $351,050. En route to California, federal agents stopped Richards and seized the $351,050, but the agents did not arrest Richards. Richards obtained a receipt for the money that he delivered to \u201cunknown Hispanic males in southern California.\u201d During the third trip, Richards obtained 120 kilograms of cocaine \u201cfrom Hispanic males in the Dallas, Texas area,\u201d delivered the cocaine to Sanchez in Atlanta, and Sanchez gave Richards money to transport to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">At tidal, Palmer testified that he had transported drugs to Atlanta and drug proceeds to Sacramento and Los Angeles and he deduced that the proceeds were destined for Mexico. Palmer explained that Chuey superintended how the proceeds were handled and, during one conversation, Chuey pressured Palmer to rush his delivery so Chuey could travel to Tijuana, Mexico. Palmer stated that the drug proceeds seized from Richards\u2019s truck were supposed to be delivered to Mexico, but Palmer did not discuss the final destination with Richards. Palmer testified that Madrigal was upset that \u201cthe money was taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">After the government rested, Richards argued that the government failed to prove he laundered or conspired to launder money. Richards argued that the district court had to assume he knew the money was delivered to Mexico based on circumstantial evidence that the proceeds were delivered to Hispanic men, the cocaine came from Mexico, and the dropoff points were near the Mexican border. Richards also argued that he did not know about or join a conspiracy to deliver money to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The district court found Richards guilty of conspiracy to launder money and of laundering money. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(2)(A), (h). The district court found the circumstantial evidence proved that the proceeds were destined for Mexico. The court ruled that Richards did not have to know the final destination of the proceeds either to aid and abet in laundering money or to conspire to launder. The district court sentenced Richards to 240 months of imprisonment for his drug-crime, a concurrent term of 121 months of imprisonment for his money laundering crimes, and ten years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir. 2007). In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of, the government. <em>id. </em>An argument not presented to the district court is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hunerlach, </em>197 F.3d 1059, 1068 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Richards argues there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for conspiracy to launder and laundering money. Richards argues there is no evidence he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>knew either that the drug proceeds were destined for Mexico or the objective of the conspiracy was to launder money. Richards also argues for the first time on appeal that his actions did not promote trafficking in cocaine. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Ample evidence supports Richards\u2019s convictions. Richards joined the conspiracy at Palmer\u2019s invitation and he knowingly transported proceeds of cocaine sales in a manner intended to avoid the detection of law enforcement. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(h); <em>United States v. Quintero, </em>165 F.3d 831, 838 (11th Cir. 1999). Richards promoted trafficking in cocaine by transporting the drug proceeds, which, in turn, aided and abetted his co-conspirators in delivering the money to Mexico. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1956(a)(2)(A). Richards did not have to know the ultimate destination of the money. Based on evidence that Richards knew the cocaine was imported from Mexico and he accepted the money from Hispanic men, it was nevertheless foreseeable that the money would be delivered to Mexico. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1335 (11th Cir. 2005). The district court did not err by denying Richards\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Richards\u2019s convictions for conspiring to launder and laundering cocaine are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
