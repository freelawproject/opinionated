Ray contends that the district court erred by failing to grant him a downward departure, and, as such, that his within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable. Ray specifically argues that the district court should have given minimal weight to the guidelines range because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 it is not based on empirical evidence and results in exponentially high sentences for persons convicted of possessing child pornography. He further argues that the other \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors militated in favor of a below-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">In reviewing a sentence, this court should \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008). When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range and gives prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>er weight to the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court gives \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In this case, the district court considered Ray\u2019s argument for a below-guidelines sentence in conjunction with the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and determined that they supported a within-guidelines sentence. The absence of empirical data supporting \u00a7 2G2.2 and Ray\u2019s disagreement with his within-guidelines sentence are insufficient to rebut the presumption that his sentence is reasonable. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338. Accordingly, the district court did not err by not sentencing Ray to a below-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
