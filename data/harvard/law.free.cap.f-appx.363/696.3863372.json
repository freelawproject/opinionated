Prior to the instant arrest, Owens had been convicted of various crimes, including ten counts of rape in the second degree and two counts of sodomy in the second degree, each in violation of Alabama law. Owens was classified as an \u201carmed career criminal,\u201d and his sentence was enhanced to 293 months, pursuant to the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. On appeal, Owens asserts his sentence was improperly calculated, because neither second-degree rape nor second-degree sodomy are crimes of violence, and are thus improper predicate crimes for enhancement under the Aimed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In <em>United States v. Ivory, </em>we concluded rape in the second degree under Alabama law was a crime of violence because it involved the use of non-consensual physical force against another. <em>United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1236 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior Eleventh Circuit panel holdings are binding on all subsequent panels \u201cunless and until they are overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhile an intervening decision of the Supreme Court can overrule the decision of a prior panel of our court, the Supreme Court decision must be clearly on point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">As Owens concedes, in <em>Ivory, </em>we conclusively addressed \u2014 and rejected \u2014 the argument that second-degree rape under Alabama state law does not constitute a violent felony for purposes of ACCA sentence enhancements. Owens has presented no evidence that sodomy in the second degree \u2014 which also involves some element of physical force against a minor \u2014 should be an exception to the reasoning in <em>Ivory. </em>Until <em>Ivory </em>is abrogated by either the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc, </em>it remains precedential, and the district court did not err in relying on it. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's determination that a particular conviction is a \u2018\u2018violent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. Although <em>Ivoiy </em>was using the definition of crime of violence at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), case law interpreting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is applicable to interpreting the definition of \"violent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 206, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (noting the Sentencing Guidelines' \"definition of a predicate 'crime of violence' closely tracks ACCA's definition of 'violent felony' \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
