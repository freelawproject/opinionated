Specifically, at the core of this action is the issue of the authority of the Circuit Court for Carroll County, by its approval of an agreement (\u201cConsent Order\u201d) between a private party and an executive agency, to modify the method of election of Carroll County commissioners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Article VII of the Maryland Constitution, captioned \u201cSundry Officers,\u201d governs the method of election of commissioners in a county commissioner form of local government. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-8\">\u201cSection 1. The County Commissioners of each county not governed by Article XI-A of this Constitution.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] may be elected by the voters of <em>commissioner districts established </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>therein, </em>or by the voters <em>of the entire county [at-large], </em>or by a combination of these methods of election, <em>as provided by the General Assembly by </em>law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">\u201cSection 2. The number, compensation, and powers and duties of the County Commissioners of each county not governed by Article XI-A of this Constitution shall <em>be such as now are or may be hereafter prescribed by law.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUP\">(Emphasis added). Because we conclude that, as ordained by the Constitution, the power and authority to designate the method of election ultimately, and exclusively, lies with the Legislature, we shall hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s approval of the Consent Order authorizing a change in the method of election of county commissioners was a clear violation of Article VII, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In the case sub <em>judice, </em>the Carroll County Board of Elections (\u201cthe Board\u201d), in an attempt to expand the number of county commissioners in order to implement district, instead of at-large, representation, entered into a Consent Order with Dana Lee Dembrow (\u201cDembrow\u201d), a registered voter in Carroll County, Maryland. Under that Consent Order, the County committed to the adoption of a redistricting plan creating five commissioner districts in the County, and, thus, in effect, to create a new method of election of commissioners for the November 7, 2006 General Election.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Carroll County currently has, and has had since its formation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a commissioner form of government, with three county commissioners. The three persons elected to serve on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>County\u2019s Board of Commissioners historically were elected at-large. In 2003, however, House Bill 290 (2003), mandating the expansion of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners (\u201cthe CCBC\u201d) from three members to five, providing for their election by district, rather than at-large, <em>and </em>establishing a process for the creation of five commissioner districts in the County, was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly, adopted by both houses and signed by the Governor, as Chapter 417, 2003 Laws of Maryland. Section 2 of Chapter 417 conditioned the Act\u2019s becoming effective on its approval by referendum of the legally qualified voters of Carroll County at the next general election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act was referred at the 2004 General Election, and it was approved by Carroll County voters and codified as Public Local Laws of Carroll County \u00a7 3-101. As enacted, the legislation provided, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201c(a) The Board of County Commissioners for Carroll County <em>consists of five Commissioners to be elected by Commissioner District.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">\u201c(c) <em>Redistricting Committee.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201c(1) On or before May 1, 2005, and on or before May 1 following the release of each decennial census of the United Stated thereafter, the County Commissioners shall appoint a Commission Redistricting Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-7\">\u201c(2) (i) The Commission Redistricting Committee shall consist of seven members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-8\">\u201c(ii) Of the seven members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-9\">\u201c1.

The Committee\u2019s function was <em>to make recommendations </em>to the Carroll County Legislative Delegation (\u201cthe Delegation\u201d) as to the boundaries of the proposed five commissioner districts, \u201cfor consideration at the following legislative session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">The Committee drafted two alternative redistricting plans, designated as Option 1 (\u201cthe Wheatley Plan\u201d) and Option 2. Under Option 1, or the Wheatley Plan, Carroll County was divided into a central Westminister district; a northern district consisting of Taneytown and Manchester; a southwestern district consisting of New Windsor, Union Bridge and Mount Airy; a southeastern district consisting of Sykesville and Eldersburg; and an eastern district consisting of Hampstead and Finksburg. Under Option 2, the five districts created were a central Westminister district; a northeastern district containing Hampstead and Manchester; a northwestern district containing Taneytown, New Windsor and Union Bridge; a southwestern district containing Mount Airy and Sykesville; and a southeastern district containing Eldersburg and stretching from the Howard County line to the south side of Md. 140. In this delineation, Finksburg was split between the northeastern and southeastern districts. These plans were the subject of several public hearings, at which the Committee solicited and received input from the Carroll County citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">At its final meeting on June 30, 2005, by a vote of 4 to 2,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Committee adopted and, therefore, recommended Option 2. It completed and submitted its Final Report, including the Committee\u2019s Guidelines, minutes of both its meetings and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>public hearings, and map configurations, to the Carroll County Delegation on August 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Thereafter, the Carroll County Delegation held two public hearings on the Committee Report, one on October 25, 2005 and the other on December 13, 2005. At the latter meeting, the Delegation rejected the Committee\u2019s recommendation of Option 2 and adopted, instead, by a vote of 5 to 2, the Wheatley Plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Wheatley Plan, as P.L.L. \u00a7 3-101(c)(4) required, was introduced, on January 30, 2006, \u201cat the following legislative session,\u201d as House Bill 491. Due to the closeness of the election at which the plan was to be implemented, House Bill 491 was introduced as emergency legislation. Although it passed the House of Delegates and the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee (\u201cthe Senate Committee\u201d), on sine die, the Maryland General Assembly adjourned without completing action on the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">In response to the Delegation\u2019s failure to secure the passage of House Bill 491 and acting on the advice of the Attorney General,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on April 17, 2006, the Board determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>election of the five county commissioners would be conducted at-large and not by district. It did so on the basis that no delineation of commissioner districts had been at the time lawfully created by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Having learned of the Board\u2019s decision, Dembrow, the plaintiff below and one of the appellees in this appeal, filed, in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Writ of Mandamus, naming the Board as defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, Dembrow sought to compel the Board \u201cto implement the directive of a certain voter referendum adopted by the voters of Carroll County, Maryland in November 2004 requiring the election of county commissioner by district in the 2006 elections.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">In response to Dembrow\u2019s Complaint, the Board held two emergency meetings to discuss the pending litigation, at the second of which Dembrow was in attendance. Having heard from Dembrow with regard to the nature of his Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>and the relief he sought, the Board unanimously voted to enter into the Consent Order with Dembrow \u201cto seek jointly at the earliest possible time an Order of the Circuit Court authorizing the conduct of [Carroll County] elections using commissioner district boundaries as designed, approved and recommended by the Redistricting Committee, also known as \u2018Option 2.\u2019\u201d The Circuit Court expedited its review of the Consent Order \u201cin order to afford [the Board] as much time as possible to plan and conduct orderly elections in the fall of 2006 as required by law and dictated in part by a certain voter referendum____\u201d Based solely on the \u201cjoint and abbreviated presentations by counsel,\u201d no notice to the public having been given and no evidentiary hearings having been held, the Circuit Court issued its Order approving the Consent Order and marking the action \u201cas settled and dismissed with prejudice.\u201d As approved, the Consent Order provided, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-5\">\u201c1. [The Board] withdraws its determination of April 17, 2006 to conduct the election of five (5) members of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners in the 2006 election at large rather than on the basis of districts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-6\">\u201c2. [The Board] agrees to conduct the 2006 election of five (5) members of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners by district rather than at large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-7\">\u201c3. [The Board] adopts the December 2005 recommendation of the Districting Committee also known as Option No. 2, and places the said adopted recommendation for Carroll County Commissioner districts in place for the 2006 election by determination of the Carroll County Board of Elections dated April 19, 2006.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">On April 24, 2006, James Harris (\u201cHarris\u201d), for the purposes of appealing or filing motions for reconsideration, filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-214,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a Motion to Intervene in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>action. In that motion, he alleged \u201cthat there was no authority to pass [the Consent Order] as only the state legislature can set or delineate election district boundaries for County Commissioners.\u201d The following day, on April 25, 2006, Getty filed a Motion to Intervene as of Right for the Purpose of a Post-Judgment Appeal. Getty alleged that the Board did not have the authority to create commissioner districts, and, further, that the only power that the Board had was \u201cto recommend the name of one member for appointment by the County Commissioners of Carroll County to the seven-member Commission Redistricting Committee, which power [had] been exhausted.\u201d Moreover, Getty posited that \u201cthe authority to create the five commissioner districts [was] reserved entirely to the legislative branch through action by the Maryland General Assembly.\u201d Finally, Getty submitted that \u201cthe [Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>cuit] Court\u2019s Final Order of April 19, 2006, unlawfully and unconstitutionally impair[ed] and/or defeated] the weight of ... [his] vote [and] impaired] and defeated] the ability to protect the interests of the public in securing the lawful adoption of a commissioner redistricting plan.\u201d Both motions were unopposed, and the Circuit Court granted them on April 25, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The following day, Harris noted an expedited appeal to this Court, which was later amended, on May 11, 2006, as a corrective notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On May 1, 2006, Getty also noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. He then filed, on May 4, 2006, a Motion to Stay the Circuit Court\u2019s Order pending appeal, in which Harris joined, reiterating his intervention arguments and claiming, in addition, that Dembrow\u2019s Complaint was improper because both forms of relief requested could not be granted. They averred that the issuance of a writ of mandamus was improper on the basis that the Circuit Court could not compel the Board to adopt a redistrieting plan since the Board does not have the power to create district lines, while a motion for declaratory relief was baseless once the Board agreed to the Consent Order. In response, Dembrow filed an opposition to the motion to stay the Circuit\u2019s Court ruling and a Motion to Dismiss, or in the alternative, to Transfer the Appeal to the Court of Appeals for Expedited Review. The Circuit Court denied the intervenors\u2019 Motion to Stay, holding that it \u201cwould not promote the expeditious resolution of this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">This Court, on its own initiative, issued a Writ of Certiorari on May 15, 2006. <em>Getty and Harris v. Board of Elections, </em>392 Md. 727, 898 A.2d 1006 (2006). Oral Argument was heard on June 1, 2006, and, on that same day, the Court issued its Order vacating the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanding the ease to that court \u201cwith directions to order the Carroll County Board of Elections that, in the absence of an enactment by the General Assembly of Maryland, pursuant to Article VII, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Maryland Constitution, of new legislation for the election of Carroll County Commissioners in the 2006 elections, the 2006 elections of Carroll County Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>missioners shall be in accordance with \u00a7 3-101(a) of the Public Local Laws of Carroll County as that subsection provided immediately prior to the passage of Chapter 417, 2003 Laws of Maryland,\u201d <em>ie. </em>the election of three county commissioners at-large. We now set forth the reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The appellants, in this Court, as they did in the Circuit Court, argue that the Circuit Court erred in approving the Consent Order between Dembrow and the Board creating commissioner districts in Carroll County. They proffer three theories. At the core of their argument is the separation of powers doctrine. The appellants, citing to this Court\u2019s past redistricting cases, <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>370 Md. 312, 805 A.2d 292 (2002); <em>Legislative Redistricting Cases, </em>331 Md. 574, 614, 629 A.2d 646, 666 (1993); <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>299 Md. 658, 672-81, 475 A.2d 428 (1984) and <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>271 Md. 320, 317 A.2d 477 (1974), claim that the authority to create districts for political offices is a uniquely legislative function, one which should not, and is not permitted to be, under the separation of powers doctrine, infringed upon by the judiciary. The appellants asseverate further that \u201c[t]he Board also lacked authority to establish such districts and ... was bound to conduct the election on an at large basis absent some form of <em>appropriate </em>judicial intervention.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">First, the appellants assert that the Circuit Court\u2019s actions \u201cimproperly usurped the legislative function required by Section 3-101 of the Code of Public Laws of Carroll County.\u201d The appellants also take issue with the Circuit Court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing after notice of the Complaint to the Delegation or, more important, to the citizens of Carroll County, and with the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201cblindly accepting] ... at face value a purported consent disposition on [an] issue with countywide ramifications that had been reached between only two parties[,]\u201d the effect of which, in essence, was the promotion of \u201ca private individual and a ministerial agency [ ] into a legislative body responsible for deciding the countywide commissioner districts.\u201d Accordingly, they urge this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>nullify the Circuit Court\u2019s Order and, instead, give deference to the Delegation\u2019s endorsement of the Wheatley Plan and to instruct the Circuit Court to adopt said plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The second theory upon which the appellants base their argument concerns \u201cbasic due process principles and precedent established by Maryland\u2019s courts for addressing redistricting issues.\u201d Specifically, the appellants posit that the Circuit Court should have adhered to the \u201cfair and open process for the consideration of disputes over redistricting\u201d that has been established by this Court, including, but not limited to, \u201cthe ability for anyone who is aggrieved to petition the Court with specific challenges to [a given] redistricting plan, the appointment of a Special Master as a fact-finder, and a heaxing to allow all sides of the challenge to be heard.\u201d It is the appellants\u2019 contention that, in hastily approving the Consent Order, the Circuit Court disregarded this process altogether.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the appellants assert that the Circuit Court should have afforded \u201clocal courtesy\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the Delega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>tion\u2019s approved plan (the Wheatley Plan), as opposed to simply accepting and authorizing the plan to which the appellees consented. The Wheatley Plan, according to the appellants, should have been the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201cpoint of beginning,\u201d when reviewing Dembrow\u2019s Complaint. Consequently, in the appellants\u2019 view, the Circuit Court\u2019s recognition of the Wheatley Plan would have required Dembrow. and the Board to challenge the plan\u2019s constitutionality, to point out any infirmities it may have or why its adoption was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">The appellants final theory finds its basis in the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (\u201cthe D JA\u201d) of Maryland Code (1974, Repl. Vol. 2006) \u00a7\u00a7 3401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). Specifically, the appellants asseverate that \u201c[t]he lower court\u2019s Order is a complex amalgamation of forms of relief, none of which satisfy the statutory prerequisites for issuing a declaratory judgement as set forth in the [Act].\u201d The appellants maintain that the Act is \u201cremedial in nature\u201d and intended to settle matters involving \u201cuncertainty and insecurity.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the appellants emphasize the adversarial nature of the Act and claim that it was not satisfied below because there existed no controversy between the parties once they entered into an agreement to extinguish the Complaint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Circuit Court, thus, could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>have granted the relief requested by Dembrow and should have dismissed the action since, as the appellants submit, \u201clitigants in a pending civil lawsuit may [not] obtain a \u2018declaratory judgment\u2019 by consent.\u201d Similarly, the appellants argue that the court failed to adhere to the applicable rules for issuing a writ of mandamus, and that if its order could be construed as such that it \u201cwas entirely inappropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Finding no flaw in the Circuit Court\u2019s approval of the Consent Order, the appellees, not surprisingly, take the contrary view and urge this Court to enforce the Consent Order. The appellees\u2019 main argument, although based on different theories,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is that the Circuit Court did not err in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>approval of the agreement between them because, according to them, the court had, indeed, the authority to approve the Consent Order, \u201cwithout abridging the notion that the judicial branch ought not to inject itself into matters reserved solely for legislative or executive branch prerogative, and ought not inject itself into purely political matters at all,\u201d thus making the Consent Order binding on the Board and its conduct of the Carroll County elections for county commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The appellees argue that the General Assembly satisfied the requirements prescribed in Article VII of the Maryland Constitution for modifying the method of election of county commissioners when it adopted House Bill 290. They assert that, by enacting House Bill 290, without regard to the voter referendum provision, the General Assembly expressed its intention on the subject; \u201cby law,\u201d it provided for the election of five, instead of three, county commissioners and for their election by district, rather than at-large, in the 2006 election, subject only to the condition that the bill be approved by the Carroll County electorate. Once that condition was met, they maintain, \u201cthe legislation became fully effective and five Carroll County commissioners [were to] be elected in 2006 by district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Relying on Maryland Code (2003, 2006 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 12-202(a) of the Election Law Article and Maryland Code (1973, Repl. Vol. 2006) \u00a7 3-409 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the appellees asseverate further that the Circuit Court properly authorized the Consent Order. Indeed, they submit that the court not only was authorized, but it was compelled, by both \u00a7 3-101 and the failure of the General Assembly to delineate district lines, to \u201cset the districts and Order the Board of Elections to comply with the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">With regard to the speed with which the Circuit Court considered the issue, the appellees assert that, given the timing of the filing of the action, the deliberations that already had elapsed and the imminence of the general election, only months away, with its various procedural and filing deadlines, it was imperative for the Circuit Court to act when, and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>manner that it did to ensure the orderly conduct of that election. In any event, the appellees proffer that the Circuit Court did no more than it was required to do, simply approve the Consent Order, there having already been, over the course of the previous approximately three years, legislation by the General Assembly, a voter referendum, \u201cformal meetings\u201d of both the Committee and the Delegation on the matter and \u201cextensive public debate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Before turning to the merits of this case, it is important to review the two principles underlying the issue involved-separation of powers and redistricting. We will touch briefly on both these subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Maryland\u2019s separation of powers jurisprudence has its origin in the State\u2019s first Constitution. Thus, the doctrine is a part of the State\u2019s organic law. Found specifically in Article 6 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution of 1776, and dividing the powers of the state government into three departments, it mandated that the \u201clegislative,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> executive<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and judicial powers<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of government ought to be for ever separate and distinct from each other.\u201d In 1851, with the adoption of a new constitution, that language was incorporated, and expanded, to explicitly prohibit one branch of government from assuming or usurping the power of any other branch. As adopted in 1851, and as provided in the current Maryland Constitution,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Article 6 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>\u201cThat the legislative, executive and judicial powers of government ought to be for ever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">This Court has long recognized, and frequently discussed, the general maxim of the separation of powers. As early as 1829, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-5\">\u201cThe Constitution of this State, composed if [sic] the Declaration of Rights and form of government, is the immediate work of the people, in their sovereign capacity, and contains standing evidences of their permanent will.

[If a redistricting plan] meets constitutional muster, [it] will not be, indeed, cannot be, second guessed by the Court\u201d); <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>299 Md. 658, 688, 475 A.2d 428, 443 (1984) (\u201cEssentially, the districting process is a political exercise for determination by the legislature and not the judiciary ....\u201d); <em>see also LaPorte County Republican Cent.

When a redistricting plan that has been adopted, either by the Governor or the Legislature, is challenged, our inquiry begins by first looking at the plan on its face and taking into consideration whether, in light of the specific challenges, both federal and state legal requirements have been met. In <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>we articulated the process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">\u201cWhen, from the petitions and the answers alone, we perceive deviations that do not appear to be permissible, but for which there may be some explanation that could serve to justify them, we have appointed a special master, thus affording the State and the petitioners the opportunity to present evidence and argument to supply that explanation.

On the other hand, if we are satisfied that, despite the proffered explanation, the deviations are constitutionally impermissible, we have but one choice: declare the plan unconstitutional and void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOC\">370 Md. at 322, 805 A.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">To be sure, it is not this Court\u2019s charge to hold merely that a redistricting plan is invalid. If an adopted plan does not pass constitutional muster and is declared void, the Maryland Constitution requires us to do more-we must provide a remedy. There is no one remedy that is imposed in such cases, instead we evaluate the circumstance of each one on a case-by-case basis. When there is time to return the matter to the other political branches, giving them the opportunity to produce an amended, or even a new, plan, we have done so. When, however, there is the urgency of an upcoming election, we have chosen to fashion and adopt the redistricting plan ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Keeping in mind the above principles, we turn now to the merits of the case <em>sub judice. </em>The appellees rely on Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution, P.L.L. \u00a7 3-101 and CJP \u00a7 3-409 to support their position. We are not persuaded that any one, or a combination, of those authorities, imbued the Circuit Court with the power or authority to approve the Consent Order. Indeed, a stronger argument, a dispositive one, has been made, by the appellants in this case, that the Consent Order cannot be upheld on constitutional or statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The appellees urge this Court to accept that the General Assembly\u2019s inaction, in essence, compelled the Circuit Court to act, and effectively, if inadvertently, conferred on that court some semblance of authority to do so. This Court has held that \u201cArticle 8 [of the Declaration of Rights] prohibits the courts from performing non-judicial functions,\u201d <em>Consolidated Const. Servs., Inc. v.

More specifically, we have stated that the \u201c[t]he judicial department ha[s] no jurisdiction or right to interfere with the legislative process which was committed by the constitution ... to the Legislature itself.\u201d <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Randall, </em>209 Md. 18, 25, 120 A.2d 195, 199 (1956). It is clear that the provisions of the Consent Order agreeing \u201cto conduct the 2006 election of five (5) members of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners by district rather than at large,\u201d and adopting \u201cthe December 2005 recommendation of the Districting Committee also known as Option No. 2, and plac[ing] the said adopted recommendation for Carroll County Commissioner districts in place for the 2006 election by determination of the Carroll County Board of Eleetions[,]\u201d go beyond the functions of the judiciary, and, indeed interfere with the Legislature\u2019s authority to redistrict. In issuing its Order, the Circuit Court assumed a role that, in fact, constitutionally belongs to the legislative and executive departments of our government.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Article III, \u00a7 28 of the Maryland Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o bill ... shall become a Law unless it be passed in each House by a majority of the whole number of members elected____\u201d As previously discussed, House Bill 491 passed the House of Delegates, but failed to pass the Senate. Thus, there is no legislation at all to serve as the basis for the Consent Agreement. In <em>Watkins v. Watkins, </em>2 Md. 341 (1852), this Court was faced with a similar situation. In that case, our predecessors were asked to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the incumbent Adjutant General to deliver all materials germane to the office to the petitioner, who was his presumed and designated, though not confirmed, successor. Article 9, \u00a7 2 of the 1851 Maryland Constitution, applicable to the office of Adjutant General, provided that, \u201cthe Adjutant General shall be appointed by the Governor, by and with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>consent of the senate.... \u201d The petitioner was nominated by the Governor, but the petitioner did not receive the consent of the senate, as it failed to complete action on the nomination before the adjournment of the Legislature. The Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that he was entitled to succeed to, and hold, the office and held, instead, that, as prescribed by the Constitution, absent the concurrence of both the Governor and the senate, the incumbent Adjutant General would continue his commission. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-4\">\u201c[W]e have only to observe, that in all human contrivances confidence must be reposed somewhere, and that under the distribution of the powers of government in our State, it is not given to the judiciary to <em>compel </em>action on the part of a co-ordinate branch of the government. Its authority is confined to <em>restraining </em>the potency of its enactments when they transcend constitutional limits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">2 Md. at 355 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">More than a century later, this Court, once again, had the opportunity to address the separation of powers between the judiciary and the Legislature. In <em>Planning v. Randall, supra, </em>House Bill 505 was enacted by the General Assembly, but was subsequently vetoed by the Governor. Before the bill was returned to the House in which it originated for further action-it was thought that the bill would be passed over the Governor\u2019s veto-, an appeal was brought asking the Court to decide various questions of law pertaining to the bill. This Court, pointing out that legislative action had not been completed, stated, \u201c[cjertainly the Bill has not been <em>enacted. ... </em>It could hardly be contended that after one House had passed a bill the courts could enjoin the submission of that bill to the other House on the allegation that the bill as passed by one House was unconstitutional or unlawful.\u201d 209 Md. at 26-27, 120 A.2d at 199 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court dismissed the suit, holding that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Our sister states are in accord. In <em>Goodland v. Zimmerman, </em>243 Wis. 459, 10 N.W.2d 180 (1943), the court was asked to enjoin the Secretary of State from publishing an act enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ed by the Legislature. As prescribed by the Constitution of Wisconsin, a bill does not become effective as law until it is published. Thus, the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-4\">\u2018We are here dealing with a bill that has not yet become a law. There is no such thing known to the law as an unconstitutional bill. <em>A court cannot deal with the question of constitutionality until a law has been duly enacted and some person has been deprived of his [or her] constitutional rights by its operation. </em>In a proper case a court may declare whether the legislature has exceeded its constitutional powers in the enactment of the law complained of. * * * If a court can intervene and prohibit the publication of an act, the court determines what shall be law and not the legislature. If the court does that, it <em>does not in terms legislate but it invades the constitutional power of the legislature to declare what shall be law. This it may not do.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">10 N.W.2d at 183 (emphasis added). <em>See also State ex rel. Carson v. Kozer, </em>126 Or. 641, 270 P. 513, 516 (1928) (holding that \u201c[i]f [a] measure is unconstitutional, and should be adopted, the Constitution itself will require the courts, if the question is properly presented, to pronounce the measure to be unconstitutional; but the courts possess no such power as to any proposed bill before the same has become a law[.]\u201d); <em>Kuhn v. Curran, </em>184 Misc. 788, 792, 56 N.Y.S.2d 737 (N.Y.Sup.1944) (holding that \u201c[i]t cannot be supposed that when any citizen reaches the opinion that a law is unconstitutional he may, without any actual controversy and before the law begins to become operative, sue a State officer for a declaration of invalidity. This would amount to insinuation of the views of the judicial branch of the government into the legislative field\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Under the principles set forth in the above cases, it follows that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to enact House Bill 491, and, thus, adopt a redistricting plan for Carroll County, did not somehow authorize the Circuit Court to act. These cases make clear, in fact, that the Circuit Court\u2019s actions transcended its jurisdiction, usurping the Legislature\u2019s function in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>process. To be sure, the Circuit Court, as a trial court, not being accorded any authority, either by Constitutional provision or through statutory law, has no jurisdiction to create district lines. Thus, it follows, the court could not, in light of the General Assembly\u2019s inaction, step in and create, through a consent order, a redistricting plan for Carroll County. In other words, the April 19, 2006 Consent Order could not confer jurisdiction on the Circuit Court where none otherwise existed. <em>See, e.g., Montgomery County v. Bradford, </em>345 Md. 175, 206, 691 A.2d 1281, 1296 (1997) (Eldridge, J., dissenting) (noting that the fact that parties to an underlying litigation may consent to a decree cannot bring that litigation within the jurisdiction of the court) and cases there cited; <em>Price v. Hobbs, </em>47 Md. 359, 378 (1877) (\u201c[N]o consent of parties can confer power or jurisdiction on this Court\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Consistent with the foregoing, it is not the place of this Court to adopt a redistricting plan for Carroll County. While we agree with the appellants that the Circuit Court\u2019s Order should be vacated, thus, rejecting the adoption of Option 2, we do not, in doing so, grant them the relief they seek, <em>ie. </em>the adoption of the Wheatley Plan, or, in the alternative, permit the election of five commissioners at-large. Thus, it is clear that the judiciary, although permitted to act at certain junctures in the districting process, should not, otherwise interfere in the process. In other words, the power of judicial review does not equate to the power to exercise functions that are explicitly vested in the other organs of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Because House Bill 491 was never enacted, we consider all actions thus far, including those on behalf of the Committee, the Delegation, and even the parties in this suit, to be mere recommendations. There simply is no plan for this Court to review. Thus, what we have is a question entrusted, in the first instance and exclusively, to the Legislature, <em>ie. </em>its law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>making function to enact legislation and its power to redistrict. That being so, this Court is required, under the separation of powers doctrine, to give deference to the General Assembly\u2019s action, or, as in this case, inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We note and emphasize that P.L.L. \u00a7 3-101 contemplated, and so provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that any redistricting plan adopted by the Carroll County Delegation was to be approved by the General Assembly. In addition, under Article VII, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution, the plan would have to be adopted by the General Assembly. The statute addressed two issues. Not only did it address the number of commissioners, providing for the election of five, but it also addressed how they would be elected, opting for district elections and providing for the drawing of five of them. The language of the statute did not, indeed could not, in any manner, confer jurisdiction on the Circuit Court; it did quite the opposite. Providing that \u201cthe Commission Redistricting Committee shall report its recommendations to the Carroll County Legislative Delegation to the General Assembly for consideration at the following legislative session,\u201d P.L.L. \u00a7 3-101 was explicit in its intent and left little room for interpretation in terms of where the authority to create a redistricting plan ultimately resided. The Legislature was very deliberate in its language; thus, we cannot simply determine, as both parties would urge us to do, that the election should consist of five commissioners, who, because there has been no delineation of district lines by the General Assembly, will be elected at-large.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The common theory upon which both parties rely for their argument that there should be the election of five commissioners is the fact that the voters of Carroll County, through referendum, expressed their desire to change the method of election in the County and authorized the appointment of a committee to consider and adopt, for recommendation to the Legislative Delegation, a redistricting plan. The desire of the parties, and even the electorate, is not dispositive, however, as there exists a clear demarcation between desire and authority to act. While the interests of the parties, as well as all those involved in the redistricting process in Carroll County, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>certainly be valid, that is a matter for the Legislature and not for this Court. Regardless of what the electorate, the Committee, the Delegation, or the parties may desire, the fact remains that neither the Circuit Court, nor this Court, has the power to, in fact, grant the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Moreover, the plain language of P.L.L. \u00a7 3-101 and Article III, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution requiring action by the General Assembly to draw a redistricting plan simply cannot be severed. <em>See Park v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Baltimore City, </em>338 Md. 366, 384, 658 A.2d 687, 696 (1995); <em>Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54, 82-83, 344 A.2d 422, 439 (1975); <em>Maryland Unemployment Compensation Bd. v. Albrecht, </em>183 Md. 87, 95-96, 36 A.2d 666, 670 (1944); <em>Mayor and Council of Hagerstown v. Dechert, </em>32 Md. 369, 384 (1870). Contrary to the arguments of the parties, it is logical that in order to achieve the goal of a five commissioner election, there has to be a mechanism in place, one which we, as the Judiciary, cannot provide. This Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-5\">\u201c[a] valid statute can only be passed in the manner prescribed by the Constitution, and when the provisions of that instrument, in regard to the manner of enacting laws, are wholly disregarded, in respect to a particular Act, it would seem to be a necessary conclusion that the Act, though having the forms of authenticity, must be declared to be a nullity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-6\"><em>Harford County v. Bd. of Supervisors of Elections of Harford County, </em>272 Md. 33, 38, 321 A.2d 151, 154 (1974), <em>quoting Anne Arundel County v. Moushabek, </em>269 Md. 419, 422-23, 306 A.2d 517, 519 (1973); <em>Legg v. Annapolis, </em>42 Md. 203, 221 (1875). We hold the Circuit Court\u2019s approval and authorization of the Consent Order was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The appellees fare no better under Maryland statutory law. The appellees claim that under CJP \u00a7 3-409, <em>supra, </em>the Circuit Court had the authority to review the matter below for declaratory judgment and to approve the Consent Order. The appellees claim further that, notwithstanding the final agreement reached between them in the trial court, that at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>outset of the matter there existed \u201can actual controversy.\u201d <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-409(a). The appellants, while agreeing with the appellees that there did exist an initial controversy, proffer that that was simply not enough.

Moreover, the proper forum for Dembrow\u2019s objection was in that same court. Instead, both motions to intervene were unopposed.

Our discussion of both the Board\u2019s and the Circuit Court\u2019s authority, <em>infra, </em>serves to address this issue raised by the appellants. As such, we will not specifically address the appellants\u2019 mandamus argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b946-9\">. While their arguments for why the Circuit Court\u2019s Order should be affirmed are based on different grounds in their briefs, at oral argument, the Board adopted appellee Dembrow's arguments in addition to its own. On brief, the Board argued that the Circuit Court\u2019s approval of the Consent Order was proper because the Board had the statutory authority not only to enter into the agreement with Dembrow, but to create district lines for the upcoming elections. In asserting this position, the Board equated the creation of district lines to the creation of precinct lines or boundaries. It relied on Maryland Code (2003, 2006 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 2-202(b)(6) and 2-303(a)(l) of the Election Law Article, which provide, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">\"(b) <em>Powers and duties. </em>\u2014 Each local board, in accordance with the provisions of this article and regulations adopted by the State Board, shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\"(6) establish and alter the boundaries and number of precincts in accordance with \u00a7 2-303 of this title, and provide a suitable polling place for each precinct, and assign voters to precincts[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">\"(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this section, as it deems it expedient for the convenience of voters, a local board may: \"(i) create and alter the boundaries for precincts in the county;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">\"(ii) designate the location for polling places in any election district, ward, or precinct in the county; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">\"(iii) combine or abolish precincts.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">The Board also relied on a number of Attorney General Opinions. <em>See </em>35 Opinions of the Attorney General 167 (1950) (noting the action of an election board \"establishing new election districts\u201d); 16 Opinions of the Attorney General 121 (1931) (noting the authority of a local board to \"sub-divide\u201d election districts and precincts); 56 Opinions of the Attorney General (recognizing the power of election officials to either sub-divide of change the boundaries of precincts).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Although not specifically at issue in the case sub <em>judice, </em>the Board\u2019s argument deserves some comment. The Board\u2019s reasoning is a stretch at best. As defined in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>a \"precinct\u201d is \"a <em>geographical unit </em>of government, such as an election district, a police district, or a judicial district,\u201d while a \"distrid\u201d is defined as \"a territorial area into which a country, state, county, municipality, or other political subdivision is <em>divided for judicial, political, electoral, or administrative purposes.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>goes on to define a \"legislative district\" as \u201ca geographical subdivision of a state <em>for the purpose of electing legislative representatives.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">To be sure, in the context of election matters, a precinct is the place one may go in order to cast one\u2019s vote, while a district constitutes the number of persons a particular legislator or appointee may legally represent in a particular jurisdiction based on the apportionment of the jurisdiction. A district, although also a \"geographical\u201d area in the literal sense of the word, has much more significance than a precinct, and its creation is not within the purview of local elections boards. Indeed, the redistricting of a state, as discussed in greater detail later in this opinion, is primarily a legislative task and should be left to that branch of the State\u2019s government.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Notwithstanding the various \u201cinterpretations\u201d made by the Attorney General, authority which it is important to note is not binding on this Court, see <em>City of Baltimore Dev.

Lamone, </em>398 Md. 146, 174, 919 A.2d 1223, 1240, <em>quoting Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003); <em>Condon v.

We have, moreover, stated that our interpretation of statutes should not lead to absurd results. <em>Abrams, </em>398 Md. at 187, 919 A.2d at 1248, <em>citing Montgomery County Comm'rs v. Supervisors of Elections of Montgomery County, </em>192 Md. 196, 208, 63 A.2d 735, 740 (1948); <em>Comptroller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 539, 404 A.2d 1045, 1053 (1979). Following the Board\u2019s logic, giving local boards of elections the authority to create county districts, the State Board would be permitted to redistrict the State. We reject the Board's argument incorporating into \u00a7\u00a7 2-202(b)(6) and 2-303(a)(l) of the Election Law Article the word \"district.\u201d Thus, the only authority vested in the Board under those provisions is to delineate precincts lines or boundaries, not district lines. That function is primarily ministerial and intended to facilitate the elections process.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Moreover, this Court has stated, while recognizing the essential function of administrative agencies, such as the Board, within the State\u2019s operation, that we are \"bound to ensure that those agencies act within the confines of their delegated power.\u201d <em>Benson v.

The right of the Legislature to delegate powers to administrative agencies long has been recognized in this State. <em>Harrison v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>1 Gill 264 (1843). However, \"a legislatively delegated power to make rules and regulations is administrative in nature, and it is not and can not be the power to make laws; it is only the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of the legislature as expressed by the statute.

As the appellants point out correctly, the <em>only </em>delegated power granted to the Board was to, in fact, appoint one member to the Committee in order to craft a redistricting plan to submit to the Delegation.
