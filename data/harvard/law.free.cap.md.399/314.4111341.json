Respondents claimed that they each had sustained an accidental injury or occupational disease, known as \u201csick building syndrome,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arising out of and in the course of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>employment, due to exposure to toxic mold. The issue presented in this case is whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion by not holding a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing pursuant to our holding in <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978), to determine the admissibility of the testimony of respondents\u2019 expert, Ritchie Shoemaker, M.D., and specifically, to decide whether the doctor\u2019s methodologies used for diagnosis and theories regarding the causal connection between mold exposure and certain human health effects are generally accepted in the scientific community for that purpose. We shall hold that the expert\u2019s testimony should have been the subject of a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Respondents, Josephine Chesson, Martha Knight, Carole Silberhorn, Linda Gamble, Kenneth Lyons, and Connie Collins, were employees of the Baltimore Washington Conference of the United Methodist Church, and worked at the Church\u2019s offices located at 9720 Patuxent Woods Parkway, Columbia, Maryland. On November 18, 2002, several employees working in the office building noticed a foul odor emanating from the walls. A maintenance crew broke through an interior wall and discovered two types of mold, Aspergillus and Stachybotrys.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Respondents each filed a claim with the Maryland Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission, alleging that they had sustained an accidental injury or occupational disease known as sick building syndrome due to mold exposure on November 18, 2002. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1999, 2006 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission held a hearing and disallowed two of respondents\u2019 claims and awarded partial compensation to the remaining respondents after finding accidental injury or occupational disease due to mold exposure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1999, 2006 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 9-737 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article, and a joint motion to consolidate the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The Circuit Court consolidated the claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each respondent had been examined and treated by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker, a licensed medical doctor and board-certified physician in the field of family medicine. Prior to trial, petitioner filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude the testimony of Dr. Shoemaker on the grounds that his theories and methodologies for diagnosis regarding a causal connection between mold exposure and certain human health effects had not been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. Petitioner requested a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, addressing the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The diagnosis of sick building syndrome, or bio toxic illness, assumes the causal relationship of the symptoms, to the bio toxic illness. It\u2019s \u2014 the diagnosis in itself, of the bio toxic illness, is that this particular illness exists, as a legitimate illness. Unfortunately, the ICD-9 classifications, which lists all diagnosis, for all illnesses, do not recognize bio toxic illness as an illness. It\u2019s also not recognized by the CDC, the Institute of Medicine, and NIOSH, The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Arrival at that diagnosis of bio toxic illness, uses techniques not generally accepted by the scientific community, which is the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">Dr. Shoemaker focuses on a constellation of symptoms as being caused by bio toxic illness. This constellation of symptoms is not accepted as an illness from mold. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>fundamental principles of differential diagnosis require that you rule out other causes of illnesses from symptoms that are presented from the patient. The first thing you would do is rule out known illnesses, not an illness that you happen to have made up yourself, and that is not accepted by the ICD-9 classifications. For example, the symptoms presented by these claimants could include: allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, stress at the belief of being ill; those illnesses were not even considered by Dr. Shoemaker. He took the constellation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">THE COURT: Excuse me, wouldn\u2019t that go to the weight, rather than the admissibility of his opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, because you must base your opinion on accepted medical and scientific data. Using a constellation of symptoms, and concluding that it\u2019s sick building syndrome, is not a generally accepted method for diagnosis. The generally accepted method for diagnosis is to rule out different illnesses that are accepted as illnesses. In addition, accepting a patient\u2019s prior medical history just by having them tell you, -without verifying the accuracy of the information, is not a generally accepted form of diagnosis. Dr. Shoemaker, by his own admission, reviewed no medical evidence, whatsoever, concerning prior illnesses. In addition, he prescribes a drug, Cholestyramine, for the treatment of bio toxic illness, and the FDA has not approved Cholestyramine for the treatment of bio toxic illness because, of course, they don\u2019t recognize bio toxic illness as a legitimate illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">The modifying of the accepted diagnostic tools, also comes under a <em>Frye-Reed </em>evaluation, and that is exactly what Dr. Shoemaker is doing. He\u2019s saying, look there\u2019s five thousand tests of the visual-contrast sensitivity test. There\u2019s, you know, four thousand studies on Cholestyramine, but what he is not telling you, is that those studies are being modified for his use; his use is unique, and new, it\u2019s a new scientific technique and it should be looked at under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>When we look at these issues with diagnosis and treatment, we haven\u2019t even gotten yet to his expression of \u2018causal relationship.\u2019 If he can separate out where he has diagnosis, and then goes to \u2018causal relationship,\u2019 I\u2019d sure like to see it, because by the time these people even got to him, he had already diagnosed sick building syndrome. He sent out the questionnaires, they filled them out, and sent them back, or brought them back and, by that time, he found sick building syndrome. He didn\u2019t do any differential diagnosis, even though he says he did. He didn\u2019t do any testing that is accepted as \u2014 by the general scientific community for mold related illnesses, such as: allergy testing, spirometry testing \u2014 he decides that blood work is the way to go with mold. That visual-contrast sensitivity tests, which are used to test the vision of pilots, is what is used for mold. That \u2014 those techniques, though they may be established for other causes, have been modified for Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s purposes and, therefore, they should be under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">His tests, and his methods are completely experimental. He is the self-proclaimed forerunner in this area of law. He admits that he\u2019s the one that developed this\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">The problem with Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s experience is it\u2019s all anecdotal. The anecdotal evidence that he sees from treating people with Physteria and from what he sees\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">THE COURT: Physteria were the fish down in Pocomoke City, or the Pocomoke River, or something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s corrects THE COURT: \u2014 or the Chesapeake Bay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">THE COURT: Yeah\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 that\u2019s right. And he uses that anecdotal evidence and anecdotal evidence from his treatment of mold patients. The problem with that is, it assumes that the test he uses to get to those diagnoses are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>generally accepted and they\u2019re not the generally accepted way to diagnose a mold related illness, which is to look at the prior medical records, physically look at them, see what these people have been experiencing prior to the mold exposure. It\u2019s to do allergy testing, spirometry testing, and then come up with a differential diagnosis by excluding known illnesses, not by automatically assuming that this constellation of symptoms means sick building syndrome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">THE COURT: Well, if I were going to \u2014 before I could do what you\u2019re asking me to do, if indeed, this would have to be submitted to the <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis, then would I not have to have a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, as opposed to just say, \u2018oh, well, I agree with you,\u2019 wouldn\u2019t I be entitled to have a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We can bring our experts in, Your Honor, and Dr. Shoemaker is already on video.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Respondents maintained that because Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s opinion was a medical opinion, offered as that of a general practitioner and treating physician, the testimony was admissible and not the proper subject of a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The Circuit Court agreed with respondents and denied petitioner\u2019s request for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201cI\u2019m prepared to rule on the motion <em>in limine, </em>and I\u2019m satisfied, from the evidence. I\u2019m going to deny the motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker, and I have reviewed the entire submissions and responses, and the cases that you\u2019ve cited, and also have reviewed, with interest, the deposition of Dr. Shoemaker, and I\u2019m satisfied, from the evidence that, regardless of where he starts, that Dr. Shoemaker has people fill out a form, which is not an uncommon practice among physicians, or physician\u2019s offices, but \u2014 he then goes on and he takes a history, and \u2014 of the patients, and he physically examines them, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>then does testing, and the particular tests that he uses are different various and sundry blood tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">And he also indicated that he\u2019s spending, approximately, seventy-five percent of his professional time, now, dealing with bio toxic related illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">His particular entry into this area, and notoriety, came with the Physteria problem in Maryland, and I noted, in reviewing his deposition, that he had a particular interest in wetlands, and causal relationship with that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">But we\u2019re talking about a board-certified physician, who has devoted, apparently, in the last five or six years, more than fifty percent of his time to this area of specialty, and I\u2019m satisfied that this is not a <em>Frye-Reed </em>situation, it\u2019s \u2018diagnosis by a medical practitioner,\u2019 and he, while they have not adopted, or adapted his publications, and things that he has developed; he\u2019s published widely in this field, he\u2019s gone to law school, and consulted, and he\u2019s indicated he\u2019s worked with a number of other doctors in this area; I\u2019m satisfied that he\u2019s qualified to render opinions in this area, and his opinions would be admissible in the things you mentioned that go to their weight, rather than their admissibility. So I am going to deny the motion <em>in limine. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The case proceeded to trial and Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony was admitted on behalf of respondents. The jury returned verdicts in favor of each respondent, finding a causal relationship between mold exposure and certain illnesses claimed by respondents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court, petitioner raised the argument he raises before this Court: that the Circuit Court erred when it accepted Dr. Shoemaker as an expert witness without first holding a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether his medical opinions and methods of diagnosing patients are generally accepted within the scientific community. The intermediate appellate court rejected petitioner\u2019s argument, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201cAs in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we have previously held that expert opinions concerning the cause or origin of an individual\u2019s condition are not subject to <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis. In <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 460, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991), <em>cert, denied, Fibreboard Corp. v. Myers, </em>325 Md. 249, 600 A.2d 418 (1992), we reversed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of appellant\u2019s expert causation opinion regarding asbestos exposure and cancer. In distinguishing the facts of <em>Myers </em>from a case that would invoke a <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis, we explained that the fact that \u2018exposure to asbestos may cause cancer ... is not a novel or controversial assertion, nor is it a conclusion personal to Dr. Schepers.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 458, 594 A.2d 1248. We also stressed that the <em>Reed </em>holding had \u2018not been extended to medical opinion evidence which [was] not presented as a scientific test [,] the results of which were controlled by inexorable, physical laws.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 391 A.2d 364 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We revisited <em>Myers </em>in the case of <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004), <em>cert. granted, </em>384 Md. 581, 865 A.2d 589 (2005), <em>cert, dismissed, </em>387 Md. 351, 875 A.2d 702 (2005), in which we affirmed the trial court\u2019s acceptance of expert medical opinion testimony. Referring to our opinion in <em>Myers, </em>Judge Moylan reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqL\">A doctor\u2019s opinion as to the etiology of his patient\u2019s arthritis is simply not the type of thing contemplated by the phrase \u2018new and novel scientific technique [required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>by the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test].\u2019 What is contemplated are new, and arguably questionable, techniques such as lie detector tests, breathalyzer tests, paraffin tests, DNA identification, voiceprint identification, as in the <em>Reed </em>case itself, and the use of polarized light microscopy to identify asbestos fibers ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 187, 858 A.2d 1025.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>Montgomery Mutual v. Chesson, </em>170 Md.App. 551, 569-70, 907 A.2d 873, 884 (2006). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing was not necessary to address Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s theory of causation because that was part of his medical diagnosis, and that the Circuit Court committed no error in denying the motion <em>in limine </em>because Dr. Shoemaker utilized medical tests that are generally accepted in the scientific community. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 907 A.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company filed a petition for writ of certiorari before this Court. We granted that petition to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201cWhether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker\u2019s own, unsupported, testimony about his practices and expertise renders his opinions concerning mold related illnesses admissible without the necessity of a <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\"><em>Montgomery Mut. v. Chesson, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Before this Court, petitioner argues that the Circuit Court should have held a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony. Petitioner states that under a proper <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis, Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony should have been excluded from trial because his methodologies, techniques, and tests used to formulate his opinions regarding mold exposure and sick building syndrome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>have not been generally accepted in the scientific community.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that it was, at a very minimum, entitled to demonstrate at an evidentiary hearing before the Circuit Court the basis for its argument that Dr. Shoemaker should not have been permitted to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Respondents contend that <em>Frye-Reed </em>applies only to the appropriateness of new scientific techniques, and that there was no need for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing in this case because Dr. Shoemaker based his diagnosis on techniques which are generally accepted in the scientific community. Respondents argue that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s medical opinion concerning causa<em>tion </em>\u2014 i.e., that exposure to mold caused sick building syndrome in respondents-was not a proper topic for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Maryland Rule 5-702 addresses the testimony of expert witnesses at trial. The Rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cExpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">(1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">(2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>(3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">A trial judge has wide latitude in determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence, and his sound discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless the decision to admit the expert testimony was clearly erroneous or constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 200, 803 A.2d 1034, 1039 (2002); <em>Massie v. State, </em>349 Md. 834, 850-51, 709 A.2d 1316, 1324 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Maryland adheres to the standard set forth in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923), for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence and expert scientific testimony. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 389, 391 A.2d at 372 (adopting the <em>Frye </em>standard). Under the <em>Fryer-Reed </em>test, a party must establish first that any novel scientific method is reliable and accepted generally in the scientific community before the court will admit expert testimony based upon the application of the questioned scientific technique. <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201, 803 A.2d at 1039. A trial court may take judicial notice of the reliability of scientific techniques and methodologies that are widely accepted within the scientific community. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 380, 391 A.2d at 367. A trial court also may take notice that certain scientific theories are viewed as unreliable, bogus, or experimental. <em>Id. </em>However, when it is unclear whether the scientific community accepts the validity of a novel scientific theory or methodology, we have noted that before testimony based on the questioned technique may be admitted into evidence, the reliability must be demonstrated. <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201, 803 A.2d at 1039-40. While the most common practice will include witness testimony, a court may take judicial notice of journal articles from reliable sources and other publications which may shed light on the degree of acceptance <em>vel non </em>by recognized experts of a particular process or view. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 380, 391 A.2d at 367. The opinion of an \u201cexpert\u201d witness should be admitted only if the court finds that \u201cthe basis of the opinion is generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201, 803 A.2d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Where evidence is subject to challenge under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>it is the better practice for a court to address the issue pre-trial and out of the presence of the jury. <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 347-48 n. 6, 896 A.2d 1059, 1064 n. 6 (2006). <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearings are best held before trial in order to preclude jury members from considering irrelevant evidence and to ensure that the verdict is derived from evidence which is before the jury properly. <em>Id. </em>at 348 n. 6, 896 A.2d at 1064 n. 6. As we noted in <em>Reed, \u201cFrye </em>was deliberately intended to interpose a substantial obstacle to the unrestrained admission of evidence based upon new scientific principles.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 386, 391 A.2d at 370 (quoting <em>People v. Kelly, </em>17 Cal.3d 24, 130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240, 1245 (1976)). In addition, <em>Frye-Reed </em>generally involves matters collateral to the substantive issues at trial, and for that reason alone is better resolved outside of the presence of the jury. <em>Clemons, </em>392 Md. at 348 n. 6, 896 A.2d at 1064 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that it was unnecessary for the Circuit Court to hold a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, reasoning (1) that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s medical diagnosis was not a proper subject for <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis, and (2) that the tests Dr. Shoemaker used in reaching his medical diagnoses are generally accepted in the medical community, and are therefore not subject to <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis. <em>Montgomery Mutual, </em>170 Md.App. at 560, 907 A.2d at 878. We disagree and hold that, based on this record, the Circuit Court should have held a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the medical community generally accepts the theory that mold exposure causes the illnesses that respondents claimed to have suffered, and the propriety of the tests Dr. Shoemaker employed to reach his medical conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">This Court has emphasized repeatedly that <em>Frye-Reed </em>is meant to apply to evidence based on scientific opinion. <em>See Clemons, </em>392 Md. at 364, 896 A.2d at 1073; <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201, 803 A.2d at 1040; <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 381, 391 A.2d at 368. The proper test for determining admissibility under <em>Frye-Reed </em>\u201cis whether the basis of the opinion is generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>field.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201, 803 A.2d at 1040. Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony was based on scientific opinion regarding the causal link between mold exposure and sick building syndrome. As such, both his theories regarding causation and the tests he employed to diagnose respondents were subject to <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Our decision in <em>Wilson </em>helps to demonstrate this point. In <em>Wilson, </em>we found that the trial court erred in permitting the State to use statistical data and a product rule computation to prove the improbability of two Sudden Infant Death Syndrome deaths in a single family. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 803 A.2d at 1036. While admitting that Frye-Reed \u201coften will not apply to statistical calculations because the choice between alternative statistical techniques, although subjective, is often merely a choice between equally valid methods of describing the same underlying scientific data,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 202, 803 A.2d at 1040 (quoting <em>Armstead v.

Similarly, <em>CSX </em>involved a medical opinion regarding the etiology of a patient\u2019s arthritis. In both cases, the intermediate appellate court found that <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis was unnecessary because <em>\u201cReed v.

This case fits well within the Maryland rule permitting and providing for a limited remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Maryland Rule 8-604(d) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201c(d) Remand. (1) Generally. If the Court concludes that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment, or that justice will be served by permitting further proceedings, the Court may remand the case to a lower court. In the order remanding a case, the appellate court shall state the purpose for the remand. The order of remand and the opinion upon which the order is based are conclusive as to the points decided. Upon remand, the lower court shall conduct any further proceedings necessary to determine the action in accordance with the opinion and order of the appellate court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">A limited remand is appropriate in various circumstances, in both civil and criminal cases, and most notably \u201cwhen the purposes of justice will be advanced by permitting further proceedings.\u201d <em>Southern v. State, </em>371 Md. 93, 104, 807 A.2d 13, 19-20 (2002). A remand may be limited if the error occurred in a proceeding collateral to the trial itself, and the limited purpose of the remand is to correct the error that occurred during the collateral proceeding. <em>Lipinski v. State, </em>333 Md. 582, 591, 636 A.2d 994, 998 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Our jurisprudence is replete with examples where a limited remand is proper. <em>See e.g., Edmonds v.

For example, in <em>Brim v. State, </em>695 So.2d 268 (Fla.1997), the Florida Supreme Court ordered a limited remand after determining that DNA population frequency tests were subject to analysis under the <em>Frye </em>test. The court noted that there would be no need to overturn the verdict if the trial court found that the methods satisfied the <em>Frye </em>test; a new trial would be necessary only if the trial court reached a contrary conclusion and found the tests should have been inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 275. Likewise, in <em>People v. Leahy, 8 </em>Cal.4th 587, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 663, 882 P.2d 321 (1994), the California Supreme Court ordered a limited remand to hold a <em>Kelly-Frye </em>hearing. In addressing the propriety of certain field sobriety tests, California\u2019s highest court noted that retrial of the case might be unnecessary because the questioned scientific evidence could be found admissible at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>34 Cal.Rptr.2d 663, 882 P.2d at 335. <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>State v.

Verdicts should not be vacated unnecessarily, and in this case, a retrial may not be necessary. Indeed, it would be a grave injustice were we to reverse the judgment and vacate the verdict, and then the trial court, after a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, determined properly that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony was generally accepted within the scientific community. Accordingly, we remand this case for an evidentiary hearing to ascertain whether Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s methodologies used for diagnosis and theories regarding the causal connection between mold exposure and certain human health effects are generally accepted in the scientific community. The trial court is directed to make factual findings and conclusions and then to issue a <em>Frye-Reed </em>determination. If the trial court finds that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s methods and theories satisfy the Frye-Reed test, the judgment should remain in effect. If the court finds to the contrary, the judgment should be vacated. Our remand is limited solely to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED.

While we offer no opinion on the general acceptance of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s medical conclusions, we think it clear that his theories are not the proper subject of judicial notice. The debate on toxic mold and sick building syndrome has become increasingly prevalent in American courtrooms, and courts across the country have reached differing conclusions regarding the causal relationship between mold exposure and sick building syndrome. <em>See e.g., Mondelli v.
