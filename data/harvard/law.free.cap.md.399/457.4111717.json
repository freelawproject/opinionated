In this Court, the petitioner argues that the Circuit Court erred in admitting hearsay evidence and that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that general objections during trial did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>preserve the hearsay issue for appeal. Mr. Boyd also maintains that the intermediate appellate court erroneously affirmed the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of Mr. Boyd\u2019s alleged prior bad conduct. The respondent, the State of Maryland, argues that, \u201cto the extent\u201d that the hearsay issue was \u201cpreserved\u201d for appeal, the Circuit Court\u2019s rulings admitting the challenged evidence were correct. We shall reverse the Court of Special Appeals, hold that the hearsay issue was preserved, and hold that the admission into evidence of hearsay and of other \u201cbad acts\u201d was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Ronald Boyd and Cathleen Weaver are the parents of Lyric Weaver-Boyd who was born on May 7, 2003. Mr. Boyd and Ms. Weaver had not expressly agreed upon custody or a visitation schedule after Lyric\u2019s birth, and Lyric lived with Ms. Weaver. Until February 2004, Mr. Boyd visited his daughter whenever he wanted. On February 17, 2004, Mr. Boyd attempted to visit his daughter, and Ms. Weaver refused to permit the visit because Lyric was sleeping. This led to an argument between the two, with Mr. Boyd allegedly threatening Ms. Weaver. The next day, February 18, 2004, Mr. Boyd came to Ms. Weaver\u2019s place of employment and allegedly threatened her. On February 19, 2004, Ms. Weaver filed a petition in the District Court of Maryland for a protective order, and an interim protective order was issued on that date. The protective order was based on the February 17th and February 18th incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">On February 23, 2004, with Mr. Boyd\u2019s consent, a final protective order was entered by the District Court. The final protective order in pertinent part provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\u201cAfter the appearance of the PETITIONER [WEAVER], RESPONDENT [BOYD], and in consideration of the petition and evidence, the Court makes the following findings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">A. That CATHLEEN WEAVER, who is a Person(s) Eligible for Relief, is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>An individual who has a child in common with the Respondent. DAUGHTER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">B. That the Respondent consents to the entry of a Protective Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">Based on the foregoing findings, the Court hereby ORDERS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">1. That, unless otherwise stated below, this Order is effective until 12/01/2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">2. That the Respondent SHALL NOT abuse, threaten to abuse, and/or harass THE PETITIONER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">3. That Respondent SHALL NOT contact, (in person, by telephone, in writing, or by any other means) and/or attempt to contact THE PETITIONER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">4. That the Respondent SHALL NOT enter the Residence of CATHLEEN WEAVER at 3219 AVON AVE, BALTIMORE MD 21218.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-11\">(Residence includes yard, grounds, outbuildings, and common areas surrounding the dwelling.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-12\">5.

That the Custody of LYRIC BOYD is awarded to THE PETITIONER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-18\">7. That visitation is granted to THE RESPONDENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-19\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-20\">\u201cThe children) shall be delivered and picked up for visitation and returned afterwards as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>CONTACT BARBARA FOWLKES \u2014 MOTHER OF PET. VISITATION HOURS SUNDAY AND MONDAY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A10\">Pursuant to Mr. Boyd\u2019s request, the District Court on April 14, 2004, modified the final protective order to provide specific hours for visitation. The modified final protective order specified visitation hours for Mr. Boyd every Sunday from 9:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M. and every other Monday from 9:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Until July 11, 2004, Mr. Boyd\u2019s visitation with his daughter, pursuant to the modified order, took place without any problems. On Sunday, July 11, 2004, however, another argument occurred. As scheduled according to the visitation arrangements in the modified protective order, Mr. Boyd on July 11th picked up Lyric from the home of Ms. Weaver\u2019s mother, Barbara Fowlkes. He returned her that evening 50 minutes late. Upon returning his daughter, Mr. Boyd and Ms. Fowlkes engaged in an argument. Mr. Boyd attempted to leave with Lyric, but several neighbors and a police officer prevented him from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">On the following Sunday, July 18, 2004, Ms. Weaver decided not to permit visitation, although she failed to inform Mr. Boyd of this decision. Ms. Weaver instead decided to take Lyric to Artscape, a cultural arts festival in Baltimore City. Mr. Boyd, along with his friend Pam Wilson, went to Ms. Fowlkes\u2019s home to pick up Lyric for his scheduled visitation, but no one answered the door. He subsequently telephoned Ms. Fowlkes twice, but she hung up on him each time. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Boyd arrived at Ms. Fowlkes\u2019s home with two police officers. Ms. Fowlkes informed the police officers and Mr. Boyd that neither Ms. Weaver nor Lyric was there. The officers and Mr. Boyd left.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Ms. Weaver testified that, on her way to Artscape, she saw Mr. Boyd riding in a truck driven by Pam Wilson. Both the truck and Ms. Weaver were stopped at the same traffic light, although they were headed in different directions. Later, as Ms. Weaver continued on her route, she testified that the truck was following her, a few vehicles behind her. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to Ms. Weaver\u2019s testimony, she continued for several more blocks, eventually using her cell phone to call the police because the truck was still following her. The police instructed Ms. Weaver to stop driving so that a police car could catch up with her. Ms. Weaver parked her car on McMeeken Street; the truck turned before reaching her and continued on another street.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">A police car pulled alongside Ms. Weaver, and an officer told Ms. Weaver that he would follow her to a parking place for Artscape and then accompany her to Artscape. Once she found a parking place, Ms. Weaver put Lyric in her stroller and started walking toward the police car. As she was walking, Ms. Weaver noticed the truck drive past the police car, and the police officer also noticed the truck. Ms. Wilson, who was driving the truck, testified that Mr. Boyd \u201cwas upset because his daughter has chronic asthma and she had [his] daughter out in the pouring down rain.\u201d Ms. Wilson parked the truck nearby, and Mr. Boyd \u201cwent over to the police officer with his visitation papers that he had gotten from the court.\u201d The police officer told Mr. Boyd to wait in the truck, and Mr. Boyd then returned to the truck. The officer \u201cran him for a warrant check,\u201d and thereafter arrested Mr. Boyd on an unrelated, open warrant. At no time on July 18th did Mr. Boyd approach or talk to Ms. Weaver. The State later charged Mr. Boyd with violating the February 23, 2004, final protective order. The charge was based entirely upon the events on July 18, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Before trial, the State filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, including Ms. Weaver\u2019s petition for the protective order, testimony concerning the February incidents, and testimony relating to the July 11, 2004, incident. At the pretrial hearing on the motion, the State argued that the petition itself, and testimony about the incidents, were relevant to understand why Ms. Weaver sought protection from Mr. Boyd. According to the State, the information in the petition for a protective order and the proposed testimony required a \u201cprior bad acts analysis.\u201d The pertinent Maryland Rule of Evidence states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cRule 5-404. Character evidence not admissible to prove conduct; exceptions; other crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201c(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. \u2014 Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The State asserted that the petition for a protective order and evidence regarding the February incidents fell under the special relevance exception of \u201cabsence of mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The defense, at the hearing on the motion <em>in </em>limine, agreed that the protective order itself was admissible, but argued against the admissibility of the petition and other evidence concerning the February incidents, asserting that the evidence did not fall under any Rule 5-404(b) exception. Mr. Boyd\u2019s attorney argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201cthe nature of the acts that are alleged by Ms. Weaver that support her seeking protection are again, Your Honor, prior bad acts. And unless that \u2014 they don\u2019t seem to be relevant to the case and they seem greatly prejudicial to Mr. Boyd and not relevant \u2014 not probative \u2014 not helpful to the jury in deciding whether Mr. Boyd violated the final protective order which we concede was in place on February 23rd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAO\">At the pretrial hearing, with regard to the incident on July 11, 2004, the State argued that testimony about the event should be admissible because it showed harassment by Mr. Boyd and showed Ms. Weaver\u2019s state of mind. In addition, the State maintained that such evidence \u201cgoes to [Mr. Boyd\u2019s] absence of mistake again because just a week prior he knew that there were problems.\u201d The defense responded that admission of testimony regarding the July 11, 2004, incident would result in a \u201cmini trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The Circuit Court, during the pretrial hearing, heard testimony from Ms. Weaver about the incidents on February 17th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>and 18th so that it could assess whether, by clear and convincing evidence, the events described in the petition for a protective order took place. Thereafter, the court granted the motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling in favor of the State on the admissibility of the petition for the protective order, testimony about the February incidents described therein, and testimony concerning the July 11th incident. As to the petition and testimony about the February incidents, the Circuit Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u201cI do find having listened to Ms. Weaver\u2019s testimony that the State has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the conduct occurred. Further, I believe that the probative value of the evidence outweighs any potential prejudice. So, I\u2019m going to admit that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The court did not specify what category of admissibility, listed in Rule 5 \u2014 404(b), encompassed the evidence about the February incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In explaining its ruling with respect to the July 11th incident, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s another bad act on Mr. Boyd\u2019s part. So I don\u2019t think it needs to be analyzed under 5-404. I think it has minimal probative value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">\u201cHowever, after thinking about it, it could tend to prove or disprove facts that could be relevant in this case. I don\u2019t think it shows any intent to harass on his part or bears on the harassment. However, my understanding is that by the proffer the State\u2019s evidence in this ease is going to be that Mr. Boyd and Ms. Wilson followed Ms. Weaver on July 18th which was a visitation day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\u201cAnd I further understand from what the parties told me ... that Ms. Weaver had because of this incident refused to give Mr. Boyd visitation on that day. I think it may be important to the context to hear that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">\u2018When I say it\u2019s potentially prejudicial I think it\u2019s potentially prejudicial, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prejudicial in the sense it\u2019s going to make the jury find Mr. Boyd guilty of harassment on July 18th. I think it\u2019s potentially prejudicial because I don\u2019t particularly want to spend time trying what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>happened at this fracas on July the 11th and I don\u2019t want to divert the jury\u2019s attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cHowever, finding no prejudice in the sense that I think it would tend to make the jury convict Mr. Boyd of harassment on the 18th, I am going to permit some evidence of it. I don\u2019t know what Mr. Boyd\u2019s evidence is going to be, but it seems to me both parties may get into what happened before in terms of why ... what happened on the 18th happened on the 18th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult to have evidence of what happened on the 18th without any evidence as to what happened on the 11th. So, I\u2019m not going to exclude that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">At trial, defense counsel repeatedly objected to the introduction of the evidence ruled on by the Circuit Court at the pretrial hearing on the motion <em>in limine. </em>During Ms. Fowlkes\u2019s testimony, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I just need to make a record. I\u2019m objecting to all these references to July 11th. All the testimony. I don\u2019t want to keep objecting every time you ask her a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: What do you mean by all the testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m trying to enter a standing objection to any testimony that\u2019s elicited about the July 11th incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Well, in accordance with my prior ruling\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand. I\u2019m just making a record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">At the beginning of Ms. Weaver\u2019s testimony regarding the February 2004 incidents, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-14\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your honor, I\u2019m going to object.

I don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s just that this is another different incident that\u2019s coming in so I\u2019m going to make a standing objection to all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: This is the February incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: February ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-15\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: The subject of the protective order. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. And I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I understood that. I don\u2019t think you need to say anything more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-19\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I need to protect the record, Your Honor. Our appellate lawyers say that if we don\u2019t make a standing objection \u2014 you would think that the ruling on the motion in limine would be sufficient, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, no, no. I know you need to make an objection during trial. You\u2019re correct. But I think if you make the objection from the bench you don\u2019t need to put the grounds on the record all over again. That\u2019s all I was saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-21\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor, It\u2019s just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: So you could have made it from the table. That\u2019s all I was saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 a standing objection. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">Later, during testimony regarding the petition for a protective order, defense counsel objected: \u201cYour Honor, again, just for the record we\u2019re objecting.\u201d Prior to the admission into evidence of the petition for the protective order, defense counsel objected as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, again, I would just make an objection for the record based upon\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: The same objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The same objection. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is overruled. State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 will be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objections, the jury heard evidence about the February incidents and the July 11th incident. The jury also was given the petition for the protective order. As previously mentioned, the jury found Mr. Boyd guilty of violating the protective order. The court sentenced Mr. Boyd to imprisonment for one year, but suspended all except for time already served, and placed Mr. Boyd on three years of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Mr. Boyd appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting the petition for the protective order and some of the testimony because the petition and testimony contained inadmissible hearsay statements. He also challenged the trial court\u2019s admission of the petition and other evidence relating to the February incidents on the ground that the evidence was inadmissible under Rule 5-404(b). Similarly, Mr. Boyd argued that the July 11, 2004, incident should have been considered a \u201cprior bad act,\u201d that the trial court erred in failing to analyze it as such, and that evidence of the incident was not admissible under Rule 5-404(b). Mr. Boyd argued that the challenged evidence was not relevant, and that, even if it were, the prejudice outweighed any probative value. The State in the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Special Appeals made a single argument, namely that the Circuit Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were, on the merits, correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appellate court initially addressed the hearsay issue, and decided that the issue was not preserved for appellate review. The appellate court held that defense counsel had made general objections during trial and that ordinarily such objections \u201cpreserve[] for appellate review all grounds upon which the evidence could be deemed inadmissible.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals then stated that the \u201centire focus of the discussion at the hearing <em>in limine </em>concerning evidence of the February incident[s], including the petition itself, was whether the evidence was admissible as a prior bad act.\u201d The intermediate appellate court held that, because of the discussions during the motion <em>in limine </em>hearing, Mr. Boyd\u2019s general objections at trial failed to preserve the hearsay issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The Court of Special Appeals also upheld the trial court\u2019s decisions concerning the admissibility, under Rule 5-404(b), of the petition for a protective order and testimony about the February events. The intermediate appellate court held that, \u201c[bjecause evidence of appellant\u2019s repeated conduct is relevant to show whether he intended to harass Weaver, we affirm the court\u2019s ruling to admit the petition and testimony describing the February\u201d incidents. In addition, the Court of Special Appeals held that admission of testimony concerning the July 11, 2004, incident was not erroneous because the trial judge explained that \u201cit [would] be very difficult to have evidence of what happened on the 18th without any evidence of what happened on the 11th.\u201d The appellate court concluded that evidence of the July 11, 2004, incident was relevant to understand Ms. Weaver\u2019s conduct on July 18, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Mr. Boyd filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the following issues (although we have re-arranged their order):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201c1. Did the intermediate appellate court err in holding that a general objection at trial was insufficient to preserve a hearsay issue, because that ground of objection had not been stated during a pretrial motion <em>in limine?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">\u201c2. Is the conduct that formed the basis for entry of a protective order admissible in a prosecution for violation of that protective order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">\u201c3. Did the circuit court err in admitting evidence of other crimes and bad acts (some of which was hearsay), including the application for a protective order?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The State did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. This Court granted Mr. Boyd\u2019s petition, without adding or deleting any issues. <em>Boyd v. </em>State, 393 Md. 244, 900 A.2d 751 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The petitioner Boyd initially argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that defense counsel\u2019s general objections at trial did not preserve the hearsay issue for appellate review. Mr. Boyd contends that this holding is \u201cnovel,\u201d is contrary to the Maryland Rules, and is inconsistent with numerous opinions by this Court. With regard to the merits of the evidentiary issues, Mr. Boyd argues that the petition for the protective order and some of the evidence concerning the incidents in February 2004 and on July 11, 2004, constituted inadmissible hearsay, that the petition and testimony about the February and July 11th events were inadmissible under Rule 5-404(b), that the challenged evidence was not relevant to any material issue in the case, and that, in any event, any probative value of the challenged evidence was exceeded by its prejudicial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The State, for the first time in its brief in this Court, argues that defense counsel\u2019s objections at trial were not general objections. Alternatively, the State, without citing any supporting authority, contends that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that general objections at trial failed to preserve for appellate review the hearsay issue where the hearsay issue was not raised at the pretrial hearing on the motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>As to the merits, the State maintains that the petition for a protective order and some of the testimony about events prior to July 18, 2004, did not constitute hearsay because the evidence was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Rather, according to the State, the evidence supported the validity of the issuance of the protective order and helped explain Ms. Weaver\u2019s state of mind when she did not allow Mr. Boyd to visit Lyric on July 18, 2004. The State also contends that the trial court properly admitted the petition for a protective order and the testimony regarding the February incidents as evidence of prior bad acts because the evidence fell under the absence of mistake exception in Rule 5-404(b). In addition, the State asserts that testimony about the July 11th incident was proper and \u201cnecessary to show that Ms. Weaver was justified in not making her daughter available for visitation.\u201d The State also claims that this evidence demonstrated that Mr. Boyd \u201cknew there was conflict relating to visitation and that he was well-aware of the [limits] of the visitation order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">We shall first address the State\u2019s arguments that the hearsay issue was not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The State, in its brief in this Court, injects an issue that had not previously been raised in the case. The State for the first time argues that defense counsel\u2019s objections to the admission of evidence at trial \u201cdid not constitute general objections.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 10). As previously pointed out, the State did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that defense counsel made general objections at trial and that a general objection ordinarily \u201cpreserves for appellate review all grounds upon which the evidence could be deemed inadmissible.\u201d In fact, in its answer to Mr. Boyd\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, the State expressly acknowledged \u201cthat there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>was a general objection to the admission of the protective order.\u201d (Answer to Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Under the circumstances, the contention that defense counsel\u2019s objections at trial were not general objections is not before us. See Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(b) (\u201cUnless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court acting in an appellate capacity, the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition ...\u201d); <em>Rhaney v. UMES, </em>388 Md. 585, 596 n. 7, 880 A.2d 357, 363 n. 7 (2005); <em>Renbaum v. Custom Holding, </em>386 Md. 28, 33 n. 2, 871 A.2d 554, 557 n. 2 (2005); <em>Edwards v. Corbin, </em>379 Md. 278, 284 n. 3, 841 A.2d 845, 849 n. 3 (2004) (\u201cAs this issue [presented for the first time in the brief] was not presented in the certiorari petition, a cross-petition, or added by order of this Court, it is not properly before us\u201d), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Even if the issue were before us, we would reject the State\u2019s argument. The State relies on the trial judge\u2019s reference to his \u201cprior ruling\u201d when defense counsel objected to the testimony of Ms. Fowlkes, and upon the trial judge\u2019s reference to the \u201cpre-trial,\u201d when defense counsel objected to Ms. Weaver\u2019s testimony, and defense counsel\u2019s reply, \u201cYes, Your Honor, but I just need to make a record at the bench please.\u201d According to the State, this shows that the objections \u201cdid not constitute general objections\u201d but were \u201cbased on the prior bad acts or other crimes arguments that [defense counsel] asserted pre-trial.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In our view, these vague references to the pretrial hearing did not amount to a specific ground for defense counsel\u2019s objections at the trial. At no time during the trial did the trial judge ask defense counsel to delineate the grounds for the objections, and at no time did defense counsel specify the grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">A somewhat similar factual situation was present, and a similar argument by the State was made, in <em>von Lusch v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>State, </em>279 Md. 255, 263-264, 368 A.2d 468, 473 (1977). This Court\u2019s response in <em>von Lusch </em>is applicable to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201cIn the instant case, we do not believe that the statements by petitioner\u2019s attorney were attempts to express specific reasons for the objection. Instead, they appear to be mere responses to the remarks of the trial court. * * * Both statements by counsel appear to have been prompted by remarks made by the trial court and not an attempt to delineate specific grounds for the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>See also Bailey v. State, </em>263 Md. 424, 426-427, 283 A.2d 360, 361 (1971) (Upon the prosecution\u2019s asking a witness about a prior conviction, defense counsel stated: \u201cObjection, Your Honor. This is not pertinent to \u2014 ,\u201d and the trial judge immediately said \u201cOverrule the objection.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals held that the use of the word \u201cpertinent\u201d made it clear that the objection was not a general one but \u201cwas predicated on the traditional ground of relevance to impeach the credibility of the witness.\u201d This Court disagreed and reversed, holding, inter alia, that the objection was general).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Consequently, there is no merit in the State\u2019s argument that defense counsel\u2019s objections to evidence at trial did not constitute general objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">We also reject the State\u2019s argument and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that a general objection to evidence at trial does not preserve all grounds for inadmissibility when specific grounds had been the focus at a pretrial hearing on a motion in <em>limine. </em>The State\u2019s argument and the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding would create a new exception to the Maryland evidence principle regarding the sufficiency of a general objection. It is an exception which finds no support in the Maryland Rules or case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-323, applicable to criminal cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 2-517(a), applicable to civil cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Rule 5-103(a)(l), applicable to cases generally,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reflect the long established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Maryland practice that a contemporaneous general objection to the admission of evidence ordinarily preserves for appellate review all grounds which may exist for the inadmissibility of the evidence. Under Rules 2-517, 4-323, 5-103(a)(l), and this Court\u2019s opinions, the only exceptions to the principle that a general objection is sufficient are where a rule requires the ground to be stated, where the trial court requests that the ground be stated, and \u201cwhere the objector, although not requested by the court, voluntarily offers specific reasons for objecting to certain evidence,\u201d <em>von Lusch v. State, supra, </em>279 Md. at 263, 368 A.2d at 472. <em>See, e.g., Grier v.

For example, in <em>Johnson v. State, 9 </em>Md.App. 166, 177, 263 A.2d 232, 239 (1970), the Court of Special Appeals had held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Maryland rule, that a general objection to evidence preserves all grounds for the inadmissibility of the evidence, did not apply when the objection was based on a \u201cnontraditional ground.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Although </em>the <em>Johnson </em>case did not come before the Court of Appeals, this holding by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Johnson </em>was later dealt with in <em>Bailey v. State, supra, </em>263 Md. 424, 283 A.2d 360. The \u201cnontraditional ground\u201d for inadmissibility in <em>Bailey </em>was different from that in <em>Johnson. </em>In <em>Bailey, </em>defense counsel made a general objection to the admission of evidence of a prior conviction; the ground argued on appeal was that an appeal of the prior conviction was pending, and that a statute made evidence of such prior conviction inadmissible when the prior conviction was still on appeal. This Court in <em>Bailey </em>overruled the above-described holding in <em>Johnson, </em>with Chief Judge Hammond stating for the Court (263 Md. at 428, 283 A.2d at 362):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201c[W]e do not agree with the view of the Court of Special Appeals that [the] Rule ... means one thing for \u2018traditional\u2019 grounds of objection and another for \u2018non-traditional\u2019 grounds. Indeed we think it would be difficult from time to time to decide whether a ground of objection was traditional or non-traditional. We see no room in the Rule or in the decisions for making such a distinction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Other cases refusing to broaden the exceptions to the Maryland principle, that a general objection to evidence is ordinarily sufficient, include, <em>e.g., Grier v. State, supra, </em>351 Md. at 250-251, 718 A.2d at 216; <em>Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 36-37, 637 A.2d 1197, 1200-1201 (1994); <em>Ali v.

Under our cases, however, such a ruling in favor of admitting evidence carries little weight with regard to evidence objections at trial. The <em>in limine </em>ruling admitting evidence does not affect Rules 2-517(a), 4-323(a), and 5-103(a)(1), which ordinarily require contemporaneous <em>general </em>objections at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Reed v.

Similarly, some of the trial testimony by Barbara Fowlkes and Cathleen Weaver, which defense counsel objected to, consisted of testimony concerning what Mr. Boyd and other persons had said to the two witnesses in February 2004 and on July 11, 2004. In addition, the petition for the protective order and the challenged testimony described Mr. Boyd\u2019s conduct in February 2004 and on July 11, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">As earlier indicated, Mr. Boyd argues that the evidence of out-of-court statements was inadmissible hearsay, and that the evidence regarding his statements and conduct prior to July 18, 2004, constituted inadmissible evidence of other \u201cwrongs\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>or bad \u201cacts\u201d under Maryland Rule 5-404(b). Mr. Boyd also contends that the challenged evidence was irrelevant, and, to the extent that any of it was relevant, that the relevancy was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The State does not argue that the statements by out-of-court declarants fell within any exceptions to the Rule making hearsay inadmissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the State maintains that evidence of the out-of-court statements was \u201c \u2018admissible as nonhearsay\u2019 \u201d and was \u201c \u2018not introduced for the purpose of showing that the facts asserted in the statements] are true.\u2019 \u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 12-13, quoting <em>Graves v. State, supra, </em>334 Md. at 38, 637 A.2d at 1201). The State contends that the statements in the petition for the protective order were \u201cnot admitted for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted therein\u201d but that the \u201cstatements ... merely supported the validity of the issuance of the protective order, as well as helped to explain Ms. Weaver\u2019s state of mind on July 18, 2004, when she decided not to make Lyric available for visitation with [Mr.] Boyd, as prescribed by the protective order.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 13). According to the State, because \u201cthe thrust of the defense to violation of the protective order was that [Mr.] Boyd was merely trying to enforce his visitation rights when he followed Ms. Weaver in her car,\u201d the \u201cfact that [Mr.] Boyd and [Ms.] Weaver had past visitation conflicts explained her state of mind in effectively denying Boyd visitation [on] July 18, 2004.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 15).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Turning to Rule 5-404(b), which generally renders inadmissible evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts, the State asserts that evidence of Mr. Boyd\u2019s statements and conduct in February 2004 \u201cwas admissible under the absence of mistake exception\u201d in Rule 5-404(b). (Respondent\u2019s brief at 20). The State contends that evidence of the July 11, 2004,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cvisitation incident was necessary to show that Ms. Weaver was justified in not making her daughter available for visitation, as well as to show that [Mr.] Boyd knew there was conflict relating to visitation and that he was well-aware of the [boundaries] of the visitation order. As such, he could not claim that he was mistaken on July 18th, in thinking that he was permitted to follow Ms. Weaver in her car in order to enforce his visitation right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 22).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The State\u2019s argument that the challenged out-of-court statements, contained in the petition for the protective order and testified to by witnesses, were admissible for the nonhearsay purpose of showing the \u201cvalidity of the issuance of the protective order,\u201d is entirely without merit. There has never in this case been any issue, or hint of an issue, concerning the validity, propriety, or admissibility of the protective order itself. The petitioner Boyd has never challenged the reasons for or the validity of the protective order, has never claimed that the order was erroneously issued, and has consistently taken the position, beginning with the pre-trial hearing, that the protective order was admissible in evidence. In fact, Mr. Boyd expressly consented to the final protective order of February 23, 2004, and Mr. Boyd sought the modified final protective order of April 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Similarly misplaced is the State\u2019s reliance upon the other alleged \u201cnonhearsay purpose\u201d of the out-of-court state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ments, namely to explain Ms. Weaver\u2019s \u201cstate of mind in effectively denying [Mr.] Boyd visitation July 18, 2004,\u201d and \u201cto show that Ms. Weaver was justified in not making her daughter available for visitation\u201d (respondent\u2019s brief at 15, 22). The issue in this case did not involve Ms. Weaver\u2019s state of mind on July 18, or whether she violated the terms of the protective order by denying visitation on that date, or whether Ms. Weaver\u2019s denial of visitation was \u201cjustified.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s entire theory was that Mr. Boyd violated the protective order by following Ms. Weaver on July 18. The only issue before the jury was whether Mr. Boyd\u2019s conduct on July 18, 2004, constituted a violation of the protective order. It was not the function of the jury to weigh Ms. Weaver\u2019s degree of fault, if any, against Mr. Boyd\u2019s degree of fault, if any, and then ascertain the proper balance. Ms. Weaver\u2019s conduct was not on trial; Mr. Boyd\u2019s conduct on July 18 was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The claimed nonhearsay purposes of the challenged out-of-court statements were not relevant to the material issue in the case. Even if it be assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that these nonhearsay purposes might have a slight degree of relevance, such relevance was clearly outweighed by the prejudicial effect of Mr. Boyd\u2019s alleged threats and other statements on February 18, 19, and July 11, 2004. Under these circumstances, courts exclude the evidence on hearsay grounds. Thus, the out-of-court statements, which defense counsel objected to, should have been excluded as hearsay. <em>See Graves v. State, supra, </em>334 Md. at 36-43, 637 A.2d at 1200-1204 (holding that somewhat similar out-of-court statements of bad acts, contained in written records and testimony by a police officer, and allegedly offered for a nonhearsay purpose, had limited relevance at best, that any relevance was outweighed by the prejudicial effect, and that the evidence should have been excluded as hearsay); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>767 F.2d 1078, 1083-1084 (4th Cir.1985); 2 <em>McCormick On Evidence </em>\u00a7 249, at 136 n. 20, and cases there cited. <em>See also Bernadyn v.

Whether Ms. Weaver\u2019s denial of visitation was justified was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b), providing that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts is ordinarily inadmissible, embodies the Maryland common law of evidence concerning other crimes, etc., which existed prior to the adoption of the Rule. <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 806, 724 A.2d 111, 114 (1999); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 406, 697 A.2d 432, 440 (1997). <em>Streater v. State, supra, </em>involved the admissibility of other crimes or bad acts evidence embodied in the protective order itself, unlike the present case which involves such evidence contained in the petition for the protective order. Judge Chasanow for the Court in <em>Streater </em>reviewed the applicable law as follows (352 Md. at 806-807, 724 A.2d at 114):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKF\">\u201cWe have often cited with approval Professor McCormicks general observation that \u2018the prosecution may not introduce evidence of other criminal acts of the accused unless the evidence is introduced for some purpose other than to suggest that because the defendant is a person of criminal character, it is more probable that he committed the crime for which he is on trial.\u2019 John W.

According to the State, the evidence was relevant so that Mr. Boyd \u201ccould not claim that he was mistaken on July 18th, in thinking that he was permitted to follow Ms. Weaver in her car in order to enforce his visitation right.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">A major problem with the State\u2019s theory, however, is that Mr. Boyd, who did not testify at trial, has never asserted or defended on the ground that his conduct on July 18th, if it was inconsistent with the protective order, was permitted or was based on a mistake or a mistaken belief. Judge Cathell for the Court in <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998), extensively discussed the general admissibility of other crimes or bad acts evidence, and specifically dealt with the \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception. After reviewing numerous cases and other authorities, Judge Cathell explained one of the prerequisites for the exception <em>(Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 330-331, 718 A.2d at 599-600, emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cOur examination of the commentators and the case law both in Maryland and in other jurisdictions <em>that we have discussed </em>reveals a general prerequisite to the application of the absence of mistake exception. In order for the exception to apply, the defendant generally must make some assertion or put on a defense that he or she committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>act for which he or she is on trial, but did so by mistake. In those cases noted above in which the exception was found not to apply, the defendant made no assertion or put forward no defense that he or she mistakenly committed the <em>act for which he or she was on trial.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Like the defendants in the cases discussed in <em>Wynn, </em>and like the defendant in <em>Wynn, </em>the defendant Boyd \u201cmade no assertion or put forward no defense that he ... mistakenly committed the act for which he ... was on trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In affirming the conviction, the Court of Special Appeals stated that the evidence of prior wrongful conduct was admissible under Rule 5-404(b)because it was \u201crelevant to show whether he [Mr. Boyd] intended to harass Weaver.... \u201d If the intermediate appellate court was referring to the crime of \u201charassment\u201d prohibited by Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 3-803 of the Criminal Law Article, Mr. Boyd was not charged with such crime. The only alleged crime for which he was tried was violation of the protective order. <em>Cf., Streater v. State, supra, </em>352 Md. at 812-817, 724 A.2d at 117-119, where the defendant was, <em>inter alia, </em>charged with harassment, and this Court reversed the conviction because of the trial court\u2019s failure to follow the requirements of Rule 5-404(b). If the Court of Special Appeals meant that the evidence demonstrated a criminal intent rather than mistaken conduct, <em>Wynn v. State, supra, </em>is dispositive. Mr. Boyd at no time claimed that he acted mistakenly. He at no time asserted that he lacked knowledge of the protective order or misunderstood it. Moreover, there was no contention that Mr. Boyd intended anything other than what he did on July 18th. The facts concerning July 18, 2004, were basically undisputed. The defense was simply that Mr. Boyd\u2019s July 18th conduct was not a violation of the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Finally, if there were some merit in the State\u2019s contention that the evidence of prior wrongful conduct was somehow relevant to absence of mistake, the relevance would be slight compared to the prejudicial effect of the evidence. The possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>bility that the jury may have convicted Mr. Boyd because of his conduct on February 17 and 18, and July 11 and 18, 2004, rather than just his conduct on July 18th, is not farfetched.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.

In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant\u2019s attorney objected to evidence of a prior conviction. The ground was that the prior conviction was invalid because the defendant had been denied his constitutional right to counsel. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned as follows (9 Md.App. at 177, 263 A.2d at 239):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201c[The] Rule ... provides that unless requested by the court, it is not necessary to state the grounds of objections to evidence. See <em>Robert v. State, 220 </em>Md. 159, 151 A.2d 737; compare <em>Wilt v. Wilt, </em>242 Md. 129, 218 A.2d 180 [1966]; <em>Mulcahy v. State, </em>221 Md. 413, 158 A.2d 80 [1960], But we believe that objection on the nontraditional ground, as here made, was not within the contemplation of the Rule when adopted and that the fair administration of justice requires the defendant specifically to make known to the court the ground of his objection. We hold that it is incumbent upon the defendant, when his objection to the evidence of a prior conviction is on the ground that the conviction was constitutionally void to state his reasons to the court to enable it properly to determine the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\">.
