It presents the issue of whether the rule in <em>Yorkdale Corporation v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 205 A.2d 269 (1964), may be applied to enlarge uses as well as to limit uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Colleen Layton and Scott Robbins, d/b/a Frisky\u2019s Wildlife and Primate Sanctuary, Inc., (collectively referred to as \u201cFrisky\u2019s\u201d), the petitioners, attempted to obtain a special exception to operate as a charitable and philanthropic institution in Howard County. The primary reason for the application was that Frisky\u2019s had apparently been out of compliance with Howard County\u2019s zoning ordinances in its operation as an animal rehabilitation center and primate sanctuary. The Howard County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d) granted Frisky\u2019s special exception in part, but denied it permission to operate as a primate sanctuary. Thereafter, on June 17, 2004, petitioners filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County. On June 25, 2004, Richard Wyckoff and Julianne Tuttle, neighbors of Frisky\u2019s, filed a separate petition for judicial review, which the Board joined (collectively the respondents). Both petitions, by order of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>were later consolidated. On September 27, 2004, a pertinent portion of the Howard County Code was amended, changing the definition upon which the Board had relied in making its initial zoning decision to deny Frisky\u2019s permission to operate a primate sanctuary. On April 8, 2005, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the matter and, on July 13, 2005, issued a memorandum opinion affirming the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend judgment, which was denied on August 30, 2005. Petitioners then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In a reported opinion, <em>Layton v. Howard County Board of Appeals, </em>171 Md.App. 137, 908 A.2d 724 (2006), the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court. Petitioners then timely filed a petition for certiorari with this Court, which we granted on December 14, 2006. <em>Layton v. Howard County, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One question is presented for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cWhether one who challenges a decision of a zoning board may have, as Petitioners here seek, (a) the benefit of a legislated change in the basis of a decision of the zoning board and (b) demand application on judicial appeal of the \u2018new law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">We answer this question in the affirmative. Under the <em>Yorkdale Corporation v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 205 A.2d 269 (1964), rule, legislated change of pertinent law, which occurs during the ongoing litigation of a land use or zoning case, generally, shall be retrospectively applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Petitioners have operated Frisky\u2019s, a wildlife refuge and sanctuary, in Howard County since 1976. Frisky\u2019s has been at its current location, 10790 Old Frederick Road, Woodstock, Maryland, since 1993. That property is composed of 3.728 acres and is zoned as a Rural Conservation-Density Exchange Option Overlay Zoning District (\u201cRC-DEO\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>This controversy arose on December 14, 1999, when petitioners were issued a notice by the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) for violating a zoning regulation by operating a charitable and philanthropic institution without an approved special exception. Frisky\u2019s was incorporated in 1998, as a not-for-profit corporation, but petitioners had never filed for a special exception to bring the operation of the facility into compliance with Howard County\u2019s zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">On April 28, 2000, petitioners filed a petition \u201cfor a Special Exception for a Charitable and Philanthropic Institution (Section 131.N.13) for an existing wildlife rehabilitation center and primate sanctuary\u201d with the Department. The Department, on August 9, 2000, issued a recommendation to the Howard County Board of Appeals, in which it suggested that Frisky\u2019s petition for a special exception be approved, subject to a number of conditions. The matter then went before the Board, for a special exception petition for a charitable and philanthropic institution in a RC-DEO, pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 131.N.13<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>and 130.B.2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Howard County Zoning Regulations (\u201cHCZR\u201d) in effect at that time. Numerous hearings were held over the course of the next three years \u2014 these hearings included testimony from witnesses on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On May 18, 2004, the Board issued its written decision, which, as relevant to this proceeding, granted Frisky\u2019s a special exception to operate as a charitable and philanthropic institution, including permitting the operation of an animal rehabilitation center on the property. The Board, however, denied Frisky\u2019s an exception to operate a primate or other exotic wildlife sanctuary. The Board\u2019s factual findings stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201c2. The Petitioner currently operates a charitable institution that functions as an animal rehabilitation center and primate sanctuary (the \u2018Center\u2019) on the Property. Frisky\u2019s is registered with the State of Maryland as a Charitable Organization and with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation as a non-stock, not for profit corporation for the purpose of a charitable organization. In order to operate such an organization in the RC district, a Special Exception is required.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] The Petitioner is trying to gain approval as a Special Exception for a \u2018Charitable and Philanthropic Institution\u2019 for this purpose on the 3.728 acre Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201c3. The Petitioner\u2019s proposed activities include care and rehabilitation for \u201cwildlife that have been injured or orphaned; domestic animals such as rabbits, and farm animals that are sick or who have become pets, but can\u2019t be kept by their owners; and primates that come from laboratories, sanctuaries or private owners around the country before it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>became illegal to own primates without a license.\u2019 The Petitioner submitted documentation of a Wildlife Permit for Wildlife Rehabilitation from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">\u201c4. At the hearing held before the Board on November 1, 2001, the Petitioner submitted documentation that F risky\u2019s had obtained a \u2018Class C Exhibitor\u2019 license pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.) from the United States Department of Agriculture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201c5. Animals which are permitted to be rehabilitated are accepted from multiple sources, provided care and shelter, and upon recovery, are released back into the wild or made available for adoption. Primates stay in the care of Frisky\u2019s for the remainder of their lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c18. The Board finds based on the evidence presented that the Petitioner operates the Center on the subject Property as a charitable institution for the rehabilitation and sanctuary of animals. Included in the animals housed in the center are monkeys, other primates and wild animals. Exotic animals are defined in Section 17.300(p) of the Howard County Code (the \u2018Code\u2019) as \u2018animals of a species that is not indigenous to Howard County and is not a domesticated animal.\u2019 A wild animal is defined in Section 17.300(y) of the Code as \u2018an animal which is not a domesticated animal, is incapable of being completely domesticated, or requires the exercise of art, force, or skill to keep it in subjugation. Wild animal includes any hybrid animal which results from the breeding of a wild animal and a domesticated animal.\u2019 \u201c19. The Board finds that the monkeys and other primates housed in the Center are wild and exotic animals as defined in the Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c20. Section 17.306(e) of the Code provides that wild or exotic animals are prohibited in Howard County as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">(1) Wild or exotic animals prohibited: No person may keep, hold for sale or sell wild or exotic animals even if well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>trained, de-clawed, defanged, ostensibly domesticated and affectionate to people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">(2) Exemption for licensed veterinarian: a licensed veterinarian is exempt from the provisions of paragraph (1) only for the purpose of professional medical treatment of such animals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">(3) Exemption for research, study, exhibits: The holder of a currently valid permit issued by a state or federal authority to keep animals for scientific research, study, or exhibits is exempt from the provisions of paragraph (1) only to the extent provided in the permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201c21. The Board finds that although the Petitioner may have a license to exhibit animals at the Center, the Petitioner initially did not apply to be an animal exhibitor and subsequently failed to provide sufficient evidence during the course of the hearings held before the Board to determine that the Petitioner is, in fact, an animal exhibitor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201c22. Therefore, the exemption for \u2018exhibits\u2019 in Section 17.306(e)(4)[ (3) ] is not applicable to this petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">The Board\u2019s conclusions of law stated, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c1. The Board concludes that the Petitioner operates the Center as a charitable institution for the rehabilitation and sanctuary of animals on the Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201c2. The Board concludes that the rehabilitation center and sanctuary does not operate as a center for displaying or exhibiting the animals to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201c3. The Board concludes that the monkeys and other primates at the center are wild and exotic animals as defined by the Howard County Animal Control Law, Section 17.300 et seq. of the Howard County Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201c4. The Board concludes that it is unlawful under the Howard County Code to operate a primate sanctuary or wildlife rehabilitation center in Howard County. Section 17.306(e)(1) of the Code provides that \u2018No person may keep, hold for sale or sell wild or exotic animals even if well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>trained, de-clawed, defanged, ostensibly domesticated and affectionate to people.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201c5. The Board concludes that although the Petitioner may have an exhibitor\u2019s license, the Petitioner failed to provide sufficient evidence during the course of the hearings for the Board to determine that the Petitioner is, in fact, an animal exhibitor rather than a sanctuary and rehabilitation center for animals. The exemption for exhibits in Section 17.306(e)(4) [ (3) ] of the Howard County Code does not apply because the Petitioned ] did not prove to the Board that she was an exhibitor and the Petitioned ] cannot therefore legally keep primates or other wild or exotic animals on the subject Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201c7. The Board further concludes that because wild or exotic animals are prohibited by local law in Howard County (except under circumstances not found to be present in this case) the Zoning Board could not have contemplated a land use for a rehabilitation center and primate sanctuary for wild and exotic animals as constituting a charitable institution in the context of the zoning regulations. The Board cannot grant a special exception for the primate sanctuary use or that portion of the rehabilitation center involving wildlife which is not permitted by the Howard County Code or the Howard County Zoning Regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201c8. Thus this Board\u2019s approval of the charitable and philanthropic institution use for a animal sanctuary and rehabilitation center hereinafter (referred to as \u2018Approved Charitable Use\u2019) excludes the primate sanctuary and other wildlife not permitted under the Howard County Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Pursuant to the provisions of the Howard County Code in effect at the time of the Board\u2019s decision, monkeys and other primates were considered exotic or \"wild animals. \u00a7\u00a7 17.300(p) and (y). Furthermore, \u00a7 17.306(e) of the Howard County Code, at that time, provided that no person (or corporation) could keep exotic or wild animals unless it met the exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of having a valid permit issued by a state or federal authority to keep such animals for scientific research, study or exhibits. \u00a7 17.306(e)(3). The Board found that Frisky\u2019s did not satisfactorily establish evidence to meet such an exemption and, therefore, determined that it was not permitted to operate a primate sanctuary.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">On June 17, 2004, Frisky\u2019s filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County; Richard Wyckoff and Julianne Tuttle, neighbors of Frisky\u2019s, filed a separate petition for judicial review on June 25, 2004. Those petitions were consolidated by order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On September 27, 2004, prior to any hearing before the Circuit Court, Howard County amended pertinent provisions of the Howard County Code. The Code provided a definition for \u201cAnimal Sanctuary,\u201d which was not in existence at the time of the hearing before the Board. Specifically, \u00a7 17.300(g) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>\u201cAnimal Sanctuary.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">A facility that performs at least one of the following functions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">(1) Rescues, rehabilitates and releases, when possible, native wildlife; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">(2) Provides permanent housing to the following categories of non-releasable animals, as defined in this subtitle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">(i) Wild animals; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">(ii) Exotic animals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Exotic animals were defined in \u00a7 17.300(q) as: \u201cAn animal of a species that is not indigenous to Howard County and is not a domesticated animal.... \u201d Wild animals were defined in \u00a7 17.300(aa) as: \u201cAn animal that is not a domesticated animal, is incapable of being completely domesticated, or requires the exercise of art, force, or skill to keep it in subjugation.... \u201d Thus, monkeys and other primates still fell under the definition of a wild or exotic animal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The provision upon which this case turns, however, (i.e., the section dealing with the keeping of wild or exotic animals) was also amended. Now set forth in \u00a7 17.307(d), it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\"><em>\u201cWild or Exotic Animals Prohibited. </em>A person shall not keep, hold for sale, offer for sale, or sell a wild or exotic animal, even if the animal is well-trained, de-clawed, defanged, ostensibly domesticated, and affectionate to people, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">(1) A circus or animal show holding a valid permit from any public authority for temporary operation is exempt from this subsection for the term of the permit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">(2) A licensed veterinarian may temporarily keep such an animal only for the purpose of professional medical treatment of the animal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">(3) The holder of a valid permit issued by a state or federal authority to keep a wild or exotic animal is exempt from this subsection only to the extent provided in the permit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">(5) <em>An animal sanctuary is exempt from this subsection if the sanctuary meets all state and federal licensing and permitting requirements. \u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Subsection (5) now provided an exemption for animal sanctuaries. Therefore, under the new law, as described by \u00a7 \u00a7 17.300(g) and 17.307(d) of the Howard County Code, Frisky\u2019s may arguably meet the definition of an \u201cAnimal Sanctuary\u201d and thus be exempt from the prohibition<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against keeping wild or exotic animals under \u00a7 17.307(d)(5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Petitioners incorporated this change in law into the arguments presented before the Circuit Court for Howard County. On April 8, 2005, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the consolidated petitions for judicial review and, on July 13, 2005, issued a memorandum opinion affirming the decision of the Board. The Circuit Court declined to accept petitioners\u2019 argument that the new provisions of the Howard County Code should be retrospectively applied to Frisky\u2019s petition for the operation of a primate sanctuary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend judgment, which was denied by the Circuit Court. The petitioners then timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court heard argument and issued its reported opinion on October 2, 2006. <em>Layton v. Howard County Board of Appeals, </em>171 Md.App. 137, 908 A.2d 724 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The Court of Special Appeals addressed the retrospective application of the new provisions of the Howard County Code. After conducting a review of Maryland law, the court determined that the changes in the Code should not be applied to the case at bar. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cTurning to the instant case, we see no reason to stray from the general rule that statutes are presumed to operate prospectively and are construed accordingly. <em>See Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. Riverdale Heights Volunteer Fire Co. Inc., </em>308 Md. 556, 560-61, 520 A.2d 1319 (1987). We are unable to discern in the statute a clear expression of the legislative intent that the statute should operate retrospectively, nor have appellants directed us to any such intent in their brief or oral argument. Notwithstanding that there is no articulated legislative intent, no other exception to the general rule applies to the change in the animal control law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cThe law is not procedural, but substantive. The Court of Appeals discussed the difference between substantive laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>and procedural or remedial laws in <em>Langston, </em>stating: \u2018A law is substantive if it creates rights, duties, and obligations, while a remedial or procedural law simply prescribes the methods of enforcement of those rights.\u2019 359 Md. at 419, 754 A.2d 389 [ (2000) ] (citations omitted). The animal control law at issue provides a right for a sanctuary to have exotic and wild animals, not a new method or procedure to enforce their right to have the animals. We discussed in <em>Langston </em>what defines a remedial statute, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Generally, remedial statutes are those which provide a remedy, or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries. They also include statutes intended for the correction of defects, mistakes and omissions in the civil institutions and the administration of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">359 Md. at 408-09, 754 A.2d 389. The animal control law is not remedial, but a new substantive right to possess wild and exotic animals for facilities that are designated as animal sanctuaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201cFinally, the animal control law is not a zoning law;[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] whether it should be applied retrospectively is not properly based upon the rationale relied upon in our decisions in <em>Mandel[</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>and <em>Holland[</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em>]. </em>Thus, we hold that the circuit court did not err by refusing to remand the case to the Board for consideration under the current animal control law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Layton, </em>171 Md.App. at 172-73, 908 A.2d at 744.

Draper Properties, Inc., </em>395 Md. 694, 912 A.2d 598 (2006), we quoted <em>Alviani v.

There, the Court was concerned with the disposition of spoils of war. A French schooner (the <em>Peggy) </em>had been captured by an American ship. The Court was faced with the question, in the midst of litigation, of determining who was entitled to possession of the <em>Peggy. </em>For guidance, the Court turned to a treaty. The provisions of the treaty involving the validity of the capture and resultant possession of captured ships had changed during the course of the litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Chief Justice Marshall explicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201cIt is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not.

Yorkdale also applied for a special exception and variance. The zoning commissioner granted Yorkdale\u2019s requests, with the exception of limiting the number of units in the apartment building, i.e., the density of the zoning. A neighboring property owner appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court. There, the question was \u201cwhether the zoning ordinances ... gave the zoning officials power to grant a variance as to density.\u201d <em>Yorkdale, </em>237 Md. at 123, 205 A.2d at 270. The Circuit Court found that the then-current law did not authorize a variance in density. <em>Id. </em>at 124, 205 A.2d at 270. Yorkdale appealed to the Court of Appeals and, after argument, but before a decision was issued, a bill was passed by the county council modifying the law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>respect to the granting of variances as to density. <em>Id. </em>Upon becoming aware of this event, the Court set the case for reargument.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In reaching its decision, the <em>Yorkdale </em>Court first stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cMaryland consistently has followed the rule that \u2018an appellate court is bound to decide a case according to existing laws, even though a judgment rightful when rendered by the court below should be reversed as a consequence,\u2019 as Judge Markell, for the Court, repeated in <em>Woman\u2019s Club v.

Because the amended law had come into effect during the course of litigation (i.e., while the appeal was pending and before a final judgment) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Court applied it retrospectively and dismissed Yorkdale\u2019s appeal. <em>Yorkdale, </em>237 Md. at 133, 205 A.2d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Following the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Yorkdale, </em>we have affirmed those principles in relation to land use and zoning cases several times. In <em>Mandel v. Board of County Cormn\u2019rs of Howard County, </em>238 Md. 208, 214, 208 A.2d 710, 714 (1965), the property owners \u201chad applied to the Board to use their respective properties for high-rise apartments under the zoning regulations then existing.\u201d During the course of litigation, the pertinent zoning regulations were changed to disallow high-rise apartments. Applying the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule, the Court decided against the property owners and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201c[T]his case is to be determined under the law as it now exists, that the appellants had not secured a final decree establishing their rights to use their properties for the use permitted under the former classification, that they had no vested rights, and that the change in the regulations is not invalid because it eliminates the proposed use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Mandel, </em>238 Md. at 215, 208 A.2d at 714. Additionally, the Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\u201c[I]t is clear that the Board, as a legislative body, if its action is otherwise in accordance with law, can validly change a zoning regulation, even though the effect of its action is to eliminate any inchoate rights, which property owners may have asserted in pending appeals from adverse administrative determinations under the pre-existing regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 216, 208 A.2d at 715. Furthermore, \u201c[u]nder the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule, the Board\u2019s legislative act, if otherwise valid, eliminated any rights which the appellants had to use their property for high-rise apartments under the pre-existing zoning regulations.\u201d <em>Mandel, </em>238 Md. at 217, 208 A.2d at 715-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">In <em>Marathon Builders, Inc. v. Montgomery County Planning Board, </em>246 Md. 187, 227 A.2d 755 (1967), we addressed the impact of a change to the overall zoning ordinance during the course of litigation. After referencing the holding in <em>Mandel, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cCertainly if such a change in classification has the effect of extinguishing existing rights during the pendency of an appeal involving the exercise of rights under a former classification, <em>a fortiori </em>a change in classification as a result of the passage of a comprehensive rezoning ordinance would have at least the equal effect of terminating any rights unexercised as of the effective date of the change in classification. This Court has made frequent declarations in zoning cases that courts are bound to decide cases according to existing laws. <em>Yorkdale v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 205 A.2d 269 (1964).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><em>Marathon Builders, </em>246 Md. at 194, 227 A.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In <em>Springloch Area Citizens Group v.

Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>264 Md. 691, 694, 288 A.2d 119, 121 (1972), we stated that \u201cwe have held that a zoning case must be decided upon the law applicable at the time the case is before us, in the absence of intervening vested rights.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We had further occasion to address this issue in <em>Anne Arundel County v. Maragousis, </em>268 Md. 131, 299 A.2d 797 (1973). The Maragousises had purchased a piece of property that was subject to a rezoning after their purchase. They brought an action in the Circuit Court and then appealed that verdict to this Court. After the case had been appealed, but prior to any decision being issued, the County amended the zoning ordinance. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cIt has consistently been our policy to consider zoning cases on the state of the substantive law as it exists when the case is argued before us, <em>Dal Maso v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>264 Md. 691, 694, 288 A.2d 119 (1972); <em>Mandel v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>238 Md. 208, 215, 208 A.2d 710 (1965); <em>Yorkdale Corporation v.

The County also conceded that some of the uses allowed under the rezoning had changed. We continued, stating that, \u201c[s]ince neither this concessum nor [the new Bill] was before the lower court, the whole picture has been drastically altered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 299 A.2d at 802. As a result of this determination and the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule, we remanded the case for reconsideration under the new law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Yorkdale </em>and its progeny have never been overruled.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They are still good law and are determinative in evaluating whether, in a land use or zoning case, a change in statutory law taking place during the course of a litigated issue should have retrospective application. As discussed <em>supra, </em>we shall consider zoning cases based upon the law as it exists at the time the case is before us.,</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The respondents argue that, after the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. Riverdale Heights Volunteer Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 520 A.2d 1319 (1987), <em>Yorkdale </em>is no longer viable. We disagree. Before we discuss <em>Riverdale </em>directly, we look to <em>Janda v. General Motors Corp., </em>237 Md. 161, 205 A.2d 228 (1964). The <em>Janda </em>opinion was issued by the Court of Appeals on the same day as <em>Yorkdale </em>and penned by the same judge. Thus, there can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>little argument that the Court rendered the opinions without a realization of their full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In <em>Janda, </em>we addressed a change in the State\u2019s unemployment law. There, a number of employees were denied unemployment insurance benefits for a week in January of 1963. Those employees appealed the denial to the Board of Appeals, which, on August 21, 1963, affirmed the initial denial. The facts of the case show that there was a collective bargaining agreement between the employees and General Motors in effect from September 20, 1961, through August 31, 1964. During the course of the litigation, a statute governing unemployment insurance benefits in 1961, was repealed and reenacted in 1963. The 1963 statute specifically provided that benefits to be paid under a contract in force prior to the reenactment should be continued. The <em>Janda </em>Court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201cMany of the reasons that led us to conclude that the Legislature intended in 1961 to make extra pay in lieu of vacation a bar to benefits lead us to conclude the 1963 act operates to remove that bar where the allowance in lieu of vacation is paid by the employer under and during the term of a written contract in effect on December 6, 1962, and the \u2018normal practice\u2019 of the employer was not to grant a vacation with pay. December 6, 1962, was the day the 1961 act first took effect (it having been in suspended animation since June 1, 1961, its stated effective date, because it had been put to referendum). Prior to that day extra pay in lieu of vacation had not been a bar to benefits. We think the 1963 Legislature, by expressly making December 6, 1962, the critical date, manifested a clear and unmistakable intent that extra pay allowances in lieu of vacation, paid under a contract in force on that day, should continue not to be a disqualification for unemployment benefits so long as the contract then currently in force continued, whether or not the time of separation from employment came before June 1,1963, the effective date of the 1963 act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">237 Md. at 171, 205 A.2d at 234. <em>Janda </em>clearly did not involve a land use or zoning issue, and the Court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>changed statute specifically provided that the pre-existing contract continue to be in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In reaching its decision, however, the <em>Janda </em>Court described various rules \u201cformulated by the courts to aid in determining whether a statute is to be applied retrospectively or prospectively.\u201d 237 Md. at 168, 205 A.2d at 232. Pertinent to our discussion, the Court stated in its fourth rule<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">\u201c(4) A statute which affects or controls a matter still in litigation when it became law will be applied by the court reviewing the case at the time the statute takes effect although it was not yet law when the decision appealed from was rendered, even if matters or claims of substance (not constitutionally protected), as distinguished from matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>procedural or those affecting the remedy are involved, unless the Legislature intended the contrary. See <em>Yorkdale Corp. v. Powell, 237 </em>Md. 121, 205 A.2d 269, and cases cited....\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Janda, 237 </em>Md. at 169, 205 A.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Respondents contend that <em>Riverdale </em>overruled this portion of <em>Janda, </em>thereby overruling <em>Yorkdale. </em>That is simply not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In <em>Riverdale, </em>an Act was passed, effective July 1, 1983, providing fire companies with immunity for civil liability arising out of allegedly tortious conduct in the course of performing their duties. In 1980, a fire had occurred, damaging an apartment house in Riverdale. The fire insurer paid for the loss and then sued the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), alleging that WSSC was negligent in failing to maintain the fire hydrant closest to the fire. In other words, when fire fighters arrived to combat the blaze, they attempted to utilize that particular fire hydrant, but it proved to be dry, faffing to provide any water. This allegedly caused a delay that resulted in an increase in damages and the resultant loss due to the fire. In September 1984, after the 1983 Act became effective, WSSC filed a third-party complaint against the Riverdale Heights Volunteer Fire Co., Inc. (\u201cFire Co.\u201d), alleging that Fire Co. knew that the fire hydrant was inoperable and therefore, any negligence on the part of WSSC was secondary. Fire Co. moved to dismiss, asserting immunity under the 1983 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The Circuit Court granted Fire Co.\u2019s motion to dismiss. WSSC appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court was erroneous in its retrospective application of the Act. This Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">First, it must be noted that <em>Riverdale </em>clearly did not concern a land use or zoning issue. The case involved a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>statute pertaining to fire companies\u2019 immunity from civil liability in tort actions. In determining whether such a statute should be applied retrospectively, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">\u201cAs a general rule, statutes are presumed to operate prospectively and are to be construed accordingly. <em>See, e.g., Rigger v. Baltimore County, </em>269 Md. 306, 305 A.2d 128 (1973); <em>Kastendike v. Baltimore Association for Retarded Children, Inc., </em>267 Md. 389, 297 A.2d 745 (1972); <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Hearn, </em>242 Md. 575, 219 A.2d 820 (1966); <em>but cf. Spielman v. State, </em>298 Md. 602, 471 A.2d 730 (1984) (there is no absolute bar to retrospective application). The presumption against retrospectivity is rebutted only where there are clear expressions in the statute to the contrary. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Hearn, </em>supra. Moreover, even where permissible, retrospective application is not found except upon the plainest mandate in the legislation. <em>Bell v. State, </em>236 Md. 356, 204 A.2d 54 (1964). The rationale underlying the general rule provides that retrospective application, which attempts to determine the legal significance of acts that occurred prior to the statute\u2019s effective date, increases the potential for interference with persons\u2019 substantive rights. <em>State Commission on Human Relations v. Amecom Division of Litton Systems, </em>278 Md. 120, 360 A.2d 1 (1976).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Riverdale, </em>308 Md. at 560-61, 520 A.2d at 1321-22. The Court then addressed <em>Janda, </em>which Fire Co. had raised in arguing for the retrospective application of the 1983 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Court, initially, correctly distinguished <em>Janda, </em>stating that, \u201c[ujnlike the instant case, <em>Janda </em>involved a statute the terms of which clearly reflected a retroactive intent.\u201d <em>Riverdale, </em>308 Md. at 562, 520 A.2d at 1322. The Court then observed that there was writing, which it described as dicta, in <em>Janda, </em>referring to the four rules discussed <em>supra, </em>and in particular to the fourth rule. The <em>Riverdale </em>Court elaborated: \u201cJanda\u2019s collection of rules was not intended to restate the universe of then Maryland law on prospective or retrospective application of statutes.\u201d <em>Riverdale, </em>308 Md. at 563, 520 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>at 1323. The Court proceeded to state that \u201c[t]his Court has never applied the fourth rule in <em>Janda </em>to decide a case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 520 A.2d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As <em>Yorkdale, Mandel, Marathon Builders, Springloch, Dal Maso, Maragousis, </em>and the cases cited in <em>Yorkdale </em>indicate, that was only correct to the extent of actual statements in reference to <em>Janda </em>in the determination of subsequent cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In the case <em>sub judice, </em>respondents\u2019 reliance on this statement \u2014 placed out of the context of the rule\u2019s basis in <em>Yorkdale </em>and other cases \u2014 is unavailing. It is evident that the <em>Janda </em>Court cited to <em>Yorkdale </em>in stating the fourth rule. <em>Janda, 237 </em>Md. at 169, 205 A.2d at 233. And, as we have said, the two opinions were written by the same judge and filed on the same day. Thus, it is clear that the holdings are related to each other. The Court obviously knew what it was doing in <em>Yorkdale </em>and <em>Janda. </em>Moreover, as discussed <em>supra, </em>there are a significant number of cases which follow and affirm <em>Yorkdale </em>in the context of land use and zoning cases and cases prior to <em>Yorkdale </em>supporting the concept.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is evident that this Court has applied the fourth rule in <em>Janda, </em>but generally only in the context of land use and zoning cases. After discussing several non-land use and non-zoning cases, the <em>Riverdale </em>Court went on to state that \u201c[bjecause it is inconsistent with the general body of Maryland law on the subject, the fourth rule in <em>Janda </em>is disapproved.\u201d <em>Riverdale, </em>308 Md. at 565, 520 A.2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The <em>Riverdale </em>Court ultimately declined to retrospectively apply the 1983 Act, and therefore, held that Fire Co. was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>immune from liability. In doing so, the Court applied the general rule that the Act was presumed to operate prospectively and found that there was no evidence of legislative intent that the statute be applied otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 520 A.2d at 1326. Specifically, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he foregoing review demonstrates that under the law of Maryland statutes ordinarily are construed to operate prospectively, absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 520 A.2d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The <em>Riverdale </em>Court was correct in the above statement. <em>Ordinarily, </em>we do construe statutes to operate prospectively, absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary. The <em>Riverdale </em>Court, however, did not address <em>Yorkdale, </em>the exception to the general rule. The <em>Riverdale </em>Court\u2019s \u201cdisapproval\u201d of what it termed dicta from <em>Janda </em>(a non-land use and non-zoning case) does not affect the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Any disapproval of <em>Janda\u2019s </em>fourth rule by the <em>Riverside </em>Court was made in the context of the statute at issue in that case, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>had no relation to land use and zoning issues. The exception to the general rule still stands. In land use and zoning cases, the law shall be applied as it is in effect at the time of argument.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, respondents\u2019 reliance on <em>Riverdale </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Respondents urge that <em>Holland v. Woodhaven Building and Development, Inc., </em>113 Md.App. 274, 687 A.2d 699 (1996), demonstrates that zoning cases are not to be distinguished from the general rule of prospective application. We disagree. When language in a Court of Special Appeals opinion is in conflict with language in an opinion of this Court, the language of this Court\u2019s opinion is controlling. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Holland </em>dealt with the issue of a party\u2019s standing to challenge a ruling of a zoning board. Factually, the protesting party filed an appeal to the Board. The Board dismissed that appeal due to lack of standing. The protesting party then appealed to the Circuit Court, and while that appeal was pending, an ordinance was enacted specifically providing for such standing. Addressing the argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the ordinance should be applied retrospectively, the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201cWithout discussing <em>Jando </em>or <em>Riverdale Fire Co., </em>appellants assert that \u2018[i]n <em>zoning </em>cases, Maryland law is absolutely clear [that \u201ca]n appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time a case is decided, provided that its application does not affect intervening vested rights.\u201d \u2019 We see no reason to distinguish zoning cases in this manner. The Court of Appeals could have limited its holding in <em>Riverdale Fire Co. </em>to exclude zoning cases, but it did not so limit that case. <em>See, e.g., Arundel Corp. [v. County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County], </em>323 Md. [504,] 509-10, 594 A.2d 95 (applying <em>Riverdale Fire Co. </em>in a zoning case).[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\"><em>Holland, </em>113 Md.App. at 286, 687 A.2d at 705-06. Obviously, the viability of the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule was not \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d at the time of the <em>Holland </em>decision. We now, however, deem to make it so. Our discussion <em>supra, </em>serves to distinguish <em>York-dale </em>from <em>Riverdale, </em>thus, in the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling in <em>Holland </em>does not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Furthermore, in <em>Powell v. Calvert County, </em>368 Md. 400, 795 A.2d 96 (2002), decided subsequent to both <em>Riverdale </em>and <em>Holland, </em>we reaffirmed the principles of <em>Yorkdale. </em>There, the granting of a special exception for the outdoor storage of excavating material was at issue. The landowner, respondent, in that case was granted a special exception by the Calvert County Board of Appeals in February of 1997, over the protests of his neighbors. The neighbors, petitioners, appealed to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the decision of the Board. The neighbors then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In December of 1998, while the appeal was pending, the Board amended the pertinent zoning ordinance to disallow outdoor storage of excavating material, repealing the section under which the landowner had initially obtained approval from the Board for his special exception. In April of 1999, the Court of Special Appeals issued an unreported opinion <em>(Powell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>I), reversing the Circuit Court\u2019s decision, vacating the Board\u2019s decision, and remanding the case back to the Board. The intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision was based upon a \u201clack of evidence result[ing] in a deficient record from which the court was unable to determine if the Board\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>368 Md. at 405, 795 A.2d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In September of 1999, the Board again considered the landowner\u2019s application for a special exception. His application was granted, with the Board applying the law as it existed at the time of the original hearing (February 1997), not in accord \"with the new ordinance enacted in December of 1998. The neighbors appealed that decision to the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court upheld the Board\u2019s decision based upon a finding that the landowner had established a vested right. The neighbors again appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the relevant decision of the Board <em>(Powell </em>II).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We first looked at the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Powell II, Powell v. Calvert County, </em>137 Md.App. 425, 435-36, 768 A.2d 750, 756 (2001), where the court found that, under <em>Holland, </em>the amendment to the zoning ordinance <em>by its terms </em>operated retrospectively. <em>Powell, </em>368 Md. at 407-08, 795 A.2d at 100. We then went into an in-depth discussion of whether the landowner had obtained vested rights, ultimately holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cIn instances where there is ongoing litigation, there is no different \u2018rule of vested right\u2019 for special exceptions and the like. Until all necessary approvals, including all final court approvals, are obtained, nothing can vest or even begin to vest. Additionally, even after final court approval is reached, additional actions must sometimes be taken in order for rights to vest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 409, 795 A.2d at 101. We found that the landowner in <em>Powell </em>had not obtained a vested right because he had \u201cnever used his property for the storage of materials under a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>special exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 795 A.2d at 103.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We then, discussing <em>Ross v. Montgomery County, </em>252 Md. 497, 250 A.2d 635 (1969), cited <em>Yorkdale </em>and <em>Mandel </em>in support of this \u201congoing litigation\u201d reasoning and for the rule that, in cases involving land use and zoning, we apply the law as it \u201cnow exists,\u201d absent a vested right. <em>Powell, </em>368 Md. at 412-13, 795 A.2d at 103. In <em>Powell, </em>we reiterated the language of <em>York-dale, </em>that one \u201cwho has been successful before the zoning authorities and the circuit court does not acquire a vested or substantive right which may not be wiped out by legislation which takes effect during the pendency in this Court of the appeal from the sections below.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>368 Md. at 413, 795 A.2d at 103 (quoting <em>Ross, </em>252 Md. at 503, 250 A.2d at 639 (quoting <em>Yorkdale, </em>237 Md. at 126, 205 A.2d at 272)) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Respondents, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>attempt to characterize <em>Powell\u2019s </em>citations to <em>Yorkdale </em>and <em>Mandel </em>as only affirming the \u201cproposition that mere zoning approval does not create vested rights.\u201d Respondents assert that, \u201c[i]f <em>Yorkdale </em>was still good law, the Court had the opportunity to so state. It did not.\u201d The converse, however, is true. We did not have to state that <em>Yorkdale </em>is good law, because it was and still is. <em>Yorkdale </em>has never been overruled and our citation to it in <em>Powell </em>is evidence of that. Had <em>Yorkdale </em>been overruled, we would have had to distinguish it. Thus, not only does it stand for the proposition elucidated in <em>Powell, </em>that approval pending ongoing litigation does not create a vested right, but also for the rule that we reiterate today, that in the case of land use and zoning issues, appellate courts generally are bound to apply the law (whatever its source) relating to those issues as it exists at the time of their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Respondents cite to several additional non-land use and non-zoning cases in support of their argument that we should not retrospectively apply a change in statutory law: <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Evans, </em>382 Md. 370, 855 A.2d 364 (2004); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 829 A.2d 611 (2003); <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000); <em>Informed Physician Services, Inc. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Md., Inc., </em>350 Md. 308, 711 A.2d 1330 (1998); <em>Morgan v. Cohen, </em>309 Md. 304, 523 A.2d 1003 (1987). None of these cases dealt with land use or zoning and, thus, they do not affect the viability of the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule as applicable to land use and zoning cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Respondents also argue that the law in question, \u00a7\u00a7 17.300(g) and 17.307(d) of the Howard County Code, is not part of Howard County\u2019s zoning ordinance or regulation, but part of the Howard County Animal Control Law. The zoning law, however, impliedly incorporates those relevant provisions of the Animal Control Law. The Animal Control Law was applied by the Board in making its land use determination as to whether Frisky\u2019s was entitled to a special exception under the zoning ordinance. It was applied in a land use context.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, it was a determinative provision in a zoning context, and we will apply it retrospectively under <em>Yorkdale. </em>On remand, the Board shall apply the current law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we reaffirm the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule that a substantive change in relevant statutory law that takes place during the course of the litigation of a land use or zoning issue shall be retrospectively applied by appellate courts. We reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

In the forty plus years since <em>Yorkdale, </em>governmental entities have generally supported its applicability in land use cases.

An amendatory Act takes effect, like any other legislative enactment, only from the time of its passage, and has no application to prior transactions, unless an intent to the contrary is expressed in the Act or clearly implied from its provisions.\u2019 <em>State Tax Comm. v. Potomac Power Company, </em>182 Md. 111, 117, 32 A.2d 382.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">(3) A statute, even if the Legislature so intended, will not be applied retrospectively to divest or adversely affect vested rights, to impair the obligation of contracts, or so as to violate the due process clause, or to operate as a bill of attainder or an ex <em>post facto </em>law. Aside from the disinclination of legislative bodies and courts to make a law operate on past events or transactions, the limitations on retroactive laws are only those which affect all legislation and, if the Legislature intends a law affecting substantive matters to operate retrospectively and the law does not offend constitutional limitations or restrictions, it will be given the effect intended.

As Judge Cathell\u2019s opinion points out, there is, indeed, case law to support the conclusion that zoning cases have been treated somewhat differently than other kinds of cases in determining the effect to be given to a change in statutory law while a matter is pending in court. I therefore cannot fault the Court\u2019s reliance on those cases in continuing to carve out a special exception \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 for zoning, or even broader land use, cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">My problem is that I can find no practical or jurisprudential basis for such a distinction, and the Court offers none. The issue is always presented when a legislature changes a law whether that change, from and after its declared effective date, should apply to matters already in litigation when the law takes effect. On the one hand, as Chief Justice Marshall observed in the <em>Schooner Peggy </em>case, there is a certain anomaly in a court\u2019s failure to apply the law that is in effect when it decides the case, for the effect of that is to render a judicial decision that is not supported by existing law. On the other hand, there is a certain unfairness in applying laws retroactively, at least where, as part of its legitimate declaration of public policy, the legislative body has not clearly indicated an intent that they be so applied. In both commerce and personal dealings, people and entities necessarily rely on existing law to guide their conduct and their transactions, and that necessary and permissible reliance \u2014 that certainty \u2014 is seriously jeopardized when the rules are changed in the middle of the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The general rules that we have adopted attempt to balance those considerations. As an overarching principle, subject only to Constitutional imperatives, we have left it to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>legislative body to determine whether statutory changes should be applied to matters already in litigation. If the legislature declares that a new law should be so applied and there is no Constitutional impediment to such application, we respect the legislative judgment and apply the new law as the legislature intended. The problem arises when there is no such expressed intent \u2014 when all that we have is an effective date of the law and nothing more. In those situations, we have generally applied the principle that, if the change is o ne of procedure only, we will apply the new law even if doing so would produce a different result than not doing so. If the change affects substance, however, we will not apply the new law, at least if doing so would produce a different result. In that circumstance, we do not permit the rules to be changed mid-stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Those distinctions are not perfect; they can, and sometimes do, result in what may appear to be an injustice in a given case, and it is not always clear whether a change is merely procedural or also affects substance. But, on the whole, the distinctions are reasonable, and they have a solid jurisprudential basis. When we start carving out categorical exceptions to them, however, both their rationality and their jurisprudential basis are eroded. Why just zoning or land use cases? What is so special about them? They involve property, but only real property. Is real property somehow more, or less, sacred than other kinds of property, including contractual rights? I would be more inclined to bless the Court\u2019s opinion in this case if it offered any legitimate reason for drawing a distinction between zoning cases and other kinds of cases. Unfortunately, however, it does not. I would therefore overrule the prior case law relied upon by the Court and affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
