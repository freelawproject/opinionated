Vol., 2006 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s license was suspended after he refused to take an alcohol concentration test following a traffic stop for speeding. Respondent challenged the suspension before the Office of Administrative Hearings. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found respondent to be in violation of \u00a7 16-205.1. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County vacated that ruling. Because we find that the administrative ruling was based on substantial evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>was not rendered on the basis of an erroneous conclusion of law, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, commonly known as Maryland\u2019s Implied Consent Law, provides the statutory structure for suspending the license of a driver who refuses to submit to testing for alcohol concentration. Section 16-205.1(a)(2) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cAny person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol ...\u201d Section 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2) requires a police officer who has <em>reasonable grounds </em>to believe that a person has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201c(i) Detain the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">(iii) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15 at the time of testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">(iv) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions, including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license unless the person participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program under \u00a7 16-404.1 of this title, that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test and for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">(iv) Advise the person of the additional criminal penalties that may be imposed under \u00a7 27-101 (x) of this article on conviction of a violation of \u00a7 21-902 of this article if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>person knowingly refused to take a test arising out of the same circumstances as the violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Notwithstanding the implied consent to take a test, a driver is generally not compelled to submit to testing to determine alcohol concentration. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l). Section 16-205.1(b)(3), however, directs a police officer to respond to a driver\u2019s refusal to take a test by seizing the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license, serving a temporary order of suspension, issuing a temporary driver\u2019s license, and informing the driver of his or her right to a hearing and possible administrative sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Section 16-205.1(f)(8)(i) requires the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) to suspend an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license if the ALJ makes certain findings at an administrative hearing. The section states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cAfter a hearing, the Administration shall suspend the driver\u2019s license or privilege to drive of the person charged under subsection (b) or (c) of this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">1. The police officer who stopped or detained the person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">2. There was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">3. The police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised, as required under subsection (b)(2) of this section, of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">4. A. The person refused to take the test; or B. A test to determine alcohol concentration was taken and the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">An aggrieved driver whose license has been suspended may seek judicial review of the administrative decision before a circuit court of this State. \u00a7 16-205.1(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Respondent\u2019s license was suspended pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(i) following a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings. At the hearing, the ALJ issued an opinion and order based upon a form DR-15A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed by the arresting officer and the testimony of respondent. The DR-15A indicated that at 1:03 a.m., on October 7, 2005, Gaithersburg City Police Officer Finch saw respondent driving in excess of 132 miles per hour, that he stopped the vehicle, there was a strong odor of alcohol on respondent\u2019s breath, respondent had bloodshot and watery eyes, respondent blew a preliminary breath test of O. 10, and respondent admitted drinking two beers. Based on this evidence, the ALJ made the following findings of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">On October 7, 2005, at 1:03 a.m., Officer Finch observed a Porsche Boxster traveling at a speed in excess of 132 miles per hour on Route 1-270 in Montgomery County, Maryland. The officer initiated a traffic stop, at which time he identified respondent as the driver of the Porsche. Respondent had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath, as well as watery and bloodshot eyes. Officer Finch asked respondent if he had been drinking, and respondent stated that he had two beers earlier that evening. After the officer administered a preliminary breath test, respondent performed a standard field sobriety test, which included a horizontal gaze nystagmus test, a walk and turn test, and a one leg stand test. Officer Finch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>arrested respondent for driving under the influence of alcohol, and indicated in his report that respondent failed the field sobriety test.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Back at the police station, Officer Finch requested that respondent take a breathalyzer test to determine his alcohol concentration level. The officer advised respondent of administrative and criminal sanctions he would face for either refusing to submit to testing or submitting to testing where the results showed an alcohol concentration level above the legal limit. Respondent signed a form DR-15,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thus acknowledging that the officer advised him of the possible sanctions he would face for refusing the test. Respondent refused the breath test. Pursuant to the statute, and acting on behalf of the MVA, Officer Finch served an order of suspension of respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">At the administrative hearing, the ALJ determined that Officer Finch had reasonable grounds to believe respondent had been driving under the influence of alcohol on the night in question. The ALJ ruled orally as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cI\u2019ve considered the evidence and the testimony presented in this case, and I find by a preponderance of the evidence the following facts. The police officer who stopped or detained you, Mr. Shepard, did have reasonable grounds to believe that you were driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol because when he first came upon you, you were speeding 132 miles per hour, and there was further evidence of the use of alcohol based upon the fact that it was early morning hours, you had an odor of alcohol, you had bloodshot, watery eyes, the standard field sobriety tests were performed unsatisfactorily, and you admitted drinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The issue was alcohol in this case pretty clearly. And in any event the issue is not probable cause. That is the issue in a criminal proceeding. The issue in this case is reasonable grounds. The reasonable grounds as stated by the officer are much more than sufficient. He has stated more than sufficient reasonable grounds to request that you take a test. That\u2019s what he was doing here. The standard field sobriety tests are identified contrary to counsel\u2019s statement. Horizontal gaze nystagmus, walk and turn, one leg stand, he says that those tests were done. He said based on the results arrested. There is also a reasonable inference that I am going to draw that based upon that language that the tests were done not to his satisfaction which is why he arrested you for driving while under the influence of alcohol. The officer did fully advise you of the sanctions to be imposed, requested that you take a test which you refused. Therefore, you are in violation of \u00a7 16-205.1\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The ALJ filed written findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which she stated \u00a7 16-205.1 was violated based upon the following: \u201cearly A.M. hours, odor alcohol, bloodshot, watery eyes, SFSTS [standard field sobriety tests] performed unsatisfactorily, admitted drinking.\u201d The ALJ imposed a one year suspension of respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license, stayed on the condition that he participate in the Ignition Interlock Program for a period of eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Respondent filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Before the Circuit Court, respondent argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u201c[T]he operative allegations upon which the administrative law judge premised his decision were, \u2018standard field sobriety tests, the nystagmus gaze, walk and turn, one leg stand were done, based on results, arrested.\u2019 We argued before the administrative law judge, and we argue here, that those test results, that are not enumerated in the certification of the officer, do not constitute competent evidence upon which an administrative agency may base its decision that a reasonable person would have believed that the individual in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>question had operated a motor vehicle while impaired. That is the central thrust of our argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Respondent maintained that an officer must state the factual basis upon which he concludes that field sobriety tests are not done to his satisfaction. He argued that the evidence presented and the inferences drawn by the ALJ were incompetent and therefore, the factual decision of the ALJ was not based upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The Circuit Court agreed. The Circuit Court vacated the ruling after determining that the ALJ based her ruling solely on the results of the field sobriety test. The court concluded that the results of the sobriety test constituted incompetent evidence because particular facts regarding respondent\u2019s performance on the field sobriety test were not identified on the form DR-15A. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201cHe expressly states the basis of his ruling on the unsatisfactory performance of enumerated roadside sobriety tests, we have no clue of what that was. And I don\u2019t believe the law is that the Court should say, well, because the defendant failed, and in any kind of test, because the blood test failed or you could come in on a criminal case and say, because the DNA indicated you were there without getting any results, without saying what it was at all ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">But what we have here is unsatisfactory performance. Now, we hear it all the time in guilty pleas, but that\u2019s an entirely different scenario. But not when this Court is here to make its decision based upon, look at the findings of the administrative law judge, and says it is not my role to sit here and decide that a finding of stepping off line and weaving, whether that\u2019s reasonable grounds to make an arrest or not, that is not the role of this Court to go back like an instant replay, second-guess that, and say that shouldn\u2019t have been reasonable grounds. That\u2019s just not the role of this Court. But this Court doesn\u2019t have before it what the grounds were at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">And for those reasons, the findings of the administrative law judge will be vacated, and the petition is sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The MVA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court. We granted the petition to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cDid the ALJ have substantial evidence to find the arresting officer who stopped Shepard had reasonable grounds to request a chemical breath test under [\u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i)(l) ], when the ALJ considered that Shepard was stopped for speeding 132 miles per hour, was observed at the time of his stop to have a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath, as well as watery bloodshot eyes, had a preliminary breath test result of 0.10 and was arrested based on the result of field sobriety tests, which the officer did not describe in detail in his written statements?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"><em>MVA v. Shepard, </em>396 Md. 9, 912 A.2d 646 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Before this Court, the MVA argues that there was substantial evidence to support the ruling of the ALJ that respondent violated \u00a7 16-205.1. The MVA argues that the statute does not require an officer to provide a detailed written description of how a person performs on a field sobriety test and that the DR-15A upon which the ALJ relied contained sufficient information and reasonable grounds to ask respondent to take the alcohol concentration test. Alternatively, the MVA argues that even without the results of the field sobriety test, the officer\u2019s certification indicated that respondent was traveling at an excessive rate of speed, had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath, had watery and bloodshot eyes, and admitted to drinking, all of which are indicia of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">In his initial argument, as noted in his brief before this Court, respondent states that the ALJ found that \u201cthe only bases upon which the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that Shepard was attempting to drive while under the influence is articulated in the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s written finding of fact, i.e., that Shepard was speeding at 132 miles per hour.\u201d Somewhat inconsistently, respondent then argues that the ALJ relied solely, and improperly, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>eonclusory statement of the officer as to the results of the field sobriety test. Respondent\u2019s second argument is that the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard. In his brief before this Court, respondent states that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as used in the statute means \u201cprobable cause.\u201d At oral argument, based upon this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Volodarsky v. Tarachanskaya, </em>397 Md. 291, 916 A.2d 991 (2007), a case filed after respondent\u2019s brief, he maintained that the term \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as seen in \u00a7 16-205.1 means \u201ca preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We consider first whether the evidence at the administrative hearing was sufficient for the ALJ to conclude that Officer Finch possessed the reasonable grounds necessary to request a test to determine respondent\u2019s alcohol concentration. We hold that the ALJ\u2019s ruling was supported by substantial evidence to show that the officer possessed the requisite reasonable grounds required by \u00a7 16-205.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Maryland courts play a limited role when reviewing adjudicatory decisions of administrative agencies. <em>See Fowler v. MVA </em>394 Md. 331, 342, 906 A.2d 347, 353 (2006). The Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.) \u00a7 10-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article, sets out the framework for judicial review of administrative agency decisions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\"><em>\u201cDecision </em>\u2014 In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.) \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court\u2019s role in reviewing an agency adjudicatory decision is very narrow. <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 570-71, 873 A.2d 1145, 1154 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In <em>Board of Physician v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 729 A.2d 376 (1999), we discussed the standard of review of administrative agency decisions. We noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">\u201cA court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">\u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 729 A.2d at 380-81 (internal citations and quotations omitted). <em>See also MVA v. Illiano, </em>390 Md. 265, 274-75, 888 A.2d 329, 335 (2005). A court may set aside an agency\u2019s factual finding only when the finding is \u201cunsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted.\u201d <em>Spencer v. State Board of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 529, 846 A.2d 341, 349 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the substantial evidence test was not applied properly by the Circuit Court to the ALJ\u2019s final decision. The ALJ did not err in concluding that respondent violated \u00a7 16-205.1. The ALJ\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence to support the finding that the police officer who initiated the traffic stop had reasonable grounds to believe respondent was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Contrary to the conclusion of the Circuit Court, the record reflects that the ALJ considered the totality of the officer\u2019s observations when she determined whether he possessed the requisite reasonable grounds. In the judge\u2019s oral findings of fact, she stated that she considered the odor of alcohol, respondent\u2019s physical condition, his admitted use of alcohol earlier that evening, his excessive speed of 132 miles per hour, and his performance on the field sobriety tests. <em>See c.f, State v. Orvis, </em>143 Vt. <em>388, </em>465 A.2d 1361, 1362 (1983) (holding that a \u201cmild odor of alcohol, defendant\u2019s excited state and his admission of alcohol consumption, in conjunction with the fact of the 3:00 a.m. automobile accident and admitted operation, would appear to provide reasonable grounds for further inquiry by a law enforcement officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Respondent\u2019s assertion that the ALJ considered only the \u201cfactually unsupported field sobriety test\u201d or the fact that respondent was traveling in excess of 132 miles per hour is simply wrong and unsupported by the record. The Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion is erroneous as well. The Circuit Court determined that the ALJ based her decision exclusively on the results of the field sobriety test. The court found that because the field sobriety test results were not explained in sufficient detail, the ruling was based on incompetent evidence and could not be sustained. The test is whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the agency. As the ALJ made clear, she considered the combined evidence at the hearing \u201cmore than sufficient ... to request that [respondent] take a test.\u201d She did not simply consider the field sobriety test and the evidence she considered was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>more than sufficient to request respondent to take a test to determine his alcohol concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We turn now to respondent\u2019s argument that the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard in construing the meaning of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as used in \u00a7 16-205.1. Based on our recent opinion in <em>Volodarsky, </em>397 Md. 291, 916 A.2d 991, he argues that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d means \u201ca preponderance of the evidence standard\u201d or at the very least, probable cause. We disagree and hold that the term \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as used in \u00a7 16-205.1 means \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d and not preponderance of the evidence or probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In interpreting a statute, we have stated repeatedly that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006). In <em>Mountain Lake, </em>we explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cIn ascertaining legislative intent, we first examine the plain language of the statute, and if the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, we give effect to the statute as it is written. If a statute has more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous. If the language of the statute is ambiguous, we resolve the ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, considering the legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose. We consider both the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute and how that language relates to the overall meaning, setting, and purpose of the act. We avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense. We construe a statute as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The United States Supreme Court addressed the threat to public safety caused by drunk drivers in <em>South Dakota v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 103 S.Ct. 916, 74 L.Ed.2d 748 (1983).

The statute was enacted in 1989 to allow a driver\u2019s license to be suspended promptly for suspected drunken driving if the person refused a test to determine alcohol concentration. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 460-62, 597 A.2d 939, 941-43 (1991). The purpose of the statute was to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests; the statute was not meant to protect drivers. <em>MVA v.

Rather, the statute requires that \u201cthe person should be <em>detained </em>on <em>suspicion </em>of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">As we have noted in the context of criminal cases, there are three types of police encounters: an arrest, an investigatory stop or detention, and a consensual encounter. <em>Swift v. State, </em>393 Md. 139, 150, 899 A.2d 867, 873 (2006). An arrest requires probable cause; an investigatory detention, which is a seizure of limited duration, does not require probable cause but instead requires reasonable articulable suspicion; and a consensual encounter need not be supported by any level of suspicion. <em>Id. </em>Given the underlying purpose and plain language of \u00a7 16-205.1 requiring a detention and not an arrest, we conclude that the use of the word \u201cdetained,\u201d combined with the word \u201csuspicion,\u201d means reasonable articulable suspicion and not probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Respondent argues alternatively that, based on our recent decision in <em>Volodarsky, </em>397 Md. 291, 916 A.2d 991, the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201creasonable grounds\u201d in \u00a7 16-205.1 means \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Volodarsky </em>was a child custody case in which one parent accused the other of child sexual abuse. The issue before the Court was the construction of Md.Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article. Section 9-101 requires, in any custody or visitation proceeding, that, if the court has \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that a child has been abused or neglected by a party to the proceeding, the court must determine whether abuse or neglect is likely to occur if custody or visitation rights are granted to that party. \u00a7 9-101(a). The statute states that, unless the court finds specifically that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by the party, the court must either deny custody or visitation rights to that party or approve a supervised visitation arrangement that assures the safety and physiological, psychological, and emotional well-being of the child. \u00a7 9-101(b). In holding that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d means the same as preponderance of the evidence under \u00a7 9-101, we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cThe two subsections of \u00a7 9-101 must be read together. Subsection (a) requires that, if, in a custody or visitation proceeding, the court has reasonable grounds to believe that a child has been abused or neglected by a party to the proceeding, the court must determine whether abuse or neglect is likely to occur if custody or visitation rights are granted to the party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">Subsection (b) then states the consequence of the court\u2019s determination that reasonable grounds for such a belief exist. In that event, the court must deny custody or visitation, except in a secure, supervised setting, unless it specifically finds \u2018that there is no likelihood <em>of further abuse or neglect by the party. </em>\u2019 (Emphasis added). To require a specific finding that <em>further </em>abuse or neglect\u2019 is not likely clearly implies that there must be some sort of finding or determination by the court that abuse or neglect likely occurred in the first instance. The question is whether, <em>at a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>minimum, </em>that finding must be made by at least a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">It defies logic and reason to permit a court to make what is essentially a finding of fact, especially one that may lead to the deprivation of a Constitutionally-based right of access to one\u2019s child, when the court is unable to find, even by the slimmest margin, that the fact is more likely so than not. How can a court have reasonable grounds for it to believe that an act occurred if it is not persuaded, from whatever evidence is properly before it, that the act more likely occurred than not? Under the Court of Special Appeals rationale, a court could find reasonable grounds to believe that which, in its own mind, it does not believe because, in its view, the credible evidence does not support the fact, and that strikes us as the antithesis of reasonableness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au0\"><em>Volodarsky, </em>397 Md. at 304-06, 916 A.2d at 999-1000 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The decision required by a circuit court judge under \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article and that of the police officer on the road under \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article are very different. The Family Law Article requires the judge to make a finding of fact \u2014 one which necessarily must be by a preponderance of the evidence. The police officer on the road need only have suspicion of intoxication to justify further investigation and further detention under \u00a7 16-205.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">We pointed out in <em>Volodarsky </em>that the determination of reasonable grounds for a belief can involve either an objective or subjective analysis, depending on the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 916 A.2d at 1000. When a police officer is called upon to make a preliminary determination based on incomplete and often non-testimonial hearsay evidence as to whether probable cause or reasonable grounds or reasonable suspicion exists to justify some further step in an investigation, the officer may take the evidence at face value and simply decide whether, if true, it leads to a reasonable belief that an offense was committed. <em>See id. </em>(noting that an \u201cobjective analysis is most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>often used in situations in which only a preliminary determination need be made, based on incomplete and often non-testimonial hearsay evidence\u201d). The result of such a determination is not an ultimate finding of fact, but simply a basis for taking a further procedural step \u2014 an arrest, a detention, a search, or, as in this case, a request to take a test to determine alcohol concentration. When a court is called upon to make a judicial finding, a different analysis may be required. The court often must make credibility determinations and weigh the value of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 916 A.2d at 1000-01. Because the judicial finding has preclusive effect, the court, unless required to use a higher standard, must find its conclusion supported by at least a preponderance of the evidence, for anything less would necessarily be arbitrary. <em>Id. </em>at 305-06, 916 A.2d at 1000. We are not dealing here with that kind of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">As we have indicated, reasonable grounds means less than probable cause. <em>Ipso facto, </em>it does not mean preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Although counsel for the respondent Shepard, in oral argument before the ALJ, used both the phrase \u201cprobable cause\u201d and the statutory phrase \u201creasonable grounds\u201d in arguing that the police officer did not have a sufficient basis to believe that Shepard was driving his motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, counsel for Mr. Shepard made absolutely no argument with respect to the meaning of the phrase \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d Furthermore, although the ALJ, in the oral ruling rejecting counsel\u2019s arguments, pointed out that the statutory standard was \u201creasonable grounds\u201d rather than \u201cprobable cause,\u201d the ALJ rendered no opinion or legal conclusion with respect to the meaning of the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard. It was not an issue at the administrative hearing but was raised for the first time in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">At the administrative hearing, on February 9, 2006, counsel for Mr. Shepard (Mr. John F.X. Costello) made what he categorized as three arguments relating to whether Mr. Shep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ard should be sanctioned pursuant to \u00a7 16-20 5.1 of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Mr. Costello initially argued that Mr. Shepard\u2019s preliminary breath test (PBT) results, included in the police officer\u2019s certification (Form DR-15A), should not be admitted into evidence. Counsel relied upon a Court of Special Appeals opinion holding that PBT results were inadmissible in circuit court criminal cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ pointed out that a recent Court of Appeals opinion held that PBT results were admissible in administrative hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the ALJ ruled that, \u201cif you don\u2019t want me to consider the PBT, I have no problem not considering it. I\u2019ll just read everything but the PBT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Counsel\u2019s next arguments at the administrative hearing concerned the certification form. Mr. Costello argued that the refusal to take an alcohol concentration test \u201cwas not signed by the test technician\u201d and that, because of the police officer\u2019s punctuation in the certification, the certification did not comply with \u00a7 16-205.1. This latter contention seemed to be that, because of the absence of a comma, it was not clear whether \u201cthis officer is certifying under his reasonable grounds that this man was under the influence of alcohol\u201d or whether \u201che\u2019s certifying that based on the reasonable grounds he was driving a motor vehicle after consuming a controlled dangerous substance. There\u2019s absolutely no indication whatsoever that he was operating a motor vehicle after consuming a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d The ALJ, without ruling upon these contentions at the time, asked respondent\u2019s counsel to make \u201cyour third argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The third and final argument by respondent\u2019s counsel was that the evidence was insufficient for the police officer to have had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Shepard was driving while under the influence of alcohol. In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>counsel contended that \u201c[t]here is absolutely no evidence before the Court [the ALJ] as to what the standard field sobriety test results were.\u201d While Mr. Shepard\u2019s attorney at times used the phrase \u201cprobable cause,\u201d as well as the statutory phrase \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d he at no time made or intimated any contention regarding the meaning or interpretation of the statutory language \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d The argument was completely factual, based on the asserted absence of substantial evidence. Counsel\u2019s entire argument was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cATTORNEY JOHN F.X. COSTELLO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cThe third argument is when the Court looks at the reasonable grounds and excludes the impermissible PBT from [our] standpoint as the Court has agreed to do so the four corners of the reasonable grounds certification does not amount to probable cause. There is absolutely no evidence before the Court as to what the standard field sobriety test results were. They\u2019re not outlined at all. All the Court has before Your Honor is driving a motor vehicle at a high rate of speed with a strong odor of alcohol and bloodshot watery eyes. The fact that the officer chooses not to give you the test results is an indication of his own disbelief in either the test results or his belief that the test results would be indicative of something other than probable cause of intoxication. As Your Honor knows, the whole purpose for field sobriety tests is that odor of alcohol and bloodshot eyes standing alone is not evidence of probable cause of an individual\u2019s inability to operate a motor vehicle safely. Here we got a man that is driving a vehicle very well at a very high rate of speed. That in and of itself militates against any inference of probable cause of impaired ability to drive due to alcohol, number one. Number two, the officer chooses not to give this Court any benefit of what the field sobriety test results showed. To the extent that they don\u2019t, that is an inference against the officer and to the extent that the officer needs those field sobriety tests upon which to base his certification of probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>arrest, and that\u2019s the whole reason that they\u2019re done, a failure is indicative of probable cause but compliance with or a successful completion of field sobriety tests is an indication of just the opposite. When he purposely chooses not to give you the benefit of those results there\u2019s got to be an honest inference that they would not have been helpful. Whether the Court wants to argue or whether you want to accept it under a spoliation theory or just a failure to certify under a reasonable grounds theory. He could have come in and said nystagmus gaze constitutes a failure, that the man could not walk safely, he could not do walk-and-turn, he could not do the one-leg stand. He hasn\u2019t given you the benefit of any of that. And the whole reason that he had to do them was that candidly you and I both know that it does not amount to probable cause if an individual is lawfully operating a motor vehicle, i.e. within the lanes, at a high rate of speed and simply has an odor of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. If that were the case then there would be no need for the field sobriety test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Immediately following the above argument, the ALJ asked whether counsel had any additional arguments; the ALJ did not want to be \u201csandbagged\u201d by some additional contention made later. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE FRIEDMAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cOkay. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201cATTORNEY JOHN F.X.

I\u2019m going to rule so I want to know whether there are any other arguments. You stated three. I\u2019m going to rule on all three of your arguments. I don\u2019t want you then to be telling me that you have another argument so I want to have all the arguments at once. \u201cATTORNEY JOHN F.X. COSTELLO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">\u201cI appreciate that. And what I meant by not at this time is if you don\u2019t rule in our favor and I put on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>evidence, I have a right to renew my motion. Nothing more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Counsel then had Mr. Shepard testify. At the conclusion of that testimony, counsel reiterated his argument that there was insufficient evidence and asserted that Mr. Shepard\u2019s testimony confirmed the alleged insufficiency. Again, no statutory interpretation argument was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The ALJ thereupon delivered an oral ruling, rejecting those arguments which the ALJ had not previously ruled upon. With respect to the principal argument by Mr. Shepard\u2019s counsel, the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cThe issue in this case is reasonable grounds. The reasonable grounds as stated by the officer are much more than sufficient. He has stated more than sufficient reasonable grounds to request that you take a test. That\u2019s what he was doing here. The standard field sobriety tests are identified contrary to counsel\u2019s statement. HGN, walk-and-turn, one-leg stand, he says that those tests were done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">At no time did the ALJ make any conclusions concerning the interpretation of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as used in the statute. As previously mentioned, the ALJ did point out that the statutory standard was \u201creasonable grounds\u201d and not \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Nothing was said, however, about the meaning of \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d Finally, no statutory interpretation issue was mentioned in the ALJ\u2019s written conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">As emphasized time after time in our cases, courts should not judicially review adjudicatory administrative decisions on grounds not raised before the administrative agency. The General Assembly, as a matter of public policy, has determined that administrative agencies and administrative law judges should initially rule upon issues falling within the jurisdiction of the agencies and ALJs. Permitting agencies and ALJs to be \u201csandbagged\u201d by new legal issues raised for the first time in circuit courts is directly contrary to the legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Even if the statutory interpretation issue were before us, there is no good reason to utilize the somewhat complicated criminal law concepts of arrest, \u201cprobable cause,\u201d \u201creasonable articulable suspicion,\u201d etc., with their federal law and state law components, and apply such concepts to a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard in a state law civil proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">There is no issue presented in this case, and rationally there could be no issue, that Mr. Shepard was lawfully arrested under Maryland law. He committed a misdemeanor in the presence of a police officer, <em>i.e., </em>driving a motor vehicle in excess of 132 miles per hour.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Maryland Code (2001), \u00a7 2-202(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article. No other criminal law issue is involved. The license suspension proceeding, based upon Mr. Shepard\u2019s refusal to take an alcohol concentration test, is entirely a civil administrative proceeding, subject to a statutory civil action for judicial review. While three or four issues may have been raised at the administrative hearing, the only surviving issue is whether the police officer had \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that Mr. Shepard was \u201cdriving ... while under the influence of alcohol [or] while impaired by alcohol ...,\u201d \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Courts and adjudicatory agencies have traditionally applied the \u201creasonableness\u201d standard in civil proceedings without utilizing or drawing analogies to criminal law concepts. A multitude of negligence cases, of all types, require triers of fact to determine the \u201creasonableness\u201d of defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>See, e.g., Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 477, 479-480, 869 A.2d 837, 843, 845 (2005) (\u201cThe trier of fact must ... evaluate whether the actions taken by the defendant were reasonable under all the circumstances. * * * [T]he trier of fact must determine whether the defendant acted reasonably given the circumstances\u201d); <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty, </em>378 Md. 70, 84-85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>835 A.2d 616, 624 (2003). Similarly, in the present case, the ALJ as trier of fact should decide whether the police officer had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d under all of the circumstances. The ALJ did find that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d were present, and that finding was supported by substantial evidence. This should be the end of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Judge GREENE joins this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. <em>Harmon v.
