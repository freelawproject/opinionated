On March 26, 2003, the Public Service Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), one of the petitioners, entered a final order (Order No. 78354) granting Clipper Windpower, Inc. (\u201cClipper\u201d), the other petitioner (collectively \u201cthe petitioners\u201d), a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (\u201cCPCN\u201d) for the construction of a 101 megawatt (\u201cMW\u201d) wind turbine facility. On April 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>2003, by letter signed by Eric Tribbey, on behalf of, and as its representative, Friends of Backbone Mountain (\u201cFriends\u201d) requested a rehearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That request was denied (Order No. 78617). Thereafter, Tribbey, one of the respondents, acting on his own behalf, filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for judicial review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of both orders (Case No. 24-C-036366). This action for judicial review was consolidated with the judicial review action initiated by Paul C. Sprenger, Russell W. Bounds, and Troy Gnegy, the other respondents (collectively \u201cthe respondents\u201d), who also filed petitions for judicial review (Case No. 24-C-036325).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Clipper and the Commission each filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the respondents\u2019 petitions for judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>were untimely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Circuit Court agreed and, therefore, dismissed the actions for judicial review. The respondents noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We granted the petitions for writ of certiorari filed by both Clipper and the Commission, <em>Clipper Windpower v. Sprenger, </em>391 Md. 577, 894 A.2d 545 (2006), to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cWhether PUC \u00a7 3-114(c) limits the right to request rehearing solely to <em>\u2018a </em>party in interest\u2019 that has properly intervened as such in the Commission\u2019s proceedings, and is thus distinguishable from PUC \u00a7 3-202(a) which provides a right to judicial review to \u2018a party or person in interest ... dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the Commission \u20199\u201d [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>While, to be sure, the right to judicial review of orders and decisions of the Commission is available to \u201ca party or person in interest ... dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the Commission ...,\u201d PUC \u00a7 3-202(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we conclude that only a \u201cparty in interest\u201d may seek rehearing under PUC \u00a7 3-114. To be a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d if the requestor was not a party, the requestor must have intervened properly, pursuant to PUC \u00a7 3-106,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thus becoming a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">On August 26, 2002, Clipper filed an application with the Commission seeking authorization to build a wind turbine facility for the purpose of generating electricity. As required, Clipper notified the public, by publishing a notice in both <em>The Republican </em>and <em>The Cumberland Times-News, </em>generally circulated newspapers in Garrett County, on the successive weeks of September 26, 2002, September 30, 2002, October 3, 2002, and October 6, 2002, of its application to build the facility, and the date, time, and location of a scheduled prehearing conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The wind turbine facility was to be composed of up to 67 individual turbines. Each turbine would consist of a freestanding tower approximately 262 feet in height. A rotor, having a diameter not in excess of 262 feet (80m) (39m blades), would be attached to the tower. The maximum combined height would be approximately \u201c394 ft (120 m) with one blade in the vertical position.\u201d Clipper\u2019s executive summary of its proposal for the facility implied that some, but not all, of the turbines would be of that size and stated that all 67 turbines may not need to be built depending upon \u201cfactors ... not identified prior to [the] start of construction.\u201d In addition to the tower and the blade, each turbine would consist of a foundation anchoring it to the ground and a transformer that would collect the power from the turbines and transfer it to a substation through an \u201cunderground electrical collection system.\u201d All-weather gravel service roads would be built from existing hardtop roads and the cables associated with the electrical collection system were to be buried alongside such service roads. The total project area would cover approximately 10.8 miles and would be constructed on Backbone Mountain extending from \u201cWild Turkey Rock at an elevation of 3,228 ft (984 m) above sea level southwestward to Allegheny Heights at 3,200 ft (975 m).\u201d Although three other sites were surveyed, Allegheny Heights was selected \u201cbecause of wind resource potential and favorable site characteristics (primarily contiguous, well-exposed areas and proximity to three transmission lines).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">An adjudicatory hearing regarding Clipper\u2019s proposal, at which attendance was high, \u201cstanding room only,\u201d was held. Clipper, the Department of Natural Resources\u2019s Power Plant Research Program, the staff of the Commission, and the Office of People\u2019s Counsel were the named parties to the proceeding. Pursuant to PUC \u00a7 3-106, four individual members of the public intervened and were granted party status.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>those in attendance were respondents Eric Tribbey and Russell Bounds, who also testified. Although both Tribbey and Bounds submitted citizen comment letters following the conclusion of the hearing, neither they, nor Friends, sought to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The hearing examiner issued a proposed order that contained and recommended settlement conditions to which all of the parties had agreed, which the Commission subsequently adopted. It issued a final order (Order No. 78354) approving Clipper\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Tribbey, then, writing on behalf of Friends, submitted a letter to the Commission requesting a rehearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commission, by Order No. 78617, denied the request, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATF\">\u201cThis matter comes before the Public Service Commission (\u2018Commission\u2019) as a result of a series of filings made by entities that did not appear as parties in the above-captioned proceeding. On April 24, 2003, the Friends of Backbone Mountain (\u2018Friends\u2019) filed a <em>pro se </em>formal request for rehearing in this case. On April 25, 2003, Citizens for Responsible Wind Power (\u2018Citizens\u2019) also filed a <em>pro se </em>formal request for rehearing in this case. A third <em>pro se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>formal request for rehearing in this matter was filed on April 28, 2003, by The Garrett County Historical Society (\u2018Garrett Historical\u2019).... Friends made an additional filing, by Counsel, on June 27, 2003. This June 27th filing includes two documents: (1) an Application to Intervene, and (2) a Supplement to Request for Rehearing and Application to Reopen for Further Evidence .... On August 5, 2003, Counsel for Paul C. Sprenger filed an Application to Intervene and a Motion for Reconsideration and for Modification of the Order of the Public Service Commission (\u2018Sprenger Motion\u2019). This August 5th filing includes four exhibits (\u2018Sprenger Exhibits A, B, C, and D\u2019). None of the actual parties to the case have raised any objection to the Commission\u2019s Order No. 78354, issued on March 26, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\u201cThe Commission denies all four requests. Public Utility Companies (\u2018PUC\u2019) Article \u00a7 3 \u2014 114(c)(1) restricts the right to apply for rehearing to parties: \u2018A <em>party in interest </em>may apply to the Commission for rehearing within 30 days after service of a final order on the party.\u2019 [Emphasis added.] Since none of the four entities requesting rehearing were parties to the proceeding, none qualify to request rehearing. Additionally, the filing made on behalf of Friends on June 27, 2003, is not a filing provided for either under PUC \u00a7 3-114 or Code of Maryland Regulations (\u2018COMAR\u2019) \u00a7 20.07.02.08,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> both of which contemplate a single, c\u00f3mpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>hensive rehearing application by a party. Friends\u2019 June 27th filing is also well beyond the thirty-day period during which parties may request rehearing. Sprenger\u2019s filings are still further beyond the thirty-day period during which parties may request rehearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">\u201cClipper complied with all of the procedural elements of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (\u2018CPCN\u2019) process, including the provisions of COMAR \u00a7 20.79.01.03, and also complied with the Hearing Examiner\u2019s direction to advertise the pre-hearing conference and the public hearings in local Garrett County newspapers. The four entities requesting rehearing had sufficient notice and opportunity to intervene as parties; since they did not, they do not have standing to request rehearing----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201c... as already stated, Clipper properly advertised the prehearing conference and the public hearings in local Garrett County newspapers, thus providing sufficient notice to enable prompt and timely intervention. This is not a question of whether Friends could have intervened \u2018sooner in the process,\u2019 but rather an issue of whether Friends attempted to intervene <em>during </em>the process at all. The Commission finds that the attempted intervention is outside the process, and cannot be granted since the proceeding closed prior to the attempted intervention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Order No. 78617 (internal footnotes omitted). Thus, the Commission concluded that Friends was not a \u201cparty in interest\u201d under PUC \u00a7 3-114 because it had not properly intervened under PUC \u00a7 3-106. The Commission also determined that it already had fully considered the issues presented for rehearing in the original proceedings and it was not necessary to readdress them or to address them further.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Thereafter, as we have seen, Tribbey, on his own behalf, and not on behalf of Friends, filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Order No. 78617, and, on the same day, a separate petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Order was filed by the respondents Sprenger, Bounds, and Gnegy. The actions having been consolidated, the petitioners each filed a motion to dismiss the petitions as untimely. Before the Circuit Court, the respondents did not contend that they were \u201cparties\u201d to the proceeding, just that they were \u201cpersons in interest.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Tribbey argued, in addition, that although Friends was not a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d its application for rehearing tolled the time for filing a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The Circuit Court dismissed both actions, ruling that none of the respondents had filed a timely request for rehearing and that their petitions for judicial review were similarly untimely. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cThe [respondents] in these cases concede that judicial review is sought only under Section 3-202 of the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Utility Companies] Article. Under that section a \u2018party or person in interest\u2019 may seek judicial review of a decision or order of the Commission. This court assumes without deciding that the [respondents] are \u2018persons in interest.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201cThe issue then is whether the petitions for judicial review were timely. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-203(a)(1), the petitions had to be filed -within 30 days after the date of the order or action for which review is sought. I believe that was March 26th, 2003. In these cases the petitions were not filed until some five months later. So, unless the time for fifing was stayed, the petitions were untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201cNeither of the [respondents] filed a timely request for re-hearing before the Commissioner. Mr. Sprenger filed a request, but it was not timely. Even if it had been timely, however, the statute restricts petitions for rehearing before the Commission to parties in interest. That is the plain language of Section 3-114(c). Accordingly, the time for the [respondents] to seek judicial review pursuant to 3-202, was 30 days from March 26th, 2003. That date was not met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201cThe [respondents\u2019] attempt to, what I would call, piggyback on the arguably timely filings of others to stay a deadline is of no avail. First, there is no legal support under the Public Utility Companies] A[rticle] for the [respondents\u2019] position that the timely fifing of a petition for re-hearing by one party stays the time for fifing judicial review by another. Moreover, none of the entities that filed a request for re-hearing were parties in interest, so the [respondents\u2019] attempts at re-hearing were\u2014 I\u2019m sorry. Those parties\u2019 attempts, those entities\u2019 attempts at rehearing were like the [respondents\u2019] a nullity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Although Friends\u2019 request for rehearing may have been timely filed, its request was invalid because Friends was not a \u201cparty in interest\u201d and, thus, was not entitled to a rehearing under PUC \u00a7 3-114.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Thereafter, the respondents appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. In holding that the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>review action should not have been dismissed as untimely, the intermediate appellate court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cAs stated above, \u00a7 3-114 provides a \u2018party in interest\u2019 with the right to apply for a rehearing. We are persuaded that this term was placed into the statute in order to reduce the number of requests for rehearing that the Commission must deal with. The Court of Appeals has made it clear that \u2018one may become a party to an administrative proceeding rather easily.\u2019 <em>Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E., </em>375 Md. 59, 72[, 825 A.2d 388, 395] (2003) (quoting <em>Sugarloaf v. Department of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 286[, 686 A.2d 605, 613] (1996)). We conclude that a person who has become a \u2018party\u2019 to a Commission proceeding is not entitled to apply for a rehearing unless the order entered as a result of that proceeding has \u2018personally and specifically affected [him or her] in a way different from ... the public generally.\u2019 <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 288[, 686 A.2d 605, 614] (1996) (quoting <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 185[, 213 A.2d 487, 489-90] (1965)). As an \u2018adjoining landowner,\u2019 Mr. Tribbey was a \u2018party in interest\u2019 to the Commission proceeding because (1) his participation in the proceeding made him a \u2018party,\u2019 and (2) as an \u2018adjoining landowner\u2019 to the property where the turbines will be placed, the Commission\u2019s order has personally and specifically affected him in a way different from the way that order affects the general public,\u201d[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">and that Tribbey\u2019s request for rehearing was made <em>\u201cin both </em>his individual capacity <em>and </em>in his capacity as a representative of Friends of Backbone Mountain.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cit would be exalting form over substance to hypothesize that Mr. Tribbey made the request for a rehearing \u2018solely\u2019 as a representative of the Friends of Backbone Mountain.\u201d On this premise, the court held that, \u201cas a result of the timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>request for rehearing filed by Mr. Tribbey, all of the appellants had 30 days from August 8, 2003 to file their actions for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s March 26, 2003 order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We review, in this case, a decision by the Commission, an administrative agency.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Though couched in terms of a formal judicial review, we do not even actually reach that stage of the proceedings. Petitions for judicial review were filed by the respondents, but only after the Commission had denied Friends\u2019 application for rehearing. It is the denial of that application, encapsulated in Order No. 78617, upon which the resolution of this case primarily rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Our scope of judicial review of an action by the Public Service Commission is dictated by PUC \u00a7 3-203.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, we shall not overturn a factual decision by the Public Service Commission unless it proves to be unlawful or unreasonable. <em>Town of Easton v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>838 A.2d 1225, 379 Md. 21 (2003); <em>Office of Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>pie\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>733 A.2d 996, 355 Md. 1 (1999). Our review in the instant case is of the Commission\u2019s interpretation and application of provisions of the Public Utility Companies Article; thus, our review is <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The outcome of this case essentially hinges on the timeliness of the respondents\u2019 petitions for judicial review. That, in turn, depends on whether the respondents were \u201cparties\u201d or persons entitled to seek rehearing and, if so, whether they timely applied for that rehearing. We hold that the respondents were not parties entitled to seek rehearing and, therefore, they did not timely apply for rehearing. It follows, as well, that they did not petition for judicial review timely. We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In addressing the issues this case presents, we are required to construe various provisions of the Public Utility Companies Article. The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Centre Ins. Co. v. J.T.W., </em>397 Md. 71, 79, 916 A.2d 235, 239 (2007); <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443, 903 A.2d 388, 395 (2006). Statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]nd ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 443, 903 A.2d at 395 (quoting <em>Kushell v.

We stated in <em>Kushell </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201cIn construing the plain language, \u2018[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced by the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Price v.

The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487; <em>Navarro-Monzo v.

Inherent in the language of this provision is that one must be a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding in order to be able to apply for rehearing. An entity must be a <em>\u201cparty </em>in interest\u201d and may apply \u201cwithin 30 days after service of a final order on the <em>party.\u201d </em>PUC \u00a7 3-114(c) (emphasis added).

It states, in pertinent part: \u201cExcept for the staff of the Commission, a <em>party or person in interest </em>... that is dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the Commission may seek judicial review of the decision or order as provided in this subtitle.\u201d PUC \u00a7 3-202(a) (emphasis added). Maryland Rule 7-203<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this Rule or by statute, a petition for judicial review shall be filed within 30 days after the latest of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201c(1) the date of the order or action of which review is sought;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">\u201c(2) the date the administrative agency sent notice of the order or action to the petitioner, if notice was required by law to be sent to the petitioner, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">\u201c(3) the date the petitioner received notice of the agency\u2019s order or action, if notice was required by law to be received by the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Thus, for a petition for judicial review of an order issued by the Commission to be timely, it must be filed by a \u201cparty or person in interest\u201d within 30 days of the date of the final decision or order. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>that order was Order No. 78354, issued on March 26, 2003, which granted Clipper permission to build the wind turbine facility. Therefore, for the petitions in this case to have been timely filed, they would have had to have been filed by April 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Applying for rehearing under PUC \u00a7 3-114(c) is separate and distinct from seeking judicial review under PUC \u00a7 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>202(a). To apply for rehearing, an entity must be a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d PUC \u00a7 3-114(c), whereas, either a \u201cparty <em>or person in interest </em>\u201d may seek judicial review of a final order under PUC \u00a7 3-202(a). (Emphasis added). The respondents contend that a \u201cperson in interest\u201d is the same as a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d We do not agree and believe, in fact, that this is clearly not the case. The language in all of the relevant sections of the Public Utility Companies Article is unambiguous. Construing \u201cparty in interest\u201d and \u201cperson in interest\u201d as having the same meaning renders one or the other superfluous or nugatory. <em>See Chow, </em>393 Md. at 443, 903 A.2d at 395 (holding that when analyzing a statute, we look at the statutory scheme as a whole and harmonize the provisions so that each may be given effect.); <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193 (holding that \u201c[statutory text \u2018 \u201cshould be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d \u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Collins, </em>383 Md. at 691, 861 A.2d at 732 (quoting <em>Butler, </em>378 Md. at 696, 838 A.2d at 1187)). The respondents in addition assert that the legislative history of the Public Utility Companies Article lends credence to their argument. We need not, however, look beyond the plain and unambiguous language of the statute as written. <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 194 (citing <em>Collins, </em>383 Md. at 688-89, 861 A.2d at 730). We are satisfied that the current version is plainly and unambiguously written. Thus, we shall not delve into an analysis and interpretation of the prior versions of the Public Utility Companies Article, which the Legislature has amended and repealed over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The Commission\u2019s initial Order No. 78354 was issued on March 26, 2003. Friends applied, through Tribbey, for rehearing on April 24, 2003. The application was made within 30 days, as required by PUC \u00a7 3-114(c). Because, as indicated, Friends never intervened,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, so, never became a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>pursuant to PUC \u00a7 3-106, its application for rehearing was neither effective nor proper, as only a \u201cparty in interest\u201d may apply to the Commission for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Commission, in its August 8, 2003, Order No. 78617, denied Friends\u2019 request for rehearing. The Commission correctly interpreted PUC \u00a7 3 \u2014 114(c)(1) as \u201crestricting] the right to apply for rehearing to parties .... \u201d The order further stated that, \u201cSince none of the ... entities requesting rehearing were parties to the proceeding, none qualify to request rehearing.\u201d The Circuit Court concurred with this finding, stating that \u201cnone of the entities that filed a request for re-hearing were parties in interest.\u201d We agree with the Commission and Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">An entity must be a <em>\u201cparty </em>in interest\u201d in order to be entitled to apply for rehearing. PUC \u00a7 3 \u2014 114(c)(1) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d the entity must first have acquired the status of \u201cparty\u201d by having timely sought, and been granted, the right to intervene. PUC \u00a7 3-106(a). A \u201cparty in interest,\u201d in context and as used in PUC \u00a7 3-114(c)(1), actually is a more restrictive term than \u201cparty.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals held that Friends was not a party in interest because it \u201cwas [not] personally and specifically affected in a way different from the public generally.\u201d Under the circumstances of this case, as we explain <em>infra, </em>that was the wrong standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Friends was never a party to the proceedings. It simply never sought to intervene in a timely manner. That should have concluded the matter. The intermediate appellate court nevertheless determined that the respondent Tribbey, although purporting to act on behalf of Friends as the organization\u2019s representative, also, and at the same time, <em>personally </em>filed for rehearing. The court stated that the request for rehearing was made <em>\u201cin both </em>his individual capacity <em>and </em>in his capacity as a representative of Friends.\u201d Thus, despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>absence of any indication that Tribbey intended that result, that court, refusing to \u201cexalt[ ] form over substance to hypothesize that Mr. Tribbey made the request for a rehearing \u2018solely\u2019 as a representative of the Friends of Backbone Mountain,\u201d attributed the \u201ctimeliness\u201d of Friends\u2019 application\u2014 which the court had determined did not itself satisfy the requirements of PUC \u00a7 3-114 \u2014 to Tribbey, which it also recognized to be filing in his individual capacity. It followed from this interpretation that Tribbey had timely requested rehearing and, because he had, all of the respondents were beneficiaries; they \u201chad 30 days from August 8, 2003 to file their actions for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s March 26, 2003 order.\u201d We do not agree with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The decision of the Court of Special Appeals rested on two points: (1) that Tribbey, acting on behalf of Friends as its representative, was also personally applying for rehearing, and (2) that Tribbey himself was a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d Whether Tribbey\u2019s actions as a representative of Friends also qualify as his personal application for rehearing is a matter that we need not and do not reach. Tribbey simply was not a party in interest under PUC \u00a7 3-114(c). He did not intervene and, consequently, never became a \u201cparty.\u201d Therefore, whether he timely filed for rehearing is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination that Tribbey was a party in interest was premised on his being an \u201cadjoining landowner,\u201d to the property where the turbines will be placed and \u201chis participation in the proceeding.\u201d The latter, it said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">\u201cmade him a \u2018party,\u2019 and ... as an \u2018adjoining landowner\u2019 to the property where the turbines will be placed, the Commission\u2019s order has personally and specifically affected him in a way different from the way that order affects the general public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The intermediate appellate court relied on our cases, see, <em>e.g., Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E., </em>375 Md. 59, 72, 825 A.2d 388, 395 (2003) (quoting <em>Sugarloaf v. Department of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 286, 686 A.2d 605, 613 (1996)), <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>240 Md. 180, 184, 213 A.2d 487, 489 (1965), which it construes as \u201cma[king] it clear that \u2018one may become a party to an administrative proceeding rather easily.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">In <em>Sugarloaf </em>an action before the Maryland Department of the Environment, we addressed the distinction between the standing necessary to be a party to an administrative proceeding and the standing necessary to petition for judicial review of an administrative decision. 344 Md. at 285-86, 686 A.2d at 613 (\u201cThe cases in this Court, and the language of the Administrative Procedure Act itself, \u00a7 10-222(a)(l) of the State Government Article, recognize a distinction between standing to be a party to an administrative proceeding and standing to bring an action in court for judicial review of an administrative decision.\u201d). We held that \u201ca person may properly be a party at an agency hearing under Maryland\u2019s \u2018relatively lenient standards\u2019 for administrative standing but may not have standing in court to challenge an adverse agency decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 11, 633 A.2d 855, 859 (1993); <em>see Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 611-614, 612 A.2d 241, 248-50 (1992)). The <em>Sugarloaf </em>Court relevantly stated that: \u201cThe requirements for administrative standing under Maryland law are not very strict.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Sugarloaf </em>344 Md. at 286, 686 A.2d at 613. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>See Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E., </em>375 Md. 59, 72, 825 A.2d 388, 395 (2003). This is the language that the Court of Special Appeals found compelling. Immediately following that statement, however, we qualified it: <em>\u201cAbsent a statute or a reasonable regulation specifying criteria for administrative standing, </em>one may become a party to an administrative proceeding rather easily.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 286, 686 A.2d at 613 (emphasis added); <em>Dorsey, </em>375 Md. at 72, 825 A.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The limiting language used by this Court in <em>Sugarloaf, </em>\u201cAbsent a statute ... specifying criteria for administrative standing,\u201d 344 Md. at 286, 686 A.2d at 613, is important and may not be disregarded. Indeed, its significance was underscored and confirmed when, in <em>Sugarloaf, </em>we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201c \u2018Bearing in mind that the format for proceedings before administrative agencies is intentionally designed to be informal so as to encourage citizen participation, we think that <em>absent a reasonable agency or other regulation providing for a more formal method of becoming a party, </em>anyone clearly identifying himself to the agency for the record as having an interest in the outcome of the matter being considered by that agency, thereby becomes a party to the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">344 Md. at 286-87, 686 A.2d at 613 (quoting <em>Morris v. Howard Res. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>278 Md. 417, 423, 365 A.2d 34, 37 (1976)) (emphasis added). Finally, in stating its decision, the <em>Sugar-loaf </em>Court explained, \u201c[i]f there were a statutory provision or a regulation setting forth criteria for administrative standing, the Secretary\u2019s request would have been appropriate.\u201d 344 Md. at 288, 686 A.2d at 614. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>PUC \u00a7 3-106 creates just that type of statutorily provided criteria for becoming a party to an administrative action before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Commission. Therefore, the present factual situation is clearly distinguishable from <em>Sugarloaf.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We interpreted PUC \u00a7 3-106 in <em>Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Association v. Public Service Commission, </em>361 Md. 196, 760 A.2d 1087 (2000). There, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201cThe appellant was, as we have seen and the parties to these proceedings also agree, a party before the PSC. <em>Because it moved, and was allowed, to intervene, </em>Maryland Code (1998) \u00a7 3-106 of the Public Utility Companies Article, governing intervention in Commission proceedings, is implicated. Because \u00a7 3-106 defines the meaning of \u2018party,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 3-202(a), it and \u00a7 3-202(a) must be read together. Section 3-106 provides that a person shall be permitted to intervene if the person makes timely application and the Commission concludes that the interests of that person are not being adequately represented and that the issue or issues the person seeks to raise are neither irrelevant nor immaterial. <em>Thus, to become a party to a proceeding before the Commission, a party must have been determined, by the Commission, to have an interest in the proceeding that is not being adequately represented and that interest, in turn, has been determined not to be frivolous or of no consequence to the proceeding.[</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>Once intervention has been granted, the person has all the rights of a party to the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">361 Md. at 205-06, 760 A.2d at 1092 (emphasis added). So, not only does an entity have timely to apply to intervene as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>party, but it is for the Commission to determine whether to grant leave for that entity to intervene. PUC \u00a7 3 \u2014 106(b) states that: \u201cThe Commission shall grant leave to intervene unless the Commission concludes that: (1) the parties to the proceeding adequately represent the interest of the person seeking to intervene; or (2) the issues that the person seeks to raise are irrelevant or immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Therefore, while generally it may be rather easy to become a party to many administrative proceedings regulated by the State Administrative Procedure Act, in the case of actions before the Public Service Commission, one must comply with PUC \u00a7 3-106. That compliance requires, at a minimum, the timely filing of an application to intervene in a proceeding before the Commission in order to become a \u201cparty.\u201d PUC \u00a7 3-106(a). The facts of the instant case show that neither Friends nor Tribbey timely filed an application to intervene. Friends filed to intervene on June 27, 2003, after it had attempted to apply for rehearing and well after it would have been timely to intervene (i.e., prior to the close of proceedings). Failing timely to intervene, Friends was not a party, and, therefore, not a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d when it filed for rehearing on April 24, 2003. Thus, the Commission\u2019s denial of Friends\u2019 application for rehearing was appropriate. Similarly, Tribbey <em>never </em>filed to intervene in his own right and, thus, also never became a party or \u201cparty in interest.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As a result, even if we were to consider Tribbey\u2019s representation of Friends to satisfy somehow his own personal filing for rehearing, he still would not have properly filed, as he never intervened to become a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Because of our determination that neither Friends nor Tribbey was a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> neither of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>was, or could have been, a \u201cparty in interest\u201d to the proceeding so as to be entitled to apply for rehearing under PUC \u00a7 3-114(c). Therefore, there was no proper, timely application for rehearing filed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 concluded that, \u201cas a result of the timely request for rehearing filed by Mr. Tribbey, all of the [respondents] had 30 days from August 8, 2003 to file their actions for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s March 26, 2003 order.\u201d The court recognized that the respondents, other than Tribbey,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> were not parties or parties in interest to the proceeding, stating: \u201cWe therefore hold that (1) Mr. Sprenger was not a \u2018party in interest\u2019 to the Commission proceeding because he was never a \u2018party\u2019 to that proceeding, and (2) none of the four entities that requested a hearing was a \u2018party in interest\u2019 because none was personally and specifically affected in a way different from the public generally.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Furthermore, the intermediate appellate court concluded: \u201cFor these reasons, the actions for judicial review were untimely <em>unless </em>Mr. Tribbey\u2019s request for a rehearing was presented in his individual capacity rather than in his capacity as a representative of an entity that does not qualify as a \u2018party in interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">As discussed above, Tribbey did not timely or properly apply for rehearing because he was not himself a \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cparty in interest.\u201d Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 erred in its determination as to the respondents\u2019 petitions for judicial review. The respondents did not have \u201c30 days from August 8, 2003 to file their actions for judicial review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Commission\u2019s March 26, 2003 order.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, they had 30 days from March 26, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">PUC \u00a7 3-202(a) provides that a \u201cparty or <em>person in interest\u201d </em>may seek judicial review of a decision or order of the Commission. A \u201cperson in interest\u201d is, by its very terminology, different from a party or a \u201cparty in interest\u201d. Thus, the respondents, as adjoining landowners to the property where the wind turbine facility will be constructed could possibly be \u201cpersons in interest\u201d entitled to seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s March 26, 2003, Order No. 78354.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In order to seek that judicial review, however, Maryland Rule 7-203(a) requires that a petition be filed within 30 days after the order is issued; that would have been April 25, 2003 in the case at bar. None of the respondents<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> filed a petition for judicial review within that time period and, hence, their petitions for judicial review, not being timely, were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">For the aforementioned reasons we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. The respondents failed timely to apply to intervene as parties, PUC \u00a7 3-106, before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Commission and, therefore, the pertinent applications for rehearing were not properly submitted by \u201cparties in interest.\u201d PUC \u00a7 3 \u2014 114(c). As a result, there was no timely application for rehearing. PUC \u00a7 3 \u2014 114(c). Consequently, the time for filing a petition for judicial review of Order No. 78354 was not stayed by Friends\u2019 application. The final order was issued on March 26, 2003, and any petition for judicial review had to be filed within 30 days of that date. There was no timely petition for judicial review filed in the instant case. The decisions of the Commission and the trial court were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
