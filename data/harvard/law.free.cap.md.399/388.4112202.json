Encroachment on this institution by the expanding jurisdiction of the English vice-admiralty courts, the trials of which were conducted without juries,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was chief among the complaints registered by American colonists in the Declaration of Independence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>question that the jury trial is a vital and cherished institution of United States<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Maryland law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>With that historical perspective firmly in mind, we confront the issues concerning this right debated by the parties in the present case. The primary controversy touches on the question of whether the empaneling of a non-citizen on a jury in a criminal case abridged Marcus Dannon Owens\u2019s right to a jury trial under either the U.S. or Maryland Constitutions. Alternatively, we consider whether empaneling a non-citizen juror violates \u201cmerely\u201d Maryland statutory law. In either case, we decide whether Owens waived his opportunity to object to service by the non-citizen on his jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The second issue we review is whether Owens was \u201cin custody,\u201d as that term is understood in Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, at the time he was questioned, without <em>Miranda </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> warnings, by the police at the hospital where his stepson was taken following a medical emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Marcus Dannon Owens was tried in the Circuit Court for Howard County before a presiding judge and a jury of twelve individuals, on charges of murder and child abuse resulting in death. The jury convicted Owens of second degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. The victim of both crimes was Owens\u2019s stepson, Kevonte Davis. The trial judge sentenced Owens to two consecutively-running 30 year terms in prison. The facts giving rise to these convictions are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Owens married Kenesha Davis in late July 2003, and lived with her in their Columbia, Maryland, townhouse. Also living with the couple were Davis\u2019s two children from a prior rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tionship: Daequan Davis, age four; and Kevonte Davis, age 2; as well as the couple\u2019s seven month-old infant, Kemari Owens. In July 2003, Owens was unemployed, but Davis worked at a warehouse for the distributing firm, Genco, in Columbia where she typically worked from 7:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. The couple shared a single car so, each morning, Owens would drive the children to daycare, drop his wife off at Genco, and then return home. At the end of the work day, Owens would pick up the children and his wife and return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Owens deviated from that routine on the morning of 30 July 2003 when he took Davis to work directly, without dropping the children at daycare. Davis testified that Kevonte appeared normal when she exited the car. Kevonte, however, did not appear so when Owens picked Davis up from work approximately 10 hours later. Davis noticed that Kevonte had his eyes closed, was foaming at the mouth, had cold hands, and was \u201cmoaning like he was in pain.\u201d She and Owens took Kevonte to Howard County General Hospital (\u201cthe Hospital\u201d), where the child died after approximately thirty minutes of failed attempts to revive him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">A number of witnesses from the Hospital medical staff testified at Owens\u2019s trial to the extent and possible causes of the injuries leading to Kevonte\u2019s death. The consensus of the testimony was that Kevonte sustained severe trauma on the level of a serious car accident or a fall off a budding of several stories.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Several of the staff members also noted that Owens\u2019s explanation of Kevonte\u2019s activities during the critical 10 hours on July 23 was not consistent with the extent of his injuries. At about 6:30 p.m., Howard County Police Detectives Eric Kruhm and Vicki Shaffer encountered and interviewed Owens for 10 to 15 minutes in the playroom of the Hospital\u2019s pediatric ward, where he was tending Daequan. That conversation, to which Owens was apparently a free participant, yielded some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>additional background on the day\u2019s events. Owens indicated that the two older boys had spent the day playing and watching TV together and seemed relatively normal at lunch time. Around the time the children and Owens picked up Davis, however, Kevonte was \u201cfussy\u201d and difficult to keep awake. When asked how Kevonte received such heavy bruising, Owens attributed it to fighting with his four year-old brother, Dacquan. The detectives noted that Owens seemed nervous during their conversation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The interview ended when Owens left the room. At that point, the detectives considered Owens a suspect in Kevonte\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Several hours later, around 9:48 p.m., the detectives conducted a second interview. The detectives approached Owens, who was in the Hospital parking lot, and asked him to come back inside for another interview. Owens complied with the request and also did not object to the audiotaping of the interview. The two plain-clothes detectives and their suspect, Owens, convened in an empty room in the pediatric ward, several doors down from the playroom where the first interview took place. The detectives took possession of Owens\u2019s car keys, but the record is not clear as to whether this occurred before or after the second interview.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During the interview, the detectives asked pointed questions about the circumstances surrounding the death of Kevonte. The interview lasted somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes and was terminated at Owens\u2019s initiative. The following exchange took place at the end of the interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">[Owens]: Is there anything else before I go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">[Detective Kruhm]: You can leave at any time; we\u2019re not holding you in here anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>[Owens]: All right See you tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The police arrested Owens two days later on 1 August 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"ALx\">A. Non-Citizen Juror Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The jury in Owens\u2019s trial returned its verdict against him on 10 June 2004. Later that same evening, Steven Merson, the Howard County Jury Commissioner, received a voicemail message from Juror No. 10, Adeyemi Alade. Alade indicated that he was concerned about the propriety of his jury service because he was not a U.S. citizen. On 18 June 2004, the Circuit Court held a hearing regarding this revelation. At the hearing, Merson explained that Alade expressed concern for the status of the case because he had just learned that jury service was restricted to U.S. citizens. Merson testified that Alade indicated that he was qualified to serve as a juror on his pre-trial juror questionnaire. According to Merson, his office does not review for accuracy the responses provided by juror candidates unless some information is missing. Merson also confirmed that the videotape shown to potential jurors upon their arrival for service does not include information relating to qualification for service.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Alade testified that his \u201ccountry of origin\u201d was Nigeria and that he was not a U.S. citizen. Rather, he stated that he had been in the U.S. for two years as a \u201cpermanent resident,\u201d was attending university, and had obtained a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license, listing his Howard County residence address. Alade acknowledged that he checked the box on the juror questionnaire indicating that he was qualified to serve as a juror as an oversight and did not do so deliberately. Apparently, no one inquired into his citizenship status when he reported for possible jury duty and he was never asked about the subject at any point in the trial. For Alade\u2019s part, the court found no intent to misrepresent his status to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Owens filed a Motion for a New Trial on the same day as the hearing. The rationale for the motion was that Owens was deprived of a lawful jury because Alade, as a non-U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>citizen, was not qualified to serve as a juror. The State argued that the citizenship requirement for jurors is confined to the realm of statutory rights, a right which Owens waived by not challenging Alade\u2019s service in a timely fashion. The Circuit Court, on 21 July 2004, denied Owens\u2019s motion. The court reasoned that neither the U.S. nor Maryland Constitutions mandate a jury composed of U.S. citizens only. As to Owens\u2019s contention that Alade\u2019s non-citizenship status could not reasonably have been discovered because <em>voir dire </em>questions relating to statutory disqualifications are not mandatory, the court pointed out that neither party sought a <em>voir dire </em>question on the subject of citizenship. Had it been proposed, the court ventured that the citizenship question would have been propounded to the jurors and Alade would have been disqualified as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">B. Suppression Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Prior to trial, Owens sought to suppress any statements he made to Detectives Kruhm and Shaffer during their two interviews. Owens argued that the conversations between him and the detectives occurred while he was in custody and must be suppressed because the detectives never advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The Circuit Court denied the motion to suppress the statements made during the interviews based on a totality of the circumstances analysis. The court examined numerous factors in concluding that the interrogation of Owens was not custodial, including: the neutral locations and short length of the interviews, the small number of officers present and their relaxed posture, whether Owens was a suspect and treated as such, Owens\u2019s willingness to commence the interviews, the lack of use of physical restraint, the absence of force or coercion, and that Owens was not placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">C. Review by the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Owens noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. As to both issues discussed previously, it relied on much the same grounds as expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>by the trial court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court concluded that Owens\u2019s right to a citizen jury was purely statutory, not constitutional, in nature. <em>Owens v. State, </em>170 Md.App. 35, 71, 906 A.2d 989, 1009 (2006). Because the <em>voir dire </em>process is the means by which defendants are accorded the opportunity to identify and challenge unqualified jurors, a failure to pose proper questions and object during that time is equated to a waiver of that opportunity. <em>Owens, </em>170 Md.App. at 71-73, 906 A.2d at 1009-10. The Court of Special Appeals reinforced its conclusion by examining <em>Kohl v. Lehlback, </em>160 U.S. 293, 16 S.Ct. 304, 40 L.Ed. 432 (1895), a case where, in spite of a due process argument, the Supreme Court refused to grant a post-conviction objection to a non-citizen juror. <em>Owens, </em>170 Md.App. at 73, 906 A.2d at 1010. The appellate panel analogized <em>Kohl </em>to several Maryland cases involving jurors whose statutory disqualifications were discovered only after a verdict was rendered and motions for new trials were denied because it was held that the right to object to unqualified jurors had been waived. <em>Owens, </em>170 Md.App. at 73-77, 906 A.2d at 1010-12. As for the custodial interrogation issue, the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that the encounters between the detectives and Owens were not very long and that a reasonable person in Owens\u2019s position would have felt free to leave the situations. <em>Owens, </em>170 Md.App. at 99, 906 A.2d at 1025. We granted Owens\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. 396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A1q\">A. Non-Citizen Juror Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In another case concerning the right to a jury trial, albeit in the realm of civil law, we said that \u201c[b]ecause our interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Constitution, provisions of the Maryland Code, and the Maryland Rules are appropriately classified as questions of law, we review the issues <em>de novo </em>to determine if the trial court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>legally correct in its rulings on these matters.\u201d <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 80-81 (2004); <em>see also Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175, 184 (2006) (\u201cwhere an order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, our Court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review\u201d). Thus, because we are presented with legal questions on the constitutional and statutory soundness of a jury containing a non-citizen, we consider them <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">B. Suppression Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, <em>443-44 (2003) </em>(citations omitted), we stated the applicable standard of review regarding motions to suppress and determinations of custody for purposes of evaluating arguments asserting <em>Miranda </em>right violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">Our review ... is ordinarily \u201climited to the evidence presented at the suppression hearing.\u201d In conducting our analysis, we view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion .... We pay deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, upholding them unless \u201cthey are clearly erroneous.\u201d \u201c[We] must make an independent constitutional evaluation,\u201d however, \u201cby reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the unique facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">In determining whether there was custody for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>we accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. \u201cWe must, however, make an independent constitutional appraisal of the record to determine the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s decision concerning custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AIb\">A. Non-Citizen Juror Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Owens advances two interrelated arguments in support of his position that the Maryland Constitution recognizes a right to a trial by a jury composed only of United States citizens. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>He argues that the substantive due process component of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights, guaranteeing that no person is to be \u201cdeprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his <em>peers,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when informed by English common law made applicable through Article 5, means a \u201cjury of <em>citizens.\u201d </em>Assertedly, English common law at the time of the Revolution required jurors to be citizens. This general rule, Owens contends, is proven by its exception: jury <em>de medietate linguae,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the mechanism by which non-English citizens were tried, which permitted the jury to be composed of one-half citizens and one-half non-citizens.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries *362 (1768). Thus, by the complimentary operation of Articles 5 and 24, Owens posits that the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution secures for defendants like himself the right to a trial by a jury of U.S. citizens. As a right of constitutional pedigree, it may be waived only upon a knowing and voluntary <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em><footnotemark>15</footnotemark>-type waiver by the defendant himself, a much harder waiver for the State to prove than must be shown for waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of a statutory right. Even if the right to a citizen jury is of a statutory, rather than constitutional dimension, Owens maintains that he did not waive that right because our decision in <em>Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 439-40, 671 A.2d 33, 37 (1996), would have made his request for a <em>voir dire </em>question regarding citizenship potentially a futile effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The State responds by directing us to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kohl </em>and <em>Carter v. Jury Commission, </em>396 U.S. 320, 90 S.Ct. 518, 24 L.Ed.2d 549 (1970), implying that the U.S. Constitution does not mandate citizen juries. Additionally, the State argues that the Maryland Constitution is amenable to a similar interpretation, despite the common law practice of trials by jury <em>de medietate linguae. </em>Instead, Owens\u2019s right to a jury composed of U.S. citizens exists solely as a matter of statutory law, which right he waived by failing to request a <em>voir dire </em>question inquiring into the citizenship status of the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to a trial by an impartial jury in criminal matters.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This right has been incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and is thereby applicable to Maryland and the several states. <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968); <em>accord Miller v. Warden, </em>16 Md.App. 614, 623-24, 299 A.2d 862, 868 (1973). The Maryland Constitution also provides for the right to a jury trial in several articles of its Declaration of Rights. Two of the provisions deal specifically with the right to a jury trial in criminal cases: Articles 21<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and 23,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but they are not espe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>daily applicable in the present case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, we look to the provisions of Articles 5(a)(1) and 24, on which Owens bases his arguments, for guidance on the question of the right to a jury trial in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Article 5(a)(1) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">That the Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England, and the trial by Jury, according to the course of that Law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed on the Fourth day of July, seventeen hundred and seventy-six; and which, by experience, have been found applicable to their local and other circumstances, and have been introduced, used and practiced by the Courts of Law or Equity; and also of all Acts of Assembly in force on the first day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven; except such as may have since expired, or may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution; subject, nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legislature of this State ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">This provision has deep roots. Some iteration of its provisions has been an organ of the fundamental law of Maryland since 1776,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> when the State declared its independence and formed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>its Constitution. The origin of Article 5(a)(1) harkens to the popular sentiment among colonists that they should restore and guarantee the common law privileges, their birthright as Englishmen, of which England had wrongfully deprived them, including the right to trial by jury. <em>See supra </em>notes 4 and 5 and accompanying text; <em>see also </em>Charter of Maryland art. X (1634) (guaranteeing the colonists of Maryland \u201call Privileges, Franchises and Liberties of this our Kingdom of England, freely, quietly, and peaceably to have and possess, and the same may use and enjoy in the same manner as our Liege-Men born, or to be born within our said Kingdom of England ____\u201d)\u2022 We turn now to the task of identifying the common law principles of English criminal jury trials in 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>1. The English Common Law of Jury Trials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1z\">To better understand the status of criminal jury trials at the time of the Revolution, we examine briefly the evolution of that institution in common law England. The earliest record of a primordial form of the criminal jury trial in English common law history may be attributed to the Saxon king, Ethelred the Unready (978-1013, 1014-16). Under Ethelred\u2019s law, 12 elders of a local community would be accompanied by a sheriff to swear on a religious relic and swear not to accuse an innocent man of a crime. Maximus A. Lesser, The Historical Development of the Jury System 134 (1894); William Forsyth, History of Trial by Jury 57 (2d ed. 1875). This form of accusation and conviction was replaced by the \u201cfrank-pledge\u201d system, instituted by the Normans following their Conquest in 1066, which held every member of a community responsible for the conduct of his neighbors. Lesser, <em>supra </em>at 135-36 (citing Forsyth, <em>supra </em>at 161). This system compelled neighbors to bring to justice the criminal element in their communities. <em>Id. </em>This led to another mode of trial by accusers making oaths, called voraths, against a defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Proffatt, A Treatise on Trial by Jury 25-26 (1877). A defendant would typically undergo an ordeal<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or, under Norman rule, trial by combat.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Lesser, <em>supra </em>at 136 (citing Forsyth, <em>supra </em>at 194). Dissatisfaction with this rumor-driven, perilous process lead to reforms in the following centuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The criminal jury trial began to assume a form more recognizable to us under the reign of King Henry II. Among Henry II\u2019s innovations was his Assize of Clarendon, decreed in 1166, which brought under the jurisdiction of the royal courts serious crimes and felonies identified by an inquest, or a type of grand jury, of 16 men gathered from the vicinage.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Leon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ard W. Levy, The Palladium of Justice: Origins of Trial by Jury 11 (1999). These jurors were charged with the responsibility of speaking for the neighborhood as to their suspicions and accusations of criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>Once identified by this sworn jury, the defendant was faced with one of several possible ordeals. <em>Id. </em>This method of reaching a verdict was beginning to replace the older Saxon and Norman procedures of taking oaths of innocence and trial by battle. 2 Frederick Pollock &amp; Frederic William Maitland, The History of English Law 598-603 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Steadily, advancements in the realm of civil trials under Henry II lead to the petit jury verdict\u2019s replacement of the ordeal as the final arbiter of criminal guilt or innocence. Contemporaneous with the Assize of Clarendon was the establishment of the assizes of <em>novel disseisin </em>(recent dispossession), <em>mort d\u2019aneestor </em>(death of an ancestor), and <em>darrein presentment </em>(last presentment), which provided for final jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>verdicts bearing on various issues of land possession. Levy, <em>supra </em>at 13-14. The jurors in these cases were drawn from the vicinity and resolved the disputes before them based upon their knowledge of the facts at issue. <em>Id. </em>In 1179, Henry II promulgated the Grand Assize, a form of appeal from civil jury verdicts as to rightful possession of land, which called for yet another jury. <em>Id. </em>at 14. This jury was selected by the sheriff, who nominated 4 knights to complete the jury with 12 other knights hailing from the same neighborhood as situs of the land in question. <em>Id. </em>Again, these jurors relied on their knowledge of the facts to reach a decision. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">With the advent of the Magna Carta in 1215, the nobles of England secured for themselves,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in Article 39 of the Great Charter,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the right to a jury verdict in lieu of the more perilous methods of determining guilt or innocence. Lesser, <em>supra </em>at 142-43. Until that time, a petit jury verdict was only available for a price as a dispensation from the Crown.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Two legal authorities of good repute from the period, Henry de Bracton and the <em>Fleta, </em>indicated that criminal jury trials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>had become typical by the end of the 13th century.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 143; <em>see supra </em>note 25. This may have been attributable in large measure to the abolition of the trial by ordeal around 1215, <em>see supra </em>note 22, which left judges with few desirable alternatives for trying the guilt of defendants. Lesser, <em>supra </em>at 145. Beginning in the 1300s, the petit and grand juries finally emerged as bodies of distinct jurors. In 1352, King Edward III agreed to a statute empowering defendants to challenge petit jurors because of their service on the grand jury that indicted the defendant. Levy, <em>supra </em>at 22. Another development in the ancient jury trial, making it resemble closer our modern institution, was the move away during the reign of King Henry III from the jurors as witnesses, which became normal practice by the mid-15th century.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The qualifications for jury service remained principally unchanged over the many centuries of the common law\u2019s development. A juror was required to be a land-owning (freeholder, or freeman)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> male<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> possessing land and chattel of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>specified value who dwelled in the general area from which the disputed question arose.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> 3 Blackstone, <em>swpra </em>at *362; Giles Duncombe, Trials Per Pais, or The Law of England Concerning Juries by Nisi Prius, &amp; C. 7, 85-88, 103, 123 (6th ed. 1718). Jurors also had to be lawful, that is, not outlawed for some illegal act previously done. Duncombe, <em>supra </em>at 85; 3 Blackstone, <em>supra </em>at *363-64. Jurors could also be challenged for possible partiality, insufficient age, and occupation as a clergymen or member of Parliament. 3 Blackstone, <em>supra </em>at *361, 363, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In summary, the practice of the criminal jury trial in English common law at the time of the Revolution stood as follows. A grand jury was assembled to indict a defendant based upon eye-witness testimony and other evidence. Then, a petit jury of 12 free, land-holding, lawful men worth a certain amount of money from the general area of the situs of the crime determined the correctness of the indictment based on testimony from witnesses and instructions of law from judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">As its language indicates, Article 5(a)(1) of the Declaration of Rights avails Marylanders of the common law of England as it existed at the time Maryland declared its independence.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Id., State v.

Thus, notwithstanding whatever merit may inhere in Owens\u2019s English common law argument, if the Maryland statutory scheme prescribing the qualifications for jury service overbears completely the common law as it existed at the time of the Revolution, Article 5(a)(1) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights offers no support for Owens\u2019s argument for a constitutional right to a jury composed of U.S. citizens. We examine that statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>2. Maryland\u2019s Statutory Juror Qualification Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">The Maryland Rules reiterate that the right to a jury trial is preserved in the Circuit Courts as it is guaranteed by the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights. Maryland Rule 4-311(a). Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 8-102(a) states that when a criminal defendant is entitled to a petit jury, \u201cthe jury shall be selected at random from a fair cross section of the citizens of the State who reside in the county where the court convenes.\u201d Md.Code (1973, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>2002 Repl.Vol.), Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc., \u00a7 8-102(a) (hereinafter \u201cCts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Article also specifies that either a jury commissioner or the clerk of the court should manage the jury selection process with the end goal of establishing procedures that \u201cassure the random selection of a fair cross section of the citizens of the State who reside in the county where the court convenes.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 8-202(2). Among those procedures is the provision of a \u201cjuror qualification form\u201d to be mailed to potential jurors asking them, among other things:<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> their race and national origin, length of residence within the county, and any other questions within the purview of the statutes concerning jury selection. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-202(5)(i). The Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article further provides that \u201c[a] person may not be disqualified or excused from jury service except on the basis of information provided by the juror qualification form\u201d and leaves the determination of qualifications to the jury judge, on his or her initiative, or by recommendation of the jury commissioner or clerk of the court, as the case may be. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 8-207(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Under the Article, \u201c[a] person is qualified to serve as a juror unless he [or she]: (1) Is not constitutionally qualified to vote in the county where the court convenes ....\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Cts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>&amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 8-207(b)(l). The Maryland Constitution, in turn, states that \u201cno person shall vote ... unless his [or her] name appears in the list of registered voters ____\u201d Md. Const, art. I, \u00a7 2. In order to be registered to vote, an individual must be \u201ca citizen of the United States .... \u201d Md.Code (2002), Election Law Article, \u00a7 3-102(a)(l). Thus, the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article requires indirectly, among other qualifications, that jurors be citizens of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">We believe that this broad and detailed statutory scheme for selecting qualified jurors encompasses the same, if not greater, body of law addressed in the English common law extant in 1776. Importantly, the statute discusses clearly the same citizenship requirement that existed implicitly at common law, thus abrogating the older common law rule.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This renders inconsequential Owens\u2019s <em>\u201cde medietate linguae </em>argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Properly understood, Owens\u2019s argument contends that because the <em>de medietate linguae </em>exception was not formally abolished by the Maryland General Assembly until 1809<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> proves that the common law embraced that concept in 1776. Therefore, if the exception were still in place at common law, its existence demonstrates that citizenship was a qualification for jury service in 1776. This is irrelevant because, as Owens points out, the Legislature created an express statutory citizenship qualification for jury service as early as 1973. Md. Code (1957, 1972 Repl.Vol.), Article 51, \u00a7 1. We have noted previously that a statutory enactment may abrogate complete<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ly a common law principle, rendering it of no effect. The 1973 statute creating the citizenship qualification did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\n<em>3. Dm Process Does Not Mandate a Citizen Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Turning to Owens\u2019s second constitutional argument for the right to a citizen jury, we consider whether the substantive due process components of either the U.S. or Maryland Constitutions acknowledges such a right. Decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court make clear that the federal Constitution does not require that jurors be U.S. citizens. <em>Carter, </em>396 U.S. at 332, 90 S.Ct. at 525, 24 L.Ed.2d 549 (1970); <em>Kohl, </em>160 U.S. at 300, 16 S.Ct. at 306, 40 L.Ed. 432 (1895); <em>Jugiro v. Brush, </em>140 U.S. 291, 297-98, 11 S.Ct. 770, 772, 35 L.Ed. 510 (1891); <em>Hollingsworth v. Duane, </em>4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 353, 1 L.Ed. 864 (1801). Owens\u2019s protestations that the Supreme Court precedent is stale, and possibly tainted by some vague prejudice because it emerged from the same era as the infamous <em>Plessy v. </em>Ferguson<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> case, are unavailing. First, the Supreme Court reaffirmed, in its 1970 <em>Carter </em>decision, the essence of its dicta in <em>Kohl. Carter, </em>396 U.S. at 332, 90 S.Ct. at 525, 24 L.Ed.2d 549. Second, courts since <em>Kohl </em>concurred routinely in this analysis. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gordon-Nikkar, </em>518 F.2d 972, 976-77 (5th Cir.1975). <em>United States v. Armsbury, </em>408 F.Supp. 1130, 1135 (D.Or.1976). <em>Perkins v. Smith, </em>370 F.Supp. 134, 138 (D.Md.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>426 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 2616, 49 L.Ed.2d 368 (1976); <em>State v. Mendoza, </em>227 Wis.2d 838, 596 N.W.2d 736, 742 n. 5 (1999); <em>Commonwealth v. Acen, </em>396 Mass. 472, 487 N.E.2d 189, 195 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Maryland law does not provide any firmer footing for Owens\u2019s argument. The Maryland Constitution makes no express guarantee of a trial by a citizen jury and no opinion of this Court construes it as such. The only support Owens can marshal in favor of his Maryland due process claim is a few sentences of dicta from a 1983 Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>opinion linking the phrases \u201cjury of peers\u201d to \u201cjury of citizens.\u201d <em>Lawrence v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 575, 581, 444 A.2d 478, 482 (1982). In <em>Lawrence, </em>the intermediate appellate court correctly parsed the words \u201cjudgment of his peers\u201d from Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights as signifying a jury trial. 51 Md.App. at 581, 444 A.2d at 482 (citing <em>Wright, </em>2 Md. at 452); <em>see supra </em>note 11. The court then referred inexplicably to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>to further illuminate the constitutional significance of the term \u201cpeer.\u201d 51 Md.App. at 581, 444 A.2d at 482. The dictionary indicated that peers are equals, a definition from which the Court of Special Appeals derived the contextually unwarranted and facile conclusion that \u201c \u2018trial by a jury of his peers\u2019 means \u2018trial by a jury of citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The general utility of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>notwithstanding, such a reference is not a controlling or persuasive authority in construing the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights. The intermediate appellate court would have been better advised to halt its inquiry into the phrase \u201cjudgment of his peers\u201d at this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Wright </em>interpreting it as simply a trial by jury. This is the latter-day construction of the peerage principle discussed previously, which limited the privilege of jury trials to the landed gentry of 13th century England. <em>See supra </em>note 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">\n<em>I. Waiver of the Statutory Right to a Citizen Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Because we hold that the right to a jury composed of U.S. citizens is of a statutory, rather than constitutional, dimension, we consider whether Owens waived this right under applicable standards. <em>Cubbage v. State, </em>304 Md. 237, 241, 498 A.2d 632, 634-35 (1985) (\u201cJust as constitutional rights may be waived, so may nonconstitutional rights be waived.\u201d). As opposed to waiver of a constitutional right, which ordinarily must meet more stringent standards,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> a statutory right may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>be deemed waived by a lesser showing. Generally, \u201cmost rights, whether constitutional, statutory or common-law, may be waived by inaction or failure to adhere to legitimate procedural requirements.\u201d <em>State v. Rose, </em>345 Md. 238, 248, 691 A.2d 1314, 1319 (1997). In the case of the statutory right to a citizen jury, there exist three levels of screening to preserve that right. <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 441, 671 A.2d at 38 (\u201cMaryland courts screen juror qualifications on at least three levels: a statutorily-required qualification form, appearance before the jury judge or commissioner at the courthouse, and the trial judge\u2019s observance of each juror during the <em>voir dire.\u201d). </em>In the event that the court\u2019s internally-administered means of automatically disqualifying prospective jurors has failed to eliminate a disqualified juror,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> we have recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the <em>voir dire </em>process as a proper procedural occasion to verify juror qualifications. <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 112, 904 A.2d 534, 542 (2006) (\u201c[V]oir dire is the mechanism by which we give substance to the constitutional guarantee to criminal defendants of a fair and impartial jury trial.\u201d); <em>see Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 331, 825 A.2d 1008, 1035 (2003); <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 9, 759 A.2d 819, 823 (2000) (citing <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 435, 671 A.2d at 35, <em>Grogg v. State, </em>231 Md. 530, 532, 191 A.2d 435, 436 (1963), <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 280, 661 A.2d 1164, 1166 (1995), and <em>Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 670, 566 A.2d 111, 116 (1989)). Thus, a defendant\u2019s failure to pursue the opportunity to question prospective jurors as to citizenship during <em>voir dire </em>constitutes a waiver of the statutory means of protecting the right to a citizen jury. <em>See Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 144, 691 A.2d 1255, 1265-66 (1997) (construing Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 8-211) (holding that if a party fails to pose a challenge to a potential juror after <em>voir dire, </em>that party \u201chas lost the statutory remedy and must labor under constitutional or common law principles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The record in this case reveals that Owens did not propose any questions for the judge to ask of the venire regarding the citizenship status of the potential jurors, including the non-citizen, Alade. Owens argues, however, that his request for such a <em>voir dire </em>question would have been futile because our precedent in <em>Boyd </em>leaves it to the discretion of the trial court whether actually to put the question to the venire. In <em>Boyd, </em>the Court reviewed two consolidated appeals raising the issue of whether it was an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to refuse to ask the venire a <em>voir dire </em>question seeking to discover any potential jurors with physical infirmities that may compromise their ability to serve. 341 Md. at 433, 671 A.2d at 34. The defendants argued that under <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 633 A.2d 867 (1993), and <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>217 Md. 595, 143 A.2d 627 (1958), it was mandatory for the court to pose the question. The <em>Boyd </em>Court distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Casey, </em>which concerned a <em>voir dire </em>question seeking to uncover bias, from the <em>Boyd </em>cases, which concerned <em>voir dire </em>questions directed to the minimum statutory qualifications for jury service. In neither of the consolidated cases in <em>Boyd </em>was the physical impairment question attributable to any specific bias linked to the armed robbery and second-degree murder charges faced by the defendants. 341 Md. at 438, 671 A.2d at 36-37. Further, the question would not have uncovered an automatic cause for disqualification. <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 438, 671 A.2d at 37. Our predecessors in <em>Boyd </em>also distinguished <em>Davis </em>on the ground that it concerned <em>voir dire </em>questions seeking to expose bias on the part of potential jurors rather than their ability to meet minimum statutory qualifications. <em>Id. </em>Also, the bias question in <em>Davis </em>would not have exposed grounds for immediate disqualification. <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 439, 671 A.2d at 37. Although <em>Davis </em>indicated that questions bearing on the satisfaction of the minimum statutory qualifications fell generally into the category of mandatory questions, the key inquiry was whether the given inquiry would be \u201creasonably likely to reveal cause for disqualification.\u201d 333 Md. at 35-36, 633 A.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Based on these distinctions, the <em>Boyd </em>Court opined that the defendants\u2019 requested question regarding physical infirmities was not mandatory because it \u201cwould not be reasonably likely to lead to [discovery of] cause for disqualification of a juror.\u201d 341 Md. at 440, 671 A.2d at 37. First, as in <em>Casey </em>and <em>Davis, </em>a physical disability would not have served as an automatic cause for disqualification. <em>Id. </em>Even if a disability were discovered, accommodations are more likely to precede dismissal. <em>Id. </em>Second, <em>Boyd </em>stated that posing questions already covered by the processes preceding <em>voir dire </em>would be \u201credundant and unnecessary.\u201d 341 Md. at 441, 671 A.2d at 38. Thus, <em>Boyd </em>ostensibly stands for the proposition that <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning the minimum statutory qualifications of a potential juror are only mandatory should they reflect a reasonable likelihood of bias or prejudice against the defendant. It is this rationale that Owens invokes in his argument that he did not waive his right to challenge a non-citizen juror. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Essentially, he complains that because <em>Boyd </em>leaves it entirely to the trial judge\u2019s discretion whether to pose a citizenship question in a case where citizenship is not a likely source of bias, his request of such a question would have been futile. We cannot agree entirely with this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The rule in <em>Boyd </em>that <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning minimum statutory qualifications are not mandatory when sought was animated, in part, by a belief that such questions duplicate needlessly the efforts of the pr <em>e-voir dire </em>screening methods which focus on statutory disqualifications. That cases such as the present one occur demonstrate a correctable weakness in this reasoning. Because the pr <em>e-voir dire </em>screening methods failed to identify and excuse Alade, a non-citizen, it is evident that <em>voir dire </em>questions regarding minimum statutory qualifications are not always \u201credundant and unnecessary.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In fact, our cases ruminate that the pr <em>e-voir dire </em>processes of screening out disqualified jurors are not fail-safe. <em>See supra </em>note 42. We are persuaded, and so hold, that it is in the better interests of justice to require trial judges to pose <em>voir dire </em>questions directed at exposing constitutional and statutory disqualifications when requested by a party. Accordingly, we overrule <em>Boyd </em>to the extent that it conflicts with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Notwithstanding our limited overruling of <em>Boyd, </em>the result in this case is not affected. Simply because it is <em>not mandatory </em>for a judge to pose a particular question does not make it a <em>prohibited </em>question. Had Owens sought, and the trial judge refused, a citizenship question in the present case, the propriety of the denial would have been preserved for appellate review as an abuse of discretion. But because Owens did not suggest the question, he may not complain reasonably that a non-citizen was empanelled on his jury. Indeed, the Circuit Court noted in its opinion denying Owens\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>motion for a new trial that \u201c[h]ad such a question been requested, the court would in all likelihood have made the inquiry (as it did <em>sua sponte </em>regarding the issue of pending jury trials) and Mr. Alade would have been excused as a disqualified juror.\u201d <em>Owens, </em>170 Md.App. at 59, 906 A.2d at 1002. We agree with the intermediate appellate court that there is no reason not to credit the Circuit Court on this point. <em>Owens, </em>170 Md.App. at 77, 906 A.2d at 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">There exist several persuasive authorities supplying examples of waived objections to potential jurors who otherwise would have been disqualified had a defendant proposed and a judge asked a pertinent <em>voir dire </em>question. In <em>Kohl, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to the non-citizen status of a juror as a disqualification, whether done voluntarily, negligently, or unknowingly, was not grounds to upset the murder conviction against the defendant. 160 U.S. at 302, 16 S.Ct. at 307. In <em>Hansel v. Collins, </em>this Court held that a defendant waived his objection to a West Virginia resident serving on the jury that found him liable for trespass when he waited four months after the verdict to raise his objection and could not show that the presence of the out-of-state resident prejudiced him. 180 Md. 100, 103, 23 A.2d 1, 2-3 (1941). The Court stated that the defendant\u2019s ignorance of the juror\u2019s non-resident status was immaterial because he just as easily could have inquired into the matter. 180 Md. at 104, 23 A.2d at 3. In <em>Johns v. Hodges, </em>our predecessors concluded that a trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial to a defendant who, after the case was decided against him, discovered that two jurors empanelled to hear the matter were below the minimum statutory age for jury service. 60 Md. 215, 220 (1883). The <em>Johns </em>Court reasoned that the defendant should not have assumed that the statutory screening devices produced an entire jury of qualified persons, but rather, he should have undertaken to protect his interests through his own inquiry. 60 Md. at 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Maryland appellate cases also demonstrate that even when a <em>voir dire </em>question is posed to the venire, false or withheld responses do not necessarily entitle the defendant to a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>trial. <em>See, e.g., Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 144-46, 691 A.2d at 1265-66 (citing <em>United States v. Boney, </em>977 F.2d 624, 633 (D.C.Cir.1992)); <em>Leach v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 611, 618-19, 425 A.2d 234, 238-39 (1981) (refusing to strike a juror, who upon cross-examination at trial, was discovered to be an old neighbor and acquaintance of a State\u2019s witness when the trial judge was satisfied that the juror had no bias); <em>Burkett v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 438, 445, 319 A.2d 845, 849 (1974) (refusing to grant new trial on the ground that an unbiased juror inadvertently failed to reveal that he was the father of a secretary in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, despite <em>voir dire </em>question asking jurors to reveal their relation to any prosecutor\u2019s office personnel).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Most instructive is <em>Hunt v. State, </em>where a prospective juror, Diana Void, was arrested on a misdemeanor theft charge several days after returning her juror qualification form, on which she stated (then-truthfully) that she had not been charged or convicted of a serious crime. 345 Md. at 140-41, 691 A.2d at 1263-64. When summonsed for jury service, Void failed to respond affirmatively to questions regarding pending criminal charges during her orientation and, again, during <em>voir dire. Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 141, 691 A.2d at 1264. Subsequent to his conviction, during a second petition for post-conviction relief, the defendant, Hunt, challenged Void\u2019s presence on the jury that convicted him on the ground that she was disqualified statutorily. The Court disagreed with Hunt\u2019s argument, concluding that because Void had been empanelled, Hunt lost the opportunity to exercise the statutory remedy of challenging jurors. <em>Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 145-46, 691 A.2d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Owens argues that his situation is different than the scenario presented in <em>Hunt </em>because his objection to an unqualified juror came much closer in time after the verdict. <em>Hunt </em>and our other appellate decisions belie any validity in this point of distinction. Although the objection raised in <em>Hunt </em>came during the defendant\u2019s second petition for post-conviction relief, the Court did not rely on length of delay in denying the objection. Rather, the Court specifically noted that the statutory right to challenge a juror expires at least as early as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>when a juror is empanelled.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 145-46, 691 A.2d at 1266. This principle also is illustrated in <em>Leach, </em>where the Court of Special Appeals upheld a trial court\u2019s decision not to strike a juror who was discovered during cross-examination at trial to have been an acquaintance of a State\u2019s witness. 47 Md.App. at 618-19, 425 A.2d at 238-39. Even in 19th century-practice, the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[t]he usual method is by challenge before the juror is sworn or the trial begins.\u201d <em>Johns, </em>60 Md. at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Hunt </em>indicates that the reason for this narrow allowance of time for statutory challenges to juror qualifications advances the \u201cgoal of finality in judicial decision-making.\u201d 345 Md. at 144, 691 A.2d at 1266. Owens mistakenly argues that because he raised his objection to the non-citizen juror within the ten-day post-trial motion period, the concerns of finality and judicial economy are not impacted. A verdict was reached by, what appeared to the trial judge to be, <em>impartial </em>jurors.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> After Alade\u2019s non-citizen status was revealed, the trial judge held a hearing on the matter and satisfied himself that there was \u201cno showing that Mr. Alade\u2019s non-citizen status in any way or manner prejudiced the Defendant\u2019s case, his consideration of the evidence, or the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Related to the goal of judicial economy is the object of integrity of the process. Our cases highlight the necessity for foreclosing statutory challenges to jurors after <em>voir dire </em>in the interests of preventing an abuse of those challenges. In <em>Hansel, </em>our predecessors noted the wisdom of the earlier <em>Johns </em>decision, admonishing courts not to allow new trials based on challenges to juror qualifications after a verdict has been rendered, lest parties be allowed a second bite at the apple whenever the litigation does not end in their favor. 180 Md. at 104, 23 A.2d at 3 (citing <em>Johns, </em>60 Md. at 220); <em>see also Johns, </em>60 Md. at 223. This Court also noted the potential for collusion between defendants and venal jurors to invalidate guilty verdicts by subsequently revealing or conjuring some disqualifying trait in order to obtain a new trial. <em>Young v. Lynch, </em>194 Md. 68, 73-74, 69 A.2d 787, 789 (1949) (citing <em>Hollars v. State, </em>125 Md. 367, 376-77, 93 A. 970, 974 (1915)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Because Owens waited until after <em>voir dire </em>(indeed, after a verdict was reached) to challenge Alade\u2019s presence on the jury, he waived his statutory right to challenge an unqualified juror.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Simply because <em>Boyd </em>did not require the citizenship question to be a mandatory one for the trial judge to pose to the venire does not excuse Owens of exercising due diligence in requesting the question. Had he done so, Owens\u2019s request most likely would have been granted and Alade would have been excused. Even if the trial judge had refused to pose the question, the issue would have been preserved for appellate review. In either instance, the result is far better than the waiver we find due to Owens\u2019s lack of foresight in at least proposing the question. Accordingly, we find no abridgement of Owens\u2019s right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>B. Suppression Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Owens invokes the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as applicable to the states by incorporation under the Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), for the proposition that his questioning by the Howard County police detectives at the Hospital was illegal because it was custodial in nature and not preceded by the proper warnings prescribed by <em>Miranda. </em>Perhaps nothing is more recognized in the realm of constitutional criminal procedure than the notion that once a suspect is in \u201ccustody,\u201d agents of law enforcement must advise the suspect of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before engaging in \u201cinterrogation,\u201d should the state wish to admit the resulting statements against the suspect at trial. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612; <em>accord Fenner v. State, </em>381 Md. 1, 9, 846 A.2d 1020, 1024-25. It is clear that the strictures of <em>Miranda </em>apply only in a custodial setting. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 441, 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1610-11, 1612; <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 1528, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (per curiam); <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985); <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 714, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977); <em>accord Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 333, 893 A.2d 1018, 1043 (2006); <em>Fenner, </em>381 Md. at 9, 846 A.2d at 1025 (2004). Thus, if Owens was not \u201cin custody\u201d at the time he was questioned by the detectives, the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is immaterial and the Fifth Amendment presents no impediment to the admission of his inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">A significant body of law has developed around the questions of what constitutes \u201ccustody\u201d and \u201cinterrogation\u201d for Fifth Amendment purposes. The <em>Miranda </em>Court defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. \u201cCustody,\u201d though typically associated with formal arrest or incarceration, <em>Allen v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 194, 229, 857 A.2d 101, 122 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>387 Md. 389, 875 A.2d 724 (2005), is not always so clearly delineated a concept. The Supreme Court declared in <em>California v. Beheler </em>that \u201cthe ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 <em>of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 3520, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. at 714) (emphasis added). In fact, a person is considered \u201cin custody\u201d when \u201ca reason able person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 465, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995); <em>see also Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 662, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 2149, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004); <em>accord Rucker, </em>374 Md. at 209, 821 A.2d at 445; <em>Whitfield v. State, </em>287 Md. 124, 141, 411 A.2d 415, 425 (1980). \u201cInterrogation\u201d is no longer considered solely as direct questioning by the police, a concept that prevailed when <em>Miranda </em>was newly-minted. That concept now \u201crefers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (footnotes omitted); <em>accord Drury v. State, </em>368 Md. 331, 335-36, 793 A.2d 567, 570 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The question of whether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d is determined objectively, to the exclusion of the subjective intent of law enforcement, in light of the totality of circumstances of the situation. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. at 667, 124 S.Ct. at 2151; <em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 323, 322, 114 S.Ct. at 1529; <em>accord Whitfield, </em>287 Md. at 140, 411 A.2d at 425. Among the circumstances which should be considered in determining whether a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d took place are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>when and where it occurred, how long it lasted, how many police were present, what the officers and the defendant said and did, the presence of actual physical restraint on the defendant or things equivalent to actual restraint such as drawn weapons or a guard stationed at the door, and whether the defendant was being questioned as a suspect or as a witness. Facts pertaining to events before the interrogation are also relevant, especially how the defendant got to the place of questioning whether he came completely on his own, in response to a police request or escorted by police officers. Finally, what happened after the interrogation whether the defendant left freely, was detained or arrested may assist the court in determining whether the defendant, as a reasonable person, would have felt free to break off the questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Whitfield, </em>287 Md. at 141, 411 A.2d at 425 (quoting <em>Hunter v. State, </em>590 P.2d 888, 895 (Alaska 1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The record here establishes that the first interrogation of Owens by the detectives took place in the pediatric ward\u2019s playroom where Detectives Kruhm and Shaffer encountered Owens. The playroom was a public space, apparently enclosed mostly in glass, and Owens was not detained in the room in any way. The two non-uniformed detectives were wearing side-arms, but did not draw or display threateningly their weapons. The questioning was brief, lasting only 10 to 15 minutes, and involved subjects relating to their investigation, but did not tend to imply that Owens was responsible for Kevonte\u2019s death. The encounter ended when Owens left the room. Under these circumstances, it is beyond cavil that the first interrogation was not custodial in nature. No force or compulsion kept Owens in the playroom: there were only two officers; and, there is no evidence that either of them advised Owens not to leave or positioned themselves to prevent or discourage such an attempt. In fact, the interview was terminated after less than a quarter of an hour because Owens left. Clearly, Owens was not placed under formal arrest, restrained in his freedom of movement, or made to feel that he was not at liberty to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Though the second interrogation bears more characteristics of a custodial interrogation, those qualities are sufficiently outweighed by those indicative of a non-custodial encounter. The detectives initiated the second contact by seeking out Owens, who was now a suspect, in the Hospital parking lot and requested his car keys (whether to effect a search or restrain his movement was likely not clear to Owens). This request to talk was, however, from all indications, not a compulsory order and Owens agreed to accompany the detectives back inside. Owens also agreed to the audio-taping of the interview. Owens argues that the unoccupied patient room, with the door closed, was so unfamiliar and the questioning so accusatory that he must have been \u201cin custody.\u201d This argument is significantly compromised by the fact that the hospital room was still a public place<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> from which he was more than capable of extricating himself in the face of hard questioning, a feat he accomplished after approximately 30 minutes when he evidently felt that the detectives were being too confrontational. Owens was not arrested that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Owens\u2019s reliance on <em>Bond v. </em>State, 142 Md.App. 219, 788 A.2d 705 (2002), is inapposite. <em>Bond </em>involved a situation where three police officers confronted a half-undressed suspect in his bedroom around midnight and, while blocking the only exit, accused him of being involved in a hit-and-run accident. 142 Md.App. at 223-24, 788 A.2d at 707-08. The Court of Special Appeals held that the unexpected nature of the sudden bedroom confrontation at such a late hour would have curtailed a reasonable person\u2019s ability to ask the officers to leave. <em>Bond, </em>142 Md.App. at 233-34, 788 A.2d at 713. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>There was no unexpected late-night home invasion in the present case. Rather, the two detectives approached Owens in the Hospital parking lot and acquired his con sent for more questioning. We are persuaded that Owens must not have felt unable to end the encounter because, unlike in <em>Bond, </em>he did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">.

American jurisprudence on the right to jury trials is epic, beginning with the landmark case of <em>Strauder v. West Virginia, </em>100 U.S. (10 Otto) 303, 309, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1880), enforcing a black defendant's right to a jury not selected by discriminatory means intended to eliminate black jurors.

In view of this history, the Supreme Court has opined that \"the inestimable privilege of trial by jury ... is a vital principle, underlying the whole administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 309, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 1776, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987) (quoting <em>Ex parte Milligan, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2, 123, 18 L.Ed. 281 (1866)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">.

Maryland Code (1973, Repl.Vol.2002) \u00a7 8-207(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) provides that, in order to serve on a jury, one must be, <em>inter alia, </em>an adult citizen of this State. As pertinent, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201c(b) Grounds for disqualifications. \u2014 A person is qualified to serve as a juror unless he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201c(1) Is not constitutionally qualified to vote in the county where the court convenes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201c(8) Is under 18 years of age[.]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7P\">Section 8-207 also provides for limited instances of disqualification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> specifically, where there is a language problem, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>inability to speak, understand and/or write the English language, a documented disability which prevents satisfactory jury service and there is a disqualifying or pending disqualifying conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Owens did not learn that one of the jurors who sat on his case, Mr. Alade, was a non-citizen until after he had been convicted. Indeed, if Mr. Alade had not informed the jury commissioner to the contrary,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his citizenship status never would have become an issue; it undoubtedly would have remained undiscovered and, thus, unknown. That is not at all surprising, or should be: the majority points out that \u201c[the jury commissioner\u2019s office] does not review for accuracy the responses provided by juror candidates unless some information is missing,\u201d 399 Md. 388, 400-01, 924 A.2d 1072, 1079 (2007), and, presumably because he had filled out the juror qualification form adequately, that office clearly did not verify Mr. Alade\u2019s citizenship in this case. As it was required to do, pursuant to Maryland Code (2001) \u00a7 6-105 of the Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Procedure Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Circuit Court held a hearing to determine whether the non-disclosure, and/or the juror\u2019s status, influenced the outcome of the trial, thus, entitling Owens to a new trial. The court found that neither denied Owens a fair trial. It, therefore, rejected Owens\u2019 constitutional and statutory arguments. The court viewed Mr. Alade\u2019s non-disclosure and consequent service on the jury to be purely a statutory matter, cognizable on <em>voir dire. </em>Because Owens did not pose a question, during <em>voir dire, </em>inquiring into the citizenship status of the venire, to include Mr. Alade, the court concluded that he had waived his objection to Mr. Alade\u2019s service on the jury, notwithstanding his non-citizenship and the fact that, had that fact been known, he would have been required to have been struck for cause. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. Like the trial court, it believed that <em>voir dire, </em>rather than post-judgment, was the proper time for Owens to have challenged unqualified jurors, and that his failure to inquire of the panel as to the citizenship of its members at that time is equivalent to a waiver of the challenge. <em>Owens v. State, </em>170 Md.App. 85, 71-73, 906 A.2d 989, 1009-10 (2006). The majority concurs in that rationale. 399 Md. at 419-20, 924 A.2d at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">How the majority reaches the result it does is quite interesting and also most instructive. It acknowledges the three levels of screening that this Court has recognized potential jurors are subjected to ensure that they are minimally qualified to serve and, further, that each level of screening is performed by a different actor. 399 Md. at 418-20, 924 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>at 1089-90, <em>citing </em>and <em>quoting Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 441, 671 A.2d 33, 38 (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Viewing those efforts as not much more than preliminary, certainly not conclusive, with respect to juror qualifications, the majority perceives the <em>voir dire </em>procedure, which it characterizes as \u201ca proper procedural screening occasion to verify juror qualifications,\u201d as the fall back position, \u201c[i]n the event that the court\u2019s internally-administered means of automatically disqualifying prospective jurors has failed to eliminate a disqualified juror.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 924 A.2d at 1090. For that proposition, it relies on <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 112, 904 A.2d 534, 542 (2006); <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 331, 825 A.2d 1008, 1035 (2003) and <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 9, 759 A.2d 819, 823 (2000), in turn <em>citing Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 435, 671 A.2d at 35, <em>Grogg v. State, </em>231 Md. 530, 532, 191 A.2d 435, 436 (1963), <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 280, 661 A.2d 1164, 1166 (1995), and <em>Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 670, 566 A.2d 111, 116 (1989). It is from this premise that the majority asserts \u201ca defendant\u2019s failure to pursue the opportunity to question prospective jurors as to citizenship during <em>voir dire </em>constitutes a waiver of the statutory means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>protecting the right to a citizen jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 924 A.2d at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The implications of the pre-screening process \u2014 that it is monitored by the jury commissioner\u2019s office, an arm of the court, that a question on the juror qualification questionnaire specifically asked the citizenship question and that it was in this case answered albeit, and perhaps inadvertently, incorrectly \u2014 and the fact that <em>voir dire </em>inquiries into juror qualifications are not mandatory questions, <em>see Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 446-47, 671 A.2d at 40-41, are not lost on the majority. Its response to the former is facile and predictable: \u201c \u2018[w]hile [Owens] may have assumed that the venire panel had been pre-screened based on the jury questionnaire, it is easy to anticipate that mistakes do occur, which is why a questionnaire alone is not the sole tool used to select a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 924 A.2d at 1090, <em>quoting Owens v. State, </em>170 Md.App. at 73, 906 A.2d at 1010. It buttresses its logic by citing a ease, decided 113 years before <em>Boyd </em>and whose rationale is inconsistent with Boyd\u2019s holding and rationale. <em>Johns v. Hodges, </em>60 Md. 215, 221-22 (1883)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">As to the latter, the majority confesses partial error, and, thus, overrules that portion of <em>Boyd </em>that made <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning minimum statutory qualifications for jurors discretionary, rather than mandatory. It pronounces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>itself satisfied \u201cthat it is in the better interests of justice to require trial judges to pose <em>voir dire </em>questions directed at exposing constitutional and statutory disqualifications when requested by a party.\u201d 399 Md. at 422, 924 A.2d at 1092. Its explanation for why that is necessary is classic bootstrapping:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201cThe rule in <em>Boyd </em>that <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning minimum statutory qualifications are not mandatory when sought was animated, in part, by a belief that such questions duplicate needlessly the efforts of the <em>pre-voir dire </em>screening methods which focus on statutory disqualifications. That cases such as the present one occur demonstrate a correctable weakness in this reasoning. Because the pre<em>voir dire </em>screening methods failed to identify and excuse Alade, a non-citizen, it is evident that <em>voir dire </em>questions regarding minimum statutory qualifications are not always \u2018redundant and unnecessary.\u2019 In fact, our cases ruminate that the <em>pre-voir dire </em>processes of screening out disqualified jurors are not fail-safe.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 422, 924 A.2d at 1091-92 (footnote and citation omitted). In support of the latter proposition, the majority again turns to <em>Johns v. Hodge. </em>And it directs our attention to the concession by the jury commissioner for Howard County, \u201cthat his staff did not confirm the veracity of the information contained on juror questionnaires and the orientation session also failed to address citizenship as a qualification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419-20 n. 42, 924 A.2d at 1090 n. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The partial overruling of <em>Boyd </em>is prospective, of course, and does not, therefore, serve to make the question in this case mandatory. Nevertheless, presumably because, in the majority\u2019s view, the defendant could, and probably should, have anticipated that there could be a failure of the screening process, thus allowing a non-citizen to slip through the cracks, the majority faults Owens for relying on the screening procedures and not asking the court to again ask the venire a question to which everyone of them already had responded, and consistently so with service on the jury. To it, because the trial court\u2019s refusal to ask the question could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>reviewed for an abuse of discretion, Owens may only benefit from the jury deficiency if he asked the trial court to inquire of the venire concerning an issue as to which he had no basis for inquiring.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">At the outset, the <em>voir dire </em>process is not a back-up to the juror qualification process; its office is not to \u201cverify juror qualifications.\u201d None of the cases cited for this proposition support it. To be sure, in <em>Williams, </em>394 Md. at 112, 904 A.2d at 542, we said that \u201c[V]oir dire is the mechanism by which we give substance to the constitutional guarantee to criminal defendants of a fair and impartial jury trial,\u201d which, we made clear, was accomplished by \u201cexclud[ingj from the venire potential jurors for whom there exists cause for disqualification, so the jury that remains is capable of deciding the matter before it based solely on the facts presented, and uninfluenced by extraneous considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 904 A.2d at 539, <em>citing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Hill, </em>339 Md. at 279, 661 A.2d at 1166, in which we stated that the <em>voir dire </em>procedure is undergirded by the \u201csingle, primary, and overriding principle or purpose: \u2018to ascertain \u201cthe existence of cause for disqualification.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Quoting McGee v. State, </em>219 Md. 53, 58, 146 A.2d 194, 196 (1959), in turn <em>quoting Adams v. State, </em>200 Md. 133, 140, 88 A.2d 556, 559 (1952). <em>See Jenkins, </em>375 Md. at 331, 825 A.2d at 1035-36 (\u201c[0]ne of the ways to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury is to expose the existence of factors which could cause a juror to be biased or prejudiced through the process of <em>voir dire </em>examination\u201d); <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 9, 759 A.2d at 823 (stating that <em>voir dire </em>is the process by which prospective jurors are examined to determine whether cause for disqualification exists); <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 435, 671 A.2d at 35 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In <em>Boyd, </em>we explained the nature of the disqualification to which we had reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cIn virtually all our previous cases ..., the proposed questions concerning specific cause for disqualification were related to the biases, such as racial or religious interests or prejudices, of the prospective jurors. As a result, in discussing what type of questions <em>must </em>be asked on <em>voir dire, </em>we have defined the proper focus of the <em>voir dire </em>examination to be only \u201cthe venireperson\u2019s state of mind and the existence of bias, prejudice, or preconception, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification....\u2019\u201d <em>Hill, </em>339 Md. at 280, 661 A.2d at 1167, <em>citing Davis[ v. </em>State], 333 Md. [27,] 37, 633 A.2d [867,] 872 [(1993)]. Although we did make a general statement in <em>Davis </em>that the minimum statutory qualifications for jurors would be included in the mandatory scope of <em>voir dire, </em>that case pertained solely to possible biases the venirepersons might have had in favor of law enforcement personnel, and our analysis and application of the rules of <em>voir dire </em>involved primarily the search for bias.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">341 Md. at 436-37, 671 A.2d at 36. Thus, <em>Boyd </em>and all of the cases the majority cites, with the exception of the over-broad statement in <em>Davis v. State, </em>addressed a process developed to ensure juror impartiality, not to verify juror qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>This is consistent with the elaborate system for vetting potential jurors that the Court identified and described in Part IV of the <em>Boyd </em>decision. 341 Md. at 441-45, 671 A.2d at 38-40. That system, whose origin is a statutory scheme of some sophistication, is implemented by Rules of this Court in which this Court plays a significant role. The Rule requires each circuit court to develop a jury plan, which must be approved by the Court of Appeals. The plan prescribes the procedures for compiling a list of potential jurors meeting the minimum statutory qualifications and for processing them. It assigns responsibility for the superintendence of the process to court personnel, including the bench or jury judge, and it contemplates that such personnel will gather the necessary information and do what is required to amass a venire, to develop a pool from which impartial juries may be selected. That system, I submit, contemplates that the litigants will rely on the results of the process. It simply is inconceivable that the majority\u2019s view of the jury plans and the very important tasks assigned to court personnel in order to develop a venire is correct. That certainly is not how this Court viewed such systems in <em>Boyd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">There, we construed the jury selection subtitle as being \u201cconcerned with the <em>removal </em>of unnecessary screening barriers,\u201d so that mandatory <em>voir dire </em>of prospective jurors about matters (in that case, their physical limitations) already thoroughly covered earlier in the selection process <em>\u201cimposes </em>an unnecessary screening barrier. Indeed, further questioning may embarrass or intrude upon the privacy of a prospective juror.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 446, 671 A.2d at 40 (emphasis in original). That is especially the case, we added, \u201cwhen an affirmative answer does not by any means denote likely disqualification[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cThe petitioners cannot specify a single reason why further questioning specifically on physical limitations is necessary. We acknowledge that a question on <em>voir dire </em>about physical limitations of jurors and addressed to all venirepersons might occasionally result in disqualification of a juror; but so might literally any other line of questioning. Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>have not documented instances where the juror selection process failed completely to screen out physically incapable jurors, who would have been identified and excused had the question been asked on <em>voir dire. </em>In short, unless the judge has made some observations regarding possible physical problems, such questioning can become merely a general attempt to \u2018fish\u2019 about for more information than is necessary about prospective jurors. Certainly it is not reasonably likely to lead to cause for disqualification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><em>Id., </em>671 A.2d at 40-41. These observations apply with at least equal force to the case <em>sub judice, </em>with the exception of the likelihood of disqualification. Owens had no reason to suspect that Mr. Alade was not a citizen and neither did anyone else. The trial judge, so far as the record reflects, had not made any observations concerning possible citizenship problems and certainly the pre-screening process had revealed none.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, there was no basis to ask the question, the screening already having been done, and there simply is no basis for believing that had it been proposed, it would have been met with anything but a refusal, in the absence of the proffer of some basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">There is also in this case no showing of \u201cdocumented instances\u201d where the juror selection process has failed completely to screen out nor-citizens, just this case. That is not enough, I submit, not by a long shot. Nothing is perfect. There simply is no completely fail-safe system, no matter what it is intended to accomplish. Because this is so, one always can anticipate and expect mistakes. But this fact does not mean that the system is broken. It is not a reason to deny to a party the right to rely on the results of the process or to change the responsibility for inquiring, in hopes of discovering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the pertinent information. It is not a basis for holding a party to a different standard or changing the jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Maryland is, and has prided itself on being, a limited <em>voir dire </em>State. <em>See Curtin v. State, </em>393 Md. 593, 602, 903 A.2d 922, 928 (2006); <em>Landon v. Zorn, </em>389 Md. 206, 216, 884 A.2d 142, 147 (2005); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 215-17, 798 A.2d 566, 574-75 (2002); <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 34, 40-43, 633 A.2d at 870, 873-75. There are, at present, only a few mandatory inquiries. <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 11 n. 8, 759 A.2d at 824 n. 8, listed those this Court has identified: \u201cracial, ethnic and cultural bias,\u201d <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>357 Md. 204, 232, 742 A.2d 952, 967 (1999); <em>Hill, </em>339 Md. at 285, 661 A.2d at 1169; <em>Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 15, 595 A.2d 448, 455 (1991), religious bias, <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>217 Md. 595, 606-07, 143 A.2d 627, 632 (1958), predisposition as to the use of circumstantial evidence in capital cases, <em>Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 564, 45 A.2d 340, 343-44 (1946), and placement of undue weight on police officer credibility, <em>see Langley v. State, </em>281 Md. 337, 349, 378 A.2d 1338, 1344 (1977). To these, we may add the inquiries approved in <em>Thomas, </em>369 Md. at 214, 798 A.2d at 573 (bias due to the nature of the narcotics crime with which the defendant is charged) and <em>Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 9-10, 806 A.2d 265, 271 (2002) (applying <em>Thomas </em>to sexual abuse related crimes). All of these categories involve \u201cpotential biases or predispositions that prospective jurors may hold which, if present, would hinder their ability to objectively resolve the matter before them.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 36, 633 A.2d at 872. Ironically, this case expands those categories to each and every qualification category there is. Questions proposed as to any of them, whether there is basis for them or not, will have to be asked; there simply is no basis for doing otherwise. The jury commissioner is just as likely to make mistakes as to any one of them as he or she has done with regard to citizenship. Moreover, an attorney representing a defendant will be constrained to ask each of the questions for fear of later post-conviction \u2014 the failure to ask and there subsequently turns up information showing a juror was disqualified for failing to meet one of them would be incompe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tency of counsel, as the defendant\u2019s right to appeal would have been lost. This hardly seems to be productive of judicial economy. Just the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Judge CATHELL joins in the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">. On this point, I am not persuaded by the majority's analysis. I incline to the view advanced by and forcefully advocated by the petitioner. I do not address this issue specifically, however, believing that the petitioner is entitled to reversal even if the right is only statutory. I note, however, that it is well settled that a jury consists of one\u2019s peers and that, as the Constitution required, <em>see </em>Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the General Assembly, by prescribing the qualifications for jury service, made clear that, for that purpose, a defendant's peers are his or her fellow citizens. Thus, while it may be true that neither Constitution explicitly states that only citizens may serve on juries, the implementing legislation, which necessarily is complementary and explanatory, does. Bear in mind that the legislature may not legislate in derogation of the Constitution. <em>See Lamone v. Capozzi, </em>396 Md. 53, 73, 912 A.2d 674, 685 (2006), <em>citing Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 546, 873 A.2d 1122, 1140; <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, </em>285 Md. 393, 411, 404 A.2d 1027, 1037 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Although it was dismissed summarily as having no application to this case, 399 Md. 388, 442-43, 924 A.2d 1072, 1081-82 (2007), I believe Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to be quite relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and, indeed, that its application is dispositive with respect to the composition of an \"impartial jury,\u201d as consisting only of citizens. In this view, I am persuaded by <em>Perkins v. Smith, </em>370 F.Supp. 134 (D.Md.1974). In that case, a non-citizen challenged [his/her] exclusion from jury service. In rejecting that challenge, the court enunciated principles that are just as, if not particularly, applicable to this case. The <em>Perkins </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\"This Court considers that grand and petit jurors in both state and federal courts are 'persons holding ... important nonelective ... judicial positions\u2019, that they participate directly in the execution of the laws and 'perform functions that go to the heart of representative government.\u2019 Blackstone [3 Blackstone Commentaries, Sec. 380] considered juries as \u2018the best investigators of truth, and the surest guardians of public justice.' The institution of jury trial, he said, 'preserves in the hands of the people that share which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.\u2019 In No. 83 of The Federalist [at 562 (J. Cooke Ed. 1961) (Hamilton)], Alexander Hamilton, after referring to the 'high estimation\u2019 in which he held the institution of jury trial, concluded that 'it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government. Discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly aspect to liberty.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">370 F.Supp. at 137. The Court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\"In maintaining the jury system as \u2018the very palladium of free government\u2019 the states logically can anticipate that native-born citizens would be conversant with the social and political institutions of our society, the customs of the locality, the nuances of local tradition and language. Likewise naturalized citizens, who have passed through the citizenship classes sponsored by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, have demonstrated a basic understanding of our form of government, history and traditions. There is no corresponding basis for assuming that resident aliens, who owe allegiance not to any state or to the federal government, but are subjects of a foreign power, have so assimilated our societal and political mores that an equal reliance could be placed on their performing as well as citizens the duties of jurors in our judicial system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">\"The nature or the operation of juries makes it apparent that persons unfit for jury service can work a great deal of harm, through inability or malice, to efficiency and fairness. Jury deliberations are perhaps the most secret form of decision-making in the nation; the means of persuasion used by jurors on each other are never revealed. A single juror who failed to understand the import of the evidence being presented or who lacked any concern for the fairness of the outcome could severely obstruct or distort the course of justice. A single persuasive and unprincipled juror could even direct the course of justice into channels deliberately chosen for their deleterious effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>on this country. We conclude, therefore, that the state has a compelling interest in the restriction of jury service to those who will be loyal to, interested in, and familiar with, the customs of this country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM\"><em>Id. </em>at 138.

Perhaps it is because Mr. Alade, on his own, advised the jury commissioner of his alien status that Mr. Alade's assertion that he did not intentionally misrepresent his status is not being challenged. What is troubling, of course, is the lack of verification or follow-up by the jury commissioner's office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">. Maryland Code (2001) \u00a7 6-105 of the Criminal Procedure Article provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\"(a) <em>Timing of hearing on motion. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a court in which a motion for new trial in a criminal case is pending <em>shall </em>hear the motion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">\"(l)within 10 days after the motion is filed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-_\">\"(2) if an agreed statement of the evidence or a statement of the evidence certified by the trial judge is filed, within 10 days after the statement is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\">. The first level occurs when the juror qualification form <em>is </em>executed and returned and it is under the supervision of the jury commissioner's office, overseen by the jury judge. The second level occurs when the potential juror comes to court; he or she then is seen by, and may be interviewed by, the jury commissioner or the jury judge. At this stage, \"upon the juror's appearance at the court,\" as <em>Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 444, 671 A.2d 33, 39 (1996), makes clear, \"the jury judge or commissioner [is authorized] to question the potential juror further on the information contained in the questionnaire.\u201d The third level occurs in the courtroom during jury selection, when, in the superintendence of the process, the trial judge has the opportunity to observe the venire. The main purpose of the juror qualification questionnaire is the formation of a jury pool. Necessarily, therefore, the object of the inquiry largely relates to whether, at the threshold, the potential juror meets the minimum qualifications of a juror. It is still at issue, although, perhaps not so much as at the questionnaire stage, at the second screening, where deferrals or excuses from service take on a greater importance. As we shall see, <em>infra, </em>the jury pool having been set and two screenings having already occurred, the focus at the third screening is on empaneling a fair and impartial juiy, not determining whether the venire is properly constituted. At that stage, it is assumed to be, and reasonably so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">. In <em>Johns v. Hodges, </em>60 Md. 215, 221-22 (1883), our predecessors reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\"The right of challenge itself is a safeguard provided by law in contemplation of the contingency that the officers whose duly it is to select only qualified persons have failed in the performance of that duty. It is a means specially provided by which a party to a suit may readily and effectually protect him self against any oversight or neglect committed in the original selection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">That reasoning is the exact opposite of that employed by this Court in <em>Boyd. </em>Rather than applaud an inquiry aimed at checking the adequacy with which the jury commissioner or comparable official performed, we decried and discouraged the \"redundancy.\u201d 341 Md. at 438, 671 A.2d at 37 (indicating that the inquiry in that case, involving physical infirmity, one of the enumerated minimum qualifications, was \"to be conducted at several earlier points in the juror selection process, rendering the requested questions unnecessary on <em>voir dire.\u201d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. Self-servingly, the trial court indicated that, had Owens proposed a \u201ccitizenship\u201d question, the court would in all likelihood have asked it, and Mr. Alade would have been excused. The majority accepts that speculation. That is all that is, speculation. And speculation is much too tenuous support for the denial of so important a right. There is, moreover, not even a guarantee that Mr. Alade would have responded to the question. After all, he had once, already, inadvertently failed to respond correctly to a rather straight-forward and unambiguous question.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">It is curious that the majority believes that the respondent would have been helped by proposing the citizenship question to be put to the venire. That presupposes that the information now known either should have been known then or would become known during the <em>voir dire </em>process. Otherwise, because the exercise of discretion is judged on the basis of information known, and the facts and circumstances existing, when the discretion is exercised, the later discovery of the lack of citizenship on the part of Mr. Alade would not inform the decision on review. As the majority has correctly pointed out, that a juror provides false information does not guarantee relief. <em>See </em>399 Md. at 423-24, 924 A.2d at 1092-93, <em>citing Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 144\u201446, 691 A.2d 1255, 1265-66 (1997); <em>Leach v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 611, 618-19, 425 A.2d 234, 238-39 (1981) (affirming the refusal to strike a juror, who upon cross-examination at trial, was discovered to be an old neighbor and acquaintance of a State's witness when the trial judge was satisfied that the juror had no bias and <em>Burkett v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 438, 445, 319 A.2d 845, 849 (1974)(failure to reveal relationship to prosecutor)). The interest of justice could and probably would suffice as a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>relief, I would have thought, but it is an avenue available in this case already.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"><em>. </em>That the jury commission office did not verify Mr. Alade's citizenship or challenge his assertion that he was a citizen is not a basis for suggesting that Owens should have known to inquire. Just the opposite, the responsibility for developing the jury pool, which necessarily requires the screening of the potential jurors for eligibility, is placed on the jury commission office, not the defendant. This opinion shifts that responsibility and it does so unreasonably and unnecessarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
