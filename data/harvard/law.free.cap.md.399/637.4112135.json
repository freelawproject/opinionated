We shall hold that, under the facts of this case, an organist holding a position similar to that occupied by the respondent does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>come within the ministerial exception. Thus, he may prosecute a Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The First Amendment, as relevant, provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof----\u201d U.S. Const., Am. I. These religious prohibitions are applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Employment Div., Ore. Dept. of Human Res. v. Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 876-77, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1599, 108 L.Ed.2d 876, 884 (1990). <em>See also Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 1217-18 (1940); <em>Levitsky v. Levitsky, </em>231 Md. 388, 396-97, 190 A.2d 621, 625 (1963); <em>Craig v. State, </em>220 Md. 590, 599, 155 A.2d 684, 690 (1959). The free exercise clause prohibits government regulation of religious beliefs. <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 219, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1535, 32 L.Ed.2d 15, 27 (1972). Legitimate claims to free exercise, however, can be outweighed by government interests, albeit only those of the highest importance. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 214-15, 92 S.Ct. at 1532-33, 32 L.Ed.2d at 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The free exercise protection is also present in Article 36 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution. It provides, as relevant, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">\u201c... all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for his religious practice, unless, under the color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent, or maintain, or contribute, unless on contract, to maintain, any place of worship, or any ministry ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">The Free Exercise Clause, as embodied in the U.S. Constitution and Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, does not provide \u201ca constitutional right to ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>neutral laws of general applicability,\u201d even when such laws have, as an incidental effect, the burdening of a particular religious activity, however. <em>City of Boerne v. Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 513, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2161, 138 L.Ed.2d 624, 634 (1997). <em>See also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">\u201c[A] spirit of freedom for religious organizations, an independence from secular control or manipulation, in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine. Freedom to select the clergy, where no improper methods of choice are proven, we think, must now be said to have federal constitutional protection as a part of the free exercise of religion against state interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-7\"><em>Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church, </em>344 U.S. 94, 116, 73 S.Ct. 143, 154-155, 97 L.Ed. 120, 136-137 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The Supreme Court has made clear that the church can self-govern beyond the reach of judicial power. <em>See, e.g., N.L.R.B. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 U.S. 490, 504, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 1320, 59 L.Ed.2d 533, 543 (1979) (holding that, because of a potential conflict with the First Amendment, the National Labor Relations Act did not apply to teachers in church-operated schools). Federal courts have reinforced that message. <em>See, e.g., Gellington v. Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, </em>203 F.3d 1299, 1304 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that, in matters of church governance and administration, the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ment shall not interfere); <em>Bollard v. California Province of Society of Jesus, </em>196 F.3d 940, 945 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that the \u201cFree Exercise Clause restricts the government\u2019s ability to intrude into ecclesiastical matters or to interfere with a church\u2019s governance of its own affairs\u201d); <em>Combs v. Central Texas Annual Conference United Methodist Church, </em>173 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.1999) (noting that the Free Exercise Clause protects a church from government interference with church management); <em>E.E.O.C. v. Catholic University of America, </em>83 F.3d 455, 463 (D.C.Cir.1996) (holding that the Free Exercise Clause \u201cguarantees a church\u2019s freedom to decide how it will govern itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Employment decisions typically are governed by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1964). That Title makes unlawful any employment practice that discriminates on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-l (a) carves out a statutory exception, however. That exception is for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">\u201c... an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State, or <em>to a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society </em>with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">(Emphasis added). This \u201cexception\u201d for religious organizations also is embodied in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201c(2) it <em>shall not be an unlawful employment practice </em>for a school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution of learning to hire and employ employees of a particular religion if such school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution of learning is, in whole or in substantial part, owned, supported, controlled, or managed by a particular religion or <em>by a particular religious corporation, association, or society, </em>or if the curriculum of such school, college, university, or other edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>eational institution or institution of learning is directed toward the propagation of a particular religion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The exception for religious organizations and their employment relationships with persons performing religious duties was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Corporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, </em>483 U.S. 327, 336, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 2868, 97 L.Ed.2d 273, 283 (1987). Supporting the exception, it explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">\u201c[I]t is a significant burden on a religious organization to require it, on pain of substantial liability, to predict which of its activities a secular court will consider religious. The line is hardly a bright one, and an organization might understandably be concerned that a judge would not understand its religious tenets and sense of mission. Fear of potential liability might affect the way an organization carried out what it understood to be its religious mission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-7\"><em>See also Gellington, </em>203 F.3d at 1303-1304 (holding that government interference with clergy employment matters violates the Free Exercise Clause); <em>Combs, </em>173 F.3d at 350 (holding that the judiciary could not rule on an <em>employment </em>decision concerning a minister without violating the Free Exercise Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">This Court, in addition to recognizing the Title VII exception insulating religious organizations from sanction for discrimination when making employment decisions, based on religious beliefs, even with respect to the protected classes of race, color, sex, and national origin, the other protected classes, has recognized that under Title VII, \u201cthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment precludes the application of these Title VII provisions to employment decisions by religious organizations concerning ministers, teachers, and other employees whose duties are \u2018integral to the spiritual and pastoral mission\u2019 of the religious organization.\u201d <em>Montrose Christian School Corporation v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 590, 770 A.2d 111, 126 (2001), <em>quoting E.E.O.C. v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh, N.C., </em>213 F.3d 795, 797 (4th Cir.2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Other courts have done so as well. <em>See Little v. Wuerl, </em>929 F.2d 944, 951 (3rd Cir.1991) (holding that a parochial school teacher could not, because of the exception, file a Title VII claim even though she w as discharged because she remarried); <em>Scharon v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Presbyterian Hospitals, </em>929 F.2d 360, 363 (8th Cir.1991) (holding that, in a gender discrimination action, a chaplain at a church hospital could not file a Title VII claim). In other words, engrafting a ministerial exception onto the Title VII protected classes allows the church significant latitude in its employment decisions when the employee in question has duties that are integral to the religious mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The \u201cministerial exception to Title VII,\u201d as it is known, applies to any employee whose \u201cprimary duties consist of teaching, spreading the faith, church governance, supervision of a religious order, or supervision or participation in religious ritual and worship.\u201d <em>Rayburn v. General Conf. of Seventh-Day Adventists, </em>772 F.2d 1164, 1169 (4th Cir.1985). <em>See also McClure v. Salvation Army, </em>460 F.2d 553 (5th Cir.1972) (a sex discrimination case, in which the Court found that the role of a Salvation Army officer fit within the scope of the \u201cministerial exception\u201d). More specifically, <em>Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1168, established what has become known as the \u201cprimary duties\u201d test. Pursuant to that test, the ministerial exception \u201cdoes not depend upon ordination but upon the function of the position.\u201d 772 F.2d at 1168</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">This Court recognized this exception in <em>Montrose. </em>There, we interpreted a Montgomery County statute that provided, \u201cit shall not be an unlawful employment practice * * * [f]or a religious corporation, association, or society to hire and employ employees of a particular religion,\u201d holding that it was not violative of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment nor of Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. 363 Md. at 584, 770 A.2d at 122.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">With this context in mind, we turn to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The respondent, William Moersen (\u201cMoersen\u201d), was employed as an organist at St. Catherine Labour\u00e9 Parish (\u201cthe Parish\u201d) from 1958 to 1976<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and again from 1991 to 2002. During these periods, he did not have a written employment contract. On July 11, 2001, Moersen and Robert G. Amey, the Pastor of the Parish, entered into an employment contract for Moersen\u2019s services as \u201cOrganist/Pianist/Keyboard Accompanist.\u201d Being for a term of two years, from July 1, 2001 until June 30, 2003, the contract provided, with respect to the respondent\u2019s responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\n<em>\u201cJob objectives:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">\u201cTo Support the Gospel message through the music ministry of Saint Catherine Laboure Church and to encourage the congregation to assume as active part in their musical participation at all liturgical parish functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">\n<em>\u201cJob description:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">\u201cTo provide Organ/Piano/Keyboard Music and/or musical accompaniment to both the congregation and the choirs of Saint Catherine Laboure Church at the 10:30 a.m., 12:00 noon and 1:15 p.m. Sunday services; to provide the same at the weekly Saturday 5:15 p.m. service; to provide same at special liturgical celebrations as listed below; to provide musical accompaniment for the congregation at the 7:00 p.m. Monday night weekly novena service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201c2. <em>Responsibilities of the organist:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201ca.

The organist shall be an ex officio member of all committees concerning liturgy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-13\">\u201ce. The organist will accept engagements to assist at weddings and funerals and when he is unable to accept such engagements he will recommend suitable substitutes if he is asked to do so. The fees for these services will be a matter between the organist and the party requesting his services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-14\">\u201cd. The organist will receive four (4) weeks of paid vacation each year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">For the performance of those duties, the respondent was to receive an annual salary of $26,500.00, in addition to other benefits, including hospitalization insurance. Also, \u201c[b]y mutual agreement the parties to the contract may terminate the contract in writing with advance notice of 90 (ninety) calendar days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>In 2001, the respondent informed the pastor who was in charge of the Parish and employment decisions, that he had been sexually abused by a Parish choirmaster from 1958 to 1964.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Immediately after reporting the sexual abuse, the respondent alleged that his employment situation began to deteriorate, as the pastor began to find fault with the respondent\u2019s performance. Prior to 2001, the respondent\u2019s performance record had been exemplary; he had never received a negative performance evaluation or warning during the some twenty-nine (29) years of employment with the Parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In November 2001, Moersen was told that he should retire from his position with the Parish, and was offered up to $2,000.00 to seek psychiatric counseling. Thereafter, on February 17, 2002, the respondent\u2019s employment was terminated unilaterally and without advance notice, based on his \u201capparent inability to work cooperatively.\u201d The respondent brought an action alleging breach of contract, wrongful discharge, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the Parish, its pastor, and the Archdiocese of Washington (collectively, \u201cthe petitioners,\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The Archdiocese moved to dismiss the respondent\u2019s complaint. It argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and, based on the religious guarantees of the U.S. and Maryland Constitutions, the complaint failed to state a claim. The Circuit Court denied the motion, so that the parties could engage in discovery, albeit limited, as to the nature of the organist position, a matter critical to determining whether the \u201cministerial exception\u201d would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In answers to interrogatories and answers to requests for admissions, the respondent admitted that his contract enumerated several religious purposes. In those answers, he denied, however, discharging any of those duties and stated that he \u201cdid not encourage the congregation to assume an active part in their musical participation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In moving for summary judgment, the Archdiocese argued that, under <em>Montrose, </em>the respondent\u2019s position was covered by the ministerial exception. It emphasized that the respondent\u2019s undisputed duty was to play music at religious services for the Catholic Church. The motion was granted, precipitating Moersen\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. It held that the court erred in granting the petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We granted the petitioners\u2019 petition to this Court for a writ of certiorari. <em>Archdiocese v. Moersen, </em>389 Md. 124, 883 A.2d 914 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Central to determining whether the ministerial exception applies in the case <em>sub judice </em>is deciding what, in fact, Moersen\u2019s role was in the church, which, in turn, requires an assessment of his duties. Until 2001, the respondent worked without a written contract. Only in 2001 was the first written contract introduced into the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Although this contract enumerated, with some specificity, job objectives, the respondent maintains that he was not required to perform and had never been required to, and, in fact, did not, achieve or attempt to achieve all of them. As far as he was concerned, his only duties at the Parish were to provide at the 10:30 a.m., 12:00 noon, and 1:15 p.m. Sunday services instrumental music and/or musical accompaniment to both the congregation and the choirs of St. Catherine Laboure Church, to provide those services at the weekly Saturday 5:15 p.m. service, to provide musical accompaniment for the Tuesday and Friday evening weekly choir rehearsals, to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>musical accompaniment at special services, when requested, and to provide musical accompaniment for the congregation at the 7:00 p.m. Monday night weekly novena service. Moersen contends that he did not plan, nor select, the music associated with the worship at any of the liturgies. That was done by either the Music Director or choir directors. In essence, the respondent claims that he was merely an organ player.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The respondent further contends that he supervised no one, and, in fact, never performed any duties in a leadership, teaching or training capacity. Nor was he required to attend staff or committee meetings. Consistently, the respondent was not listed as a staff member on the church directory of St. Catherine Laboure. As was true with the other religious groups for whom he performed as an organist or pianist, including Jews, Moslem and Hindu, he was not required to profess, support or become a member of the Catholic faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The petitioners viewed, and continue to do so, Moersen\u2019s role quite differently. They stress that Moersen\u2019s contract placed on him the responsibility to \u201c(1) build[ ] and sustain[ ] congregational song at all liturgies, (2) assist[] in selecting and planning the music associated with liturgical worship, and (3) participat[e] in special liturgical celebrations.\u201d In addition, the petitioners note that the contract placed the respondent\u2019s duties in a \u201clarger religious perspective,\u201d \u201c[t]o support the Gospel message through the music ministry of Saint Catherine Laboure Church and to encourage the congregation to assume an active part in their musical participation at all liturgical parish functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 approach to the dispute in this case was to look at similar cases involving employees of a church whose duties involved providing music for the services and church events. From that analysis, the intermediate appellate court held that \u201c[although music is generally an important part of the Catholic faith, here, [Moersen\u2019s] position fell outside the ambit of the ministerial exception.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The Court of Special Appeals primarily relied on <em>Assemany v. Archdiocese of Detroit, </em>173 Mich.App. 752, 434 N.W.2d 233 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>(1988), whose facts were compared to the facts in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Assemany, </em>the appellant, a white male organist, had graduated from a school operated by the church to train organists and worked for several Catholic parishes in the Detroit area. 434 N.W.2d at 234. He was offered a position as the musical director for the a parish in the Archdiocese, and was given an \u201coral assurance of lifetime employment as long as he did his job properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable contract prescribed his responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">\u201cThe music Director will be, in conjunction with the Parish Worship Committee, completely responsible for all liturgical music in the parish, and all music connected with paraliturgical services, such as bible vigils, vespers, penance services, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">434 N.W.2d at 234. In addition, it required the appellant to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATn\">\u201cselect, prepare, and teach suitable and appropriate music to the congregation, prepare music fitting to the theme of each Sunday and holy day liturgy, provide music for the daily masses, select music for and direct the parish choir, aid in the musical participation of Gesu students in their liturgies, assist with and participate in liturgies or musical events on a vicariate level and provide music for weddings and funerals[, and ... ] to be present fifteen minutes in advance of any liturgy or parish activity in which he was to participate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">434 N.W.2d at 234-35. The appellant subsequently<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cassumed the duties of teaching the school children at [the parish] to participate in daily mass and conducting a children\u2019s choir ... he handled all of the musical functions for the parish liturgies.\u201d 434 N.W.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Toward the end of the appellant\u2019s second term as music director, the parish received a new pastor, and the appellant\u2019s relationship with the church began to deteriorate. <em>Id. </em>The new management criticized the appellant\u2019s abilities and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>choices he made as musical director. <em>Id. </em>Although the appellant was re-signed to a one-year contract, that contract detailed areas that \u201cneeded improvement,\u201d and required him to take music lessons to improve his ability and to develop a program to prepare the children to sing at the Saturday and Sunday services. <em>Id. </em>Before the expiration of the contract term, the appellant was informed by the pastor that \u201c[the parish] needed a younger and black organist,\u201d and that his contract would not be renewed. <em>Id. </em>From the expiration of his contract term to his dismissal, approximately a year later, the appellant\u2019s job description was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">\u201cPlaintiff was given the new title of pastoral musician. The contract incorporated a job description for that position. Plaintiff was relieved of his responsibilities to teach music to children in the Gesu school and to direct the children\u2019s choir. He was in charge of the liturgical music of the parish and its performance. In addition, plaintiff was to develop a cantor program at Gesu in accordance with the guidelines of the archdiocesan program for cantors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">434 N.W.2d at 235-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The parish, meanwhile, hired a younger white man to teach the parish students, direct the children\u2019s choir, and play the music for daily mass. When this man resigned later, the appellant unsuccessfully sought to resume those responsibilities. The parish hired a young black man instead. 434 N.W.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The appellant filed a discrimination claim against the parish. The trial court, however, granted summary judgment to the parish on the ground that, as a \u201cnonsecular (religious)\u201d employee, <em>id., </em>his claims were barred by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. 434 N.W.2d at 234. The Supreme Court of Michigan affirmed. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that his role was merely secular because, although he was engaged in a religious activity, he was not promoting the church\u2019s faith or doctrine. 434 N.W.2d at 238. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201cPlaintiff was required to have a working knowledge of the Catholic religion and liturgy. He was responsible for the selection and teaching of all liturgical music in the parish. His primary responsibility was to enable and encourage the Gesu choir and congregation to participate in the Catholic liturgy through song. Plaintiff assumed a pastoral-liturgical leadership role in the parish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">\u201cOn the basis of the facts of this case, we conclude that, while employed at Gesu, plaintiff was more than just an organist. He was the head of the musical branch of the Catholic liturgy there. Plaintiff was intimately involved in the propagation of Catholic doctrine and the observance and conduct of Catholic liturgy by the Gesu congregation. On the basis of \u2018the function of his position,\u2019 plaintiff was, thus, \u2018clergy\u2019 ... His Title VII discrimination claim is therefore barred by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Contrasting <em>Assemany </em>and the case sub <em>judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">\u201cThe difference between the case before us and <em>Assemany, </em>is that [Moersen] merely played the organ at various services, whereas in <em>Assemany, </em>the plaintiff assumed a far more significant role in religion and liturgy. As the <em>Assemany </em>Court stated, the \u2018plaintiff was more than just an organist.\u2019 [Moersen], in the case at hand, was \u2018just an organist.\u2019 Beyond playing the organ and occasionally selecting which songs to play, there was no evidence that [Moersen] participated in services beyond that of playing the organ or that he was part of the ministry to spread the Catholic religion. He was not, for example, a choir director; nor was his position similar to that of the organist in <em>Assemany. </em>Again, the meager evidence before us to support the decision of the circuit court is the language of the contract, not the nature of the duties [Moersen] actually performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cAlthough [Moersenj\u2019s duties were to \u2018support the Gospel message\u2019 through music and to \u2018encourage the congregation to assume an active part in their musical participation\u2019 at mass and other religious functions, there is no additional evidence that he did anything more than play the organ and occasionally sing during services. Aside from the broad language of the contract, there was no evidence that his primary duties consisted of spreading the Catholic faith; his role as organist did not play an integral or important role in religious ritual or worship. Consequently, [Moersen]\u2019s position is distinguishable from that of <em>Assemany </em>and of choir directors. His basic duties were simply to play the organ at religious services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Thus, the Court of Special Appeals held that Moersen\u2019s Title VII discrimination claim was not barred by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 assessment. Under the \u201cprimary duties\u201d test, <em>see Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1169, to be deemed \u201cnon-secular,\u201d the respondent\u2019s role must \u201cconsist of teaching, spreading the faith, church governance, supervision of a religious order, or supervision in religious ritual and worship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cognizant that the \u201cfunction of the position\u201d is of greater importance than \u201cordination,\u201d we simply are not convinced that the respondent\u2019s role was supervisory in any respect, involved any form of church governance, or directly required the teaching or the spreading of the religious faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The petitioners acknowledge the respondent\u2019s denials which contradicted the terms of his contract, namely that he did not discharge certain of the enumerated duties and further that he did not support the Gospel of the church that employed him and, indeed, was openly critical of the Catholic faith. Nevertheless, they maintain that the respondent did not \u201cmerely\u201d play the organ. For this Court to make such a characterization, they submit, is to subjectively determine what the respondent\u2019s responsibilities were, something the Free Exercise Clause was designed to protect. Moreover, the petitioners point out that, as the Court of Special Appeals acknowledged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cmusic plays a vital role in a number of religious faiths,\u201d including in the Catholic faith, where music has deep religious significance. Therefore, they caution, a ruling in the respondent\u2019s favor on the issue <em>subjudice </em>would endorse governmental interference with religion, something constitutionally prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Whatever the role of music in the Catholic faith, this case involves the ministerial exception. That, in turn, implicates and requires examination of the role the respondent plays in the church. Its application, notwithstanding the undesirability of judicial intrusion in church governance and decision making, requires an examination of a complainant\u2019s duties and the place of that position in the Church hierarchy; some level of review of the disputed employee\u2019s role in the church must be conducted in order to determine whether the \u201cministerial exception\u201d applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">It is not enough to say that Moersen\u2019s music is central to the church\u2019s method of worship; it would be just as easy to say that the manufacturer of the organ contributes to the church\u2019s worship, or that the people involved in the upkeep of the organ and worship place contribute to the church\u2019s ability to maximize the participation in religious ritual. Where does one draw the line?, that is the question. As stated in a case cited by the petitioners, <em>Musante v. Notre Dame of Easton Church, </em>No. 301-CV-2352, 2004 WL 721774, *6 (D.Conn. Mar. 30, 2004), \u201cthe religious nature of the employer is not dispositive of the inquiry, since it is unlikely that a church custodian would ever be considered a ministerial employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The petitioners urge that, contrary to the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals, the <em>Rayburn </em>primary duties test does not mean that, \u201cparticipation alone [is] not enough.\u201d We do not agree. In <em>Rayburn, </em>the court considered whether the position of associate in pastoral care was important to the spiritual mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 772 F.2d at 1169. Concluding that it was, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9p\">\u201cThe role of an associate in pastoral care is so significant in the expression and realization of Seventh-day Adventist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>beliefs that state intervention in the appointment process would excessively inhibit religious liberty. The associate in pastoral care at Sligo Church is, according to undisputed evidence, pastoral advisor to the Sabbath School that introduces children to the life of the church. She also leads small congregational groups in Bible study. As counselor and as pastor to the singles group, the associate in pastoral care is once again a liaison between the church as an institution and those whom it would touch with its message. Such counseling requires sensitivity both to the human problems of the congregation and to the church\u2019s message of comfort in the face of those problems. Never are people more in need of spiritual leadership than when they turn to a pastor for help in dealing with their most difficult moments. Finally, the selection of the associate in pastoral care to stand on the platform during services, to lead out the congregation during the church\u2019s solemn rites, and to preach occasionally from the pulpit places the imprimatur of the church upon that person as a worthy spiritual leader to whom members may look for consultation, example, and guidance in their own lives and in the life of the congregation as a corporate body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">While we cannot, and will not, comment on the effect that the respondent\u2019s organ music had on the congregation or the members of the choir, we do note that the significance of the respondent\u2019s position and the level of his participation is far different than the position occupied by the appellant in <em>Ray-bum. </em>The respondent was not in absolute control of the music played, and he did not lead any choirs, teach any hymns, or control any part of the church services in which he participated. He was neither required to have specialized knowledge of the Catholic faith, nor expected to have any particular religious training. All he needed was knowledge of how to play an organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">To be sure, as <em>Rayburn </em>recognizes, the ministerial exception does not apply only to those who have been ordained. Those persons who are not ordained and are untitled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>but who, in essence, perform ministerial roles are also covered. 772 F.2d at 1168-69. On this point, the petitioners argue that the respondent\u2019s involvement with the church and in the services was essential, that \u201cwe couldn\u2019t have done this with a C/D player ... [h]e didn\u2019t function like a wind-up music box ... The position called for a human being.\u201d That the respondent, however, could have been replaced easily by another qualified organ player underscores the non-ministerial-like nature of his position. That the position requires a human being is not dispositive. It is significant that it does not require a specific human being with specific religious-based qualification. His contract to the contrary notwithstanding, the duties that the respondent actually performed, while they occurred during church services, were not \u201cministerial\u201d in any sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The cases on which the petitioners rely, although supportive of the proposition that \u201cdespite its name, it is well-recognized that the \u2018ministerial\u2019 exception applies to lay employees in addition to ordained ministers and clergy members,\u201d do not mandate a different result in the case <em>sub judice. </em>They are distinguishable. In each, the subject job or position had a far greater significance to the religious mission than does the respondent\u2019s position and, thus, the ministerial exception was appropriately applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In <em>Alicea-Hernandez v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>320 F.3d 698, 700 (7th Cir.2003), at issue was the role of \u201cHispanic Communications Manager\u201d at a Catholic church, whose duties included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">\u201ccomposing media releases for the Hispanic community; composing correspondence for the Cardinal; developing a working relationship with the Hispanic media and parishes in the Hispanic community to promote Church activities; developing a working relationship with the Hispanic community to enhance community involvement; composing articles for Church publications; and translating Church materials into Spanish.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Id. </em>The incumbent holder of that position claimed that she had been discriminated against based on her gender and race. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Noting that \u201c[i]n determining whether an employee is considered a minister for the purposes of applying this exception, we do not look to ordination but instead to the function of the position,\u201d 320 F.3d at 703, <em>citing Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh, N.C., </em>213 F.3d at 801, and stating the relevant inquiry, \u201cwhether Alicea-Hernandez\u2019s position as Hispanic Communications Manager can functionally be classified as ministerial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 703, the court concluded that the appellant\u2019s position was covered by the exception. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXs\">\u201cthe parties cite numerous cases dealing with positions such as teachers, music directors, and youth counselors, the cases provide limited guidance in making the determination required here. Unlike those positions, a press secretary is responsible for conveying the message of an organization to the public as a whole. A press secretary, as is evident from observing various public officials and entities, is often the primary communications link to the general populace. The role of the press secretary is critical in message dissemination, and a church\u2019s message, of course, is of singular importance. As the D.C. Circuit stated, \u2018[D]etermination of whose voice speaks for the church is per se a religious matter.\u2019 <em>Minker v. Baltimore Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, </em>894 F.2d 1354, 1356 (D.C.Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the rationale for the ministerial exception is founded upon the principle that \u2018perpetuation of a church\u2019s existence may depend upon those whom it selects to preach its values, teach its message, and interpret its doctrines both to its own membership and to the world at large.\u2019...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">\u201c... [The appellant] served as a liaison between the Church and the community to whom it directed its message. As Hispanic Communications Manager, Alicea-Hernandez was integral in shaping the message that the Church presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to the Hispanic community. We therefore conclude that Alicea-Hernandez served a ministerial function for the Church and her Title VII claims are therefore barred by the First Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">320 F.3d at 704 (footnotes and some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">A teacher of English and religion at a Catholic school, who had been terminated by the Catholic school after she had publicly supported abortion, was held, in <em>Curay-Cramer v. Ursuline Acad, of Wilmington, Del, Inc., </em>344 F.Supp.2d 923, 925 (D.Del.2004), to be covered by the ministerial exception. 344 F.Supp.2d at 932. There, although not owned by the church, religious principles were taught at the school so as to \u201cindoctrinate[ ] its students according to those principles.\u201d 344 F.Supp.2d at 926. The appellant acknowledged that her role was to \u201cteach those religious principles and inculcate them in [her] students.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The court decided that the ministerial exception applied to the school employee. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-8\">\u201cI am inclined to believe that a religion teacher at a parochial school does indeed fall within the ministerial exception, but I need not conclusively answer that question because, regardless of the answer, the deep respect for free exercise rights upon which the exception is based still requires extraordinary judicial caution when addressing claims by lay employees whose duties have religious significance----Here, the alleged victim of gender discrimination was a parochial school teacher of religion and of English, the latter subject, as well as the former, giving rise to frequent discussion of moral issues, as both sides acknowledge----Those religious implications are particularly clear in the circumstances of this case, in which the Plaintiff was fired during a controversy she helped create over the Catholic Church\u2019s long-established doctrinal opposition to abortion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">344 F.Supp.2d at 932-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">The employee in <em>E.E.O.C. v.

This document, like the proposed job description, assigned responsibility to Austin for the music program of the Cathedral and the Cathedral school. Among the duties listed were: teaching at the school; supervising and directing choirs; training cantors; and playing for holidays, weddings, and funerals. Austin was also required to approve music for weddings even if she was not available for the ceremonies. She was also made part of the Worship Committee and was required to attend the committee\u2019s monthly meetings and participate in seasonal liturgy planning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">213 F.3d at 798. She claimed that the church discriminated against her on the basis of sex. 213 F.3d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Focusing its analysis on \u201c \u2018the function of the position\u2019 at issue and not on categorical notions of who is or is not a \u2018minister,\u2019\u201d 213 F.3d at 801, and characterizing the proper inquiry as \u201c \u2018whether a position is important to the spiritual and pastoral mission of the church,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., citing Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1169 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court concluded that the ministerial exception applied. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5m\">\u201cThe functions of the positions are bound up in the selection, presentation, and teaching of music, which is an integral part of Catholic worship and belief... .To hold otherwise would require us to say that music is substantially devoid of spiritual significance in the life of the church.... \u201cAt the heart of this case is the undeniable fact that music is a vital means of expressing and celebrating those beliefs which a religious community holds most sacred. Music is an integral part of many different religious traditions.... It serves a unique function in worship by virtue of its capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>to uplift the spirit and manifest the relationship between the individual or congregation and the Almighty____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">\u201cThus, inasmuch as Austin\u2019s duties involve the expression of the church\u2019s musical tradition, it is a fallacy to denominate them as merely secular----The efforts of a music minister or teacher can thus influence the spiritual and pastoral mission of the church as much as one who would lead the congregation in prayer, preach from the pulpit, or teach theology in school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">\u201cAustin was clearly a pivotal figure in most, if not all, aspects of the musical life of the Cathedral and school. The various job descriptions for the music ministry positions, though not dispositive, unmistakably evince the religious significance of her music ministry. Austin was required to assist in the planning of liturgies and was in charge of the parish choirs-functions at the very heart of the church\u2019s musical life. The positions also entailed responsibility for recruiting choir members, cantors, and special musicians ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\">\u201cThe significance of Austin\u2019s role in the selection and presentation of religious music is highlighted by the interplay between music and other liturgical forms. The music at religious worship services is often tied to the seasons of the church year or the day\u2019s scripture readings. Indeed, Father O\u2019Connor stated in his affidavit that Austin\u2019s role at the three weekly worship services was \u2018to choose music that reflected and enhanced the theme of the Scriptures of the day and that would assist the assembly of believers in their individual journeys of faith.\u2019 Father O\u2019Connor also stated that Austin was involved in planning music for the special seasons of the year, such as Christmas and Easter, and for special feast days such as the Feast of Christ the King and the Feast of Pentecost. And even where Austin did not select the music herself, the subtle judgments that accompany the presentation and interpretation of sacred music contribute to its spiritual effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201cAustin also served as a representative of the church to the congregation. She played a prominent role in worship services and helped to lead the congregation in song. The significance of her role was reinforced by the fact that Austin was listed on the front page of the Parish bulletin under \u2018Parish Staff,\u2019 along with the parish priests and a Pastoral Associate/Director of Religious Education. Austin was thus a visible (and audible) sign of the church\u2019s work through music, as well as a leader of the congregation in the church\u2019s musical, and therefore spiritual, life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">\u201cIndeed, Austin\u2019s duties at the Cathedral school appear to have gone far beyond the teaching of music classes. As Austin herself points out in exhibits attached to her affidavit, she was responsible for the music program of the school and served as a resource person for all musical activities in the school. She also assisted in the music preparation for school liturgies and played the piano at Mass. Austin was responsible for the school choir and school handbell choir. These duties, coupled with the spiritual significance of her teaching role, render her position at the Cathedral school \u2018ministerial\u2019 for purposes of the exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">213 F.3d at 802-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">In <em>Musante v.

Hebrew Home of Greater Wash., Inc., </em>363 F.3d 299, 307 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Shaliehsabou, </em>the employee, an Orthodox Jewish man, a mashgiach, or \u201can inspector appointed by a board of Orthodox rabbis to guard against any violation of the Jewish dietary laws,\u201d 363 F.3d at 301, sought to assert the Fair Labor Standards Act against his employer, a nursing home, the Hebrew House of Greater Washington. Significantly, it was established that there was \u201cno secular health or safety rationale for the work performed by the [mjashgichim,\u201d 363 F.3d at 302, who \u201c[is] qualified under Judaic law to supervise the preparation of food to ensure that it is kosher,\u201d \u201cmust have a knowledge of the basic laws of kashruth,\u201d \u201cgenerally have obtained their knowledge of the laws of kathruth through experience and study at \u2018yeshiva,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cpossess the authority to enforce the laws of kathruth and make on-the-spot decisions based on their knowledge and understanding of the situation at hand.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Citing the primary duties test established in <em>Rayburn, </em>the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-7\">\u201c... Shaliehsabou\u2019s duties required him to perform religious ritual. He supervised and participated in religious ritual and worship. Shaliehsabou was responsible for starting and kosherizing the ovens and cleansing kitchen utensils in accordance with the rules of kashruth. He also oversaw the preparation of kosher food, a key aspect of the Jewish halakha----Importantly, it was his responsibility to consult with the Vaad for proper resolution of any concerns. In sum, we cannot say, given the importance of dietary laws to the Jewish religion, that the duties of mashgichim do not involve religious worship and ritual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-10\">\u201cIn addition to performing religious ritual, Shaliehsabou occupied a position that is central to the spiritual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>pastoral mission of Judaism. As a juridical religion, Judaism is dependent upon compliance with its laws, including the kashruth, and Shaliehsabou was the vessel through whom compliance with the kashruth was ensured for residents at the Hebrew Home.... Shaliehsabou, through his mashgiach tasks, performed sacerdotal duties. As Shaliehsabou has admitted, in the Jewish faith, non-compliance with dietary laws is a sin. As explained above, Jews view their dietary laws as divine commandments, and compliance therewith is as important to the spiritual well-being of its adherents as music and song are to the mission of the Catholic church. In short, failure to apply the ministerial exception in this case would denigrate the importance of keeping kosher to Orthodox Judaism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">363 F.3d at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Moersen was not required to have any specialized knowledge of the Catholic faith. Stated another way, his lack of knowledge of many aspects of the Catholic faith did not prevent him from doing his job. This is unlike the plaintiff in <em>Shaliehsabou, </em>who, without very specific training, would not have been permitted to hold the position of mashgiach, much less perform that role.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Further comparisons with the cited cases display key differences. Unlike the employee in <em>Alicea-Hernandez, </em>Moersen was not the \u201cvoice\u201d of the church. It was the Cantor that led the Parish and choir in song, and Moersen merely accompanied him. Not only did he not preach or inculcate values, he did not decide how the message was expressed. He was not, as the employee in <em>Curay-Cramer </em>was, in a teaching role, in a position where his own beliefs affected his ability to perform his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\"><em>Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh, N.C. </em>has similarities to the case <em>sub judice, </em>to be sure, but there are key differences as well. Moersen was not a \u201cmusic minister.\u201d He was not a \u201cpivotal figure\u201d at the church, did not plan any liturgies himself, and he was not in charge of the church\u2019s \u201cmusical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>life.\u201d He did not teach the choir any music, and he was not listed as Parish Staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The difference between the employee in <em>Musante </em>and Moersen is also dramatic. Moersen was not asked to train any ministers, and he was not in charge of reading scripture.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Furthermore, the cases involving an \u201cemployee in a musical position\u201d that the petitioner cites to highlight the application of the ministerial exception do not further the petitioner\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\"><em>Assemany v. Archdiocese of Detroit, </em>173 Mich.App. 752, 434 N.W.2d 233 (1988) does not stand for the general proposition that an organist position is covered by the ministerial exception. As the Court of Special Appeals explained, the court\u2019s holding that the organist was covered by the ministerial exception was based on reasons other than the employee\u2019s job title; the organist in <em>Assemany, </em>unlike the respondent, also was the head of the musical branch of the Catholic liturgy in the church, and had a \u201cleadership role\u201d in the parish. 434 N.W.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Similarly, in <em>Egan v. Hamline United Methodist Church, </em>679 N.W.2d 350 (Minn.Ct.App.2004), the employee was the music director, \u201cresponsible for managing and rehearsing Hamline Methodist\u2019s choir, selecting and preparing music for regular Sunday services and other special services, playing the organ, and supervising other church music groups, such as the children\u2019s choir and the hand bell choir.\u201d 679 N.W.2d at 352. It was with reference to those duties that the court held that the ministerial exception applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">\u201cWe recognize that music generally has a central and substantial role in expressing religious faith; it is often described as a \u2018ministry of music.\u2019 Music addresses the religious needs of church members and plays an integral part of the worship program. Egan states that his responsibilities include \u2018selecting and preparing\u2019 music for religious services. Clearly, Egan had to be familiar with the corpus of church music and theology to select the proper music for such services. In performing this task, he is expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>consider the time in the church year, the scripture readings, the sermon topic, the church\u2019s basic faith principles, and other religious matters. That Title VII cases have considered music directors exempt from the protections of that act argues in favor of our concluding that a music director plays a religious role for [Minnesota Human Rights Act] purposes. Accepting the facts alleged in Egan\u2019s complaint as true, we cannot say the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that Egan was a religious employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">679 N.W.2d at 356. Unlike the employee in <em>Egan, </em>the respondent did not lead any choirs, did not teach any music, and, with rare exceptions, the music he played was chosen for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In <em>Miller v. Bay View United Methodist Church, </em>141 F.Supp.2d 1174 (E.D.Wis.2001), the church\u2019s \u201cMusic Director and Choir Director\u201d alleged racial discrimination when he was fired by the church. 141 F.Supp.2d at 1175. The duties of \u201cmusic Director and Choir Director\u201d included \u201cchoos[ing] appropriate musical selections for the Sunday worship services and ... preparing] and directing] the choirs in leading the congregation in song,\u201d \u201cresearching] the religious themes of the upcoming services in religious books ... and ... selecting] music that coincided with the religious themes and meanings of that particular services,\u201d 141 F.Supp.2d at 1178, as well as \u201c[e]ncourag[ing] and promoting] Music Ministry outreach.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Noting that \u201c[w]here an individual\u2019s employment responsibilities are sufficiently ecclesiastical, a court may determine that it is precluded from scrutinizing a religious institution\u2019s allegedly discriminatory action in the employment context,\u201d 141 F.Supp.2d at 1181, the court decided that, in the case before it, \u201cmore was required [of the employee] than mere musical ability.\u201d 141 F.Supp.2d at 1182. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqn\">\u201cThe policy sections of both job descriptions state that music in worship rests upon the following \u2018music ministry keys,\u2019-ministry, not performance, and members are more important than gorgeous music. Both job descriptions also contain a \u201cResponsibilities and Expectations\u201d section. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Director of Music job description includes two responsibilities which are of particular significance with respect to religious criteria. The Director must \u2018ensure appropriate music for all regular services of the church\u2019 and \u2018encourage and promote [mjusic [ministry outreach.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">\u201cAdditionally, one of the responsibilities of the Chancel Choir Director job is, where possible, to choose music to fit the liturgy and or the lectionary. The policies, responsibilities and expectations of the jobs demonstrate that the defendant expected that a music ministry role be fulfilled by the Director of Music and the Choir Director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-7\">\u201cBased on the foregoing, this court concludes that the plaintiff engaged in traditionally ecclesiastical or religious activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">141 F.Supp.2d at 1182-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">In <em>Starkman v. Evans, </em>198 F.3d 173 (5th Cir.1999), the \u201cChoirmaster and Director of Music,\u201d brought an action against the church at which she was employed, alleging a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 198 F.3d at 174. Concluding that the ministerial exception applied to that position, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-10\">\u201cAlthough Ms. Starkman argues that she was hired strictly on the basis of her qualifications as a choir director, it is clear that her job requirements went above and beyond mere musical issues. To be certified as a Director of Music Ministry, she was not only required to have a masters in music, but also extensive course work in Church Music in Theory and Practice, Choral Conducting, Worship, Choral Vocal Methods, Hymnology, Bible, Theology, Christian Education, and United Methodist History, Doctrine and Polity. The job description for Director of Music, states that \u2018the Director of Music is responsible for the planning, recruiting, implementing and evaluating of music and congregational participation in all aspects of this ministry at Munholland United Methodist Church.\u2019 Furthermore, there is no dispute that religious music plays a highly important role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the spiritual mission of the church. Thus, it seems clear that the job specifications required Ms. Starkman to be educated in religion and serve as a spiritual leader.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-4\">\u201cSecond, to constitute a minister for purposes of the \u2018ministerial exception/ the court must consider whether the plaintiff was qualified and authorized to perform the ceremonies of the Church.... Ms. Starkman had several religious duties and responsibilities. For example, she was required to plan worship liturgy, coordinate church and worship activities relating to the church\u2019s Music Ministry, rehearse with choirs and conduct those choirs, hire musicians and lower level music ministry directors, and write articles about the church\u2019s Music Ministry for the weekly church bulletin, introducing liturgical seasons for worship services ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">\u201cThird, and probably most important, is whether Ms. Stark-man \u2018engaged in activities traditionally considered ecclesiastical or religious/... including whether the plaintiff \u2018attends to the religious needs of the faithful/____While Ms. Stark-man claims that attending to the \u2018religious needs of the faithful\u2019 was not a primary duty, she admits that she was designated to be a \u2018ministerial presence\u2019 to ailing parishioners on occasion. She also concedes that, for her and her congregation, music constitutes a form of prayer that is an integral part of worship services and Scripture readings. \u201cThe evidence, when examined in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, indicates that Ms. Starkman did serve as a spiritual leader and thus properly falls under the rubric of this court\u2019s ministerial exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">198 F.3d at 176-77 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The respondent was not required \u201cto plan worship liturgy, coordinate church and worship activities relating to the church\u2019s Music Ministry, rehearse with choirs and conduct those choirs, hire musicians and lower level music ministry directors, and write articles about the church\u2019s Music Ministry for the weekly church bulletin.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Penultimately, the petitioners cite <em>Fassl v.

In that case, the employee was the Director of Music of the church that dismissed her, allegedly in violation of the American with Disabilities Act. Responding to the complaint, the church alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">\u201cthe necessary qualifications for its Director of Music go far beyond musical experience and skill. Rather, the qualifications for Director of Music include an ability to teach, to lead, and to evoke active participation of the people in all liturgical celebrations and an ability to work with the volunteers who freely give their time and talent to the group that the Church deems to be its music ministry. Thus, the position of Director of Music is significantly distinguished from that of purely custodial, clerical or office personnel. At this Church, the Director of Music reportedly requires a thorough \u2018understanding of and love for\u2019 the Liturgy of the Church and the relationship of music to the liturgical life of the Church.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In that case, the appellant herself admitted that her duties were ministerial in nature,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">\u201cshe played, sang and/or directed three to five masses per weekend, planned music for liturgies, scheduled and trained the cantors, directed multiple Church choirs, chaired the \u2018Renew 2000\u2019 liturgy team, and prepared and played for penance services, all school liturgies, all other Holy Days, and contemporary and teen music groups among her enumerated duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The employee did not refute or attempt to refute the allegations describing her role in the \u201cmusical ministry\u201d of the church, leading the court to the conclusion that they were true. 2005 WL 2455253, at *9.

This Court held that it did not. 363 Md. at 596, 770 A.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">We are not, under the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>asked to resolve the merits of <em>Montrose.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\"><em>. </em>Moersen originally began working at the Parish in 1958 as an organist, when he was eleven years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">. These acts of sexual abuse, Moersen alleged, occurred at the Parish itself during church services, at church-sponsored functions, and at other locations.

The Majority opinion, in the process of minimizing the role played by Moersen as the organist for St. Catherine Labour\u00e9 Parish (\u201cthe Parish\u201d), as compared to more extensive musical ministry and other ecclesiastical positions examined by other courts, lost sight of the simple reality that because Moersen\u2019s \u201cprimary duties consisted] of ... participation in religious ritual and worship, he ... should be considered \u2018clergy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rayburn v. Gen. Conf. of Seventh-Day Adventists, </em>772 F.2d 1164, 1169 (4th Cir.1985); <em>accord Montrose Christian Sch. Corp. v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 590, 770 A.2d 111, 126 (2001). This is true regardless of whether one relies on the duties delineated in Moersen\u2019s employment contract, or the activities Moersen professes he actually performed as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>employee. Accordingly, I believe that this Court should have accepted the Archdiocese of Washington\u2019s argument invoking the \u201cministerial exception\u201d to the prosecution of Moersen\u2019s Title VII cause of action, reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">I. The \u201cMinisterial Exception\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">As the Majority opinion necessarily acknowledges, there exists a \u201cministerial exception\u201d to the application of the employment anti-discrimination measures codified in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-l(a). The U.S. Supreme Court upheld, against Establishment Clause attack, this exception in <em>Corporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, </em>483 U.S. 327, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987), and this Court also adopted it in <em>Montrose Christian School Corp. v. Walsh. </em>The aim of the exception is to honor the promise of the Free Exercise Clause by placing sectarian matters outside of the subject matter jurisdiction of secular courts. <em>Bourne v. Ctr. on Children, Inc., </em>154 Md.App. 42, 54-55, 838 A.2d 371, 379 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared that \u201c[a]s a general rule, if the employee\u2019s primary duties consist of teaching, spreading the faith, church governance, supervision of a religious order, or supervision or participation in religious ritual and worship, he or she should be considered \u2018clergy.\u2019\u201d <em>Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1169 (quoting Bruce N.

Moerseris Employment Contract Indicates Clearly that His Position is \u201cMinisterial\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In order to determine whether a given employee\u2019s position within a sectarian organization should be deemed \u201cministerial,\u201d many courts have been guided either by the language contained in the employment contract binding the religious organization and the employee, or by the job description created by the religious organization in summarizing the duties of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">In <em>Diocese of Raleigh, </em>the Fourth Circuit reviewed \u201c[t]he various job descriptions for the music ministry positions, though not dispositive,\u201d in ruling that a music director and music teacher at a Catholic church and elementary school fulfilled a ministerial role. 213 F.3d at 803. In <em>Tomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peona, </em>442 F.3d 1036 (7th Cir.2006), Richard Tomic, a music director and organist for the Diocese of Peoria and St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral, sued both entities for discrimination when he was dismissed from employment. Judge Posner, writing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, turned to the job descriptions developed by the diocese and the church for guidance in determining that Tomic\u2019s position was truly ministerial. <em>Tomic, </em>442 F.3d at 1037. In <em>Scharon v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Presbyterian Hospitals, </em>929 F.2d 360 (8th Cir.1991), a federal appellate court was persuaded by the job description of a hospital chaplain in designating that employee\u2019s position as ministerial. 929 F.2d at 362-63. In <em>Starkman v. Evans, </em>198 F.3d 173 (5th Cir.1999), another federal appellate court utilized the job description of an employee\u2019s position in its analysis of whether that position was ministerial. 198 F.3d at 176. In <em>Shirkey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>Eastwind Community Development Corp., </em>941 F.Supp. 567 (1996), the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland concluded that, based solely on the job description approved by the defendant religious organization, the position sought by a job applicant was not ministerial. 941 F.Supp. at 577-78. Another federal trial court, in <em>Miller v. Bay View United Methodist Church, Inc., </em>141 F.Supp.2d 1174 (E.D.Wis.2001), relied on the job description provided by the church in ruling that an employee\u2019s role was ministerial. 141 F.Supp.2d at 1181-82. Even in <em>Assemany v. Archdiocese of Detroit, </em>173 Mich.App. 752, 434 N.W.2d 233 (1988), a case relied upon by the Majority opinion, the court took great pains to detail the contractual duties assigned to the organist, Assemany. 434 N.W.2d at 235-36. It was to those duties that the <em>Assemany </em>court looked in concluding that the organist position in that case was ministerial. 434 N.W.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">A similar analytical approach is appropriate here. The case was disposed of in the Circuit Court on summary judgment. There was no genuine dispute between the parties as to Moersen\u2019s contractual duties. The Majority opinion quotes Moersen\u2019s employment contract with the Parish with respect to his duties as \u201cOrganist/PianisVKeyboard Accompanist:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">\n<em>Job objectives:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">To Support the Gospel message through the music ministry of Saint Catherine Laboure Church and to encourage the congregation to assume as active part in their musical participation at all liturgical parish functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">\n<em>Job description:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-9\">To provide Organ/Piano/Keyboard Music and/or musical accompaniment to both the congregation and the choirs of Saint Catherine Laboure Church at the 10:30 a.m., 12:00 noon and 1:15 p.m. Sunday services; to provide the same at the weekly Saturday 5:15 p.m. service; to provide same at special liturgical celebrations as listed below; to provide musical accompaniment for the congregation at the 7:00 p.m. Monday night weekly novena service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">2. <em>Responsibilities of the organist:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>a.

The objective of his position was \u201c[t]o Support the Gospel message through the music ministry of Saint Catherine Laboure Church\u201d and to encourage congregational participation in the liturgies though music. A position entailing the performance of religious music, for a church during its religious services, to a religious end cannot possibly be perceived as anything but religious. Moer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>sen\u2019s contract tasked him with planning and playing music as an accompaniment to the religious hymns sung by the choir and the congregation. He was required to attend Parish staff meetings and was considered an ex officio member of all committees relating to the liturgies in which he performed. Under these circumstances, the contractual relationship between the Parish and Moersen steeped Moersen in duties and responsibilities \u201cthat primar[il]y ... consist of ... participation in religious ritual and worship----\u201d <em>Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The Majority opinion, however, ignored the overtly religious duties assigned to Moersen and instead accepted Moersen\u2019s characterization of his role at the Parish. Curiously, the Majority opinion, like the misguided intermediate appellate court here, neglected to consider the number of cases catalogued above where courts looked to the terms of an employee\u2019s contract or the job description applicable to the employee\u2019s position for guidance. The Majority opinion should not be allowed to escape the relevance of the employee\u2019s job description being a stronger consideration. In surveying analogous cases, the Majority opinion itself recites from at least four cases where an employee\u2019s job description was weighed explicitly by courts in making an assessment of whether a position was ministerial. Maj. op. 399 Md. at 649-52, 658-59, 665-66, 666-67, 925 A.2d at 666-67, 671, 675-76, 676 (citing <em>Assemany, Diocese of Raleigh, Miller, </em>and <em>Starkman). </em>Indeed, the Majority opinion is forced to acknowledge the religious nature of Moersen\u2019s job description, yet sidesteps it unsatisfactorily by relying on Moersen\u2019s incomplete job performance as reason, for purposes of its analysis, to ignore the religious duties the Parish entrusted to Moersen. Maj. op. 399 Md. at 656-57, 925 A.2d at 670 (\u201cHis contract to the contrary notwithstanding, the duties that the respondent actually performed, while they occurred during church services, were not \u2018ministerial\u2019 in any sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">III. Moersen\u2019s Role Solely as an Organist was Ministerial</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Even with the Court majority confining its consideration to Moersen\u2019s averment that he only played the organ, I nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>less conclude that his position was a ministerial one. My opinion is compelled by nothing less than the simple reality that playing the organ for religious services at a Catholic church is an important facilitation of the liturgies in which Moersen participated, obviously an activity \u201cimportant to the spiritual and pastoral mission of the church.\u201d <em>Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Many jurisdictions have opined on the obvious sectarian significance of music as played during religious services. The Fourth Circuit, in <em>Diocese of Raleigh, </em>stated that it is an \u201cundeniable fact that music is a vital means of expressing and celebrating those beliefs which a religious community holds most sacred.\u201d 213 F.3d at 802; <em>see also Starkman, </em>198 F.3d at 176 (\u201c[T]here is no dispute that religious music plays a highly important role in the spiritual mission of the church.\u201d); <em>Tomic, </em>442 F.3d at 1041. There is also no shortage of facts adduced by the Archdiocese of Washington that music occupies a scared position in Catholic worship. In particular, the Archdiocese asserted that \u201cthe pipe organ is to be held in high esteem, for it is the traditional musical instrument that adds a wonderful splendor to the Church\u2019s ceremonies and powerfully lifts up the spirit to God and to higher things.\u201d <em>Constitution on the Liturgy, Sacrosanctum Councilium, </em>4 December 1963. Despite this convincing evidence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both the Court of Special Appeals and the Majority in this Court downplay unsatisfactorily Moersen\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The fact remains that because music inheres a vital liturgical significance, the performance of that music is equally as significant. Although Moersen contends that he is \u201cjust an organ player,\u201d his apt performance of sacred and reverent music during worship services belies a secular characterization of his role. Moersen, as the organist, was an active participant in liturgies in a way that an organ manufacturer or a person who merely tunes the organ is not. <em>See Tomic, </em>442 F.3d at 1041. Despite Moersen\u2019s arguments, I am persuaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>that there is no such thing as \u201cjust an <em>organ </em>player\u201d in religious rituals and ceremonies such as those in which Moersen performed. I am not alone in this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In <em>Tomic, </em>Richard Tomic, a music director and organist, portrayed his involvement with his church employer in much the same manner as does Moersen here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">[s]o far as his role as organist is concerned, his lawyer says that all Tomic did was play music. But there is no one way to play music. If Tomic played the organ with a rock and roll beat, or played excerpts from <em>Jesus Christ Superstar, </em>at an Easter Mass, he would be altering the religious experience of the parishioners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">442 F.3d at 1040. In view of this reality, the Seventh Circuit held that \u201cTomic \u2018performed tasks that were \u201ctraditionally ecclesiastical or religious.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Tomic, </em>442 F.3d at 1041. In Diocese of Raleigh, the Fourth Circuit noted of a music director tasked with selecting and playing music for worship services that \u201ceven when Austin did not select the music herself, the subtle judgments that accompany the presentation and interpretation of sacred music contribute to its spiritual effect.\u201d 213 F.3d at 803. The <em>Diocese of Raleigh </em>court then struck the same note as did the Tomic court in addressing the difficulty of accepting an argument such as Moersen\u2019s that simply playing the organ has no religious importance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">Indeed, it is not easy to divorce even the more technical aspects of music from its significance in religious worship. Whether a selection is played <em>adagio </em>or <em>andante </em>can have a profound effect on the religious worship and vocal participation of the congregation. And different performances of the same musical piece can evoke different responses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">213 F.3d at 804. Even though Moersen did not also fulfill the role of music director, he nonetheless served, for all intents and purposes, as \u201cthe primary human vessel through whom the church chose to spread its message in song.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The role of church organist almost certainly would be included at the epicenter of religious activity as described by Professor Bagni, whom the Fourth Circuit quoted in <em>Rayburn </em>in setting out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cprimary duties\u201d test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. Sidney Buchanan, <em>The Power of Government to Regulate Class Discrimination by Religious Entities: A Study in Conflicting Values, </em>43 Emory L.J. 1189, 1210 (1994) (discussing Bagni, <em>supra, </em>79 Colum. L.Rev. at 1539).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Relatedly, I perceive that the Majority opinion makes too much of the leadership role and more extensive responsibilities of music directors and other ecclesiastical figures as contrasted to a \u201cmere\u201d organist in deciding whether either position is ministerial. As I have pointed out already, at least two federal appellate courts have noted that the manner in which religious music is played is, by itself, a matter of religious significance without regard to whether the performer selected that music. Further, the <em>Diocese of Raleigh </em>court opined that simply because an employee is answerable to a superior on spiritual matters, that fact does not <em>de jure </em>relegate that employee to any less of a religiously significant role; rather, it is just one factor to consider. 213 F.3d at 803. What is more important is whether the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duties consist of ... participation in religious ritual and worship.\u201d <em>Rayburn, </em>772 F.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">It is telling that the \u201cprimary duties\u201d inquiry was dispositive in one of the cases relied upon by the Majority opinion and the Court of Special Appeals. In <em>Assemany, </em>George Assemany served as music director and organist for Gesu Parish in the Detroit area. In finding that Assemany\u2019s position was ministerial, the Court of Appeals of Michigan held that he was \u201cmore than just an organist.\u201d 434 N.W.2d at 238. The Majority opinion incorrectly seizes upon this language as proof positive that all church employees, including Moersen, who only play the organ, are not ministerial employees. To do so ignores the real test to be applied; the \u201cprimary duties\u201d test, which was utilized in <em>Assemany. </em>In the paragraph preceding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the \u201cmore than just an organist\u201d language, the <em>Assemany </em>court found that the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary responsibility was to enable and encourage the Gesu choir and congregation to participate in the Catholic liturgy through song.\u201d 434 N.W.2d at 238. Surely, this same evaluation must be made of Moersen in his role as the organist at St. Catherine Labour\u00e9 Parish. Although he alleges that he did not select the music to be played at liturgy, he nonetheless enabled and encouraged both the choir and the congregation to worship through music. Again, Moersen did not have to be in a position of leadership to impact the Parish\u2019s liturgies through his exercise of his primary responsibilities. <em>Diocese of Raleigh, </em>213 F.3d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">For the reasons expressed above, I would hold that Moersen\u2019s role was ministerial, thus placing his employment discrimination claim outside of our secular jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals should be reversed and the matter remanded to that Court with directions to affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Judges RAKER and CATHELL authorized me to state that they join the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-6\">.
