Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">On March 31, 2005, appellant, Deandre Smith, then seventeen years of age, was indicted for one count of motor vehicle theft in violation of Maryland Code, Section 7-105 of the Criminal Law Article (CL), two counts of theft over $500 in violation of CL Section 7-104, one count of unauthorized use of an motor vehicle in violation of CL Section 7-203, two counts of willful and malicious destruction of property in violation of CL Section 6-301, one count of attempting to flee and elude a police officer in a vehicle in violation of Maryland Code, Section 21-904(e) of the Transportation Article (TR), one count of attempting to flee and elude a police officer on foot in violation of TR Section 21-904(c), one count of willful failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order of a law enforcement officer in violation of CL 10-201(0(3), one count of obstructing justice by resisting arrest, and one count of carrying a handgun in violation of CL Section 4-203(a)(l). Although Smith was 17 at the time of the offenses, the handgun violation was an \u201cexcluding charge\u201d over which the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction under Maryland Code, Section 3-8A-03 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP). Smith, nevertheless, filed a motion to remove the proceedings to juvenile court under Maryland Code, Section 4-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article (CP), which was denied by Judge Graydon S. McKee of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Subsequently, Smith and the State entered into a plea agreement by which Smith pled guilty to one count of motor vehicle theft and one count of fleeing and eluding an officer in a vehicle, in exchange for having the disposition of his charges handled by the juvenile court pursuant to CP Section 4-202.2, because the handgun charge would be nolle prossed. Judge Michael P. Whalen, sitting as judge of the criminal court, accepted the plea, found that Smith was amenable to treatment available in the juvenile justice system, transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>jurisdiction of the case to the juvenile court, and ordered the case sealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge McKee conducted the disposition hearing and committed Smith to the Department of Juvenile Services, which placed him in Bowling Brook Preparatory School.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Smith subsequently escaped, was apprehended and appeared again before the juvenile court. Judge McKee found that Smith was not amenable to treatment in the juvenile justice system,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ordered the original case unsealed, and remanded Smith to the criminal court for sentencing. On remand, Smith was sentenced to four years imprisonment on the motor vehicle theft charge, with all but six months suspended, followed by three years supervised probation; with respect to the fleeing and eluding an officer in a vehicle charge, Smith was sentenced to one year imprisonment, suspended, concurrent with the sentence for the motor vehicle theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Smith noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and subsequently, this Court issued, on its own initiative, a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. <em>Smith v. State, </em>397 Md. 107, 916 A.2d 256 (2007). Smith\u2019s brief presents the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Once the circuit court sitting as a criminal court transfers a case to the juvenile court for disposition under \u00a7 4-202.2 of the Maryland Criminal Proceedings Code, does the juvenile court thereafter lack the power to remand the case to the criminal court, and does the criminal court lack jurisdiction to impose a sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">We shall hold that once a criminal court transfers the ease to the juvenile court for disposition, the juvenile court cannot return the case to the criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Smith contends that once a criminal court transfers jurisdiction of a case to a juvenile court for disposition under CP Section 4-202.2, the juvenile court does not possess the power to remand the case to the criminal court. Smith argues that CP Section 4r-202.02 parallels CP Section 4-202, so that our opinions in <em>In re Glenn S., </em>293 Md. 510, 445 A.2d 1029 (1982) and <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 783 A.2d 673 (2001) would prevent the transfer that occurred in this case. Smith also contends that there is no statutory provision allowing the criminal court to retain jurisdiction over the case after it is transferred pursuant to Section 4-202.2 and to return the case to the criminal court. Additionally, Smith argues that remanding the case to the criminal court for sentencing, after the disposition in juvenile court, would be contrary to the general principles of the juvenile justice system and would violate double jeopardy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The State, conversely, contends that, after the criminal court transfers jurisdiction of a case to the juvenile court for disposition under CP Section 4-202.2, the juvenile court retains the power to remand the case to the criminal court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>State argues that although the legislative intent of CP Section 4-202.2 is to afford juvenile offenders rehabilitative treatment opportunities, the Legislature could not have intended to preclude a remand to the criminal court for sentencing if the juvenile acts inimically to treatment. Further, the State asserts that the analogy drawn between CP Sections 4-202 and 4-202.2 is inapplicable because the transfer of jurisdiction in Section 4-202.2 is limited to disposition, rather than to transfer jurisdiction to the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The juvenile courts are created by statute and have limited jurisdiction, ordinarily possessing exclusive original jurisdiction over youthful offenders alleged to have committed delinquent acts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CJP \u00a7 3-8A-03. Nevertheless, subsection (d) of Section 3-8A-03 identifies an exception, applicable to the present case, when a juvenile is charged with a violation of CL Section 4-203, unlawfully carrying a handgun:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">(d) <em>Limitations. </em>\u2014 The court does not have jurisdiction over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">(4) A child at least 16 years old alleged to have committed any of the following crimes, as well as all other charges against the child arising out of the same incident, unless an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>order removing the proceeding to the court has been filed under \u00a7 4-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">(xvii) A violation of \u00a7 4-203, \u00a7 4-204, \u00a7 4-404, or \u00a7 4-405 of the Criminal Law Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">CJP \u00a7 3-8A-03 (d)(4)(xvii).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Although a charge may be excluded from the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction under CJP Section 3-8A-03 (d), the criminal court may \u201creverse waive\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> jurisdiction to the juvenile court before trial or before a plea is entered under CP 4-202, pursuant to various transfer criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">(b) <em>When transfer allowed. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in a case involving a child may transfer the case to the juvenile court before trial or before a plea is entered under Maryland Rule 4-242 if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">(1) the accused child was at least 14 but not 18 years of age when the alleged crime was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">(2) the alleged crime is excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(l), (4), or (5) of the Courts Article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">(3) the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a transfer of its jurisdiction is in the interest of the child or society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">(d) <em>Transfer criteria. </em>\u2014 In determining whether to transfer jurisdiction under subsection (b) of this section, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-14\">(1) the age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(2) the mental and physical condition of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\">(3) the amenability of the child to treatment in an institution, facility, or program available to delinquent children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">(4) the nature of the alleged crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">(5) the public safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">(g) <em>Procedures on transfer </em>\u2014 Juvenile <em>court. </em>\u2014 If the court transfers its jurisdiction under this section, the court may order the child held for an adjudicatory hearing under the regular procedure of the juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">CP \u00a7 4-202(b), (d), and (g).

In <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. at 306, 783 A.2d at 673, we considered whether a juvenile court had the authority to rescind its order waiving jurisdiction to the criminal court. In that case, Franklin P. was charged with various offenses, and the State successfully petitioned the juvenile court to waive jurisdiction under CJP Section 3-817 to the criminal court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>subsequently issued an order vacating that waiver, which we determined was impermissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">In <em>Austin v. Director of Patuxent Institution, </em>we stated, quoting from <em>Scherr v. Braun, </em>that \u201c[n]o principle is better established than that in exercising a statutory power, a court is without jurisdiction unless it complies with the statute.\u201d We went on to hold:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201c[I]t is apparent that the court, in the exercise of the special jurisdiction conferred on it by statute, was required to follow the only course of action prescribed by the statute when, as here, the defendant was found <em>not </em>to be a defective delinquent. If new trials are to be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>in defective delinquent proceedings, the Legislature, not the Courts, should provide for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">Petitioner is asking our Court to grant to the Juvenile Court the power to waive \u201cjurisdiction\u201d back to that court by way of its modification of its original waiver order. The waiver statute contains no provision permitting the Juvenile Court to rescind its waiver order once authority is vested in the criminal court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">That, the juvenile court has no power to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 333-334, 783 A.2d at 689-90 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Further, in <em>In re Glenn S., </em>293 Md. at 510, 445 A.2d at 1029, a case similar to the present case except for the presence of Section 4-202.2, we considered whether a juvenile court could remand jurisdiction to the criminal court after the criminal court had reverse waived jurisdiction to the juvenile court, pursuant to Section 594A of Article 27 of the Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In that case, Glenn S., a juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>nile, allegedly committed a robbery with a deadly weapon. Subsequently, the criminal court reverse waived jurisdiction of the case to the juvenile court for adjudication, whereupon Glenn S. was placed in Waxter Children\u2019s Center pending trial. He escaped, and thereafter the juvenile court ordered that jurisdiction be returned to the criminal court because Glenn S. was not fit for rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system. We concluded that the juvenile court did not have the power to return the case to the criminal court, noting that the powers of the juvenile court, those granted by statute, did not include the power to modify the criminal court\u2019s order reverse waiving the case to the juvenile court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">The juvenile causes provisions ... do not expressly or impliedly allow the juvenile court to modify decisions of the circuit court sitting in a criminal case. Because courts of special jurisdiction exercise only those powers granted to them by statute, the juvenile court in this case had no power to vacate the order of the circuit court, thus returning the case to the criminal side of the circuit court. Although the juvenile court has the statutory power to transfer jurisdiction of a case to the circuit court pursuant to \u00a7 3-817 of the Courts Article, that section only applies in cases where the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction. Because the charge here was robbery with a deadly weapon, original jurisdiction was in the circuit court, ... \u00a7 3-817 has no application. Jurisdiction in this case was originally in the circuit court, was transferred to the juvenile court and it remains there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 516-17, 445 A.2d at 1032 (citations omitted). The lesson of <em>In re Glenn S. </em>and <em>In re Franklin P., </em>thus, is that juvenile courts only have the powers granted them by statute, and to those we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Our goal, when interpreting statutes, is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Gilmer v. State, </em>389 Md. 656, 662, 887 A.2d 549, 553 (2005); <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Md. 320, 327, 872 A.2d 681, 685 (2005); <em>Derry v.

State, </em>331 Md. 137, 148-49, 626 A.2d 946, 951 (1993) (\u201c \u2018[T]he search for [legislative] intent is most accurately described as an effort to discern some general purpose, aim, or policy of the statute.\u2019 \u201d); <em>In re Keith G., </em>325 Md. 538, 542, 601 A.2d 1107, 1109 (1992); <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 485 (1991) (\u201cOur focus is, therefore, centered upon the statute\u2019s policy or purpose.\u201d). The best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there. <em>Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 663, 887 A.2d at 553; <em>Cain, </em>386 Md. at 327, 872 A.2d at 685; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; <em>Whack v.

Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 6-7, 629 A.2d 731, 734 (1993). \u201cIn the interest of completeness, however, we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993). <em>See also Robey v. State, </em>397 Md. 449, 454, 918 A.2d 499, 502 (2007); <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078, 1084 (2005). In other words, the resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to seek contradiction of the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Robey, </em>397 Md. at 454, 918 A.2d at 502; <em>Stanley, </em>390 Md. at 185, 887 A.2d at 1084. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments. <em>Robey, </em>397 Md. at 454, 918 A.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The State argues that the CP Sections 4-202.2 and 4-202 are different because the transfer of jurisdiction in Section 4 - 202.2 is limited to disposition. Section 4-202.2, however, does not include any provision permitting the juvenile court to remand the case to the criminal court. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 4-202.2. In this respect, the reasoning of <em>In re Glenn S. </em>is pertinent; the juvenile court can only exercise those powers explicitly provided to the court by statute. The only statutory provision permitting the juvenile court to transfer jurisdiction to the criminal court, other than when jurisdiction is transferred automatically under CJP Section 3-8A-07, is CJP Section 3-8A-06, which permits a juvenile court to waive jurisdiction to the criminal court before trial under certain conditions. That section, however, by its express terms, is applicable only when the juvenile court has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d initially, which the juvenile court did not have in this case because Smith was charged with the \u201cexcluding charge,\u201d the handgun violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The State argues, nevertheless, that although the legislative history of CP Section 4-202.2 indicates that the section was enacted to afford juvenile offenders rehabilitative treatment .opportunities, the Legislature could not have intended to preclude a remand to the criminal court for sentencing if the juvenile\u2019s actions reflect that he or she is not amenable to treatment. To the contrary, however, rehabilitation of a juvenile is not a single event; it is an on-going process. <em>See Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 247-49, 879 A.2d 695, 714-15 (2005) (Wilner, J., concurring) (noting that the purpose of the Juvenile Causes statute is to provide a program of rehabilitation consistent with the child\u2019s best interest and protection of the public interest, such that the juvenile court has continuing jurisdiction to assist the rehabilitation of the juvenile); <em>Raiford v. State, </em>296 Md. 289, 294, 462 A.2d 1192, 1194 (1983) (\u201c \u2018The basic difference, however, between trial as an adult and trial as a juvenile lies not in the fact-finding processes, but in the <em>procedures looking to rehabilitation </em>after a determination that an individual did in fact commit acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>which were violations of the criminal statutes of this State.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Wiggins v.

First, although both the Code and this Court have long spoken of the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the juvenile and criminal courts <em>(see, </em>for example, Md.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8A-03-3-8A-07 and \u00a7\u00a7 3-803 and 3-804 of the Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud.

Article IV, \u00a7 1 of the State Constitution lists the courts that are the repositories of the judicial power of the State, and it does not mention a Juvenile Court. It is the Circuit Courts that are authorized to \u201chear and decide all cases at law and in equity other than those which fall within the class of controversies reserved by a particular law for the exclusive jurisdiction of some <em>other forum,\u201d </em>such as the District Court. <em>First Federated Com. Tr. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>272 Md. 329, 335, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974) (Emphasis added). Maryland Rule 16-204 expressly makes the juvenile court part of the family division of the Circuit Courts required to have family divisions. There is no separate Juvenile Court in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>At one time, the juvenile courts in some counties were not part of the Circuit Court, and that <em>did </em>have pure jurisdictional significance, but that is no longer the case. What the Legislature, through a collection of statutes, has effectively done is to designate a part of each Circuit Court as a juvenile court and, with some exceptions, to allocate to that designated part of the Circuit Court the exclusive authority to handle certain kinds of cases involving juveniles. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7\u00a7 3 \u2014 801(i) and 3-8A-01 (i), defining the juvenile court as \u201cthe circuit court for a county sitting as the juvenile court.\u201d In considering that allocation of authority, <em>viv a vis </em>the part or division of the Circuit Court that handles criminal matters, we might want to begin speaking of the role and authority of the criminal and juvenile courts in terms of the proper <em>exercise </em>of the jurisdiction committed to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">That allocation is important and must be honored. It is not just an organizational matter but implements the different procedures and options available in the \u201cjuvenile court\u201d \u2014 that, in delinquency cases, the proceedings are regarded as civil, rather than criminal, that there is no right of jury trial, that there is a much more therapeutic overlay requiring greater coordination with the departments of health, education, social services, and juvenile services, and that the disposition options are quite different from those available in criminal proceedings. Failure to honor this legislative allocation will ordinarily constitute reversible error, but the allocation is not truly a jurisdictional one, at least in the sense that this Court, in recent times, has come to view the concept of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">My second thought proceeds from the first. In allocating authority between the juvenile and criminal courts, the Legislature has committed to the criminal court the initial authority to deal with juveniles who commit certain more grievous offenses. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-8A-03(d). Unless such a case is transferred to the juvenile court pursuant to what is commonly called a \u201creverse waiver\u201d <em>(see </em>Criminal Procedure Article (CP) \u00a7 4-202), the General Assembly has decided, as a general rule, that a juvenile who has allegedly committed one or more of those offenses should be treated as if he or she were an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>adult and not be afforded the more beneficent procedures and options available in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The obvious premise of the 2002 law that enacted CP \u00a7 4-202.2 was that (1) where a juvenile has been charged with offenses described in CJP \u00a7 3-8A-0S(d)(l) or (4) that, subject to any reverse waiver, must be resolved in the criminal court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as lesser related offenses that, subject to waiver by the juvenile court, would ordinarily be resolvable only by the juvenile court, and (2) pursuant to the mandate of \u00a7\u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(1) and (4), those lesser related charges are also submitted to the criminal court, and (3) the \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(l) or (4) offenses have, in some way, been resolved in the juvenile\u2019s favor and the only conviction(s) entered in the criminal court are for one or more of the lesser related offenses, the criminal court should be permitted, in its discretion, to transfer the case to the juvenile court for disposition. Although the lesser related charges have been adjudicated in the criminal court, the criminal court judge may believe that the dispositional options available only in the juvenile court would be more appropriate than those available in the criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In exercising that discretion to transfer the case for disposition, the criminal court judge must consider the five factors set forth in \u00a7 4-202.2(b). For the most part, they are the same factors that the criminal court must consider for an initial reverse waiver under CP \u00a7 4-202 and that a juvenile court must consider for waiver to a criminal court under CJP \u00a7 3-8A-06(e) and include the amenability of the child to treatment in programs available only through juvenile court disposition. It is implicit that the discretion exercised by the criminal court judge, applying those factors, should not then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>be second-guessed by a juvenile court judge, even if, as here, it is the same individual. If the respondent thereafter commits further delinquent acts, which cause a juvenile court judge to conclude that the respondent is no longer amendable to treatment in the juvenile system, the judge may waive jurisdiction with respect to <em>those </em>offenses and send <em>that </em>case to the criminal court. (In this case, those subsequent charges were filed directly in the criminal court because Smith had turned 18 when they were committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Following the approach taken in <em>In re Glenn S., supra, </em>298 Md. 510, 445 A.2d 1029, the Court seems to put this prohibition against second-guessing the decision of the criminal court judge on jurisdictional grounds \u2014 that the juvenile court has no jurisdiction to send the matter back to the criminal court. I prefer to view it as a matter of fairness and proper court administration \u2014 that the juvenile not be bounced back and forth like a ping pong ball in the same case. What is at issue is not really fundamental jurisdiction, which is vested in the Circuit Court, but rather its appropriate exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">I would hold that, once a criminal court judge, after considering the required statutory factors set forth in CJP \u00a7 4\u2014 202.2, rules that the juvenile should have the benefit of the dispositional options available in the juvenile court, that ruling must be respected and not countermanded by a judge exercising the authority of a juvenile court. The statutory authority of the criminal court judge to make that decision, after all, is based on the premise that, had the charges that kept the case out of juvenile court in the first place and that were resolved in the juvenile\u2019s favor not been made, the juvenile court would have been required to deal with disposition in any event, so nothing inappropriate has actually been imposed on the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Finally, and more globally, I suggest that the time may have come for a serious reexamination of whether this dual structure within a single court, beset with exceptions and waivers, continues to serve any useful purpose. The \u201cchildren in need of assistance\u201d (CINA) cases handled in juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>can just as easily be dealt with in the family divisions of the Circuit Court without classifying them as \u201cjuvenile court\u201d cases. The label, I suggest, adds little of practical value. The family divisions already deal with guardianships, adoptions, and child access cases, and the same health, education, and social services now available to the Circuit Court judges who sit as a juvenile court can be made available to the Circuit Court judges who are assigned to the family divisions, without the label of juvenile court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">With respect to delinquency cases, some offenses are placed initially in the criminal court and some in the juvenile court, subject to waivers both ways. If the case is in juvenile court, the child is deprived of a right to a jury trial and, most often, the case is tried by a master rather than a judge, even though a finding of delinquency could result in a significant deprivation of liberty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The posited advantages of a supposedly separate juvenile court, with these deviations, are that (1) there is a relative, but by no means complete, anonymity associated with juvenile court proceedings, which protects the child from the glare of publicity, (2) the child does not receive a criminal record if found delinquent, and (3) dispositions more appropriate to juvenile offenders are available in juvenile court. I question whether those perceived advantages require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>a separate quasi-jurisdictional organizational structure, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Except for the fact that there is no jury in juvenile court and the adjudicator may be a master rather than a judge, the due process protections are essentially the same in both juvenile and criminal proceedings, notwithstanding that delinquency proceedings are regarded as civil rather than criminal. What is the trade-off for denying a child 17 years old the right of jury trial possessed by a child 18 years old? Certainly not anonymity. If the law permits juvenile court proceedings to be closed, or access to them limited, it can permit that degree of confidentiality as well if those cases proceeded in the criminal courts. The name \u201cjuvenile court\u201d is not necessary to allow that kind of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The real, or at least perceived, value of juvenile court in delinquency cases that begin and remain, or are transferred, there are the more therapeutic dispositional options. But the law could just as easily provide those options in the criminal court, including the prospect of expungement or reclassification as a civil infraction if the juvenile successfully completes whatever program is ordered by the court. I see no reason why the criminal courts could not interface with the social service and juvenile service agencies as the juvenile courts do. We now offer special training to judges in the family divisions; similar training could be offered to judges in criminal court who would handle cases involving young offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The concept of the juvenile court as a beneficent alternative to the traditional approach to the treatment of children who commit criminal offenses came about in the 1890s. It was a progressive idea then. But that was a different era. A huge part of our social structure has undergone significant change since then. The stability and even the nature and structure of families are different. The whole social dynamic facing children is different, beginning almost from birth and extending through adolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">We have, at least tacitly, acknowledged those facts by tinkering over the years with the role and the process of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>juvenile court \u2014 by removing whole categories of offenses from its initial reach, subject to waivers back or forth, by imposing most of the due process available in criminal court into its proceedings and thus significantly circumscribing the broad discretion of what once was termed the benevolent Star Chamber, and, in Baltimore City and most of the metropolitan counties, by committing a large role to masters rather than judges. Yet we hold firm to the 19th Century structure, with its quasi-jurisdictional but amorphous circumference, which may well be outdated. It may be time to step back and take another look, to focus more substantively on the role that the courts, in collaboration with other agencies, should play (and have the resources to play) in these cases rather than on an antique legislatively-created label, or pigeonhole, that may serve to limit useful flexibility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">. CJP \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(l) excludes from the juvenile court a child 14 years old or older who is alleged to have committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment and all other charges arising out of the same incident. Section 3-8A-03 (d)(4) excludes a child 16 years old or older who is alleged to have committed any of 17 offenses listed in that subsection, which are sex offenses or offenses involving other forms of violence or weapons, and all other charges arising out of the same incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\">. At one time, a significant part of the juvenile court caseload were \"children in need of supervision\u201d \u2014 children who may have committed some minor offenses but whose real problem was that they were out of effective control by their parents. They were disobedient, they were often truant from school, they stayed out late, they were beginning to get into trouble. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-8A-01(e). That category of child\u2014 somewhat midway between the CI\u00d1A and the delinquent \u2014 is now a backwater of juvenile court cases. It may be time to look more closely at it and perhaps expand it somewhat, as it could provide a better focus for services and help. I expect that the family divisions of the Circuit Courts can deal with those children at least as well as the juvenile courts once did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. It is true that, following a finding of delinquency by a master, the law permits a juvenile to have a <em>de novo </em>trial before a judge upon exceptions filed within a rather limited period of time. We do not permit that kind of procedure in criminal court, even in relatively minor misdemeanor cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
