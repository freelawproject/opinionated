The appellee, Maryland State Board of Elections (\u201cthe State Board\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Code (2003) \u00a7 6-203<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Law Article (\u201cEL\u201d), invalidated 5,631 of the 15,094 signatures that were affixed to the nominating petition. Because, as a result, the petition fell short of the requisite 10,000 signatures by 537 signatures, the State Board did not certify the new party and, consequently, Mr. Nader\u2019s name was not to be placed on the ballot in the 2004 Presidential Election. It was stipulated that 542 of the invalidated signatures were invalidated solely on the basis that the signers, who were registered voters in the State, were registered in a county other than the one specified on the sheets they signed; they signed the petition sheet for the \u201cwrong county.\u201d <em>See </em>EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2), <em>supra. </em>The sole issue presented, therefore, is whether, when the signatories are otherwise eligible to vote in this State, the State Board\u2019s invalidation of those 542 \u201cwrong county\u201d signatures was proper. We shall hold that Maryland Code (2003) \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) of the Election Law Article is invalid as applied in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Accordingly, the State Board improperly rejected the 542 petition signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">This Court has held that \u201cthe Maryland Constitution sets forth the <em>exclusive </em>qualifications and restrictions on the right to vote in the State of Maryland.\u201d <em>Maryland Green Party v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>Bd. of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 152, 832 A.2d 214, 229 (2003). <em>See also State Admin. Bd. of Election v. Bd. of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City, </em>342 Md. 586, 599, 679 A.2d. 96, 102 (1996) (\u201cThese prerequisites [Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4] are the exclusive qualifications for voting in Maryland\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Norris, </em>173 Md. 579, 595, 195 A. 576, 584 (1937) (\u201c[T]he qualifications for the exercise of the elective franchise are [] prescribed by section 1 of article 1 of the Constitution.... \u201d); <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 239, 24 A. 606, 607 (1892) (Bryan, J., concurring) (\u201cThe qualifications of the voter are prescribed in the first article of the constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution confers upon any citizen of the United States, age eighteen or older, who is a resident of the state of Maryland, and who is not disqualified pursuant to Article I, \u00a7 4, <em>infra, </em>the right to vote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">\u201cAll elections shall be by ballot. Every citizen of the United States, of the age of 18 years or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which he resides at all elections to be held in this State. <em>A person once entitled to vote in any election district, shall be entitled to vote there until he shall have acquired a residence in another election district or ward in this State.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">(Emphasis added). This right also is embodied in Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201cThat the right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best security of liberty and the foundation of all free Government; for this purpose, elections ought to be free and frequent; and <em>every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">(Emphasis added). It is one of, if not, the most important and \u201cfundamental right[s] granted to Maryland citizens as members of a free society.\u201d <em>Liddy v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 233, 253, 919 A.2d 1276, 1290 (2007); <em>Kemp, </em>76 Md. at 241, 24 A. at 608 (\u201cThe elective franchise is the highest right of the citizen, and the spirit of our institutions requires that every opportunity should be afforded for its fair and free exercise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">As outlined in Article I, \u00a7 1, once an individual is entitled to vote in the election district where he or she resides, that individual remains entitled to vote in that district \u201cuntil he [or she] shall have acquired a residence in another election district or ward----\u201d As we explained in <em>Green Party, </em>\u201ca qualified voter who moves from one residence to another <em>within </em>the same election district remains fully qualified [to vote in that district.] ... [A] qualified voter who may be in the process of moving <em>from one district into another </em>remains qualified to vote in his or her <em>original district </em>until the change in domicile is fully effective.\u201d 377 Md. at 141-42, 832 A.2d at 222 (emphasis added). This is to say, an individual\u2019s entitlement to vote is not extinguished merely based on a change in residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Article I, \u00a7 2 of the Maryland Constitution mandates that the General Assembly provide \u201cfor a <em>uniform </em>Registration of the names of all voters in this State, <em>who possess the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>qualifications </em>prescribed in [Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4],\u201d and that that Registration \u201cshall be <em>conclusive evidence </em>... of the right of every person ... to vote at <em>any </em>election thereafter held in this State.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). Thus, Article I, \u00a7 2, imposes certain limitations on the General Assembly, and, in effect, the State Board, when it comes to the creation and management of the State\u2019s voter registry. Precisely, and pertinent to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Legislature has \u201cno discretion to decide who may or may not be listed [on the state\u2019s registry.]\u201d <em>Green Party, </em>377 Md. at 142-43, 832 A.2d at 223. In other words, the uniform, statewide registry is the official registry of who qualifies to vote in this State, and, thus, who qualifies to sign a nominating petition. Without affirmative proof that the individual is not a registered voter listed on the State registry, whether due to his or her failure to register or disqualification under Article I, \u00a7 4, the State Board is not permitted by law to disqualify any individual from exercising his or her right of suffrage.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Finally, Article I, \u00a7 4 sets out the specific perimeters of the disqualification of an individual from the right to vote in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the Constitution, there are only two instances in which an individual otherwise qualified to vote may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>be denied the right to vote: (1) if the person is \u201cconvicted of an infamous or other serious crime\u201d or (2) if the person is \u201cunder care or guardianship for a mental disability.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Constitution does not require, and, thus, does not allow for the disqualification of voters, otherwise qualified to vote, on any other basis. Although one is required to vote in his or her own election district or ward, one is not required to be registered on a specific, separate county list in order to be able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">In order to become a statutorily-recognized political party in Maryland, a party must file a petition, on or before the first Monday in August of a presidential election year, that bears, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe signatures of at least 10,000 registered voters who are eligible to vote in the State as of the first day of the month in which the petition is submitted.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>petition, moreover, must satisfy the general petition requirements of Title 6 of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For instance, pursuant to EL \u00a7 6 \u2014 201(c)(3), each signature page is required to contain \u201ca statement, to which each signer subscribes, that: (i) the signer supports the purpose of [the] petition process; and (ii) based on the signer\u2019s information and belief, the signer is a registered voter in the county specified on the page and is eligible to have his or her signature counted[.]\u201d In addition, \u201ca space for the name of the county in which each of the signers of that page is a registered voter\u201d is required. EL \u00a7 6-201 (c)(5). If the voter is not a registered voter in the county specified on the signature page that bears his or her signature, the State Board will not, pursuant to EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2), validate or count the petition signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">The State Board\u2019s validation and counting process begins with the receipt of a party\u2019s petition, including all signature sheets. The State Board disseminates the signature sheets to the appropriate corresponding local board of elections (\u201cLBE\u201d) to be counted. Each LBE checks the signatures on the signature sheets against its list of registered county voters. If a name on a signature sheet is not on its list, the signature is invalidated. That is true regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the name is on the list of another LBE or the person can be verified as being registered in another county. When the count is complete, each LBE completes a summary, containing the number of valid and invalid signatures, which is returned to the State Board. Each LBE also returns to the State Board, with the summary, copies of the signature pages, including any pertinent notations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Based on the summaries from the LBEs, the State Board determines the sufficiency of the petition, whether it should be certified. EL \u00a7 6-208(a)(l) prescribes, \u201c[a]t the conclusion of the verification and counting processes, the chief election official of the election authority shall ... determine whether the validated signatures contained in the petition are sufficient to satisfy all requirements established by law relating to the number and geographical distribution of signatures.\u201d If it is determined that all legal requirements have been met, the election official shall \u201ccertify the sufficiency of the petition[.]\u201d EL \u00a7 6-208(b)(2). If, however, the petition is determined to be deficient, for any reason, including but not limited to the lack of the requisite number of signatures, the election official shall \u201cimmediately notify the sponsor [of the petition] of that determination, including any specific deficiencies found.\u201d EL \u00a7 6-208(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">On August 2, 2004,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Populist Party (\u201cthe Party\u201d) filed a petition seeking certification of its party, as well as of its presidential candidate. Affixed to the petition were signature sheets, broken down by county, purporting to contain the signatures of 14,991 registered voters.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The State Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>disseminated the signature pages to the applicable county boards for verification.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On August 23, 2004, in accordance with EL \u00a7 6-210,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Director of the Election Management Division of the State Board (\u201cthe Director\u201d) notified the Party that 5,631 of its petition signatures had been invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">On August 27, 2004, Nader for President filed an action, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking, pursuant to EL \u00a7\u00a7 6-209 and 6-210(e),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> expedited judicial review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>State Board\u2019s determination and \u201cdeclaratory judgment holding that more than 536 signatures invalidated by the Board should have been counted and certified.\u201d In addition, the appellants sought declaratory judgment that their \u201ccivil rights [had] been violated[,]\u201d $300,000 in damages, along with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and \u201c[s]uch other and further relief as the case may require, including all court orders necessary to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.\u201d The State Board moved to dismiss the action, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. At a pretrial conference on September 8, 2004, the appellants, plaintiffs below, abandoned their monetary damages claim, and the parties stipulated that the single, dispositive issue in the case was whether Nader for President\u2019s petition should have been certified as sufficient. On that issue, the appellants asserted that the State Board was required, under the Maryland Constitution, in the case of registered voters, \u201cto validate the signatures of individuals that appeared on a signature page for a county other than the county in which they were registered.\u201d The appellee countered, citing EL \u00a7 6 \u2014 203(b)(2), which, as noted earlier, in its application, provides for the disqualification of a signature if it and the signer\u2019s address do not correspond, <em>i.e. </em>both are not located in the county specified at the top of the petition signature page.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">A hearing was held in the Circuit Court on September 13, 2004. At the hearing, it was established that the State Board had compiled a computerized list of all registered voters in the State and that a disk with those individuals\u2019 names was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>available to the public.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The computer disk, however, did not contain a \u201csearchable database\u201d of registered voters on a county-by-county basis and was not officially available to the LBEs. Instead, the information on the disk was made available to the LBEs on a state-sponsored \u201cintranet,\u201d which they could access through computer terminals, using a software program, \u201cPower Profile.\u201d Nonetheless, some LBEs did not have access to the software program because of budget constraints that prevented the State Board from providing such access to them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The appellants argued that the State Board\u2019s failure to use the statewide list of voters to verify the signatures on its petition was not rational. There was no reason, in the appellants\u2019 opinion, that the State Board should have allowed the LBEs to disqualify voters solely on the basis that they signed in the \u201cwrong county\u201d when the use of the database could have identified those individuals as registered voters in other counties in the State. The appellants contended, in addition, that the State Board\u2019s processes, as outlined in both the Election Law Article and the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCO-MAR\u201d), were unconstitutional. In short, the appellants maintained that, under the system used by the State Board, voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>were disenfranchised, unreasonably and unnecessarily so.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The appellee, the State Board, did not agree. The Director testified that the procedure in place, <em>i.e. </em>the dissemination of signature pages to the individual LBEs, was the most effective way to count the signatures, considering that some of the LBEs could not access the statewide voter list, not having use of the required computer software. Although the state database was an alternative means of verifying signatures, the Director made clear that its use was not prohibited by any law; it simply was not the most efficient way of counting the signatures and, thus, determining the sufficiency of the petition. The State Board\u2019s main argument, however, was that the use of the database could result in a single voter being \u201cverified\u201d more than once if that voter signed petitions in multiple counties and each county\u2019s LBE verified the name on the database as opposed to its own list. In sum, the State Board\u2019s argument was that in permitting the LBEs to certify only their own resident vot\u00e9rs, potential issues, such as voter mistake and voter fraud, could be avoided.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The Circuit Court issued its order the following day, rejecting the appellants\u2019 arguments and declaring that the \u201ccounty-match\u201d requirement, set forth in EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) and CO-MAR sec. 33.06.05.01.A,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was constitutional and not violative of the appellants\u2019 rights. The court articulated the issue as being:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-5\">\u201cDid defendant\u2019s rejection of signatures by registered voters, who signed plaintiffs\u2019 petition under the \u2018wrong\u2019 county heading, pursuant to Maryland Code, Election Law Art., sec. 6-203(b), violate the Maryland State Constitution?,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A60\">and, answering that question in the negative, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-6\">\u201c[T]he state constitution itself provides restrictions upon registered voters\u2019 exercise of their franchise in a county other than that of their residence. Therefore, this Court finds that the Maryland General Assembly had a rational basis consistent with the state constitution to include this restriction in sec. 6-203 of the Election Law and that the State Board of Elections had a rational basis to include it in the petition verification system of COMAR, sec. 33.06.05.01.A. This restriction has the common sense benefit of preventing a voter from improper exercise of his or her franchise in more than one county for the same electoral purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-7\">On the issue of the statewide database, the Circuit Court opined:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-8\">\u201cWhen the applicable statutory provisions most recently were adopted, the State Election Board did not have the capacity to perform a timely, statewide computer database <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>search of a list of registered voter. If the capacity now has been created, this should not cause the existing statutory provision instantly to become unconstitutional and force the State Election Board administratively to rewrite all petition verification procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">\u201cThe State of Maryland has a rational basis for establishing deadlines in relation to election filings, so as to avoid last-minute ballot chaos. Thus, the difficulty created by plaintiffs [appellants] for themselves through last-minute petition filings does not constitute a violation of their rights by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Nader for President noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court, on its own motion, issued a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in that court. <em>Nader for President 2004 v. Maryland State Bd. of Elections, </em>383 Md. 215, 858 A.2d 483 (2004). Oral argument was heard on September 20, 2004, and, on that same day, the Court issued its Order reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanding the case to that court with directions to enter a judgment declaring EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) invalid.

This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green Party </em>offers significant guidance as to the standard of review to be applied in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In that case, the petitioners, the Green Party, a minor political party, sought to nominate a candidate for the November 2000 election for the United States House of Representatives in Maryland\u2019s first congressional district. At the time, the State Board had set forth three methods for a political party to nominate its candidate\u2014 by primary, by convention, and by petition. The Green Party\u2019s options were limited to a double-petition requirement, it not being a \u201cprincipal political party.\u201d 377 Md. at 137, 832 A.2d at 220. The petitioners sought declaratory relief, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>the constitutionality of the statutory limitation on \u201cinactive voters,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>the State Board\u2019s disqualification of the Green Party\u2019s nomination petition signatures based on voters being placed on an \u201cinactive list.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held such disqualification to be inconsistent with the Maryland Constitution. 377 Md. at 139, 832 A.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">In <em>Green Party, </em>this Court recognized that laws that affect candidates, and the parties which nominate them, \u201calways have at least some theoretical, correlative effect on voters.\u201d 377 Md. at 162, 832 A.2d at 235, <em>quoting Goodsell, </em>284 Md. at 287, 396 A.2d at 1037.

To begin, the appellants cite Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, <em>supra. </em>They proffer that it \u201chas been held to be even more protective of rights of political participation than the provisions of the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Green Party, 377 </em>Md. at 150, 832 A.2d at 228; <em>See also Munsell v. Hennegan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>182 Md. 15, 22, 31 A.2d 640, 644 (1943) (\u201c[Ejectors should have the fullest opportunity to vote for candidates of any political party, and while this right ... may be restricted by the dictates of common sense, and by [other] considerations ... such restrictions will not be upheld when they are destructive of freedom of choice by the voters\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Norris, supra, </em>173 Md. at 601, 195 A. at 587, <em>quoting People v. President, etc., of Wappingers Falls, </em>144 N.Y. 616, 620, 39 N.E. 641, 642 (1895) (\u201c[The] Constitution confers upon every citizen meeting the requirements specified therein the right to vote at elections for all offices that are elective by the people, and there is no power in the legislature to take away the right so conferred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The appellants also assert that Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution protects the elective franchise and that Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights, through its implied concept of equal protection, <em>see State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, supra, </em>342 Md. at 595 n. 6, 679 A.2d at 100 n. 6, and cases cited therein, limits the power of the legislature to interfere with voters\u2019 participation in elections. Captioned, \u201cDue Process,\u201d Article 24 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFu\">\u201cThat no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">More specifically, the appellants submit that EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) \u201cimposes a far more restrictive definition of a qualified voter than the one contained in the Maryland Constitution because it only permits an individual to vote if his residence address agrees with the rolls of the Board of Elections.\u201d Relying on <em>Green Party, </em>the appellants posit that a voter, in order to exercise his or her right to vote, is only obligated to show up on election day at his or her domicile and that \u201cthe Maryland Constitution does not require anything more from [that] voter....\u201d 377 Md. at 143, 832 A.2d at 223. That the voter must ensure that his or her address corresponds with that of the State Board\u2019s rolls, in order for his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>signature to be counted for purposes of the petition certification process is, according to the appellants, unduly burdensome not only to the voters, but to the Party\u2019s ability to collect the required signatures. Further, the appellants, citing <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, supra, </em>assert that their collection of more than 10,000 signatures should be all that is required in a presidential campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The appellee, on the other hand, claims that EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) is, as noted earlier, both reasonable and nondiseriminatory, and, further, is in accordance with the residency requirements embodied in the Constitution. It denies that \u201cthe General Assembly has [] imposed additional qualifications or restrictions upon the right to vote by requiring voters to sign petitions with reference to the county in which they are registered.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the appellee asserts that it did exactly what was prescribed under EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) and that it was not required to do anything else. Once it is determined that a voter is not on the reviewing county\u2019s list, the LBE for that county is required to invalidate the signature. Identifying, either by the address itself or by using the statewide database, another county in which the subject signatory is registered to vote is not required, according to the appellee, and neither is the effort to do so. The appellee argues that EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2)\u2019s prohibition against counting the signatures of voters not registered in the county that corresponds with the signature sheet upon which the signature is found pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>vents the counting of a single signature more than once, and, even more important, prevents voter fraud.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The appellants counter that the unconstitutionality of \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) \u201cderives from the lack of notice and inability to cure the problem prior to the voter being disenfranchised.\u201d While acknowledging the State\u2019s interest in preventing voter fraud, the appellants contend that the signers of a petition are not afforded the same protections as are voters in a general election. They analogize the petition nomination process to the actual casting of a ballot in an election, noting that a voter whose address does not correspond with the State Board\u2019s roll is not refused the right to vote. Instead the voter is given the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which is counted, if the address, and, thus, the right to vote, is later verified. The same procedural safeguard, the appellants insist, should be accorded the petition process, particularly since most of the LBEs have access to the statewide database which they could use to verify \u201cwrong county\u201d signatures.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The appellee, as did the Circuit Court, rejects the argument made by the appellants that the statewide database should have been used, simply because it was available. When the predecessor to EL \u00a7 6-203,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was adopted, it points out, no statewide database was in existence which would have permitted the State Board to perform a timely, statewide search of a list of registered voters. Therefore, the appellee submits, this technological advance, making it possible to verify signatures in a manner other than that prescribed in COMAR sec. 33.06.05.01.A, <em>supra, </em>should not result in the invalidation of that procedure. And its present existence does not render the pre-existing procedure unreasonable. Adopting the Circuit Court\u2019s reasoning and citing potential problems the use of the statewide database could cause, given its condition at the time, the different software that was used by the various boards, and the availability, or lack, of computer terminals at different LBEs, the State Board argued that use of the statewide database would be unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">With the pertinent constitutional provisions in mind, we turn now to the specific arguments of the parties. To begin, it is important to note that this Court has indeed equated the nominating petition process to voting in this State. In <em>Green Party, </em>we recognized that \u201cif the only method left open for the members of a political party to choose their candidates is via petition, then the right to have one\u2019s signature counted on a nominating petition is integral to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>that political party member\u2019s right of suffrage.\u201d 377 Md. at 151, 832 A.2d at 228. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>as noted earlier, Nader for President was <em>required </em>to complete the nominating petition process in order both to become a statutorily-recognized political party and to nominate its candidate for the presidency of the United States. We agree with the appellants that the same procedural safeguards should have been afforded to them that were, and continue to be, afforded to voters who cast ballots in an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The State Board, as did the Circuit Court, erroneously relies on Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. It analogizes that provision\u2019s proscription of voting outside of the voter\u2019s district to a voter signing a petition in the \u201cwrong county.\u201d Based on that analogy, it asserts that no additional qualification or restrictions were imposed on voters. To be sure, the voters disqualified by the LBEs, and, thus, the State Board, were <em>qualified </em>registered voters in this State.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The procedure for certifying the petition, stripped those qualified, registered voters of their right to be counted as valid petition signers by disqualifying their signatures merely because the signatures were on a petition for a county in which they were not registered, a \u201cwrong county\u201d sheet. An individual who signs a party\u2019s petition, regardless of whether the signature was on the correct \u201ccounty\u201d sheet, enjoys the same protections of his or her right to suffrage under the Maryland Constitution as any voter casting a ballot on election day. Just as an individual is protected under the Constitution from having his or her right to suffrage restricted by burdensome statutes, one who signs a petition in support of a candidate, should not find \u201chis or her right to take part in the nomination process curtailed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The State Board, in effect, imposed an additional requirement on petition signers by requiring them, for their signatures to be validated, to be registered in the county whose petition they signed, in addition to appearing on the official statewide list of registered voters. Thus, the State Board, through its validation and counting processes, improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>invalidated the \u201cwrong county\u201d signatures of 542 otherwise qualified voters. As a result, those voters\u2019 right of suffrage was infringed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">We also agree with the appellants that the \u201ccounty-match\u201d requirement is unduly burdensome to the signers of the petitions, as well as to the Party itself. This is particularly so where a presidential campaign is involved. As the Supreme Court of the United States recognized in <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>a \u201c[s]tate has a less important interest in regulating Presidential elections than statewide or local elections, because the outcome of the former will be largely determined by voters beyond the State\u2019s boundaries.\u201d 460 U.S. 780, 795, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 1573, 75 L.Ed.2d 547, 561 (1983). In that case, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional a statute requiring an independent candidate for the office of the President of the United States to file nominating petitions early in order to appear on the general election ballot. 460 U.S. at 786, 103 S.Ct. at 1568, 75 L.Ed.2d at 556. The <em>Anderson </em>Court noted that such a requirement burdened the voting and associational rights of the supporters of the candidate. 460 U.S. at 806,103 S.Ct. at 1579, 75 L.Ed.2d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the \u201ccounty-match\u201d requirement was not necessary. The nominating petition was for a statewide office, and, thus, the specific county in which a voter was registered was irrelevant. The appellants are correct when they assert that the fact that they obtained the required number of Maryland voters\u2019 signatures, 10,000, entitled them to have their petition certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">In the same vein, we conclude that the State Board\u2019s literal, narrow reading of EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2) is troublesome. As stated earlier, the State Board posits that the LBEs were not required to do anything other that what they did \u2014 invalidate any signatures that were not on their rolls. This Court rejects the State Board\u2019s approach. It is clear that the verification of the 542 disqualified signatures was not particularly burdensome for the State Board when contrasted with the effect that invalidation of those signatures could have, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>consequently did have, on the appellants. Those 542 signatures were determinative; without them, the appellants were unable to be certified and recognized as a political party and was not able to nominate a candidate to be placed on the general election ballot. Moreover, that the State Board was able to determine that the 542 signatures at issue were not duplicates does not help its argument. It, in fact, only proves that what the State Board contended was \u201cunworkable\u201d at oral argument, was very possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Even if this Court assumes, <em>arguendo, </em>as the appellee would urge us to do, that the use of the statewide database was unworkable or problematic, what would have stopped one LBE from notifying another LBE of an obvious wrong signature? That is to say, if a voter signed the petition signature sheet for Baltimore County, for whatever reason, but his or her address was clearly in Harford County, why could the incorrect LBE not contact the correct LBE in order to verify the signature? This would have allowed the correct LBE to check its records and determine not only whether the individual was, in fact, a resident of that county, but also whether that individual\u2019s signature had already been counted for purposes of the nominating petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Moreover, the State Board\u2019s processes did not allow for any checks or balances once the petitions were sent to the LBEs. The State Board did not, in any way, monitor what the LBEs did, relying solely on the summaries that the LBEs sent back when their counting was done. Although the State Board received copies of the signatures sheets with the various notations on them, it admitted to relying only on the summaries. There was, then, no way for the State Board to know if the LBEs had made any errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The State Board\u2019s argument that the availability of the state database should not render EL \u00a7 6 \u2014 203(b)(2) unconstitutional is likewise unavailing. It is not disputed that, when certain provisions of the Election Law Article were adopted, a statewide database was not available to check for registered voters and that the database was a fairly new development at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>time of the case <em>sub judice. </em>The fact is, however, that the statewide database was a resource that the State Board could have used, and obviously did use to verify the 542 signatures as belonging to Maryland voters, albeit in counties other than the one whose petition they signed. It should have been used to prevent the disenfranchisement of hundreds of voters. Indeed, this Court has held in <em>Norris v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 675, 192 A. 531, 535 (1937), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-4\">\u201c[W]hile the principles of the constitution are unchangeable, in interpreting the language by which they are expressed, it will be given a meaning which will permit the application of those principles <em>to changes in the economic, social, and political life of the people, which the framers did not and could not foresee. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">(Emphasis added). <em>See also Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 632, 887 A.2d 525, 535 (2005); <em>Boyer v. Thurston, </em>247 Md. 279, 292, 231 A.2d 50, 57 (1967); <em>Johns Hopkins University v. Williams, </em>199 Md. 382, 386, 86 A.2d 892, 894 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In <em>Norris, </em>we examined the language of Article I, \u00a7 1, as we do in the instant case, although for a different purpose. In that case, the constitutionality of the provision that \u201c[a]U elections shall be held by ballot\u201d was challenged by opponents of the use of voting machines. The opponents argued that the use of voting machines conflicted with Article I, \u00a7 1 because the term \u201cballot\u201d could not include voting machines, as such machines did not exist at the time of Article I, \u00a7 l\u2019s adoption. <em>Norris </em>is analogous. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the statewide database was an improvement in technology, as were the voting machines in <em>Norris, </em>that, in effect, facilitated the voting process. It replaced an aspect of the nominating petition process, <em>i.e. </em>the State Board\u2019s validation and counting procedures, while leaving the overall scheme intact. The use of the statewide database is consistent with Article I, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution which calls for a uniform system of voter registry, while, it at the same time, satisfies the interests of the State Board. Unlike the \u201ccounty-match\u201d requirement, the statewide database did not in any way change the overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>scheme of the nominating petition process as it only served as an alternative, and in the instant case a more effective, method by which the State Board could verify signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">To be sure, we do not deny that the State Board\u2019s interest in the case <em>sub judice </em>is compelling. It is clear that in order for there to be a fair and honest implementation of the elective franchise, regulations must be in place. Those regulations, however, cannot, as previously stated, be inconsistent with the protections afforded under the Constitution. It is evident that the State Board\u2019s \u201ccounty-match\u201d requirement, as prescribed by EL \u00a7 6-203(b)(2), cannot be squared with the constitutional provisions on voter qualification and registration. Specifically, there is no provision in the Constitution requiring, for purposes of the petition process, the signers of petitions to be broken down by county, failing which the signatories are disqualified. Therefore, the disenfranchisement of voters solely based on a \u201ccounty-match\u201d requirement is inconsistent with Article I of the Maryland Constitution, as well as with Articles 7 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">It is for the foregoing reasons that we reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">RAKER, HARRELL and GREENE, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-13\">.

SBE maintains that \u00a7 6-203 unambiguously provides that SBE may count only the signature of voters who are registered to vote in the county specified on the applicable signature page, and that for Nader for President to prevail, it must show that \u00a7 6-203 of the Election Law Article is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">I agree with SBE\u2019s position that \u00a7 6-203 is reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and accomplishes a legitimate governmental objective. The asserted purpose underlying the statutory requirement prohibiting the counting of signatures of voters who are not registered in the county is to prevent counting a single voter\u2019s signature more than once. SBE explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">\u201cFor example, if a registered voter signed a petition for each of the 24 counties, his or her signature would, under \u00a7 6-203, only be validated by the board of the county in which the voter resides. If Nader for President\u2019s scheme was adopted, the same registered voter\u2019s signature could be counted again by every LBE with adequate access to the State database. Preventing the real possibility of multiple counting and voter or petition gatherer fraud is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>an important regulatory interest that justifies the incidental limitation imposed by \u00a7 6-203.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">As the Circuit Court noted, the availability of a state-wide database should not cause the existing statutory provision instantly to become unconstitutional and to force SBE to administratively rewrite all petition verification procedures. The remedy is with the Legislature, not a declaration from this Court that the statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Judge HARRELL and Judge GREENE have authorized me to state that they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-11\">. It appears as though the Circuit Court based its decision also upon the doctrine of laches. In holding that \u00a7 6-203 was constitutional, the Circuit Court went on to state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-12\">\"The procedural problems created by \u2018wrong county\u2019 signatures were problems which could have been cured by advance determinations as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>to the petitions, if plaintiffs requested this earlier (Md.Code, Election Law Art., sec. 6-202), or by supplemental petitions, if plaintiffs arranged such filings earlier <em>(Id., </em>sec.6-205). The State of Maryland has a rational basis for establishing deadlines in relation to election filings, so as to avoid last-minute ballot chaos. Thus, the difficulty created by plaintiffs for themselves through last-minute petition filings does not constitute a violation of their rights by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQi\">Because the Maryland State Board of Elections did not argue laches before this Court, I will not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
