The respondent also sought an injunction restraining \u201cthe County Council and Harford County\u201d from implementing the resolution. Various grounds were set forth which assertedly warranted the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The defendants then answered the complaint, and the plaintiff-respondent filed a motion for summary judgment. Thereafter memoranda of law, affidavits, and other documents were filed, and the circuit court held hearings extending over two days. On October 10, 1990, the circuit court filed an extensive opinion and order which granted the respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and which declared, <em>inter alia, </em>that the County Council \u201cdid not have the authority to pass\u201d the resolution on May 8, 1990, \u201cthat the Council erred by reconsidering\u201d the prior decision which had placed the respondent\u2019s proposed landfill in the County\u2019s Solid Waste Management Plan, and that the May 8th resolution was \u201cvoid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On October 30,1990, the eight individual adjacent property owners filed a notice of appeal, and on November 9,1990, the \u201cCounty Council\u201d filed a notice of appeal. The defendant \u201cHarford County\u201d did not file a notice of appeal. The individual property owners and the \u201cCounty Council\u201d filed briefs in the Court of Special Appeals and participated in the oral argument before that court. Harford County neither filed a brief nor participated in the oral argument. The Court of Special Appeals, in an extensive opinion dealing with numerous issues, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Harford County. <em>Holmes v. MRA, </em>90 Md.App. 120, 600 A.2d 864 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">A single petition for a writ of certiorari was filed in this Court by \u201cthe County Council of Harford County,\u201d which was represented by a private law firm in Baltimore City. The individual adjacent property owners, who were defendants in the circuit court and appellants in the Court of Special Appeals, did not join in the County Council\u2019s peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tion, did not file a separate petition for a writ of certiorari, and did not file any other document in this Court. Nothing was filed in this Court on behalf of Harford County or by the Harford County Department of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">This Court on June 15, 1992, granted the County Council\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>County Council v. Maryland Reclamation, </em>327 Md. 55, 607 A.2d 564 (1992). At oral argument before us, the matter of the County Council\u2019s right to seek appellate review in this Court was raised and explored. As we have determined that the County Council is not entitled to obtain appellate review in this case, and as there are no other parties seeking appellate review in this Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we shall dismiss the writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>County Council v. Supervisor, </em>274 Md. 116, 332 A.2d 897 (1975), the County Council of Montgomery County filed appeals to the Maryland Tax Court from decisions of the Appeal Tax Court for Montgomery County, and the Maryland Tax Court dismissed the County Council\u2019s appeals. Upon further appeal to this Court, we upheld the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal. In an opinion by Judge Smith on behalf of the Court, we first reviewed the provisions of Art. XI-A of the Maryland Constitution relating to charter home rule counties. We pointed out that in a charter county, it is the executive or \u201cpresident\u201d and the council together that constitutes the corporate body which is the successor to the former county commissioners and which is the equivalent of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. The Court thus explained (274 Md. at 123, 332 A.2d at 900-901):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u201cWhen one considers the fact that at the time of the adoption of Art. XI-A the corporate name of the City of Baltimore was \u2018Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,\u2019 that by the provisions of Art. 25, \u00a7 1 county commissioners of each county are \u2018declared to be a corporation,\u2019 that one would hardly expect to call the chief executive officer of a county \u2018mayor,\u2019 and the words \u2018President and County Council\u2019 are an approximation of \u2018Mayor of Baltimore and City Council of the City of Baltimore,\u2019 it becomes obvious to us that the intent of the framers of the amendment was to refer to the county in its corporate capacity, by whatever name it might ultimately be known upon the adoption of a charter. Accordingly, we conclude that it is the corporate entity of Montgomery County, Maryland, so known in its charter, which is vested with the right of appeal ... in lieu of the prior corporate entity, the County Commissioners of Montgomery County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We went on to hold that the County Council had no right to appeal, stating <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cFor purposes of this opinion we need go no further than to say that it is necessary that the appeal be maintained in the name of the corporate entity. Since the County Council is not the corporate entity, an appeal may not be maintained in its name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>See also County Exec. v. Supervisor, 275 </em>Md. 392, 393 n. 1, 340 A.2d 246, 247 n. 1 (1975); <em>Mont. Co. Council v. Supervisor, 275 </em>Md. 339, 342, 340 A.2d 302, 304 (1975); Charter of Harford County, Maryland, \u00a7\u00a7 103, 904.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>County Council v. Supervisor, supra, </em>would appear to be dispositive with regard to the Harford County Council\u2019s right to seek appellate review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">There are exceptions to the general rule that an appeal on behalf of a charter county, such as Harford County, is to be maintained in the county\u2019s corporate name, or at least by the executive and council together, but not by the county council alone. For example, where a valid statutory or charter provision makes a county council the sole agency for performing a function or resolving a matter, or provides that the county council may be a party in litigation with respect to the matter, then the county council may be an appropriate party to appeal or to petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>See, e.g., Co. Council v. Carl M. Freeman Assoc., </em>281 Md. 70, 376 A.2d 860 (1977); <em>County Council v. District Land, </em>274 Md. 691, 337 A.2d 712 (1975); <em>Montgomery Co. Council v. Summers, </em>274 Md. 110, 332 A.2d 646 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">During oral argument before us in the present case, it was suggested on behalf of the Harford County Council that the provisions of Maryland Code (1982,1987 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-501 through 9-521 of the Environment Article, authorize the \u201cCounty Council\u201d itself to adopt, review, revise and amend Harford County\u2019s Solid Waste Management Plan. Sections 9-501 through 9-521 of the Environment Article relate to \u201cCounty Plans\u201d providing for, <em>inter alia, </em>solid waste disposal systems, solid waste acceptance facilities, and collection and disposal of solid waste. According to the Harford County Council, the Harford County Solid Waste Management Plan was adopted \u201cpursuant to [these] state statutory requirements currently set forth in Title 9 of the Environment Article of the Annotated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Code of Maryland\u201d (petitioner\u2019s brief, p. 2). If these provisions of state law were to authorize the Harford County Council itself to adopt or amend the County\u2019s Solid Waste Management Plan, then the County Council arguably would be an appropriate entity to appeal or petition for certiorari on behalf of Harford County.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Sections 9-501 through 9-521 of the Environment Article, however, do not authorize a county council itself to adopt or amend a county\u2019s solid waste management plan. Instead, the authority is repeatedly granted to the \u201ccounty governing body\u201d or the \u201cgoverning body of [the] county.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 9-501(k) (\u201c \u2018Proposed county plan\u2019 means a county plan that: (i) Has been adopted by the county governing body ... \u201d); \u00a7 9-503(b) (\u201ceach county governing body shall review its county plan at least once every 2 years ...\u201d); \u00a7 9-503(c) (\u201cEach county governing body shall adopt and submit to the Department a revision or amendment to its county plan if: (1) The governing body considers a revision or amendment necessary ...\u201d); \u00a7 9-503(d); \u00a7 9-504(b) (relates to a \u201csubsidiary plan\u201d adopted by \u201cthe governing body of each county\u201d); \u00a7 9-505(e)(1); \u00a7 9-507(a) (refers to the submission by \u201ca county governing body\u201d of its proposed plan to the Department); \u00a7 9-507(e) (deals with the \u201c[effect of county plans after adoption by county governing body\u201d). Section 9-514, specifically dealing with the \u201ccounty plan in Harford County,\u201d refers to the approval of the plan by \u201cthe Harford County governing body\u201d and refers to other action regarding the plan to be taken by \u201cthe Harford County governing body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Department of the Environment regulations implementing \u00a7\u00a7 9-501 through 9-521 expressly define \u201cgoverning body\u201d in a charter county to mean the \u201cCounty Executive and Council.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 26.03.03.01B(4) (\u201c \u2018Governing body\u2019 means the Board of County Commissioners, or the County Executive and Council, or the Mayor and City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Council of Baltimore\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also County Council v. Supervisor, supra, </em>274 Md. at 121-123, 332 A.2d at 899-901; Charter of Harford County, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 103, 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Consequently, \u00a7\u00a7 9-501 through 9-521 of the Environment Article do not authorize the Harford County Council itself to adopt or amend Harford County\u2019s Solid Waste Management Plan. Those sections furnish no support for a contention that the County Council alone is an appropriate party to seek appellate review of a circuit court decision invalidating an amendment to the Harford County Solid Waste Management Plan. On the contrary, those sections confirm that the proper party would be the corporate entity of \u201cHarford County, Maryland\u201d or the County Council and County Executive together. In the present case, however, the corporate entity \u2014 Harford County \u2014 decided not to seek appellate review of the circuit court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Although our dismissal of the writ of certiorari will have the effect of leaving intact the opinion and judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, our action should not be construed as approval of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">WRIT OF CERTIORARI DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">EACH SIDE TO PAY OWN COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">CHASANOW, J., would simply dismiss this writ of certiorari as having been improvidently granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. \u201cWhere there exists a party having standing to ... take an appeal, we shall not ordinarily inquire as to whether another party on the same side also has standing.\" <em>Board v.
