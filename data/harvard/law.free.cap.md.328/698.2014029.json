Kahn. On February 11, 1988, the Petitioner filed a petition for reinstatement. Thereafter, on May 3, 1990, the Court referred the petition to the Attorney Grievance Commission to conduct an appropriate investigation and to submit a report and recommendation as to whether Petitioner should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">On July 13, 1992, the Inquiry Panel and Review Board of the Attorney Grievance Commission submitted separate reports in which the Inquiry Panel recommended that the Petitioner be reinstated and the Review Board recommended against reinstatement. After the Petitioner submitted an answer and brief urging that he be reinstated, the Court scheduled a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">The Court has carefully considered the report and recommendation of the Attorney Grievance Commission including the reports of the Inquiry Panel and Review Board as well as the Respondent\u2019s written and oral arguments in support of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The Court has also evaluated the essential factors to be considered in any reinstatement proceeding which are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the Petitioner\u2019s original misconduct; (2) the Petitioner\u2019s subsequent conduct and reformation; (3) the Petitioner\u2019s present character; and (4) the Petitioner\u2019s present qualifications and competence to practice law. <em>In re Braverman, </em>271 Md. 196, 199-200, 316 A.2d 246 (1974); <em>Matter of Murray, </em>316 Md. 303, 305, 558 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>A.2d 710 (1989).
