Before turning to the facts of the case, we briefly review the relevant aspects of the current property tax assessment system.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Real property is typically reassessed every three years, unless there are certain intervening circumstances such as zoning or use changes. \u00a7 8-104(b)-(c). Each county\u2019s Supervisor of Assessments has the responsibility of assessing all real property in the county subject to property tax. \u00a7 8-202.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 8-401(a) requires the Supervisor, an employee of the State Department of Assessments and Taxation, to provide the property owner with notice of any proposed change in the value or classification of real property. The notice must inform the owner of the right to appeal and must briefly describe the appeal process. \u00a7 8-401(c)(7). A person who receives notice under \u00a7 8-401 may protest the proposed assessment to the Supervisor within 45 days from the date of the notice. \u00a7\u00a7 8-404 and 14-502(a). In addition, \u201cany taxpayer, a county, a municipal corporation, or the Attorney General may submit a written appeal to the supervisor as to a value or classification in a notice of assessment on or before 45 days from the date of the notice.\u201d \u00a7 14-502(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Once an appeal is filed, the Supervisor must hold a hearing. \u00a7\u00a7 14-502(c) and 8-405. Section 14-510(b) provides that the hearings are informal, and that \u201cany party in interest may submit to the ... supervisor ... any informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>tion that bears on the appeal without regard to the technical rules of evidence.\u201d After the Supervisor holds the hearing and considers the evidence presented, the Supervisor issues a final notice of the assessed value of the property. \u00a7 8-407(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The final notice must notify the person who sought review of their right to appeal this final value or classification to the property tax assessment appeal board (PTAAB) where the property is located on or before 30 days from the date of the final notice. \u00a7\u00a7 8-407(b) and 14-509(a). Any taxpayer, a county, a municipal corporation, or the Attorney General may also appeal an assessment to the PTAAB within the 30 day period. \u00a7 14-509(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The final administrative level of property tax appeal is the Maryland Tax Court which, despite its name, is an independent administrative arm of the state government. Maryland Code (1988), Tax-General Article, \u00a7 3-102. Section 14-512(f)(l) provides that any taxpayer, municipal corporation, the Attorney General, the Department, or the governing body of a county may appeal to the Tax Court within 30 days after the PTAAB issues its determination or provides appropriate notice as per the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Any party to a Maryland Tax Court proceeding may appeal a final decision of the Tax Court to the circuit court for the county in which the property is located. \u00a7 14-513. Any party to a proceeding in the circuit court under \u00a7 14-513 may appeal a final decision of the circuit court to the Court of Special Appeals. \u00a7 14-515. Finally, this Court may issue a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The facts in this case are straightforward. Taxpayers, the owners of the White Flint Shopping Mall in Montgom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ery County, received a proposed assessment for their property of $111,875,960 for the 1988 tax year. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8-404 and 14-502, Taxpayers appealed to the Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supervisor heard their appeal but affirmed the proposed assessment and issued a final notice pursuant to \u00a7 8-407. Within the 30-day statutory period, Taxpayers appealed to the Montgomery County PTAAB under \u00a7 14-509. Montgomery County became aware of the scheduled PTAAB hearing and notified the PTAAB by letter that it was a party in interest in the proceedings and intended to participate in the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">At the PTAAB hearing, Taxpayers presented evidence that the proper value of the property was $109,000,000, while Montgomery County presented evidence that the property\u2019s proper value was $152,381,800. The Supervisor defended its original assessment of $111,875,960. On March 9, 1989, the PTAAB affirmed the Supervisor\u2019s original assessment. Taxpayers elected to take no further appeal, but Montgomery County appealed the PTAAB\u2019s decision to the Maryland Tax Court seeking an increase in the assessment. The County based its appeal on \u00a7 14-512(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Taxpayers filed three separate motions challenging Montgomery County\u2019s standing to appeal to the Tax Court. All three motions were opposed by the County and denied by the Tax Court. On September 27, 1990, the Tax Court held a full evidentiary hearing. Taxpayers, through their appraiser, presented evidence to support a reduction in the assessment to $104,286,100. Montgomery County presented evidence through its appraiser to support an increase in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the assessment to $130,000,000. The Supervisor presented evidence to support the original $111,875,960 assessment. On March 27, 1991, the Tax Court issued an order increasing the property\u2019s value for assessment purposes to $130,-000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">From the decision of the Tax Court, Taxpayers appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County pursuant to \u00a7 14-513, contesting only the County\u2019s standing to appeal to the Tax Court. The Circuit Court (William C. Miller, J.) held that Montgomery County had standing to appeal and affirmed the judgment of the Tax Court. Taxpayers appealed from this decision to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 14-515. We granted certiorari to consider the appropriateness of Montgomery County\u2019s appeal to the Tax Court before the intermediate appellate court could consider the issue. Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 12-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The changing role of the counties in property tax assessment and appeals does not lend itself to concise description. It is fair to say, however, that the counties\u2019 power to determine assessments has progressively decreased over time, while their right to appeal assessments set by others has progressively increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In 1951, all real property in a county was assessed by the county commissioners, and in Baltimore City by an Appeal Tax Court. Former Md.Code (1951), Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 28. The Supervisor of Assessments was responsible for conducting assessments and recommending assessment values to the county commissioners for their approval. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 232. The county commissioners were also charged with hearing protests of these decisions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 242, although they were empowered to appoint a county Appeal Tax Court to hear such protests. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 243. Any taxpayer, city or the Attorney General could appeal an assessment to the county commissioners, or to the Appeal Tax Court where one was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>created. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 251. Any taxpayer, city, the Attorney General, or a Supervisor of Assessments \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d by a decision of the county commissioners or Appeal Tax Court could appeal to the State Tax Commission. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 252. The counties had no right of appeal at these levels because they themselves were establishing the assessments. As for appeals from the decisions of the State Tax Commission, which the counties did not control, any taxpayer, city, the Attorney General, <em>as well as </em>the county commissioners could appeal from a State Tax Commission decision to the Circuit Court or to the \u201cBaltimore City Court of Baltimore City.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 255. Thus, the counties\u2019 interests were fully represented at all levels of the assessment and appeals process.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In 1959, the General Assembly replaced the State Tax Commission with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) and the Maryland Tax Court. Chapter 757 of the Acts of 1959, \u00a7 247A. The powers of the county commissioners over initial assessments were transferred to the Supervisors of Assessments in the counties and the Department of Assessments in Baltimore City, under the supervision of the SDAT. Former Md.Code (1957, 1960 Cum.Supp.), Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 232. The county commissioners, or their duly created Appeal Tax Courts, and the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals in Baltimore City still heard assessment appeals. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 255(b). Any taxpayer, any city, the State, or Supervisors of Assessments could appeal from a decision of these local \u201cfinal assessing authorities\u201d to the Maryland Tax Court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 256(a). County commissioners also were given the right to appeal to the Maryland Tax Court from any decision of a local Appeal Tax Court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 256(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">In 1973, the General Assembly created Property Tax Assessment Appeal Boards (PTAABs) in each county. It removed the jurisdiction of the county commissioners over appeals and gave the power to hear appeals from Supervisors\u2019 assessments to the newly-created PTAABs. Ch. 784 of the Acts of 1973, \u00a7 255(b). Apparently realizing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>combined effect of its 1959 and 1973 actions was to completely shut the counties out of the initial assessment process and the first two levels of appeal (to the Supervisor and the PTAAB) the General Assembly in 1976 gave the counties the right to appeal both to the local Supervisor and to the PTAAB. Ch. 495 of the Acts of 1976, \u00a7 255(a)-(b). Although counties no longer had authority to set assessments, their interests were adequately protected by their right to appeal to all three administrative levels of the assessment process \u2014 the Supervisor, the PTAAB, and the Tax Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 1985, the General Assembly recodified these provisions in the new Tax-Property Article, which controls the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Section 14-512(f)(1) of the Tax-Property Article addresses appeals to the Maryland Tax Court from PTAAB decisions. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">\u201c(f) <em>Appeals from, property tax assessment appeal board; exhaustion of administrative remedies. </em>\u2014 (1) Any taxpayer, a municipal corporation, the Attorney General, the Department, or the governing body of a county may appeal a determination made by a property tax assessment appeal board under \u00a7 14-509(a) or (b) of this subtitle to the Maryland Tax Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">In this language, Taxpayers perceive that Montgomery County\u2019s right to appeal to the Tax Court is conditioned on its being \u201caggrieved\u201d by the decision of the PTAAB. Although the statute makes no reference to whether a party must be \u201caggrieved,\u201d Taxpayers find this requirement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the predecessor statute to \u00a7 14-512(f)(1), former Article 81, \u00a7 256, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">\u201c\u00a7 256. Appeals to Maryland Tax Court from property tax assessment appeal board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Any taxpayer, any city, or the Attorney General or Department on behalf of the State, or a supervisor of assessments ... or the county commissioners of any county, or on behalf of any chartered county, by either the county council or, if the office exists, by the county executive, <em>claiming to be aggrieved </em>because of any assessment or classification, or because of any [enumerated actions of the PTAAB], may by petition appeal to the Maryland Tax Court____\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Because the Revisor\u2019s Note to current \u00a7 14-512(f) provides that it is derived \u201cwithout substantive change\u201d from former \u00a7 256, Taxpayers claim that the requirement that a party must be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the PTAAB's decision should be read into current \u00a7 14-512(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Although we have not previously addressed whether a party need be \u201caggrieved\u201d under \u00a7 14-512(f)(l), we have addressed the aggrievement requirement in another statutory context. In <em>Boulden v. Mayor, </em>311 Md. 411, 535 A.2d 477 (1988), we construed Md.Code (1957, 1983 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.08(a) dealing with who may appeal to the circuit court from a local board of zoning appeals decision. Section 4.08(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\"><em>\u201cAny person or persons, </em>jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of appeals, or by a zoning action by the local legislative body, <em>or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board, bureau </em>of the jurisdiction, may appeal the same to the circuit court of the county____\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court, concluded that although the statute required \u201cany person or persons\u201d to be \u201caggrieved,\u201d the location of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the statute meant that taxpayers and other parties following the word \u201cor\u201d were not subject to the requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 535 A.2d at 479. We thus refused in <em>Boulden </em>to read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>in the word \u201caggrieved\u201d where it did not exist, and Montgomery County encourages us to refuse to do so in the similar circumstances of the instant case. <em>See id. </em>at 415 n. 3, 535 A.2d at 479 n. 3. The presence of the Revisor\u2019s Note, though, indeed creates some ambiguity. Nonetheless, we need not resolve this ambiguity today, because even if the statute is read to require that an appellant be \u201caggrieved,\u201d we believe Montgomery County met the requirement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">On the question of who is \u201caggrieved,\u201d Taxpayers contend that the county may become \u201caggrieved\u201d by a PTAAB decision in one of only two ways. First, if a county timely appeals a Supervisor\u2019s final assessment to the PTAAB and asks for an increase, which request the PTAAB rejects, the county is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the rejection. Second, Taxpayers contend a county may be \u201caggrieved\u201d <em>without </em>timely appealing to the PTAAB only if the PTAAB reduces a Supervisor\u2019s assessment after a taxpayer\u2019s timely appeal. Taxpayers argu\u00e9 that where a county fails to file a timely appeal and the PTAAB merely affirms the Supervisor\u2019s decision, as is the case here, the PTAAB\u2019s action cannot \u201caggrieve\u201d the County because it is left in no worse position than when the hearing began. Because the Montgomery County PTAAB merely affirmed the Supervisor\u2019s assessment of $111,875,960, rejecting Taxpayers\u2019 request for a decrease, Taxpayers claim Montgomery County cannot be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the PTAAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Montgomery County makes three alternative arguments as to why it is entitled to appeal to the Tax Court. First, it contends that the plain language of \u00a7 14-512(f)(1), which makes no explicit reference to an \u201caggrieved\u201d status, renders it a so-called \u201csuper-plaintiff\u201d able to appeal to the Tax Court regardless of who appeared or what transpired before the PTAAB. Second, Montgomery County argues that even though it did not file its own timely appeal, it was an \u201cintervenor\u201d in the PTAAB proceeding and, as such, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>quired the full rights of a party including the right to appeal, regardless of whether it was \u201caggrieved.\u201d The County bases this view principally on <em>Montgomery County v. Supervisor, 275 </em>Md. 58, 337 A.2d 679 (1975), where we affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s grant of the county\u2019s motion to intervene in a property tax appeal which made the County \u201ca party ... with all rights incident thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 337 A.2d at 681. Finally, Montgomery County argues that even if the key to a party\u2019s right to appeal is whether it is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the PTAAB\u2019s decision, the fact that it submitted evidence to the PTAAB supporting a higher assessment, and the fact that the PTAAB ultimately rejected this evidence and affirmed the Supervisor\u2019s proposed assessment, rendered it sufficiently \u201caggrieved\u201d to appeal to the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Because of our conclusion below that Montgomery County was sufficiently \u201caggrieved\u201d by the PTAAB decision to enable it to appeal to the Tax Court, we need not reach the County\u2019s first argument, whether a county is a \u201csuper-plaintiff\u201d able to appeal to the Tax Court without regard to the earlier proceedings. We also need not determine whether Montgomery County\u2019s participation in the PTAAB hearing gave it \u201cintervenor\u201d status which would allow it to appeal regardless of whether it was \u201caggrieved.\u201d We might note that Montgomery County could have \u201cintervened\u201d in the more formal proceedings of the Tax Court and circuit court regardless of what happened at the PTAAB had the taxpayer appealed to the Tax Court or circuit court, <em>Montgomery County v. Supervisor, </em>275 Md. 58, 62, 337 A.2d 679, 681 (1975) (Tax Court properly permitted county to intervene in tax appeal); <em>Maryland Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>30 Md.App. 712, 718, 354 A.2d 459, 462 (1976) (State as well as county should have been permitted to intervene in property tax dispute in circuit court), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>282 Md. 588, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978) (reversing on issue of enforceability of contract clause waiving right to challenge future tax assessments). A PTAAB hearing is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>however, \u201cinformal.\u201d \u00a7 14-510(b); <em>see also </em>COMAR 14.10.-01.05(E)(1) (\u201cThe [PTAAB] Board shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner.\u201d); \u00a7 14-510(b) (\u201c[a]ny party in interest may submit to the [PTAAB] at a hearing any information that bears on the appeal without regard to the technical rules of evidence.\u201d). Montgomery County clearly had the right to participate in the PTAAB\u2019s informal proceedings, and did so, whether or not it was formally designated an \u201cintervenor.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That participation, along with the fact that the county was otherwise \u201caggrieved,\u201d permits the County to appeal to the Tax Court regardless of what label is placed on its status at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In determining what makes a party \u201caggrieved\u201d for the purposes of a property tax appeal, we first note that property taxes are unusual in that many parties may have a stake in the amount of an individual taxpayer\u2019s tax bill. Nearly half a century ago, for example, we recognized that a taxpayer may complain of underassessment of property owned by other taxpayers, under the theory that underassessment of one property necessarily increases the tax burden on neighboring taxpayers. <em>Anne Arundel County v. Buch, </em>190 Md. 394, 399-400, 58 A.2d 672, 674-75 (1948). \u201cAggrieved\u201d status in the context of property tax appeals resembles \u201caggrieved\u201d status in zoning matters. <em>See </em>Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.08(a) (\u201cAny person ... aggrieved by any decision of the [zoning] board of appeals ... may appeal the same to the circuit court of the county\u201d). There is a long and well-established line of cases addressing the meaning of \u201caggrieved\u201d in the zoning context which focuses upon the impact of the administrative action on the party seeking to appeal. To render a party \u201caggrieved,\u201d a zoning decision must affect a matter in which the party has a personal or property right. The \u201caggrieved\u201d party must also suffer some special damage, different from that suffered by the public generally. <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Applying these principles here, we cannot imagine a party, other than the Taxpayers in this case, with a greater interest in the result of the appeal or a greater susceptibility to special damage than Montgomery County. We have previously noted that \u201ca very substantial portion of [a county\u2019s] revenue is derived from [property] tax.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. 459, 462, 385 A.2d 80, 82 (1978). In the case of White Flint Mall, under the current tax rates, the difference between the tax raised from the Supervisor\u2019s proposed assessment and from the County\u2019s proposed assessment is over $200,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Taxpayers themselves concede a county\u2019s \u201cobvious stake in tax revenues.\u201d Thus, a county has a unique and important interest in the disposition of property tax appeals. We therefore hold that a county which submits evidence supporting a higher assessment at a taxpayer-initiated PTAAB appeal may appeal to the Tax Court from the PTAAB\u2019s decision which rejects its evidence and affirms the Supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>sor\u2019s proposed assessment. This right is, of course, in addition to a county\u2019s undisputed right to appeal from a PTAAB\u2019s decision which reduces a Supervisor's proposed assessment regardless of whether it appeared or submitted evidence below.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-5\">Underlying our conclusion that the County was \u201caggrieved\u201d is the premise that the PTAAB could have increased the assessment in response to a county\u2019s submission of evidence at a taxpayer-initiated appeal. There must be relief available to the county at the PTAAB, the denial of which would give the county cause to complain. Taxpayers argue that the PTAAB has no such power to increase the assessment at the taxpayer\u2019s appeal upon the County\u2019s request. They insist that a PTAAB may increase an assessment only upon a timely filed appeal asking for an increase. For this argument, Taxpayers rely on an Attorney General\u2019s opinion, 70 <em>Op.Att\u2019y Gen. </em>22 (1985), addressing the threshold question of whether the PTAAB could <em>ever </em>increase assessments and, if so, under what circumstances. The Attorney General concluded that the PTAAB was empowered to increase assessments, but did <em>not </em>have the authority to do so <em>sua sponte. Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Taxpayers construe the Attorney General\u2019s opinion to mean that \u201cthe [PTAAB] has the power to increase an assessment only pursuant to a demand for such relief by a party, including a county, which took a timely appeal from the supervisor\u2019s assessment.\u201d We believe this is too narrow an interpretation of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, and an incorrect statement of the law in any case. In the opinion, the Attorney General points out by example what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the PTAAB <em>cannot </em>do. If a taxpayer whose property is assessed at $100,000 appeals to the local PTAAB arguing that the property should be assessed at $50,000, the Supervisor would presumably present evidence supporting the original $100,000 assessment. Under these circumstances, the PTAAB could not unilaterally increase the assessment to $125,000. 70 <em>Op.Att\u2019y Gen. </em>at 27-28. While a PTAAB may not have the power to increase an assessment unilaterally, as in the above example, it does have the power to increase an assessment when a party properly before it asks it to do so. That is the case here, because Montgomery County properly appeared at the PTAAB hearing, without any objection by Taxpayers, and presented evidence supporting a higher assessment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not read the Attorney General\u2019s opinion as saying that the PTAAB can increase an assessment only upon a timely filed appeal seeking an increase, but rather that a PTAAB cannot <em>sua sponte </em>increase an assessment at a hearing where only the taxpayer and Supervisor appear and where there is no evidence to support an assessment higher than the Supervisor\u2019s. If a county has properly submitted evidence of a higher assessment, the PTAAB\u2019s increase in assessment is not <em>sua sponte; </em>it is instead at the request of a party in interest. If the PTAAB is persuaded that the county's evidence warrants an increase, then it is statutorily authorized to increase the assessment. <em>See id. </em>at 28. The Montgomery County PTAAB thus had the power to increase the assessment at the Taxpayers\u2019 PTAAB hearing, and the County was adequately \u201caggrieved\u201d by the PTAAB\u2019s refusal to do so upon its submission of evidence supporting a higher assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Finally, we address both parties\u2019 arguments on a distinct issue, the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Taxpayers raise the Code requirement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">\u201c[ujnless <em>a person </em>has exhausted all available administrative remedies before the appropriate tax determining agency, the person may not appeal to the Tax Court.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Md.Code (1988, 1992 Cum.Supp.), Tax-General Art. \u00a7 13-514. Section l-101(p)(2) of the Tax-General Art. clearly defines the word \u201cperson\u201d as excluding governmental entities unless there is express provision otherwise. Taxpayers nonetheless contend that this explicit exclusion of counties from the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 13-514 occurred through \u201can error in the revision\u201d of the Code, one which we should correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Taxpayers note that Tax-General \u00a7 13-514 was derived from former Art. 81, \u00a7 230 \u201cwithout substantive change,\u201d according to the Revisor\u2019s Notes accompanying the statute. Former \u00a7 230 required exhaustion of remedies by any \u201cparty\u201d seeking to appeal, rather than any \u201cperson,\u201d and we have previously implied that a county was a \u201cparty\u201d under former \u00a7 230. <em>See County Exec. for Montgomery County v. Supervisor, </em>275 Md. 392, 395 n. 5, 340 A.2d 246, 248 n. 5 (1975) (observing that there was no contention that the county failed to exhaust its administrative remedies \u201cas required by ... \u00a7 230\u201d). Taxpayers contend that since present Tax-General \u00a7 13-514 is a recodification of former \u00a7 230 ostensibly \u201cwithout substantive change,\u201d we must consider the new term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 13-514 to be identical to the old term \u201cparty\u201d in \u00a7 230 and consider a county a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 13-514 \u2014 despite the fact that counties are excluded from the current definition. When interpreting a statute\u2019s provisions, our goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature. <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 484-85 (1991). When a statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, however, we need look no further for some hidden legislative intent. <em>Management </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>Personnel Servs. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 341, 478 A.2d 310, 314 (1984). Where the legislature in Tax-General \u00a7 1-101(p)(2) clearly excluded governmental units from the definition of \u201cperson\u201d as used in Tax-General \u00a7 13-514, we will not alter the clear language of the statute. This conclusion is further supported by a reading of Tax-General \u00a7 13-510(a), which governs appeals to the Tax Court for non-property tax assessments. Section 13-510(a) of the Tax-General Art. provides that \u201ca person or governmental unit ... may appeal to the Tax Court____\u201d That the section refers to both a \u201cperson\u201d and a \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d is a clear indication that the General Assembly intended a governmental entity and a \u201cperson\u201d to be non-overlapping terms in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Montgomery County\u2019s perspective on the exhaustion issue focuses on yet another statutory provision, \u00a7 14-512(f)(3) of the Tax-Property Article. Section 14-512(f)(3) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201c[u]nless a taxpayer previously appealed as required by \u00a7 14-502 or \u00a7 14-503 of this subtitle to a property tax assessment appeal board, the taxpayer may not appeal to the Maryland Tax Court under this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVB\">Montgomery County uses the fact that the statute\u2019s terms only restrict a taxpayer\u2019s appeal to bolster its argument that its own right to appeal to the Tax Court is unrestricted. Not surprisingly, Taxpayers have quite a different view, contending that despite its reference to taxpayers alone, \u00a7 14-512(f)(3) actually restricts the appeals of <em>all </em>parties who have not previously appealed to the PTAAB.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Taxpayers\u2019 argument is based on the legislative history of \u00a7 14-512(f)(3). They again point out that, according to the Re-visor\u2019s Note, \u00a7 14-512(f) was derived \u201cwithout substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>change\u201d from former Art. 81, \u00a7 256. Former \u00a7 256(a) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">\u201cAn appeal on behalf of a taxpayer [to the Tax Court] may not be allowed under this section from a failure or refusal to abate, reduce, or reclassify an existing assessment unless application in writing for the action has been filed by the appellant with the [PTAAB] appealed from within the time limited for the filing of a demand for a hearing by \u00a7 255 of this article [providing for appeal from the Supervisor\u2019s decision to the PTAAB].\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">This language dates to before 1959, when the counties had no right of appeal to the Tax Court\u2019s predecessor, the State Tax Commission. From this fact, Taxpayers reach the inescapable conclusion that because the counties had no right of appeal at all when the exhaustion provision was enacted, the provision could not have been intended to exclude counties from its requirement. They insist, however, that if counties had been given the right to appeal to the Tax Court, the exhaustion provision would have applied equally to them. This conclusion is unsupported by a reading of the former \u00a7 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">When the legislature amended former \u00a7 256 in 1959 to give counties the right to appeal to the newly-created Tax Court from decisions of the local Appeal Tax Courts, the legislature retained the language which restricted only taxpayer appeals. Ch. 757 of the Acts of 1959. The legislature retained the language when it again amended \u00a7 256 in 1978 to give counties the right to appeal to the Tax Court from the PTAABs. Ch. 577 of the Acts of 1978. To us, this means that the legislature, upon seeing fit to grant the counties the right to appeal to the Tax Court, also saw fit not to extend the exhaustion requirement to the counties. Had the legislature wanted to subject counties to the exhaustion provision, it would have amended the exhaustion provision at either time it addressed the counties\u2019 right to appeal. That the legislature did not do so is sufficient evidence of its intent to apply the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 14-512(f)(3) to taxpayers and taxpayers alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In conclusion, for the reasons discussed above, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court and hold that Montgomery County could appeal to the Tax Court seeking an increase in Taxpayers\u2019 property tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Under \u00a7 2-215, the State Department of Assessments and Taxation was required to notify Montgomery County of Taxpayers\u2019 appeal to the Supervisor, although the County claims it was never notified. Then-effective \u00a7 2-215 required the Department to notify the appropriate county legal officer of any assessment appeal filed with the Supervisor when the proposed value of the property exceeds $250,000. Section 2-215 has since been amended to increase this threshold to $2,000,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">. From 1973 to 1978, the counties\u2019 right to appeal to the Tax Court from PTAAB decisions was a bit muddied, because the 1973 Act which replaced the local Appeal Tax Courts with the PTAABs failed to make the substitution in \u00a7 256 regarding appeal to the Tax Court. Thus, for this period, the counties could technically appeal only from Appeal Tax Court decisions, a body which no longer existed. In 1978, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 256 and replaced references to the Appeal Tax Court with references to the PTAAB. Chapter 577 of the Acts of 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\">. Montgomery County could have exercised its right to be heard by the PTAAB either by filing its own appeal or by submitting evidence at the Taxpayers\u2019 appeal. The advantage to the County of filing its own appeal is that it could present its evidence to the PTAAB without regard to the Taxpayers\u2019 actions. By failing to file an appeal, and instead seeking to present evidence at the Taxpayers\u2019 appeal, the County took the risk that the Taxpayer might dismiss the appeal before the presentation of testimony. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.10.01.05(D)(4) (\u201c[a] petition for appeal may be withdrawn at any time before the presentation of testimony at the hearing.\u201d). If the Taxpayers had decided to dismiss prior to presenting testimony, there would have been no PTAAB hearing at which the County could have submitted evidence. If a County files a timely appeal, a county has an independent, unfettered right to present evidence to the PTAAB. If a county neglects to file a timely appeal, it may submit evidence in support of its position only if the party who brought the appeal chooses to proceed with the PTAAB hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b795-5\">. The current \u201cweighted\" (or average) tax rate for Montgomery County is $2.80 per $100 of assessed value. The assessed value equals 40% of the full value for assessment purposes. The difference between the Supervisor's proposed full value of $111,875,960 and the County\u2019s proposed full value of $130,000,000 is $18,124,040. Multiplied by 40% and by the tax rate, the result is $202,989 which Montgomery County stood to lose by accepting the Supervisor\u2019s assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">. This case does not present the broader question of whether a county which has neither appeared at nor submitted evidence to a PTAAB can appeal to the Tax Court to seek an increased assessment. We have previously noted, however, that even Taxpayers concede the County could appeal if the PTAAB reduced the assessment. <em>Cf. County Exec. for Montgomery County v. Supervisor, </em>275 Md. 64, 65, 337 A.2d 682, 683-84 (1975) (acknowledging County\u2019s right to appeal to the Maryland Tax Court from County Appeal Tax Court decision reducing Supervisor\u2019s assessment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b797-4\">. We note that there might be some due process considerations if the Taxpayers had no notice that Montgomery County was intending to present evidence supporting a higher assessment. The record does not indicate an objection for lack of notice by Taxpayers at any point in the proceedings. Therefore, we will assume adequate notice was given or was waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">. There is at least one additional ambiguity in \u00a7 14-512(f)(3). A literal reading might indicate that a taxpayer who did not protest his or her original assessment, but whose assessment was increased by the PTAAB on a timely appeal by a county, would be prevented from appealing the increase to the Tax Court. Accepting Taxpayers\u2019 view, however, would not resolve this particular ambiguity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
