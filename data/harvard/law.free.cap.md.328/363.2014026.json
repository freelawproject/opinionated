(collectively \u201cthe defendants\u201d). At this tax sale, the plaintiffs, Theodore and Geraldine Scheve (the Scheves), were the highest bidders on the defendants\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Scheves paid the outstanding tax on the properties, and the county tax collector issued them certificates of tax sale for each of the ten parcels.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The Scheves filed a complaint to foreclose Shudder\u2019s right of redemption on March 31, 1988. The Scheves filed two requests for the service of process and for orders of publication in the Shudder case, the first with the complaint and, after a series of miscommunications with the circuit court clerk\u2019s office, again on November 14, 1988. After correcting the problem, the court issued the required process and published a notice of foreclosure. Both the notice and summons provided that the property should be redeemed by February 9, 1989, or a final judgment would be entered foreclosing Shudder\u2019s rights of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>On February 2, 1989, the Scheves also filed a complaint to foreclose Bama\u2019s right of redemption. Under the terms of the summons and the published notice, the property should be redeemed by April 19,1989, or a final judgment would be entered foreclosing Bama's rights of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">With both the Shudder and Bama complaints, the Scheves attached the tax sale certificates, affidavits of title search, requests to order publication of notice of sale, and requests to serve summons on the named defendants. In each case, the defendants received personal service of process, as well as published notice before any judicial action occurred. Neither Bama nor Shudder filed answers to the complaints or sought to prevent foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In November 1990, the defendants Shudder and Bama submitted to the circuit court proposed orders that would foreclose their rights of redemption. The circuit court signed the orders on December 11, 1990, and foreclosed the defendants\u2019 rights of redemption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Immediately thereafter, the Scheves filed a motion to strike the order foreclosing redemption. The Scheves' motion was based on the grounds \u201cthat the Plaintiffs have not sought a Final Order Foreclosing Rights of Redemption^ and that] the Order appears to have been passed by the Court <em>sua sponte </em>without communication to Plaintiffs or their attorney.\u201d On January 3, 1991, the judge granted the Scheves\u2019 motion to strike the order and revived the defendants\u2019 rights of redemption. After the court did so, however, the Scheves did not attempt to dismiss their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The defendants filed a Motion for Judgment on June 24, 1991, and requested that the circuit court foreclose their rights of redemption and authorize the collector of taxes to convey to the Scheves an indefeasible fee simple title to the property. Almost three years after filing their complaint to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>foreclose the right of redemption, the Scheves apparently decided that they had overbid the property. In response to the defendants\u2019 motion and their anticipation of potential financial loss, the Scheves filed a motion stating that they were \u201cnot interested in pursuing their Complaint to Foreclose the Equity of Redemption and request that it be dismissed____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">A hearing was held September 16, 1991, to decide the defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment. At the hearing, the defendants argued that, once a purchaser at a tax foreclosure sale files a complaint and takes all steps necessary to foreclose the right of redemption, the court must enter a judgment foreclosing the prior owner\u2019s right of redemption after the time period set in the order of publication and the summonses expire. For this proposition the defendants relied on \u00a7 14-844(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201c\u00a7 14-844. Final order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">(a) <em>Judgment. </em>\u2014 After the time limit set in the order of publication and in the summons expires, the court shall enter judgment foreclosing the right of redemption. An interlocutory order is not necessary. The judgment is final and conclusive on the defendants, their heirs, devisees, and personal representatives and they or any of their heirs, devisees, executors, administrators, assigns, or successors in right, title, or interest, and all defendants are bound by the judgment as if they had been named in the proceedings and personally served with process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">The Scheves in turn sought to dismiss their complaint and argued that after filing the complaint the statute \u201cdoesn\u2019t intend for a final decree unless the Plaintiff moves for it, and there is no authority to compel him to take [the property].\u201d The Scheves also argued that the circuit court could not foreclose the right of redemption because there had been no compliance with the literal terms of the notice provisions in \u00a7 14-839, since the Scheves failed to file an affidavit of service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The circuit court rejected the Scheves\u2019 arguments and held that \u201conce the Order of Publication and summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>requirements have been complied with, the court shall enter a judgement foreclosing the equity of redemption[, and a] specific request by the tax purchaser is not necessary.\u201d Noting that the purpose of the statute was to improve the marketability of property sold at tax sales, the court reasoned that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 14-808 et seq. would be defeated if the purchaser at a tax sale were allowed to file a Complaint to Foreclose the Equity of Redemption, comply with all the statutory notice and publication requirements, allow the time in the Summons and Order of Publication to pass and only then delay the entering of a Final Order by withholding from the Court a copy of a Final Order.\u201d The circuit court then entered the final order foreclosing the defendants\u2019 rights of redemption. The Scheves appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and we granted certiorari before the intermediate appellate court heard the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Title 14 of the Tax-Property article provides county governments a means of collecting property taxes that are in arrears. In <em>Simms v. Scheve, </em>298 Md. 1, 467 A.2d 499 (1983), we noted that, under the tax sale statute, \u201cfor a tax sale to be effective substantial compliance with the statute is required[; i]n this regard, the prescription of the statute is clear and simple.\u201d We then described the basic steps of the tax sale process. We said that under the tax sale statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201c[u]npaid taxes on real estate constitute a lien on that property. [\u00a7 14-804]. Generally, within two years from the date taxes become in arrears the jurisdiction\u2019s collector must sell the land. [\u00a7 14-808]. Notice of the proposed sale must be given to the owner at least thirty days before the property is advertised for sale and the owner is notified that if he does not pay the taxes within thirty days, the property will be sold. [\u00a7 14-812]. After the sale is properly advertised, the property is sold at public auction. [\u00a7 14-817].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The purchaser of the property is given a certificate of sale which includes a description of the property, the amount for which the property was sold, and information as to the time in which an action to foreclose the owner\u2019s right of redemption must be brought. [\u00a7 14-820]. The owner may redeem the property at any time until the right of redemption has been finally foreclosed by paying the required sum to the collector, who transfers the money to the purchaser in exchange for the tax sale certificate. [\u00a7\u00a7 14-827 to 14-828].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">Sections [14-832.1 to 14-848] define the purchaser\u2019s ability to foreclose the right of redemption. These provisions are to be \u2018liberally construed as remedial legislation to encourage the foreclosure of rights of redemption by suits in the [circuit] courts and for decreeing of marketable titles to property sold by the collector.\u2019 [\u00a7 14-832]. The holder of the certificate of sale may file [a complaint] to foreclose the owner\u2019s right of redemption after [six months] from the date of the sale. . . . The [complaint] must be filed within two years or the certificate is void. The owner may redeem the property at any time until the right of redemption has been finally foreclosed. [\u00a7 14-833].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">The purchaser initiates the foreclosure proceeding in the [circuit] court by filing a [complaint as detailed in \u00a7 14-835] and attaching the certificate of sale issued by the collector____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\"><em>Simms, </em>298 Md. at 3-4, 467 A.2d at 500 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The tax sale statute sets out several steps that must be complied with before a circuit court may enter a final order under \u00a7 14-844. In summary, the statute requires that: (1) the purchaser must file a complaint that conforms with \u00a7 14-835(a) within two years following the sale; (2) the purchaser must attach the certificate of sale (\u00a7 14 \u2014 835(b)); (3) the purchaser must attach an affidavit of title search (\u00a7 14-838); (4) the court must issue process and public notice under \u00a7\u00a7 14-839 and 14-840, setting out the time after which the right of redemption will be foreclosed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Thereafter, assuming that due process requirements have been met, the circuit court may enter a final order under \u00a7 14-844.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">On appeal, the Scheves object to the circuit court\u2019s entry of an order foreclosing the defendant\u2019s rights of redemption and seek both to reverse the circuit court\u2019s order and to dismiss their complaint. The Scheves allege that the circuit court erred in (1) its construction of Title 14 of the Tax-Property Article; (2) its denial of the Scheves\u2019 motion to dismiss; and (3) its entering a final judgment foreclosing the defendants\u2019 rights of redemption before the Scheves fully complied with the notice provisions in \u00a7 14-839.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The parties focus their arguments on the construction of \u00a7 14-844. The relevant portion of \u00a7 14-844 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201c(a) <em>Judgment. </em>\u2014 After the time limit set in the order of publication and in the summons expires, the court shall enter judgment foreclosing the right of redemption----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The Scheves contend that \u00a7 14-844(a) does not permit a circuit court to enter an order foreclosing the right of redemption against \u201can unwilling plaintiff.\u201d They argue that the filing of a complaint and complying with the procedural statutes is insufficient and that a tax sale purchaser must take additional steps to affirm its desire to foreclose. The defendants simply respond that the language of \u00a7 14-844 is mandatory, and that once the suit is filed and the statutory procedures are complied with the circuit court must enter an order to foreclose the right of redemption after the expiration of the dates in both the published notice and summonses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">In construing a legislative enactment the fundamental judicial task is to determine and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent, and indeed the very language of the statute serves as the primary source of the legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>intent. <em>See, e.g., Revis v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>322 Md. 683, 686, 589 A.2d 483, 484 (1991); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188, 191 (1990). To accomplish this task \u201cthe words of the statute are to be given their ordinary and natural import. . . .\u201d <em>Revis, </em>322 Md. at 686, 589 A.2d at 484. In addition, the language of the statute must be considered along with the statute\u2019s stated policy that its provisions \u201cshall be liberally construed as remedial legislation to encourage the foreclosure of rights of redemption ... and for the decreeing of marketable titles to property sold by the collector.\u201d \u00a7 14-832.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Under these principles of statutory construction and the plain language of the statute, the Scheves\u2019 first contention must fail. The Scheves argue that a tax sale purchaser\u2019s filing of a complaint under \u00a7 14-833 is an insufficient basis for a circuit court to grant the relief that the complaint requests. Instead, the Scheves reason, the complaint only serves to preserve the validity of the certificate, and the court must wait until the tax sale purchaser signals the court that it is \u201ctruly\u201d interested in receiving the relief requested in the complaint. The Scheves base this interpretation on policy arguments aimed at protecting the tax sale purchaser from hidden risks that may not surface until after a title search is performed or that may surface after the tax sale purchaser files the complaint. Such defects, the Scheves assert, include the risk that the purchaser may have overbid the property, the existence of federal tax liens, pending bankruptcy proceedings, and destruction of an improvement on the property due to fire or other unforeseen event. According to the Scheves, requiring the reaffirmation of the tax sale purchasers\u2019 desire to foreclose protects purchasers from these risks, thus maintaining the viability of the tax sale process. Without such protection, they argue, potential purchasers would be unwilling to purchase property at tax sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Scheves\u2019 suggested interpretation, however, simply does not conform with the statute\u2019s language or the policies that the statute embodies. To begin with, \u00a7 14-833 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>provides that the purchaser initiates the foreclosure process by filing a complaint. The statute then sets out that the complaint must contain \u201ca <em>request </em>that the court pass a judgment that forecloses all rights of redemption of the defendants and any other person having any interest in the property.\u201d \u00a7 14-835(a)(6) (emphasis added). In addition to the statutory definition, the common definition of \u201ccomplaint\u201d encompasses a demand or request for judgment granting the relief that the plaintiff is seeking. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-305; <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>285 (6th ed. 1990). Thus, under the statute the complaint is a request that the court take action, not just a mere reservation of rights used to toll the statutory time period in which foreclosure must be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In addition, our prior interpretation of the tax sale statute also indicates that no additional steps are required to enter a final judgment under \u00a7 14-844 beyond those set out in the text of the tax sale statute. For instance, in <em>Simms v. Scheve, </em>298 Md. 1, 467 A.2d 499 (1983), we rejected a contention that a court must enter a decree <em>pro confesso </em>before foreclosing the owner\u2019s right of redemption. The Court based the analysis in <em>Simms </em>upon the premise that the tax sale statute outlined \u201ca <em>complete, clear, and logical procedure </em>for foreclosing [the right of redemption].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 467 A.2d at 502 (emphasis added). Noting the language of Art. 81, \u00a7 112, the predecessor of \u00a7 14-844, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute required an additional step not present in its text. We concluded that the tax sale statute \u201cspecifically provide[d] that the final decree be entered after the time stated in the subpoena; it did not mention the delay that would be caused by the decree <em>pro confesso </em>procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 467 A.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The logic of <em>Simms </em>is just as applicable here. The literal terms that the legislature used in \u00a7 14-844 do not encompass the Scheves\u2019 suggested \u201csecond step.\u201d A complaint under Title 14 must include the certificate of tax sale, an affidavit of a title search, and requests to serve process and for the court to issue an order of publication. \u00a7\u00a7 14-835(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>14-838, and 14-835(a)(4)-(5). After the purchaser files the complaint and meets all the tax sale statute\u2019s requirements, \u00a7 14-844 provides that when the prerequisite time period expires, a time period set into motion only through filing the complaint, a judgment will be entered. There is no mention of an additional prerequisite step of reaffirming the tax sale purchaser\u2019s desire to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Under Title 14, once all the necessary steps have been taken, the purchaser\u2019s filing of a complaint will authorize the court to foreclose of the right of redemption. To add the additional requirement of a specific request for further judicial action before a circuit court may enter a final order would contradict both the statutory language and scheme. Section 14-833 provides the tax sale purchaser a two-year period to decide if its bid would be a good investment. If it is, the purchaser may then file a complaint to foreclose the right of redemption. Before filing the suit, if the investment fails to meet the purchaser\u2019s expectations, the tax sale purchaser may walk away from its bid with only the forfeiture of its payment of the back taxes. \u00a7 14-833(d). Either way, the decision to file a complaint and to proceed remains with the tax sale purchaser. The two-year filing deadline under the statute provides an adequate period of time in which the purchaser can assess and discover risks of completing the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">At a minimum, we hold that, unless the complaint is dismissed under Md.Rules 2-506 or 2-507, \u00a7 14-844 gives a circuit court authority to enter a final order foreclosing the owner\u2019s right of redemption once the plaintiff has accomplished all the prerequisite steps required by the tax sale statute. Permitting a circuit court to enter a final order under \u00a7 14-844 after the time period set forth in the purchaser\u2019s notice to the owner is true to both the statutory language and the policy of encouraging the foreclosure of redemptive rights at tax sales. To require an additional demand by the tax sale purchaser would condone the extension of the tax sale process almost indefinitely, so long as the complaint is timely filed, unless the court dismisses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>action under its own motion or the motion of an interested party. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 2-506; Md.Rule 2-507(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tax sale purchasers must be serious when filing their complaints and initiating the judicial process. When tax sale purchasers file their complaints, they signal the court of their willingness to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The Scheves\u2019 next contention is that the circuit court could not enter a final judgment since they did not comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 14-839; specifically, the Scheves point to their own failure to file an affidavit certifying the method and time of service. \u00a7 14-839(a)(5). Thus, they argue, all the prerequisites under the statute were not met and the circuit court was without jurisdiction. We disagree. Our prior case law indicates that the requirement of filing an affidavit of service of process is not a jurisdictional requirement where there are no allegations that the owners lacked notice of the foreclosure proceedings. <em>See Hauver v. Dorsey, </em>228 Md. 499, 503-04, 180 A.2d 475, 478 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The Scheves\u2019 contention has no merit. The defendants here have all been personally served with process and have submitted to the court\u2019s jurisdiction in these proceedings by filing motions for judgment. In addition, the Scheves are not the proper party to raise issues concerning the notice provisions. The Legislature intended property owners, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>tax sale purchasers, to be the beneficiaries of the tax sale notice provisions and enacted these provisions to provide greater due process protection for them. <em>See St. George Church v. Aggarwal, </em>326 Md. 90, 96, 603 A.2d 484, 487 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The Scheves finally assert the circuit court erred in not permitting them to voluntarily dismiss their complaint to foreclose prior to entering the final decree under \u00a7 14-844. The Scheves contend that they were \u201cunwilling plaintiffs\u201d and allege that once a plaintiff in a tax sale foreclosure decides to voluntarily dismiss a case a court cannot compel a plaintiff to go forward. The Scheves broadly assert that \u201c[tjhere is no provision under the law or under the Rules of Procedure requiring any Plaintiff, civil or criminal, to proceed with a cause of action against its will.\u201d The Scheves\u2019 contentions, however, misconstrue Maryland Rule 2-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We do not agree with the Scheves\u2019 assertions that tax sale purchasers possess a unilateral right to dismiss a complaint at any time. This argument is far too broad. Although Title 14 creates a distinct statutory process for foreclosing a property owner\u2019s right of redemption after a tax sale, Maryland\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure still must be followed. Under these Rules, neither tax sale purchasers nor plaintiffs in general possess an unqualified right to dismiss their suits. With tax sale foreclosure actions, as with all causes of actions, at some point in the litigation a circuit court may deny a plaintiff\u2019s request to dismiss its complaint. Maryland Rule 2-506 establishes that point.. Under the heading of \u201cVoluntary Dismissal,\u201d it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMd\">\u201c(a) By Notice of Dismissal or Stipulation. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute, a plaintiff may dismiss an action without leave of court (1) by filing a notice of dismissal at <em>any time before the adverse party files an answer or a motion for sum</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>mary judgment </em>or (2) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiB\">Under the plain language of Rule 2-506, the plaintiff loses the absolute right to voluntarily dismiss an action after an adverse party files an answer or motion for summary judgment. The tax sale statute does not alter the operation of Rule 2-506(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We note that the need of tax sale purchasers to obtain leave of court before dismissing their complaints is not new. In fact, the requirement was once far stricter. Before the merger of the courts of law and equity in Maryland, an action to foreclose the right of redemption was a proceeding in equity. <em>See Dampman v. Litzau &amp; Sonntag, </em>261 Md. 196, 202, 274 A.2d 347, 350 (1971) (foreclosure of right of redemption is a statutory equity proceeding); <em>Voge v. Olin, </em>69 Md.App. 508, 513, 518 A.2d 474, 476 (1986) (stating same); <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1957, 1975 Repl.Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 112 (\u201cthe court shall pass its decree in the proceedings, in accordance with the general equity jurisdiction and practice of the court. . . .\u201d). Old Md. Rule 582, titled \u201cVoluntary Dismissal\u2014Equity\u201d embodied the common law rule that a party requires leave of the court before dismissing an equitable action, regardless of whether the adverse party has filed an answer or a motion for summary judgment. Md.Rule 582 (1984). It stated in relevant part that \u201c[a] party may dismiss his action ... only with leave of court.\u201d Thus, contrary to the Scheves\u2019 assertions, prior procedural rules placed even greater limits on a plaintiffs right to dismiss a tax sale proceeding than exist under present Md.Rule 2-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The Scheves did not request to dismiss their complaint until after Anne Arundel County filed answers to the suits,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and after the defendants filed Motions for Judgment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>defendants\u2019 Motions for Judgment were the equivalent of motions for summary judgment, as they did not raise an issue of material fact and sought relief as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 2-501(a) and (e). Accordingly, we find that the Scheves no longer had the ability to unilaterally dismiss their complaint. Instead, the Scheves needed leave of the court to do so, permission which was within the circuit court\u2019s discretion to withhold under Rule 2-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Thus the circuit court had authority, unless it dismissed the action under Rule 2-506, to enter a final order foreclosing redemptive rights since the Scheves\u2019 had filed a complaint and complied with the necessary requirements of the tax sale statute. Under Rule 2-506, the trial court has the discretion to grant or deny a plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss made after an answer or motion for summary judgment has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The circuit court, in interpreting the tax sale statute, ruled \u201conce the Order of Publication and summons requirements have been complied with, the court <em>shall </em>enter a judgment foreclosing the equity of redemption.\u201d In light of our holding and the circuit court\u2019s apparent belief that it lacked discretion to dismiss the action based on the tax sale statute, we believe the appropriate disposition of this case is to order a limited remand to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The circuit court may then exercise its discretion under Rule 2-506 and determine whether to grant or deny the Scheves\u2019 motion to dismiss. If the circuit court grants the motion to dismiss, it should strike the judgment foreclosing the right of redemption. Otherwise, the judgment will remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY PURSUANT TO RULE 8-604(d)(1) WITHOUT AFFIRMANCE OR REVERSAL AND FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE OPINION OF THIS COURT. THE PETITIONERS, THEODORE J. SCHEVE AND GERALDINE E. SCHEVE, AND THE RESPONDENTS, SHUDDER, INC. AND <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>BAMA, INC., SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN THIS COURT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">. Hereinafter all statutory references are made to Maryland Code (1986, 1992 Cum.Supp.), Tax-Property Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">. The total price bid for the nine parcels owned by Bama was $849,000. The Scheves also bid $30,000 on the property that Shudder owned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">. At that time, Bama owed the county $9,231.23 in property taxes on its nine parcels and Shudder owed $348.05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. We will hereafter address these two matters as one case. The defendants were represented by the same counsel, all the relevant documents and court orders were identical, and the two cases were combined at a later hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">. Indeed, the period in which the purchaser\u2019s right to foreclose the right of redemption can potentially be quite extensive. For instance, in <em>Prince George\u2019s Homes v. Cahn, </em>283 Md. 76, 389 A.2d 853 (1978), we found that a tax sale purchaser who had timely filed to foreclose the owner\u2019s right of redemption but who did not seek to conclude the procedure until nine years later was still entitled to receive a final decree foreclosing the owner\u2019s redemptive rights. In <em>Cahn </em>we recognized that although the county tax collector could seek to dismiss the tax sale purchaser\u2019s complaint for failure to prosecute, until the complaint was actually dismissed the tax sale purchaser was still entitled to receive a final order and the county could not resell the property. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 389 A.2d at 856.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\">. Anne Arundel County filed simple answers in both cases. The answers stated, \"[t]hat the Defendant, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, has no interest in the outcome of this case except that all taxes, interest and penalties relating thereto, relating to each of the subject properties ... should be fully paid....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
