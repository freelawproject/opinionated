Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 599 A.2d 1171 (1992) <em>(Thomas II); Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 483 A.2d 6 (1984) <em>(Thomas I), cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985). In <em>Thomas II, </em>we set forth the proceedings which preceded our review of an order of the post conviction court vacating the death sentence imposed upon Thomas and ordering that he be granted a new sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201cOn November 18, 1982, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County convicted Donald Thomas of the first degree murders of Donald Spurling and his wife, Sarah.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>*<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the same trial, Thomas was also found guilty of the first degree rape of Noel Wilkins, of committing two first degree sexual offenses upon Ms. Wilkins, and of robbing her at knife point. Having been previously given the required statutory notice that the death penalty would be sought for the first degree murders, Thomas elected to have the trial judge decide whether he should be executed for those crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cOn December 13, 1982, Thomas was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Donald Spurling, death for the murder of Sarah Spurling, concurrent terms of life imprisonment for the first degree rape and first degree sexual offenses, and a twenty-year consecutive sentence for the armed robbery. This Court affirmed the judgments of the circuit court as to both the convictions and the sentences, including imposition of the death sentence. <em>[Thomas I, supra.] </em>The Supreme Court of the United States denied Thomas\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cThomas then filed a petition for post conviction relief. Thomas sought a new trial, or in the alternative, a new sentencing hearing. After conducting an evidentiary hearing on the petition, the court found no merit in the claims that Thomas had been improperly convicted but vacated his death sentence and ordered a new sentencing hearing. This relief was granted because the court concluded that trial counsel had failed to render Thomas effective assistance when he permitted Thomas to be reexamined by Dr. Michael Spodak following his convictions in preparation for Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 165-66, 599 A.2d at 1173 (citations omitted). Also, in <em>Thomas II, </em>we recited the factual predicate for the order of the post conviction court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cIn an indictment filed on November 9, 1981, Thomas was charged with the crimes of which he now stands convicted. He entered pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity and incompetency to stand trial. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 23-28, the court ordered that he be transferred to the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center for a mental examination and evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cDr. Spodak, a member of the staff at Clifton Perkins, after conducting a psychiatric examination of Thomas, prepared a \u2018psychiatric case work up report.\u2019 Reports were also prepared by one of the hospital\u2019s social workers who had interviewed Thomas and by a clinical psychologist who related his findings upon his testing of Thomas. On February 4, 1982, Thomas appeared at a conference at Clifton Perkins attended by Dr. Spodak, the social worker who had interviewed him, the clinical psychologist who had tested him, and three other staff psychiatrists. Thomas was further interviewed at this conference. It was the unanimous opinion of the psychiatrists present at that conference that [Thomas was competent to stand trial, and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201c \u2018At the time of the alleged offenses, Mr. Thomas was not suffering from a mental disorder which caused him to lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Those conclusions were reported to the court____</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201cIn light of the Clifton Perkins evaluation, R. Clark Kinsley, Esq., the public defender assigned as Thomas\u2019s trial counsel, arranged to have him examined by a psychiatrist of his choice, Dr. B.F. Beran. That examination produced no evidence with which to contest the evaluation of the Clifton Perkins staff, and Mr. Kinsley so advised the court at the outset of the trial on October 18, 1982. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The court concluded that Thomas was competent to stand trial. Thomas was then re-arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to all of the charges pending against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cAfter the jury returned its verdicts, the State petitioned the court for permission to conduct a pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation of Thomas. It represented in that petition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201c \u20181. That the Defendant was evaluated at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center following his entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201c \u20182. That the findings of the Hospital Center are contained in a report to the Court dated February 4,1982;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201c \u20183. That it is desirable to supplement the original insanity evaluation with further interview(s) of the Defendant to develop material for presentation at sentencing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201c \u20184. That Dr. Michael Spodak, who participated in the insanity evaluation, can conduct such further interview with the Defendant at the Baltimore County Detention Center and can do so within a few days of a court order authorizing such evaluation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201c \u20185. That counsel for the Defendant has no objection to such an evaluation.\u2019 The court granted that petition, and Dr. Spodak interviewed Thomas on November 27, 1982. Before the interview began, Dr. Spodak advised Thomas that he had been \u2018retained by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office ... to evaluate him on certain issues concerning the death penalty and that depending on what he said and depending on my findings, I might very well be called as a witness to testify at the sentencing phase.\u2019 Dr. Spodak also testified that Thomas indicated that he understood that explanation and was willing to be interviewed at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cDr. Spodak wrote to the office of the State\u2019s Attorney on November 30, 1982. He stated that based upon his several interviews with Thomas as a member of the staff of Clifton Perkins, the interview he conducted on November 27, and the review of records associated with the case he was of the opinion to a reasonable medical certainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>that the murders of Donald and Sarah Spurling were not committed while the capacity of Thomas to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired as a result of mental incapacity, mental disorder, emotional disturbance or intoxication. He further opined that it is not unlikely that Thomas would engage in further criminal activities that would constitute a continuing threat to society. These opinions negated two possible circumstances which might mitigate against the death penalty pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g)(4) and (7).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">\u201cAt the sentencing hearing, the State called Dr. Spodak as a witness. Mr. Kinsley, who had been provided a copy of Dr. Spodak\u2019s report to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office on November 30, 1982, objected to any opinions being expressed by Dr. Spodak. He argued that he was under the impression that Dr. Spodak would interview Thomas as a neutral expert from the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center when he consented to the interview of Thomas following the jury\u2019s verdicts. He stressed that, had he been aware that Dr. Spodak had been employed by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office to conduct that evaluation, he would not have consented to the evaluation. The court overruled the objection and admitted Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony and his November 30, 1982 report____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cIn his petition for post conviction relief, Thomas asserted that Kinsley, in allowing him to be interviewed without counsel by Dr. Spodak post-verdict and pre-sentence, had rendered him ineffective assistance of counsel, prejudicing him at sentencing in violation of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. At the post conviction hearing, Thomas called Kinsley as his witness and questioned him extensively on his rationale for allowing Thomas to be re-examined by Spodak. Kinsley explained that he believed that Spodak\u2019s role in re-examining Thomas was that of a neutral expert from the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, and that Spodak would therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>be impartial. He further testified that he instructed Thomas to cooperate fully with Spodak in the hope that something beneficial to Thomas might come from the examination. During cross-examination, the State attempted to elicit testimony from Kinsley regarding the results which he had received of Dr. Beran\u2019s pretrial psychiatric examination of Thomas. The court sustained Thomas\u2019s objection to that line of questioning. Following ... the hearing ..., the hearing judge ... grant[ed] Thomas a new sentencing hearing but den[ied] him any post conviction relief from his convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 166-69, 599 A.2d at 1173-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In <em>Thomas II, </em>we held that the post conviction court committed reversible error when it sustained Thomas\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s attempt to elicit from Kinsley his understanding of the results of Dr. Beran\u2019s psychiatric evaluation. 325 Md. at 173, 599 A.2d at 1177. In reaching that conclusion, we rejected Thomas\u2019s assertion that any conclusions reached by Dr. Beran were protected from disclosure by Kinsley because of the attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 173-74, 599 A.2d at 1177-78. In light of the post conviction court\u2019s error and the standards by which we measure ineffective assistance of counsel, which were set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), we \u201cremandfed] the case for admission of that excluded testimony and further consideration, in light of that evidence, of the reasonableness of Kinsley\u2019s decision to permit Dr. Spodak\u2019s post-verdict, pre-sentence interview.\u201d <em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 173, 599 A.2d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We recognized that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court [had] stressed in <em>Strickland </em>that \u2018[a] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, <em>viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 173, 599 A.2d at 1177 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695) (emphasis in <em>Thomas II). </em>In remanding the case to the post convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tion court, we stated that \u201cwhat Dr. Beran related to Mr. Kinsley with regard to his psychiatric evaluation of Thomas was highly relevant to the reasonableness of the strategy employed by Kinsley in agreeing to permit Dr. Spodak to interview Thomas.\u201d <em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 175, 599 A.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">In <em>Thomas II, </em>in addition to Kinsley\u2019s decision to permit Dr. Spodak\u2019s post-verdict, pre-sentence interview, Thomas alleged that Kinsley rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to consult with another psychiatrist or psychologist prior to Thomas\u2019s sentencing hearing. 325 Md. at 178-79, 599 A.2d at 1179-80. Again, in light of the post conviction court\u2019s error and the teachings of <em>Strickland, </em>we held \u201cthat without the admission of evidence revealing what Kinsley knew from Dr. Beran\u2019s pre-trial psychiatric evaluation of Thomas, a court cannot fully evaluate Kinsley\u2019s effectiveness in this regard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 599 A.2d at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We, therefore, remanded the case to the post conviction court for admission of the erroneously excluded evidence and further consideration, in light of that evidence, of the reasonableness of both of these decisions by Kinsley.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On April 9, 1992, the circuit court held the supplemental post conviction hearing mandated by <em>Thomas II. </em>At this evidentiary hearing, Thomas presented testimony from two witnesses, Dr. Beran and R. Clark Kinsley. Dr. Beran testified on direct examination that prior to Thomas\u2019s trial he had never indicated to Kinsley that he, Dr. Beran, had reached any preliminary or informal conclusions adverse to the defense on insanity, competency, or any other psychiatric or psychological issues that might arise at the sentencing phase of Thomas\u2019s trial. In fact, Dr. Beran testified that he was \u201cquite optimistic in terms of ... providing very significant data to help [Thomas\u2019s] insanity defense,\u201d and that he had communicated this to Kinsley. Dr. Beran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>testified that he was prevented from reaching any formal conclusion because Kinsley had failed to provide the necessary \u201cleadership,\u201d particularly in failing to help Dr. Beran formulate the proper questions that he was to ask Thomas as the examining psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On cross-examination, Dr. Beran acknowledged that he had evaluated other defendants who had been charged with murder for the purpose of determining the validity of an insanity defense. Dr. Beran conceded that there was much correspondence from Kinsley that was materially inconsistent with Dr. Beran\u2019s current testimony that he could have provided Thomas with helpful opinions but for Kinsley\u2019s lack of \u201cleadership\u201d and support. Dr. Beran acknowledged receiving a letter written by Kinsley in which Kinsley authorized and urged Dr. Beran \u201cto do all needed and necessary tests and bring in any required discipline to augment [his psychiatric] studies in this case.\u201d Moreover, Kinsley stated in this letter that he was willing to obtain whatever court order necessary to authorize any such tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Dr. Beran also testified on cross-examination that he had made some partial findings, which he had conveyed to Kinsley, that supported Thomas\u2019s insanity defense. For example, Dr. Beran testified that \u201cfrom the interviews [with Thomas] I could see that the patient had what we call poor ego boundary definition. There was a problem consistent with possible occurrences of psychosis at different times, possible homosexual panic, possible paranoid kind of development, and that needed to be explored further.\u201d Dr. Beran stated repeatedly on cross-examination that he had conveyed these findings to Kinsley. When confronted with his only letter to Kinsley dated October 14, 1982, in which none of these findings is mentioned, Dr. Beran testified that he communicated these findings orally to Kinsley. During cross-examination, Dr. Beran acknowledged that in evaluating Thomas he had read a psychological evaluation report on Thomas written by Professor Robert Brown, a psychologist whom Kinsley had authorized Dr. Beran to retain. Brown\u2019s report indicated among other things that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cno indication for psychosis, for obvious CNS dysfunction, nor for major emotional distress.\u201d While disputing Brown\u2019s findings as being contrary to his findings that he purportedly had conveyed orally to Kinsley, Dr. Beran conceded, under questioning by both the State and the trial court, that Brown\u2019s findings were consistent with a conclusion that Thomas was not only sane but had a propensity for future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Following Dr. Beran\u2019s testimony, Thomas called Kinsley as his second witness. Under questioning by Thomas\u2019s post conviction counsel, Kinsley testified that Dr. Beran had communicated unequivocally his unsuitability to being called as a defense witness in Thomas\u2019s case. Kinsley testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u201cI do recall that [Dr. Beran] was very much obsessed with the thought that there was no help that he could give this Defendant. He asked me repeatedly don\u2019t call me as a witness, I can\u2019t help your man, and indeed it is possible I could be very harmful to him, very harmful. He emphasized that over and over again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In a colloquy with the trial court, Kinsley repeated his recollection of Dr. Beran\u2019s communications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: When did he say to you don\u2019t call me as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">\u201c[KINSLEY]: On my last \u2014 probably on the telephone, but specifically I know for sure when I looked him eyeball to eyeball in his office and pinned him down; I can\u2019t help you, I can\u2019t help you, don\u2019t call me as a witness, I could be dangerous, you wouldn\u2019t want me as a witness, I could hurt him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">\u201cWell, he convinced me that he could hurt [Thomas]. So, there was nothing that would support the insanity plea, number one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Contrary to Dr. Beran\u2019s testimony, Kinsley testified that he inquired of Dr. Beran whether he could help Thomas, should he be convicted, by testifying at the sentencing hearing on issues of mitigation. In recalling why he decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ed not to call Dr. Beran to testify at the sentencing hearing, Kinsley testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what he said and, more particularly, what he did. I think it was his body language more than what he said. When I was discussing what possible help he could be at the sentencing hearing and, in particular, what kind of person could we expect if he was ever released back into society, I recall very vividly the expression on his face as though he had bit into a sour lemon and squeezed up like he was experiencing a chill. When I asked him what kind of man he would be, he said, Bad, bad man. Now, you don\u2019t go back to a guy like that and put him on the stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Kinsley also testified to the impact that Professor Brown\u2019s psychological evaluation report on Thomas had on his decision to permit Dr. Spodak\u2019s post-verdict, pre-sentence interview of Thomas. During his testimony, Kinsley was referred to the following two particularly damning statements that appeared in Brown\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u201c[Thomas\u2019s] tendency to present himself as passively compliant, unassertive, and emotionally unreactive also leaves him susceptible to being overwhelmed by strong affect, with a potential for sudden explosive outbursts (as <em>e.g. </em>of angriness or rage) that may not seem to make much sense to himself or others. In the present instance any perceived threat to his life (or to manly self-esteem) might well have acted to trigger the uncontrolled explosion of fear and rage which apparently took place, and for which he seems to have little clear recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKf\">Referring to the first sentence, Kinsley testified that that sentence \u201cworried the devil out of me to have the judge hear that when I\u2019m asking in mitigation.\u201d Kinsley testified that in his opinion, the second sentence reflected adversely on Thomas\u2019s aggressiveness and potential for violence in the future. In fact, he testified that he believed \u201cit was dynamite against us.\u201d Kinsley\u2019s testimony indicated that his post-trial decision to permit Thomas to be interviewed by Dr. Spodak was influenced significantly by both Dr. Beran\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>communications and the report by Professor Brown. Kinsley testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\u201cWell, there was nothing to indicate that [Thomas\u2019s] personality changed so that he wouldn\u2019t have this sudden explosion of rage. So, I would be very naive to think that it couldn\u2019t possibly happen again. Then you couple that with what I found out from Dr. Beran, that if released to society what kind of person he would be, he would be bad, bad, you don\u2019t need much more to convince you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Kinsley\u2019s responses to the following questions asked of him during the supplemental post conviction hearing are particularly instructive on characterizing the reasonableness of his actions. Two of these questions were propounded by the post conviction court and answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Once [Dr. Beran] said to you I can\u2019t help you, don\u2019t call me to the stand, what steps did you take to get another doctor involved on behalf of your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201c[KINSLEY]: Well, ... the file contains a very fine written medical report from Professor Brown which lent no help to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\u201cSo we have three psychiatrists at Clifton T. Perkins saying he is sane,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] nothing more than a bland report really; we had two medical men that we brought into the case saying he is sane, there is nothing we can do to help you. The Public Defender doesn\u2019t have the money to shop around for a favorable report. I had enough information from five medical people to convince me that shopping around for a favorable report wasn\u2019t our business and I didn\u2019t do any more shopping or didn\u2019t do any shopping____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: ... What were you thinking at the time that you said sure, go ahead? Why did you let [Thomas] go [to the interview with Dr. Spodak]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201c[KINSLEY]: I was thinking that Dr. Spodak, who I thought was still an employee of the State of Maryland, that he was a disinterested, fair, impartial psychiatrist. I could get nothing out of my medical magicians and I thought that if we have Spodak go down who gave us a report initially, gave it to the State as well as a copy to me, it was a bland report, I thought there was a possibility, not having anything of my own to support insanity or let\u2019s say a mitigating medical opinion, I thought why not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Kinsley\u2019s responses to two questions propounded by James Gentry, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, are particularly salient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201c[MR. GENTRY]: Did you have the hopes of obtaining a favorable opinion or favorable diagnosis from Dr. Spodak at the time of sentencing when [Thomas] was being interviewed for the purposes of sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\u201c[KINSLEY]: Something to hang my hat on. Whether you call it a diagnosis or not, I don\u2019t know, but anything to convince poor Judge Hormes \u2014 I wish he were alive today to testify \u2014 something to convince him that the death penalty should not have been imposed against this poor person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">\u201c[MR. GENTRY]: Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. The reason that you were hopeful and the reason that you didn\u2019t object to Dr. Spodak\u2019s interview is because the other doctor\u2019s had given you nothing favorable and you were hopeful at least that you would have something favorable to hang your hat on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">\u201c[KINSLEY]: That is exactly the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Following the conclusion of Kinsley\u2019s testimony, the post conviction court heard final arguments and issued its ruling on April 20, 1992. The post-conviction court determined that Thomas was denied effective assistance of counsel when Kinsley permitted Dr. Spodak\u2019s post-verdict, pre-sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>tence interview, and for the second time, granted Thomas a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The post conviction court based its ruling on two grounds. First, the court stated that, in light of Dr. Beran\u2019s communications to Kinsley that he could not help Thomas and may in fact harm Thomas if called at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable defense attorney would allow even an independent psychiatric investigation. The post conviction court reasoned that \u201c[i]f your own expert says I\u2019ll hurt, then it is absurd to suggest that an independent qualified expert is going to find something that will help.\u201d For the second ground on which the post conviction court relied in granting Thomas relief, the court stated that, even if the decision to permit the interview by Dr. Spodak was permissible, Kinsley should have attended the interview and failing to do so rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Additionally, on the issue of whether Kinsley rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to consult with another psychiatrist or psychologist prior to Thomas\u2019s sentencing, which was the second question in <em>Thomas II </em>that was to be answered on remand, the post conviction court rejected this claim and denied Thomas any relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">After a brief review of the well established <em>Strickland </em>principles, we will address <em>in seriatim </em>each of the post conviction court\u2019s conclusions as to Kinsley\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">As noted earlier, the standards by which we measure whether Thomas received effective assistance of counsel were promulgated by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In <em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 170, 599 A.2d at 1176, we quoted the standard established by the <em>Strickland </em>Court at 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\"><em>\u201c \u2018A </em>convicted defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tion or death sentence has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">As noted in <em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 172, 599 A.2d at 1177, we first applied the <em>Strickland </em>tests in <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 496 A.2d 1074 (1985), revisited its teachings in <em>State v. Tichnell, </em>306 Md. 428, 509 A.2d 1179, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 995, 107 S.Ct. 598, 93 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986), <em>rehearing denied, </em>479 U.S. 1060, 107 S.Ct. 942, 93 L.Ed.2d 992 (1987); <em>State v.

State, </em>326 Md. 367, 605 A.2d 103 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">To establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, a \u201cdefendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>Bowers, </em>320 Md. at 424, 578 A.2d at 738. In <em>Thomas II, </em>we discussed the deferential review that is accorded to counsel\u2019s performance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201c \u2018Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>nate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">325 Md. at 171, 599 A.2d at 1176 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694-95) (citations omitted). Thus, as the Supreme Court cautioned in <em>Strickland </em>and we repeated in <em>Thomas II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201c[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695; 325 Md. at 172, 599 A.2d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Even if a defendant is able to satisfy the deficient performance prong of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-prong test, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 170, 599 A.2d at 1176. In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>we interpreted the prejudice component to require a substantial or significant possibility, rather than a reasonable probability, that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different. 320 Md. at 425-27, 578 A.2d at 738-39. We applied this prejudice standard in <em>Williams v. State, </em>326 Md. 367, 605 A.2d 103 (1992) and will not retreat from it in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">As we recognized in <em>Harris, </em>\u201c \u2018a court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u2019 \u201d 303 Md. at 696, 496 A.2d at 1079 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 699). The Supreme Court stated: \u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699. Finally, \u201cboth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. at 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d at 700; <em>Harris, </em>303 Md. at 696, 496 A.2d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In determining that Thomas received ineffective assistance of counsel, the post conviction court concluded that Kinsley\u2019s decision to allow the post-verdict, pre-sentence interview of his client by Dr. Spodak, after having received categorically adverse psychiatric opinions from Dr. Beran, fell below the objective standard of reasonableness demanded by Strickland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On remand, the post conviction court was confronted with two distinct versions of the nature of the communications that occurred nearly ten years ago between Dr. Beran and Kinsley. Dr. Beran testified that he was optimistic about providing data to support Thomas\u2019s insanity defense and denied that he had communicated any conclusions to Kinsley regarding possible sentencing issues. Directly contrary to Dr. Beran\u2019s testimony, Kinsley testified that Dr. Beran indicated that he could not provide support for Thomas\u2019s insanity plea. Moreover, Kinsley testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>repeatedly that Dr. Beran urged Kinsley not to call him as a defense witness at either the trial or the sentencing hearing, inasmuch as his testimony could harm Thomas. The post conviction court resolved this dispute by accepting Kinsley\u2019s version of the communications. The post conviction court stated: \u201cI am satisfied that Kinsley was told more than I cannot help. I\u2019m satisfied Kinsley was told my testimony would affirmatively harm him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In light of Dr. Beran\u2019s communications to Kinsley, the post conviction court concluded that no reasonably competent defense attorney would have permitted Thomas to be interviewed by an independent psychiatrist following the verdict and prior to sentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Were we to conclude that Kinsley\u2019s decision amounted to ineffectiveness of counsel, we would be ignoring several of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>tenets. The <em>Strickland </em>Court stated that the performance inquiry is simply \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. In addition, \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695. Moreover, in deciding ineffectiveness claims, we must apply a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments and \u201cjudge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">At the time Kinsley consented to Dr. Spodak\u2019s post-verdict, pre-sentence interview, Kinsley\u2019s client stood convicted of two first degree murders and was awaiting the sentencing hearing at which the State was seeking the death penalty. At that time, Thomas had been pronounced sane and competent to stand trial by four independent psychiatrists employed at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, one of whom was Dr. Spodak. Similarly, the experts brought into the case by Kinsley, Dr. Beran and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Professor Brown, could not provide any favorable medical opinions at the sentencing hearing. Kinsley recognized that he did not have unlimited funds to shop around for a favorable report. At the time Kinsley made the strategic and tactical decision to allow Thomas to be interviewed by Dr. Spodak, he was trying to obtain something that he did not have, <em>i.e., </em>a favorable medical opinion which he could use at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Only by viewing Kinsley\u2019s decision in a vacuum, by using \u201cthe distorting effects of hindsight,\u201d 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694, and by failing to accord a heavy measure of deference to Kinsley\u2019s judgment, <em>Id. </em>at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695, could we conclude that Kinsley\u2019s decision to permit the Dr. Spodak interview was not a reasonable tactical decision. Each of these qualifications is contrary to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>teachings. We, therefore, reject Thomas\u2019s assertion that Kinsley\u2019s decision to permit the Dr. Spodak interview was not within the wide range of professionally reasonable judgments allowable under <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In <em>Thomas II, </em>325 Md. at 173, 599 A.2d at 1177, we hypothesized: \u201c[I]f Kinsley had been told by Dr. Beran that Thomas suffered from no mental impairments and exhibited the likelihood of future danger to society, then Kinsley\u2019s decision to allow further examination in the hope of obtaining favorable diagnosis may well have been reasonable.\u201d Today, we answer affirmatively our own hypothetical and end Thomas\u2019s \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking.\u201d Based on the testimony introduced upon remand and the post conviction court\u2019s findings of fact, we hold that Kinsley\u2019s decision to permit the post-verdict, pre-sentence interview was a reasonable tactical decision consistent with Thomas\u2019s constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In granting Thomas a new sentencing hearing, the post conviction court alternatively ruled that, even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>decision to permit the interview by Dr. Spodak was reasonable, Kinsley nevertheless rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to attend the interview. For the reason that Thomas has not satisfied either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test regarding this decision by Kinsley, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Kinsley testified that he believed the post-verdict interview with Dr. Spodak would be conducted in a manner similar to the normal pretrial competency or insanity evaluations, in which impartial psychiatrists employed by the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital conduct the examination. Kinsley testified that counsel normally did not attend those psychiatric evaluations. Due to Dr. Spodak\u2019s affiliation with the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital, Kinsley testified that he saw no reason to protect Thomas from an ostensibly neutral psychiatrist and testified further that he believed it was beneficial for Dr. Spodak to interview Thomas alone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Similar to Kinsley\u2019s decision to allow the post-verdict interview, the decision not to attend the interview was a reasonable strategic decision. As we previously noted, the <em>Strickland </em>Court stated that \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d In light of his testimony regarding the reasons why he did not attend the interview and <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>heavy measure of deference accorded to Kinsley\u2019s judgments, we hold that Kinsley\u2019s decision not to attend the interview was a professionally reasonable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Kinsley\u2019s decision not to attend the interview was professionally unreasonable, Thomas has made no showing of prejudice regarding Kinsley\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>attend the interview. As we noted in <em>Harris, </em>to satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>test a defendant must show both that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>and </em>that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. 303 Md. at 696, 496 A.2d at 1079. To satisfy the prejudice prong, Thomas must show that there is a substantial or significant possibility that had Kinsley attended the interview the result of the sentencing hearing would have been different. <em>Bowers, </em>320 Md. at 427, 578 A.2d at 739. In his brief, Thomas failed to address the issue of prejudice regarding Kinsley\u2019s decision not to attend the interview. At oral argument, Thomas similarly failed to point to any evidence of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Thus, Thomas has failed to satisfy both the deficient performance component and the prejudice component of the <em>Strickland </em>test regarding Kinsley\u2019s decision not to attend the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On the second issue left open on remand, whether Kinsley rendered ineffective assistance by failing to consult with another psychiatrist or psychologist prior to Thomas\u2019s sentencing hearing, the post conviction court rejected Thomas\u2019s claim and denied him any post conviction relief on that ground. The post conviction court resolved a dispute between the testimony of Dr. Beran and Kinsley when it found that Kinsley did consult Dr. Beran regarding sentencing issues. The post conviction court found that Kinsley decided not to call Dr. Beran or Professor Brown as defense witnesses as their testimony might harm Thomas. Having consulted with Dr. Beran with regard to sentencing issues and examined Professor Brown\u2019s psychological evaluation report on Thomas, Kinsley acted reasonably in not seeking to consult another psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Similar to Kinsley\u2019s other tactical decisions which Thomas has attacked, we agree with the post conviction court and hold that Kinsley\u2019s decision not to consult with another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>psychiatrist or psychologist prior to the sentencing hearing was a professionally reasonable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DENY THE PETITION FOR POST CONVICTION RELIEF.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">.

BELL, Judge, in which ELDRIDGE, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">I was one of the dissenters in <em>Thomas II. See State v. Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 193, 599 A.2d 1171, 1187 (1992). At that time, I was of the opinion that the record was \u201cabundantly clear that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel to petitioner\u2019s prejudice\u201d and that the only effect of remanding the case, as we did, was to \u201cmake even more obvious how ineffective trial counsel\u2019s performance really was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193-94, 599 A.2d at 1187 (footnote omitted). The record developed on remand convinces me that I was correct on both counts. Therefore, respectfully, I once again dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">It is not necessary to repeat all that I said in my prior dissenting opinion. In view of the majority opinion, however, I find it necessary to reiterate and, perhaps, expand upon a couple of points.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">As to the court\u2019s first ground for granting post conviction relief \u2014 that a reasonably competent defense attorney, equipped with the information Kinsley had as to his client\u2019s psychiatric makeup, would not have allowed even an independent psychiatric investigation \u2014 the majority is convinced that the decision to permit the petitioner to be interviewed by a psychiatrist proposed by the State was, under the circumstances <em>sub judice, </em>a strategic and reasonable one, which, being within the wide range of professionally reasonable judgments, was allowable under <em>Strickland v. Wash</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>ington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Majority op. at 560. In so concluding, the majority purports to apply \u201cseveral of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>tenets.\u201d Op. at 559. In particular, it notes that \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on the investigation.\u201d Op. at 561, quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">While focusing on that \u201ctenet\u201d is appropriate, the majority\u2019s application of it in this case is not. The majority proceeds as if the only relevant inquiry is whether, given the prior psychiatric evaluations, it was reasonable for defense counsel to permit a further psychiatric investigation of his client by yet another psychiatrist. To the majority, it is apparently irrelevant whether the psychiatrist who is to conduct the evaluation is independent. I see it differently. However bleak the prognosis of the psychiatrists retained by the defense may be and however anxious defense counsel may be to obtain something favorable for sentencing purposes, different considerations obtain when defense counsel knows that a psychiatrist is independent than when he or she knows that the psychiatrist is not. Trial counsel recognized this to be true when he testified that, had he known that Dr. Spodak was a State agent he would not have permitted him to examine his client. Notwithstanding that counsel asked no questions of the State concerning the capacity in which Dr. Spodak was to act and, indeed, did nothing to confirm the assumptions he made as to the nature of the examination the State sought, the majority finds that trial counsel\u2019s decision to permit the examination was reasonable and entitled to deference. In so doing, it overlooks, and excuses, a most basic and critical omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>In my opinion, a strategic decision, not subject to sanction as ineffective assistance of counsel, is one made after investigating and understanding available options and their relevant merits and/or consequences. Given the circumstances of this case, it is clear to me that trial counsel\u2019s decision to allow his client to be examined by Dr. Spodak was not such a decision. But, even if it appropriately could be characterized as a strategic decision, as I said in dissent in <em>Thomas II, </em>the decision by trial counsel in this case \u201cmost assuredly was not one made after a \u2018thorough investigation of the law and facts relevant to plausible options.\u2019 \u201d 325 Md. at 202, 599 A.2d at 1191, quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">An alternative holding of the post conviction court was that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by permitting his client to be interviewed by Dr. Spodak alone. Rejecting that conclusion, the majority relies very heavily on the testimony of trial counsel as to why he did not attend the examination. That testimony revealed that trial counsel made certain assumptions about the nature of the examination as well as the capacity in which Dr. Spodak was acting. As we have seen, it did not reveal, nor even suggest, however, that trial counsel made any inquiries to justify the assumptions he made. As was true, therefore, with regard to the main holding, the majority excuses as \u201ca professionally reasonable judgment\u201d basic, and critical, omissions made by trial counsel. In my opinion, in this regard as well, trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The majority suggests that even if it were error for counsel to have permitted the interview to go forward without being present, the petitioner failed to produce any evidence to prove that he was prejudiced. I do not agree. Counsel testified very clearly and, indeed, emphatically, that, had he been aware of the nature of the evaluation Dr. Spodak would do and for whom Dr. Spodak was acting, he would not have allowed his client to be interviewed. Dr. Spodak testified that before conducting the examination, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>advised the petitioner that he was acting on behalf of the State. It is clear, therefore, that the evidence which formed the basis for the death sentence in this case would not have been generated had trial counsel been present; taking him at his word \u2014 deferring to his judgment, if you will \u2014 clearly he would have terminated the examination before it started.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Judge Eldridge has authorized me to state that he joins in the views stated herein. He also continues to adhere to the views he set forth, in dissent, in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 340-352, 483 A.2d 6, 30-36 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985) and in <em>Thomas II.
