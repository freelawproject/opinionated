The allegations of misconduct arose out of Powell\u2019s representation of Emil P. Taxay, M.D., in a civil suit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relating to the dismissal of Dr. Taxay from the staff of the Jess Parrish Memorial Hospital in Titusville, Florida. For his conduct prior to January 1, 1987,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the petition alleged that Powell, in prosecuting the <em>Taxay </em>case, had violated Disciplinary Rules (DR) 2-106 and 5-103 by entering into an unreasonable and excessive fee agreement with his client. In addition, for his conduct subsequent to January 1, 1987, the petition alleged that Powell had violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>1.5, 1.7(b), 1.8(a), 1.8(j), 1.15, 8.1(b), 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Maryland Code (1989), \u00a7\u00a7 10-302,10-304, 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, and various rules under Subtitle BU of the Maryland Rules, which govern attorney trust accounts. On August 30, 1991, Bar Counsel filed an amendment to the petition that withdrew the charges that Powell violated Md.Bus.Occ.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-302, 10-304, 10-306, any rules under Subtitle BU, and the current version of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>On April 9, 1991, pursuant to Md.Rule BV9(b), we ordered that the charges be transmitted to Judge Lawrence H. Rushworth of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Following numerous procedural delays,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a hearing on the merits of the charges was conducted on November 6 and 7, 1991, on February 18 and 20, 1992, and concluded with closing arguments on March 26, 1992. Judge Rushworth\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law along with a record of the proceedings were filed in this Court on May 11, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">By written agreement, dated February 7, 1984, and executed February 9, 1984, Powell entered into a contingency fee agreement with Dr. Taxay to represent the physician in an action against the Jess Parrish Memorial Hospital because of his summary suspension as a member of the medical staff at the hospital. The record indicates that Powell was a close personal friend of both Dr. Taxay and his wife, Hester Taxay. The civil suit was expected to involve many complex issues and require extensive prepara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tion, discovery, and travel. In fact, Powell filed an eighty-three page complaint against forty defendants in March, 1985, in the federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">On January 23, 1987, Dr. Taxay died. Prior to his death, Dr. Taxay made it known to his wife and Powell that he wanted the civil suit to continue, and on March 19,1987, his wife, as personal representative of his estate, was substituted as a party-plaintiff for Dr. Taxay. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Taxay wrote Powell in April, 1987, and again in June, 1987, stating that she had \u201clost the zest for pursuing\u201d the civil suit and directing Powell to arrange for a settlement of the case. Powell told Mrs. Taxay that it would be ill-advised to simply dismiss the action, as that might leave both the estate and her open to a countersuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">During the fall of 1987, Powell made arrangements for an aggregate settlement in the amount of $82,500.00, with four of the five groups of defendants contributing various amounts toward that total, in return for an order of dismissal with prejudice of the civil suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The settlement checks were received by Powell over a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">During the time in which he received settlement proceeds on behalf of the estate of Dr. Taxay and Mrs. Taxay, Powell maintained two bank accounts in connection with his law practice. A firm operating account was maintained at Sovran Bank, and a second account was maintained at Fund for Government Investors, Inc. Powell intended the Fund for Government Investors account to be the sole depository of settlement proceeds in the <em>Taxay </em>case. Powell received a total of nine settlement checks. The first three checks that he received were deposited into the Sovran account, and the last six checks that he received were deposited into the Fund for Government Investors account.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The first settlement check in the amount of $12,500.00<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was deposited in Powell\u2019s Sovran account on November 3, 1987. Two other checks, in the amount of $50,000.00<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 2,500.00<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, were deposited in Powell\u2019s Sovran account on November 4, 1987. The other six settlement checks received by Powell were deposited in the Fund for Government Investors account. On November 20, 1987, three of these six checks, each in the amount of $2,500.00<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, were deposited in the Fund for Government Investors account. Two of the remaining three checks, each in the amount of $2,500.00<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, were deposited on December 21, 1987, in the Fund for Government Investors account. The remaining settlement check in the amount of $5,000.00 was deposited on December 28, 1987, in the Fund for Government Investors account.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Prior to the initial two deposits into the Sovran account on November 3 and 4, 1987, of settlement proceeds totaling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>$65,000.00,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it was undisputed that the Sovran account had a balance of $2,365.52. The Sovran account ending balance was $14,420.97 on November 30, 1987, $4,762.28 on December 31, 1987, and $2,619.51 on January 29, 1988. Further, prior to the deposits into the Fund for Government Investors account on November 20, 1987, and December 21 and 28,1987, of the remaining $17,500<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in settlement proceeds, it was undisputed that the Fund for Government Investors account had a balance of $110.76. The ending balance of the Fund for Government Investors account was $5,910.16 on December 31, 1987, $363.79 on January 31, 1988, and $64.28 on February 29, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Following the dismissal with prejudice on March 17,1988, of the civil suit, there were numerous telephone conversations and letters written between Powell and Mrs. Taxay pertaining to disbursement of the settlement proceeds. A chronology of the correspondence is summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On March 23, 1988, there was a 25-minute telephone conversation during which Powell and Mrs. Taxay discussed the settlement of the case and the disbursement of the funds. Having not heard from Powell, Mrs. Taxay, in a letter to Powell dated July 17, 1988, referenced their telephone call of March 23, 1988, in which she was told that an accounting would be forthcoming, and requested both disbursement of her money and an accounting. In a handwritten letter dated August 16, 1988,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Powell replied and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>counted his financial, family, and health problems. In this letter, Powell referenced a letter, which contained an accounting and an unsigned promissory note, that was purportedly mailed to Mrs. Taxay on April 8, 1988, but was never received by her. Powell, reiterating his letter of April 8, 1988, that was never received, requested that payment of the amount due Mrs. Taxay from the settlement proceeds be deferred for Powell\u2019s use in the form of a personal loan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Powell sent Mrs. Taxay another letter dated September 13,1988, and enclosed a copy of his letter dated April 8, 1988, a signed promissory note, which Mrs. Taxay, in a telephone conversation occurring sometime after August 16, 1988, and before September 13, 1988, had authorized him to sign, and an accounting of the settlement proceeds.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In a letter dated September 18, 1988, Mrs. Taxay replied to Powell\u2019s letter of September 13, 1988, and indicated that, according to the accounting he had sent, Powell had made a $400.00 error in the amount of the promissory note for the amount which she was entitled to receive from the settlement proceeds. Powell replied to this letter by letter dated November 1, 1988. In this letter, Powell recounted the health problems of his parents and enclosed a revised promissory note for the correct amount due Mrs. Taxay from the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The principal of the promissory note was due on January 2,1989, together with interest accruing from March 1,1988, at the annual rate of 10%. When nothing was paid to Mrs. Taxay during January 1989, she wrote two letters to Powell during February and March of 1989. Powell replied with a letter dated April 14, 1989, which recounted his continuing financial and family health problems, including the death of his only brother in April, 1989, and enclosed a check for the interest due on the promissory note. In a letter to Powell dated May 12, 1989, Mrs. Taxay indicated that Powell\u2019s check had bounced due to insufficient funds. By letter dated May 17, 1989, Powell wrote to Mrs. Taxay that the check was drawn against uncollected funds, and he believed that the check would now be paid. In this letter, Powell told Mrs. Taxay to redeposit the check, which she did. This time the check was honored. Having not heard from Powell since receipt of the letter dated May 17, 1989, Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Taxay wrote the Attorney Grievance Commission in mid-August 1989, and initiated the process which has culminated with this opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">After making his findings of fact, Judge Rushworth concluded that Bar Counsel had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that Powell had violated the following rules: DR 2-106, DR 5-103, or Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7(b), 1.8(a), 1.8(j), 8.1(b), and 8.4(c). Judge Rushworth did conclude that the current version of Rule 1.15(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, several BU Rules relating to attorney trust accounts, and \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 and 10-306 of the Bus.Occ. Article had been violated. Both Bar Counsel and Powell filed exceptions to Judge Rushworth\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Bar Counsel excepts to Judge Rushworth\u2019s conclusions that Rules 1.8(a), 8.1(b) and 8.4(c) were not violated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Both Bar Counsel and Powell except to Judge Rushworth\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>elusion that the current version of Rule 1.15(a), any Md. Rules from Subtitle BU, and Md.Bus.Occ.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 and 10-306 were violated.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Powell asserts that this error is \u201cof such magnitude as to vitiate the judge\u2019s conclusion of a violation.\u201d Bar Counsel maintains, however, that a prior version of Md. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), which was substituted by Bar Counsel in the amended petition, was violated, notwithstanding Judge Rushworth\u2019s erroneous conclusion based on the current version of that Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We initially make several observations including the precept that this Court has original and complete jurisdiction over disciplinary proceedings. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 687, 480 A.2d 807, 817-18 (1984); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1973); Md.Rule BV9(b). \u201cAs this is an original proceeding filed in this Court, we [make] an independent, detailed review of the complete record with particular reference to the evidence relating to the disputed factual finding.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>269 Md. at 516, 307 A.2d at 680-81. <em>See also Bar Ass\u2019n v. Carruth, </em>271 Md. 720, 727, 319 A.2d 532, 535 (1974). Moreover, \u201cthe ultimate decision as to whether an attorney has or has not been guilty of misconduct is to be made by us____\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 122, 383 A.2d 58, 61-62 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In addition, Md.Rule BV10(d) requires Bar Counsel to prove by clear and convincing evidence the factual determinations essential to establishing its case against the attorney. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>322 Md, 603, 606 589 A.2d 52, 53 (1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608, 541 A.2d 966, 968 (1988); <em>Marshall, </em>269 Md. at 516, 307 A.2d at 681. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>trial court\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 402, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991); <em>Marshall, </em>269 Md. at 516, 307 A.2d at 680. On the other hand, an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding need only establish factual matters in defense of the attorney\u2019s position by the preponderance of evidence, including whether mitigating circumstances existed at the time of the alleged misconduct. <em>Bakas, </em>322 Md. at 606, 589 A.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Inasmuch as Bar Counsel, by its amended petition, withdrew the charges that Powell violated Md.Bus.Occ.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-302, 10-304, 10-306, the rules under Subtitle BU and the current version of Rule 1.15(a), we sustain both parties exceptions to the trial court\u2019s conclusions that Powell violated these particular statutes and rules. Nonetheless, having charged Powell in the amended petition with violating the version of Rule 1.15(a) which was in effect between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 1988, Bar Counsel maintains that Judge Rushworth's findings support a conclusion that Powell intentionally and knowingly misappropriated client funds for which disbarment is appropriate. Powell concedes that his client\u2019s funds were misappropriated, but that such misappropriation was not known to him and was unintentional due to the undiscovered mis-deposit by his office personnel of settlement checks into his Sovran account rather than into the Fund for Government Investors account.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Powell explained his theory of the undiscovered misdeposit as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Powell claimed that all three checks, which were deposited in the Sovran account on November 3 and 4,1987<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>, were mis-deposited by his secretary, who at that time was a temporary employee hired from a temporary secretarial service agency. Powell claimed he filled out a deposit slip for the Fund for Government Investors for the $12,500.00 check drawn on Comstock\u2019s account and gave it to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>secretary with instructions to deposit the check in that account. The undisputed evidence shows that this check was deposited in the Sovran account, the firm\u2019s operating account, on November 3, 1987, by use of a deposit slip for the Sovran account. Powell claimed that he failed to notice this mis-deposit for two reasons. First, he confused the name of the drawer, Comstock, with ComScope, another client of his at that time. Second, the letter, in which the check from Comstock was enclosed, referred to the check as being drawn on the Freemont Indemnity Company rather than Comstock. Powell similarly claimed his office personnel again mis-deposited the other two checks, totalling $52,500.00 in settlement proceeds, in the Sovran account on November 4, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Powell maintained that, shortly thereafter, he realized that $52,500.00 of the settlement proceeds were mis-deposited in the Sovran account. Powell then determined by rough calculation that the attorney fees and unpaid expenses far exceeded the mis-deposited $52,500.00. Also by rough calculation, Powell determined that Mrs. Taxay was due approximately $12,000.00 from the $82,500.00 settlement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Powell, thereafter, deposited the remaining settlement checks in the Fund for Government Investors account on November 20,1987, and December 21 and 28, 1987. By the end of 1987, Powell believed he had placed $30,000.00 of the settlement proceeds in the Fund for Government Investors account.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Following the formal dismissal of the <em>Taxay </em>case on March 17, 1988, Powell and Mrs. Taxay discussed the dismissal of the case and distribution of the proceeds in a telephone conversation on March 23, 1988. Some two weeks later Powell mailed a letter dated April 8, 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>which enclosed an accounting, an expense itemization and an unsigned promissory note. This letter requested a loan from Mrs. Taxay of her share of the settlement proceeds and included the promissory note for her inspection. <em>See </em>footnote 14. The promissory note was in the amount of $12,242.52 which Powell had calculated to be the amount owed to Mrs. Taxay. She never received this letter and in July, 1988, wrote to Powell requesting her money and an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">At the time he requested the loan from Mrs. Taxay in his letter dated April 8, 1988, Powell claimed he had no knowledge that the $12,500.00 was mis-deposited in the Sovran account. Further, Powell claimed that he had not received, or if received, had not reviewed any of the statements of the account from the Fund for Government Investors prior to seeking the loan from Mrs. Taxay. Consequently, at the time he wrote the letter dated April 8,1988, Powell claimed to have no knowledge of the fact that he had already depleted that money. Bar Counsel claimed that the copy of the letter dated April 8, 1988, was prepared and mailed to Mrs. Taxay long after April 8, and was a sham to cover Powell\u2019s defalcations.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">After several letters were exchanged between Powell and Mrs. Taxay during the summer of 1988, Powell claimed that Mrs. Taxay, in a telephone conversation occurring between August 16, 1988, and September 13, 1988, assented to lending her settlement proceeds to him. Whereupon, Powell mailed to Mrs. Taxay a letter dated September 13, 1988, and enclosed a copy of his letter of April 8, 1988, and the signed promissory note, which represented the loan. Powell claimed that only after Mrs. Taxay assented to the loan and he sought to remove the $12,500.00 from the Fund for Government Investors account, did he realize that the funds had been misappropriated. Powell claimed he was shocked to realize at that time that the money was not in the Fund for Government Investors account. Powell then tried to rectify the misappropriation that occurred as a result of the undiscovered mis-deposit nearly one year earlier. After he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>became aware of the misappropriation, Powell established a separate account at Crestar Bank, and into which, he deposited $18,000.00 on October 27, 1988.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Powell claimed that he repaid Mrs. Taxay on September 25, 1989, not in response to Bar Counsel\u2019s letter of August 28, 1989, which indicated that Mrs. Taxay had filed a complaint against him, but rather he repaid Mrs. Taxay on the day funds were made available to him from a loan approved in mid-September, 1989, by the Household Finance Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Powell suggests that the misappropriation was the result of negligently supervising his office personnel similar to that found in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Dacy, </em>313 Md. 1, 542 A.2d 841 (1988) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldberg, </em>292 Md. 650, 441 A.2d 338 (1982), for which a reprimand or a short suspension is all that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Bar Counsel views Powell\u2019s conduct in a very different light. Bar Counsel claims that Powell failed to deposit Mrs. Taxay\u2019s funds in a separate account in violation of Rule 1.15(a). Bar Counsel claims that Powell then misappropriated Mrs. Taxay\u2019s share of the settlement proceeds, by dissipating all of the settlement funds by February, 1988, in violation of Rule 1.15. Bar Counsel claims that Powell then engaged in a sham transaction, by requesting a loan from Mrs. Taxay of her share of the settlement proceeds after knowingly misappropriating the funds, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). Bar Counsel asserts that Powell\u2019s conduct is similar to that found in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Boehm, </em>293 Md. 476, 446 A.2d 52 (1982) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 441 A.2d 328 (1982) for which disbarment is appropriate. We do not agree with either Bar Counsel\u2019s or Powell\u2019s characterization of the misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>As this Court has stated all too often, \u201c[misappropriation of funds by an attorney involves moral turpitude; it . is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608-09, 541 A.2d 966, 969 (1988). <em>See also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Lazerow, </em>320 Md. 507, 578 A.2d 779 (1990); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Boehm, </em>293 Md. 476, 446 A.2d 52 (1982); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 441 A.2d 328 (1982); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Burka, </em>292 Md. 221, 438 A.2d 514 (1981); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 383 A.2d 58 (1974); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Judge Rushworth made a finding that is dispositive of Bar Counsel\u2019s characterization of the misappropriation, unless of course, it is clearly erroneous. Judge Rushworth expressly found that \u201c[although there was ample evidence of disorganization and inefficiency in his practice, there was no clear and convincing evidence of \u2018dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\u2019 on the part of Powell in dealings with his client Hester Taxay.\u201d This Court has often stated that \u201c[i]t is elementary that a trier of fact may elect to pick and choose which evidence [or story] to rely upon.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 684, 480 A.2d 807, 816 (1984). It is clear that Judge Rushworth, by making this finding, believed Powell\u2019s theory regarding the undiscovered mis-deposit. The record sufficiently supports this finding, and therefore, it is not clearly erroneous. Consequently, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the trial court\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 8.4(c) is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Although Powell did not intentionally misappropriate Mrs. Taxay\u2019s funds, we do not accept Powell\u2019s characterization of the misappropriation as being similar to that which occurred in <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Dacy, supra. </em>In <em>Goldberg, </em>an attorney failed to adequately supervise his office manager, who negligently performed her duties. 292 Md. at 651-53, 441 A.2d at 339-40. As a result, the attorney\u2019s escrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>account became overdrawn. 292 Md. at 656, 441 A.2d at 341. In <em>Goldberg, </em>the Court summarized the facts which led to the misappropriation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cThere came a time while in the employment of Mr. Goldberg that [his office manager,] Mrs. Ofterdinger[,] failed to prepare the necessary pleadings, documents or papers required to be done. As she got increasingly behind, she would remove the files and not calendar them, preventing the lack of progress on those files from coming to the attention of Mr. Goldberg. In order to cover her inactivity on these files, Mrs. Ofterdinger then started going through all of the office mail, removing any letters that had reference to the work that had not been done. She also removed any phone messages and intercepted calls to Mr. Goldberg. She made excuses or misrepresentations as to why the work had not been done in some instances and falsely represented that the work had been done in others. Checks received from clients were not deposited in the appropriate account, and from the exhibits it would appear that unauthorized checks were drawn by Mrs. Ofterdinger for improper purposes. She further intercepted the letters from the Attorney Grievance Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">292 Md. at 652, 441 A.2d at 339. In <em>Dacy, supra, </em>an attorney failed to properly instruct an employee on arrangements she was to make with a savings and loan association that the attorney represented in real estate settlement matters. 313 Md. at 2, 542 A.2d at 841. As a result, the employee set up a firm operating account through which monies destined for the attorney\u2019s escrow account would pass. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3, 542 A.2d at 841-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">A review of the record in this case demonstrates that <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Dacy </em>are inapposite. In his deposition, Powell testified that he did not always receive his bank statements for the Sovran account and the Fund for Government Investors account. When questioned as to why he failed to discover the mis-deposit and lack of funds in the Fund for Government Investors account, Powell stated that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>not check his bank statements; \u201c[he simply] did not pay any attention to that account.\u201d Powell testified that he maintained in his head what money was owed to Mrs. Taxay and where it was located. In his deposition, Powell acknowledged he was wrong not to make sure the money was in the Fund for Government Investors account.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">At the hearing in front of the Inquiry Panel, Powell testified that he rarely is in his office and travels throughout the country on an average of two to three days a week. We find the following colloquy very instructive on characterizing Powell\u2019s misappropriation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201c[MR. POWELL]: So, when checks come in and things come into the office, no matter who they are from, I usually ask my secretary to deposit them. Now, sometimes they put the damned things in the wrong accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cMR. MURPHY: Well, what did you then do at that time, what was your method for double-checking to make sure that checks of that nature were put into the right account? This is after the fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201cMR. POWELL: My secretary is required to give me the deposit slips and I would remove the money if it were in the wrong account and place it where it is supposed to be. I don\u2019t recall doing it in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cMR. MURPHY: But you\u2019re saying that your practice at the time, in '87 and in \u201988 and today and all the time in between, was to be very careful to make sure that your secretary put funds in the proper accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cMR. POWELL: No, I didn\u2019t say that. What I would do is, I would give them instructions to put the money into specific accounts. And I have to admit to you that I was not employing the brightest of all people during this period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">\u201cMR. MURPHY: And so, knowing that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u201cMR. POWELL: Lots of time they would make mistakes and when I came back from wherever I was, I would go through my IN box and the deposit slips would be there and if I found that a deposit had been erroneously made, I would transfer the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>What distinguishes this case from <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Dacy, </em>is that, unlike the attorneys in those cases, Powell was on notice as to the probability that Mrs. Taxay\u2019s funds may be mis-deposited. We find Powell\u2019s conduct similar to the attorneys\u2019 conduct in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Berger, </em>326 Md. 129, 604 A.2d 58 (1992) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kramer, </em>325 Md. 39, 599 A.2d 100 (1991). In both <em>Berger </em>and <em>Kramer, </em>neither attorney intentionally misappropriated client funds, but both attorneys were found to have been grossly negligent in misappropriating their clients\u2019 funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">In <em>Berger, </em>the attorney failed to maintain individual client ledgers or even a general client ledger. 323 Md. 428, 431, 593 A.2d 1103, 1105 (1991). The only evidence of any accounting \u201ccontrol\u201d by Berger was his testimony that he kept at his desk a tally sheet on which he recorded the fees earned that were in his escrow account. <em>Id. </em>From the fees recorded on his tally sheet, he subtracted the incremental withdrawals as he made them. <em>Id. </em>This Court upheld the trial court\u2019s characterization of Berger\u2019s actions as \u201c \u2018gross and wanton negligence amounting to a total disdain and disregard for his duties to safeguard his client\u2019s money.\u2019 \u201d 326 Md. at 130-31, 604 A.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Kramer, </em>the attorney, as a result of personal problems, abandoned his law practice and his concomitant responsibility for managing his escrow accounts. 325 Md. at 45-51, 599 A.2d at 103-06. Consequently, many of Kramer\u2019s records of his escrow account disappeared and those he kept were woefully deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 49-51, 599 A.2d at 105-06. This Court characterized Kramer\u2019s conduct as gross negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 599 A.2d at 106-07. Even if we conclude that Powell\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of gross negligence, to repeat this Court\u2019s words from another misappropriation case, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 355, 587 A.2d 511, 521 (1991), Powell\u2019s conduct is \u201cperilously close\u201d to gross negligence and more culpable than the conduct in <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Dacy, supra. </em>Powell\u2019s exception to the contrary is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Bar counsel also maintains that, even if the money was not knowingly misappropriated and the loan was not a sham, then the loan resulted in an improper conflict of interest in violation of Rule 1.8(a). The trial court made two findings relating to Powell\u2019s use of Mrs. Taxay\u2019s share of the settlement as a loan. First, the trial court found that the loan \u201cwas a fair and equitable personal loan to a close friend.\u201d Second, the trial court expressly found that Mrs. Taxay assented to Powell\u2019s use of her share of the settlement proceeds as a personal loan when she wrote Powell, in a letter dated September 18, 1988, requesting a note in the correct amount.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Bar Counsel asserts that Mrs. Taxay was not advised to seek the advice of independent counsel and given the opportunity to do so. Moreover, Bar Counsel asserts that Mrs. Taxay did not assent to the loan, but rather, acquiesced to the loan out of sheer frustration over Powell\u2019s failure to identify and disburse her share of the settlement. Mrs. Taxay did not testify in the hearing before Judge Rush-worth, but Bar Counsel uses her testimony before the Inquiry Panel and at her deposition in support of its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Before the Inquiry Panel and at her deposition, Mrs. Taxay testified that the first time she knew of the loan request was when she received the signed promissory note, which was made out in the wrong amount, in the mail. Moreover, she testified that if she had the opportunity to refuse the loan, she would have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Throughout the proceedings, Powell testified that only after Mrs. Taxay assented to the loan by telephone did he sign the promissory note. Moreover, Powell repeatedly testified that, in this telephone conversation, he advised Mrs. Taxay to seek the advice of her attorney in Montana concerning the loan, in accordance with Rule 1.8(a)(2). This attorney in Montana was the same attorney who had handled Dr. Taxay\u2019s estate, assisted Mrs. Taxay in her execution of numerous releases from the underlying civil suit in federal district court, and been in contact with Powell on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Again, it is elementary that a trier of fact may pick and choose which evidence to rely upon. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 684, 480 A.2d 807, 816 (1984). It is obvious that Judge Rushworth accepted Powell\u2019s version of events. There is sufficient evidence in the record to support this finding, and therefore, it is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Furthermore, the record discloses that the loan was made at an annual interest rate of 10%, accruing from a date prior to final dismissal of the <em>Taxay </em>case. The <em>Taxay </em>case was formally dismissed on March 17,1988. Testifying as to why he selected March 1, 1988, as the date from which interest was to accrue, Powell stated: \u201cWell the case closed in mid to late March. I ... am not very good at computing those things, so I didn\u2019t want to use the exact date. It didn\u2019t seem to me fair to use April 1st, so I went back rather than forward.\u201d Based on a review of the record, we cannot say that Judge Rushworth\u2019s finding that this loan was fair and equitable is clearly erroneous. Consequently, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the trial court\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 1.8(a) is overruled.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Bar Counsel\u2019s final exception is to Judge Rushworth\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 8.1(b). Bar Counsel complains that, prior to the Inquiry Panel hearing, his office was never advised by Powell that he had an account at the Fund for Government Investors even though he was notified by Bar Counsel that the Inquiry Panel would be considering his deposit of the funds from the settlement of the <em>Taxay </em>case. Bar Counsel further complains that, by not producing account records from the Fund for Government Investors at the Inquiry Panel hearing, Powell failed to comply with a Md.Rule BV6(d) subpoena letter requiring him to bring records of all accounts into which he placed the settlement funds. The gravamen of Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is that Powell failed to produce, at the Inquiry Panel hearing, the bank statements from the Fund for Government Investors relating to the <em>Taxay </em>settlement. On this point, the trial court stated that he could not find \u201cclear and convincing evidence that Powell \u2018failed to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail[ed] to respond to a lawful demand for information\u2019\u201d from a disciplinary authority in accordance with Rule 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Powell testified that, as of the date of the Inquiry Panel hearing, he did not possess any of the relevant statements from the Fund for Government Investors account. Following the conclusion of the <em>Taxay </em>case, Mrs. Taxay authorized Powell, who was moving to a smaller office, to dispose of any records relating to that case. Powell testified that these records were, more than likely, inadvertently thrown out in the disposal of the other <em>Taxay </em>records. Powell also testified that he made a concerted effort to locate the records sought by the Inquiry Panel, including looking through all the files at his home and his office. In addition, Powell testified that he placed three telephone calls to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Fund for Government Investors in an effort to obtain copies of the desired records prior to commencement of the Inquiry Panel hearing. At the Inquiry Panel hearing, Powell produced several boxes of records from the <em>Taxay </em>case, including statements from Sovran Bank, his Sovran Bank ledger, as well as bills, notes, work sheets and itemizations of expenses from the <em>Taxay </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Bar Counsel argues that Powell \u201cmade no significant efforts to comply with [its] investigator ... or to present records he was obliged to maintain.\u201d Bar Counsel argues that Powell should have personally visited the offices of the Fund for Government Investors to request the account records.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The trial court found that \u201c[w]hile less than cooperative and reasonable in his responses to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of the charges against him, Powell's conduct falls short of a violation of the provisions of Rule 8.1.\u201d Although we do not condone Powell\u2019s failure to visit personally the offices of the Fund for Government Investors in order to obtain the account records in response to Bar Counsel\u2019s subpoena, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous. Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the trial court\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 8.1(b) is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Powell makes three other exceptions to the trial court\u2019s findings, each of which, we shall sustain. First, the trial court found that both bank accounts, the Sovran account and the Fund for Government Investors account, were interest bearing. The undisputed evidence shows that the Sovran account was a standard business, non-interest bearing account. The record also shows, however, that dividends were paid on the Fund for Government Investors account. Powell\u2019s exception to the finding that the Sovran account was interest bearing is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Second, the trial court found that Powell deposited the $52,500.00 directly into the Sovran account in order to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>a \u201cpointless transfer\u201d because he had determined that the entire amount was owed to him in fees and expenses for the <em>Taxay </em>case. The undisputed testimony of Powell was that the $52,500.00 was mis-deposited by his office personnel into the Sovran account. Upon realizing this mis-deposit, Powell did a rough calculation of what was owed in fees and expenses. It was only after discovering this misdeposit that Powell determined that correcting the mistake by moving the money into the Fund for Government Investors account and then back into the operating account would be a pointless transfer. The record contains no evidence to indicate that Powell deposited the $52,500.00 directly into the Sovran account in order to avoid a pointless transfer. The trial court\u2019s contrary finding is clearly erroneous and Powell\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s finding that the signed promissory note was enclosed in Powell\u2019s letter of August 16, 1988, is clearly erroneous. The record demonstrates that the first promissory note, which was made out for the wrong amount, was included in Powell\u2019s letter of September 13, 1988, following the telephone conversation in which Mrs. Taxay agreed to the loan. Powell\u2019s exception to this finding is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In sanctioning this attorney, we repeat \u201c \u2018that sanctions imposed in disciplinary proceedings against an attorney are not for the purpose of punishing the individual, but are intended as protection to the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 680, 496 A.2d 672, 680 (1985) (quoting <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>301 Md. 450, 459, 483 A.2d 354, 359 (1984)). \u201cThe severity of the sanction, of course, generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Powell unintentionally misappropriated his client\u2019s funds through conduct that, if not grossly negligent, is perilously close to gross negligence. As this Court has stated several times before, \u201c[w]e desire that the message go out loud and clear to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Maryland Bar and to the citizens of Maryland that we shall not tolerate attorneys\u2019 misusing their clients funds.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 610, 441 A.2d 328, 333 (1982); <em>see also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>301 Md. at 459, 483 A.2d at 359. A portion of former Judge Digges\u2019 oft quoted opinion bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC2\">\u201cThe relationship existing between an attorney and his client is one that of necessity requires mutual trust and confidence. It is of prime importance not only to the parties themselves, but also to lawyers as a group as well as to society in general, that there be no lessening of the degree of confidence that the public has in the fidelity, honesty and integrity of members of the profession. It has been immemorially acknowledged that at the very heart of the attorney-client relationship is the trust concept with the attorney acting as a trustee for his client in all of his undertakings for him. This is especially true in the attorney\u2019s handling of moneys of others coming into his hands. So, it is essential that all members of the legal fraternity be strongly and constantly impressed with the truism that in handling moneys and properties belonging to their clients or others that they accept them in trust and are strictly accountable for their conduct in administering that trust, so they dare not appropriate those funds and properties for their personal use. The misappropriation by an attorney of funds of others entrusted to his care, be the amount small or large, is of great concern and represents the gravest form of professional misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 518-19, 307 A.2d 677, 682 (1973). In characterizing the misappropriation in this case, we found Powell\u2019s conduct more culpable than the attorneys in <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Dacy, supra, </em>and closer to the attorneys\u2019 conduct sanctioned in <em>Berger </em>and <em>Kramer, supra. </em>The attorneys in both <em>Berger </em>and <em>Kramer </em>were indefinitely suspended from the practice of law with the right to reapply in not less than one year. A substantial suspension in this case is supported by <em>Standards for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(1992) which the American Bar Association adopted in 1986. Standard 4.12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201cSuspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The commentary to Standard 4.13 also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cSuspension or disbarment as applicable under Standards 4.11 and 4.12 and the commentary thereto is appropriate for lawyers who are grossly negligent. For example, lawyers who are grossly negligent in failing to establish proper accounting procedures should be suspended; reprimand is appropriate for lawyers who fail to follow their established procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We are aware that Powell has been in private practice for over twenty years and that this is the first time he has been charged with professional misconduct. We also are aware that the funds in this case are those of a single client. The record also is replete with the many personal and familial problems confronting Powell during this period of time. Yet, despite the many problems that confronted Powell, the trial court found that Powell was a more than capable attorney during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">After careful consideration of this matter, we have determined that a substantial suspension is called for. Accordingly, Robert Dominick Powell will be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law with the right to reapply not less than six months from the date of the filing of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15(c) FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST ROBERT DOMINICK POWELL.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">. <em>Taxay v. Jess Parrish Memorial Hospital, et al., </em>No. 85-348-CIV-ORL-18 was filed, in March, 1985, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\">. This Court, by Order dated April 15, 1986, amended Maryland Rule 1230 (Code of Professional Responsibility) and adopted the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, which became effective January 1, 1987, thereby replacing the Code of Professional Responsibility, along with its Canons, Ethical Considerations, and Disciplinary Rules. Therefore, for conduct prior to January 1, 1987, Powell was charged with violations of Disciplinary Rules, and for his conduct after January 1, 1987, Powell was charged with violations of numerous Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-4\">. This Court, by Order dated February 29, 1988, adopted a new subtitle in the Maryland Rules, Subtitle BU, which mandates and regulates the maintenance of attorney trust accounts. The Order provided for an effective date of January 1,1989, and that Subtitle BU would govern the conduct of attorneys from thereafter. It is undisputed that the alleged misconduct that pertains to these charges occurred prior to January 1, 1989. Similarly, Md.Bus.Occ.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-302, 10-304, 10-306 were enacted by the General Assembly as Ch. 3, \u00a7 1 and Ch. 632, \u00a7 3 of the Acts of 1989 and had an effective date of October 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In order to eliminate the allegations of misconduct based on statutes and rules, which were not in effect at the time that the alleged misconduct took place, the amended petition withdrew the charges that Powell violated Md.Bus.Occ.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-302, 10-304, 10-306, any rule under Subtitle BU, and the current version of Md. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a). In place of the current version of Md. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), the amended petition substituted the prior version of Md. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a) which was in effect from January 1,1987, through December 31,1988, and contained no reference to Subtitle BU of the Maryland Rules. The current version of Md. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained <em>pursuant to Subtitle BU of the Maryland Rules. </em>Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The prior version of Md. Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), which was substituted by Bar Counsel in the amended petition, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\"A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.

On July 19, 1991, Powell\u2019s initial attorneys moved to withdraw their appearance which motion was granted by Order of this Court on July 26, 1991. Also, on July 26, 1991, this Court granted Powell\u2019s request for a continuance and ordered the case to be set for a hearing before Judge Rushworth on September 19 and 20, 1991.

Powell testified, and wrote in this letter, that he received Mrs. Taxays letter of July 17, 1988, on August 12, 1988. In June 1987, following a dispute with his landlord, Powell was forced to vacate his office space at 1750 K Street, N.W., Suite 460, Washington, D.C. 20006. Powell moved his office to 2033 M Street, N.W., Suite 703, Washing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ton, D.C. 20036. Powell testified that his receipt on August 12, 1988, of Mrs. Taxay's letter of July 17, 1988, was the result of his change of address and inefficient postal delivery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">. In the letter dated April 8, 1988, a copy of which was mailed to Mrs. Taxay in another letter dated September 13, 1988, Powell wrote to Mrs. Taxay and informed her of his desperate financial situation and his need to hold onto the money due her. In the letter he stated that in March, 1987, he was removed from the position of General Counsel for his principal client, National Business Aircraft Association, which had previously provided him with $300,000.00 to $400,-000.00 in fees each year. Powell informed her that he had exhausted his savings, borrowed $18,000.00 from his parents, taken out a second trust on his house, and cashed in his pension plan. In closing, Powell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\"I need to hold onto the money due you out of the settlement for a while \u2014 at least until January, 1989. In order to apply for loans, and the like, I have to show \u2018cash on hand in banks,\u2019 and I do not have any. I <em>will </em>repay you, if you let me borrow the amount. I can pay you interest at 10%, and I have enclosed a note, which I can sign if you agree. If you need the money, or for some other reason do not want to do it, I'll understand, and I\u2019ll still love you. Please let me know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. Because Powell moved to a different office in the summer of 1988, his files were housed in numerous boxes. Around that time, Powell had injured his chest and back and was unable to sift through his files to locate the letter dated April 8, 1988, the unsigned promissory note and the accounting. Powell, therefore, did not include these enclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>sures with his letter of August 16, 1988, but rather, after finding them in early September, included the enclosures with his letter of September 13, 1988. Some of the delay between the August 16, 1988, correspondence and the September 13, 1988, correspondence was attributed to Mrs. Taxay\u2019s move from Montana to Idaho. Mrs. Taxay had indicated in her letter of July 17, 1988, that she was about to move from Montana to Idaho and would notify Powell of her new address. Powell\u2019s letter of August 16, 1988, was sent to Mrs. Taxay\u2019s Montana address with the hope that it would be properly forwarded. Upon receipt of a change of address card from Mrs. Taxay, Powell telephoned Mrs. Taxay. It was in this telephone conversation that Mrs. Taxay assented to lending Powell her part of the settlement proceeds and to Powell\u2019s executing the promissory note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. Following receipt of a letter from Bar Counsel, Powell wrote Mrs. Taxay a letter, dated September 25,1989, and enclosed a check for the outstanding interest and principal on the note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">.

The contingency fee agreement had an expense cap of $50,000.00.

Unfortunately, the record only contains statements of this Crestar account for November of 1988 through January 9, 1989.

Powell testified repeatedly that there was a telephone conversation with Mrs. Taxay, which occurred between his letters dated August 16, 1988 and September 13, 1988, in which she assented to lending him her share of the settlement proceeds. Unfortunately, Judge Rush-worth failed to make a finding regarding this testimony. Judge Rushworth seems to have based his finding that Mrs. Taxay assented to lending Powell the money solely on Mrs. Taxay\u2019s letter of September 18, 1988, requesting a note made out in the correct amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. Powell argued, in this Court and below, that this loan did not come within the scope of Rule 1.8 because he requested the loan from a friend, not a client.

Without addressing Powell\u2019s proposition, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>only find that the record adequately supports Judge Rushworth\u2019s finding that this loan complied with Rule 1.8(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
