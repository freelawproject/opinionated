These convictions occurred in a second trial after the jury in an initial trial was unable to reach a verdict. On sentencing, the trial court merged the convictions and imposed a prison term of seventy-five years subject to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, requiring service of eighty-five per cent of the term before defendant would be eligible for parole and subjecting him to five years of parole supervision upon release. Appropriate provision was made for the imposition of statutory assessments, penalties and fees, and of other conditions. On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\"><em>POINT I </em>BECAUSE THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO PROVE THAT ARMANDO NEGRON KILLED LAZARA CUNHA, THE DEFENSE MOTION FOR A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\"><em>POINT II </em>THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN REFUSING TO GRANT THE DEFENSE REQUEST FOR A MISTRIAL AFTER THE PROSECUTOR REPEATEDLY DISPARAGED DEFENSE COUNSEL AND THE EXPERT WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\"><em>POINT III </em>THE DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>We reverse on the basis that defendant was denied a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The victim, Lazara Cunha, was murdered on August 12, 1998. Defendant and Cunha worked in the same office in New Brunswick. They had been friends for several years and often lunched together. Cunha was in her fifties and was married. Defendant was in his thirties and was single.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">A number of their co-workers testified at trial concerning the relationship. According to one, because of the difference in their ages Cunha had taken defendant \u201cunder her wing\u201d and they seemed to have \u201ca mother/son relationship.\u201d Another co-worker testified that defendant had expressed a sexual interest in Cunha. A third co-worker testified that defendant had stated that Cunha had been making advances toward him. Some co-workers stated that, in the months before the murder, Cunha\u2019s relationship with defendant changed \u2014 they were no longer close and Cunha seemed to distance herself from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">On the day of her death, at about 8:30 a.m., Cunha, appearing upset, told a fellow employee that she was going to follow defendant to a gas station to leave his car for repairs and drive him back to work. Defendant had been seen by other employees before 8:00 a.m. sitting in his car in the office parking lot. Another employee saw Cunha\u2019s beige Jaguar leave the parking lot just after 8:30. At about the same time, two other fellow employees on their way to work saw defendant pacing on the pavement near an intersection down the street from their place of employment, with his car, a red Suzuki, nearby. Defendant declined their offer of assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">A few minutes later, a driver passing by saw a woman seated behind the wheel of a Jaguar. Her head was moving and she was apparently conversing with a man standing at the driver\u2019s-side window. A few minutes after that, other witnesses saw a man, later identified as defendant, looking into a gold Jaguar parked at the curb in the same location, and then returning to a red car parked nearby. One of those witnesses testified that she first saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>defendant looking into the driver\u2019s side of the Jaguar, running to the front of the car and looking inside through the windshield, and returning to his position at the driver\u2019s-side window. Then, he ran to a red jeep-type vehicle parked in a driveway and entered it. That witness described defendant as running the entire time, as if panicked or in a rush. Two other witnesses saw the Jaguar moving erratically, slowly gliding and then coming to a stop near the driveway. One of them testified that the Jaguar\u2019s emergency flashers were lit. Photographs later taken at the scene by the police showed the Jaguar squarely parked at the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">A few minutes later, Cunha was discovered by a passerby, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the Jaguar, wearing her seatbelt and slumped over the steering wheel. The Jaguar\u2019s engine was running, its right blinker was on, and Cunha was bleeding profusely from facial injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The police were summoned. They determined that Cunha had been shot in the head and was dead. It appeared that no robbery had occurred, as none of her belongings were disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">When immediate investigation disclosed that Cunha had left work to meet defendant at the gas station, the police went to his home in Newark. He was not there, but his car was located at his sister\u2019s home at another Newark address.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The day following, defendant called his sister from Toledo, Ohio. A week later he surrendered to the police at Newark Airport after disembarking from a flight from Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Although many witnesses testified to the circumstances surrounding Cunha\u2019s murder and facts bearing upon her relationship with defendant, some placing defendant in the vicinity of Cunha\u2019s vehicle at around the time of her death, there were no witnesses to the actual homicide and none had heard a gunshot. With the exception of a single character witness, defendant presented no fact witnesses. The State\u2019s theory was that defendant, spurned by Cunha, had shot her while standing beside her car. Defendant\u2019s theory was that Cunha had been shot by someone else while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>driving and was discovered by defendant in her injured condition. Expert witnesses on behalf of the State and defendant provided conflicting hypotheses supporting the respective theories of the case based on scientific analyses regarding the circumstances of the death. The focus of much of that testimony was whether Cunha could have been shot before her vehicle came to rest where found.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The State\u2019s medical expert was the State Medical Examiner, Dr. Faruk Presswalla, a forensic pathologist with extensive experience in that field. Dr. Presswalla testified that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the left side of Cunha\u2019s head above and behind the ear, which traveled toward the right in a downward direction, entering the skull and penetrating the brain, shattering the brain stem and fracturing the base of the skull, and lodging under the skin of the right cheek from where it was recovered. According to Dr. Presswalla, the brain stem injury immediately rendered Cunha unconscious with no ability for voluntary movement or motor function beyond small involuntary twitches. He concluded that the shot came from outside the driver\u2019s-side window, which was either partially or completely open since the bullet did not go through the glass. Gunpowder residue and particle lead found on Cunha\u2019s shirt indicated that the shot had been fired at an intermediate range, from a distance of about three feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Dr. Abbott Krieger, a professor and neurosurgeon with extensive practice and research experience in brain injuries, testified as a medical expert for the defense. In support of the thesis that Cunha had already been injured when defendant was seen at the side of her car, he opined that Cunha had been shot while operating her car causing her to drive erratically. He stated that a person who was severely brain injured and unconscious could move his or her arms and legs and even turn his <em>or her head in </em>reflexive motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Another defense expert, Dr. Ira Kuperstein, a forensic engineer, provided supporting opinion for the thesis that Cunha could have driven after having been shot. Based <em>on </em>the location of one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>State\u2019s witnesses, Dr. Kuperstein also questioned the ability of that witness to have discerned some of the detail provided in his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Because no one had witnessed the actual homicide and because there was no direct scientific evidence connecting defendant to the crime, the jury was left with the task of determining whether the circumstances established were an adequate basis for finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had murdered the victim. In the face of the testimony placing him at the scene around the time of Cunha\u2019s death and providing some evidence of motive, defendant had offered his theory that Cunha had been shot by someone else while driving and that her vehicle had come to rest at the location where defendant had parked his car. Despite testimony that tended to establish that Cunha had intended to follow defendant from their office\u2019s parking lot to a nearby service station, no one saw them leave the parking lot together. Indeed, although one witness placed defendant in his car in the parking lot before 8:30 a.m., others saw him alone shortly after 8:30 a.m. at the location where Cunha\u2019s body was found. Thus, there was some basis in the evidence for the jury to conclude that Cunha had driven to that location while defendant waited there, and to use that inference to support either the State\u2019s theory or defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Accordingly, the conflicting testimony of the respective experts, especially the medical experts, became a critical element in the ease. If the jury accepted Dr. Presswalla\u2019s opinion that Cunha was incapable of propelling her ear from the roadway to the curb once shot, it might well conclude that she had pulled the car to the curb before being injured and that defendant had shot her. If, on the other hand, Dr. Krieger\u2019s contrary opinion \u2014 as fortified by Dr. Kuperstein\u2019s physical depictions \u2014 regarding the decedent\u2019s physical capacities after sustaining the wound inflicted were to be accepted, the jury might well be inclined to find reasonable doubt regarding defendant\u2019s guilt. If the choice were to be seen as close, the trial might have as unsatisfactory a result as had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>occurred in the previous trial of the same charges, where the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In this context, the prosecutor embarked on a conceptually allowable effort to discredit both the credibility of defendant\u2019s experts as well as the substance of their testimony. He did so, however, in ways that exceeded the bounds of fairness, with the result that the trial was infected with the same shortcomings as were found to have existed in <em>State v. Smith, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>158, 770 A.2d 255 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We set aside numerous instances of quibbling, argumentation, baiting and contentiousness in the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Krieger, some of which earned the prosecutor well-deserved censure by the trial judge. We concentrate primarily upon the instances of Smith-type prosecutorial excess and other similar tactics which the testimonial record reveals.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">They began with a focus on several malpractice cases in which Dr. Krieger had been one defendant and which had resulted in sizeable settlements for the claimants. The prosecutor referred to the fact that Krieger was licensed in several states and had been chief of neurosurgery in several different hospitals, inquiring: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be jumping around from state to state and hospital to hospital because of all the mistakes you\u2019ve been making, right?\u201d The witness responded that his presence in New Jersey for twenty-five years was not jumping around.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Then, after summarizing the different theories propounded by Drs. Presswalla and Krieger, the prosecutor turned to concentrate on the fee charged by Krieger for his services as an expert. The trial transcript reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">Q Doctor, let\u2019s get to the real difference between you and Presswalla, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ako\">AI thought that was the real difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">Q What\u2019s your standard fee for testifying as an expert witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APJ\">A Sixty-five hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">Q If I told you Dr. Presswalla doesn\u2019t get paid to testify, certainly not $6500 a shot, would you disagree with me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-16\">AI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s getting paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Q He\u2019s employed by the State as the Chief Medical Examiner for the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s inaccurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not a question first of all. It\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He does get paid out of State, [sic] It\u2019s inaccurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">THE COURT: The objection is sustained. Don\u2019t argue with the witness and don\u2019t make comment. Ask questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">Q What\u2019s your standard fee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">A My standard fee is $6500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">Q And that\u2019s to put together like you did in this case a three-page report and come in here and share your views for a couple hours and then go home, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aix\">A No, that\u2019s not correct. It\u2019s really\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">Q In this case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">THE COURT: Let him finish his answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">A (Continuing) I\u2019m reviewing all the medical records provided to me, having several conferences with [defense counsel], appearing in court, freeing up my time to be here. In fact, in this trial I\u2019m not charging my standard fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">Q You\u2019re cutting it down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">A I\u2019m charging less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-15\">Q Because things are tough with you. Because your medical malpractice keeps going up every time you screw up, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-16\">A No. The reason why\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, judge. There\u2019s no foundation for that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-18\">THE COURT: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-19\">THE WITNESS: Can I answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-20\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to let you answer the question after I give counsel an instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-21\">One, let the witness finish the answers. I understand you have a number of questions. I understand this is vigorous cross examination. I have no problem with that. You must let the witness answer the question before you begin your next question; and don\u2019t argue with the witness. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-22\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I would then ask you to instruct the witness to answer my question. I would ask you to instruct the witness to answer my question and not lecture on tangencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-23\">THE COURT: When that occurs I will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-24\">Go ahead, you can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-25\">A The reason I was willing to testify for less than half my fee is because I felt so strongly that the understanding of the physiology was being completely misstated and I really felt an obligation, a civic obligation, to come in here and to explain to the jury what happens physiologically so that when they make their decision at least they\u2019ll make it on the basis of all the information and understanding what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>physiological disruptions of the brain do in terms of clinical functioning. I wanted to make that very clear and explain it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">Q You know that\u2019s not true because you know you could not get your standard fee. It was reduced for reasons known to you, me, and fdefense counsel],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azq0\">A And I could have walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. That\u2019s not a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">Ladies and gentlemen, there\u2019s no evidence before you that there was a reduction in the witness\u2019 fee for any reason whatsoever. It\u2019s simply not before you. That\u2019s a gratuitous statement. It\u2019s one of those gratuitous statements I\u2019ve been referring to during the entire course of this trial and you are to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Judge, are you aware of how this witness is being paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIA\">THE COURT: You are not asking questions of me. You\u2019re posing questions to the witness. Would you like me to address that with you at side bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">THE COURT: Come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">(The following is a discussion at side bar:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">THE COURT: There is no evidence before this jury by a witness as to what reductions, if any, occur in the payment of this witness. You are not a witness. You\u2019re not permitted to testify. I\u2019m sick of these gratuitous statements. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes, but let me explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s go back on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I need to make a record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-17\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-18\">(End of discussion at side bar.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-19\">Q Your bill in this case was scrutinized, was it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-20\">AI don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-21\">Q You haven\u2019t submitted it yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-22\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-23\">Q Twenty-nine hundred dollars for your civic duty, that\u2019s what it\u2019s worth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-24\">A That\u2019s what I am going to submit for my bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-25\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t hear the end of the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-26\">That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to submit to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-27\">THE WITNESS: For my bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-28\">Q You had to stumble on that. It probably hurls you to have to charge so low, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-29\">A You\u2019re making me nervous. That\u2019s why I\u2019m stumbling. I came here\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-30\">Q Sixty, 50, you\u2019ve testified however many times as an expert, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-31\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-32\">Q This is not the first time you\u2019re on the stand, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-33\">A Well, I have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Q Correct? That calls for a yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">THE COURT: Can you answer the question with a yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">THE WITNESS: No. I have to explain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: That this is not his first time on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">THE COURT: He says he can\u2019t answer it with a yes or no answer. That\u2019s his answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019ll withdraw the question. We\u2019ll move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">Q What makes you nervous, doctor, is that you are distorting the facts in this ease to come up with your silly opinion, isn\u2019t that what makes you nervous? A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">Q Well, I\u2019m going to give you a golden opportunity to explain how it is you think it\u2019s reasonable within a medical degree, your opinion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Whereupon, the cross-examination continued with inquiry into the bases of Dr. Krieger\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The prosecutor, gratuitously, continued his attack on Krieger even in beginning his qualifications <em>voir dire </em>cross-examination of Dr. Kuperstein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">Q Unlike Dr. Krieger\u2019s[,] your resume is short and sweet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">A Yes. One page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-16\">Q The way it\u2019s supposed to be, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-18\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">And then, in resuming the delayed continuation of his cross-examination of Dr. Krieger, the prosecutor took another tack in his assault on Krieger for the fact that he was receiving fees for his services as an expert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-20\">Q If I told you [one of the fact witnesses] got zero cents to come in here and testify compared to your $2900 do you think that would make a difference as to whether she was coached or whether she embellished or whether she stretched the truth as you\u2019re referring?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-21\">AI think that all witnesses come without any compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-22\">Q Not you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-23\">A Well, I\u2019m an expert and experts are a different category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-24\">QI thought you were here for your civic obligation as you testified to. Isn\u2019t that what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-25\">A Mr. Prosecutor,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-26\">\u2022 Q Mr. Neurosurgeon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-27\">A \u2014humiliating me does not change the facts or the medicine. We\u2019re talking about the specific cases and you then when you don\u2019t like my answers you humiliate me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Q I don\u2019t mean to humiliate you. You\u2019re saying this woman put a spin on her testimony, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">A Yes, I am. I\u2019m saying it based upon reading the two documents and seeing the refinement of the second testimony compared to the first. That has nothing to do with being paid or not. That has to do with just making that type of observation in terms of what the witness said on two occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">Q You\u2019re an expert witness and you know things of that sort, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">A Well, I have the benefit of reviewing both sets of testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">Q You\u2019ve also had the benefit of talking to any of the witnesses on the witness list. Did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">A No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">Q So really you\u2019re just passing your judgment on these good people who came in here to testify because in your view there\u2019s a refinement in their transcript now, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">A I\u2019m just making a comment upon having read both of them and pointing out the differences that are very obvious in both sets of testimonies. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">Q Could it be that the questioner was more refined in his questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">A In some ways you were more refined in your questioning but still the answers were really very, very much more refined and I\u2019m sure if the jury had the opportunity of reading both they would come to the exact level, the same conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-15\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I would ask you admonish the witness for that comment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-16\">THE COURT: You opened this door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-17\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-18\">THE COURT: Yes, you did. You opened the door by asking this witness to characterize another witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-19\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I think he did that all by himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-20\">THE COURT: This was absolutely foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-21\">You want to start and pursue another line of questioning?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-22\">The prosecutor\u2019s endeavor to impugn the integrity of defendant\u2019s experts with undue concentration on the fees they were charging for their services continued in the cross-examination of Dr. Kuperstein. Having established Kuperstein\u2019s hourly rate, the prosecutor, after cross-examining him regarding his theories of the case, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-23\">Q It\u2019s five minutes to twelve, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-24\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-25\">Q You\u2019ve been here since nine o\u2019clock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-26\">AI got here a few minutes before nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Q Three hours at $325.00 an hour equals almost a thousand dollars for your testimony today, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">A No. I charge for my time and it\u2019s $3.20 [sic] an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Q So $3.20 times three is $960,00. [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">Q Yesterday you were here all day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">Q How many hours is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">A Eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: May I have a black marker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">Q So yesterday was eight hours\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-15\">A I\u2019d have to check. It\u2019s either eight or nine because I did some preparation. There\u2019s travel time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">Q You bill for travel time, of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-18\">Q Let\u2019s take a conservative number, 8. My math is off. $2,560?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-19\">A It seems right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-20\">Q For yesterday. You came to Middlesex County four times to look at this car. A Three of them went to the site and there was another one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-21\">Q We\u2019ll talk about the videotape in a minute. Let\u2019s talk about the Jaguar. Four times you came into Middlesex County to check this car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-22\">THE COURT: That\u2019s a question, doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-23\">QI think we did it three times. I thought you said April.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-24\">A The 27th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-25\">QI thought you said April, May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-26\">A 27th of April, May 19th, and November 22. The 23rd was at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-27\">Q Middlesex County. I\u2019m talking at the county. I don\u2019t mean to confuse you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2v\">AI was thinking of the college.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-28\">Q Three times in Edison, once in New Brunswick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-29\">A And then the videotape\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-30\">Q We\u2019ll get to it. Four times you checked the car out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-31\">AI did different things, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-32\">Q The first time you spent what, maybe an hour?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-33\">A In total I spent about three days of billable time when you group everything together, up until\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-34\">Q Prior to court time you\u2019re saying it\u2019s three billable days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-35\">A About that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-36\">Q That\u2019s 24 hours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-37\">A Yes. That\u2019s an approximation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Q Twenty-four times $3.20 [sic] is how much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">A Seventy-five hundred plus one eighty. I can\u2019t calculate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">Q Six eighty, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">Q Now the videotape was probably another two, three hours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">A That\u2019s included in the three days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">Q You\u2019re going to throw in the $5.00 for the actual cost of the cassette?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">A The charge according to my regular fee schedule is $75.00 for each videotape done. It\u2019s the cassette, it\u2019s duplicating, it\u2019s advertising, equipment costs. It\u2019s $75.00 for that. It\u2019s $4.00 per photograph that I take and there are some photographs you may want to put another hundred dollars for stills and that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">Q Is it fair to say this is all over $10,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">AI expect that\u2019s what the total billing is going to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">On re-cross-examination, the subject was Dr. Kuperstein\u2019s opinions regarding a witness\u2019s ability to see the scene from the vantage point claimed. The subject of fees as bearing upon the opinions offered was once again injected by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">Q With respect to [the witness] what you think he could not see based upon your test and your videotape and your ten thousand dollar fee and everything else you\u2019ve done in this ease\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I object to it. That\u2019s just rude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-18\">THE COURT: It\u2019s unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-19\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: It goes to his credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-20\">THE COURT: Objection sustained. Your statement doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s already testified as to what his fee is. You\u2019ve drawn a diagram.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-21\">Next question. Let\u2019s move this along.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-22\">These attacks on the credibility of defendant\u2019s experts by concentrating on the fees they charged as well as the substance of their testimony continued into the prosecutor\u2019s summation. That focus intruded even in the prosecutor\u2019s comments upon the testimony of another, lay, witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-23\">[THE WITNESS] also had a lot to tell us about the attraction and obsession by the defendant. He told you how much the defendant wanted to have sex with her. I guess men use that expression. The defendant had a lot to say to [the witness] about Lazara. He listened to it, testified to it very truthfully. He certainly wasn\u2019t paid $10,000 to come in here and testify as to what he observed and heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">Then the prosecutor began to associate defense counsel with the suggestion that defendant\u2019s case including the expert witnesses\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>defendant\u2019s only witnesses beyond a single character witness\u2014 was premised on lies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">[Defense counsel] in one of his many attempts to spin the evidence and misstate the facts told you that [two State\u2019s witnesses] said that the defendant was wa[ ]ving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">and then, shortly thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">... [I]t bothers me to hear the defense attorney misstate the facts and the law too. I think when [defense counsel] got before you this morning he was fast and loose with what [a State\u2019s witness] said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">You know at first Dr. Krieger didn\u2019t even want to acknowledge that the blinker switch was on the left side of the steering column. I showed him the picture and he\u2019s like, well, I don\u2019t know what this is. Well, when you look at those pictures you\u2019ll see for yourself. I guess he got coached a little bit over the next 12 or 24 hours because when he came back on the stand he agreed that the switch was on the left side. He knew that\u2019s where we left off and he knew I was going to grill him to death on that point. That turn signal is very important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The summation attack on the expert witnesses based on their fees accelerated, and the argument that defense counsel had fomented untruth continued, both engendering yet another sidebar conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">The victim is pulling into the shoulder. The light came on as the victim pulled by the driveway because the victim was alive when she turned on the switch. All the other motions or actions with respect to stopping that car also indicate Mrs. Cunha was alive. It\u2019s almost ludicrous to assume this woman could have been shot up the road and without any evidence whatsoever of a shooter up the road standing along the curb in another ear or a gunshot being heard up the road. It\u2019s ludicrous to believe that this woman could have come to that scene right by where the defendant was standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">I wonder if I should even spend as much time negating that claim. There is no evidence to support it. But, you know, twelve of you have to agree on the case in order to find this man guilty. And I need to really eradicate from your mind how this woman could have been shot up the road. It\u2019s simply impossible. And with respect to that defense in general let me just tell you right now it\u2019s a desperate defense because our case is so good, the State\u2019s case is so strong, [defense counsel] has to pay witnesses to come in here to concoct a story in order to distract you from the proofs. If you don\u2019t believe the defense in this case there\u2019s simply just one option. That\u2019s to find this defendant guilty because he\u2019s the only person at the scene who could have shot the victim. He\u2019s the only one who fled from the scene. By the way, [defense counsel] doesn\u2019t say anything about that in his summation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Can I see you at side bar, judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(The following is a discussion at side bar:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I paid no fact witnesses. I paid no one to concoct a story. Expert witnesses as they always are are compensated for their testimony. But to leave the impression that I concocted a story is to say that fact witnesses are somehow paid to give testimony and I believe that impression is wrong to give. I have no problem with my adversary commenting on the fact that expert witness was compensated but an expert witness does not give facts, gives opinions based on the evidence that\u2019s already in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">THE COURT: Other than?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Paid to concoct a story is what I\u2019m objecting to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">THE COURT: Of the expert witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The prosecutor said I paid witnesses to concoct a story. There are no fact witnesses that were paid by the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">THE COURT: How many fact witnesses did you call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: None. That\u2019s my point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">THE COURT: Then you couldn\u2019t have paid any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a misleading impression, that I paid people to concoct a story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-14\">THE COURT: So it\u2019s the concoction of the <em>story </em>that <em>you are </em>objecting to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Fact, not opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-16\">THE COURT: You called no fact witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have not. That\u2019s my point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-18\">THE COURT: Other than the fact/eharacter witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-19\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I called one fact/eharacter witness, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-20\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-21\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Judge, obviously in the context of my summation I\u2019m referring to the expert witnesses. I\u2019m referring to their testimony. If counsel is trying to split hairs and suggest that I would have been permitted to say [\u201c]concoct an opinion[\u201d,] then I think it\u2019s semantics at this point. I did say in a strong attack on experts that they are fabricating their testimony for a fee. That was the basis behind my comment. I think it\u2019s permissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-22\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-23\">What\u2019s your application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-24\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That it be stricken and the jury be cautioned, given a cautionary instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-25\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I object to that. I didn\u2019t say anything that was improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-26\">THE COURT: Counsel, there was one fact witness, Lieutenant Velazquez, who was not paid. Certainly your comments were not improper as it relates to experts, Dr. Krieger, Dr. Kuperstein. I don\u2019t want the jury left with a misimpression that there was any money paid to Velazquez. With respect to Velazquez I grant the application for an instruction that fact witnesses \u2014 I\u2019ll make the statement generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that fact witnesses are not paid and that their testimony is provided without any formal payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have no objection to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(End of discussion at side bar.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">THE COURT: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">Ladies and gentlemen, fact witnesses are not paid and you should not therefore infer that any fact witness in this ease received any compensation because they did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The prosecutor persisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m very clear about my last statement. I\u2019m referring to the statement [of] two witnesses that [defense counsel] called who he paid to come up with this fabulous opinion of theirs, not Detective Velazquez who offered very little in this case as a fact witness and as a character witness. I\u2019ll talk more about that in a minute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">As the summation proceeded, the prosecutor reviewed the testimony of Dr. Presswalla, stressing that he had testified as the State\u2019s Chief Medical Examiner with a wealth of experience as a forensic pathologist. The prosecutor then juxtaposed the credentials and experience of Dr. Krieger, turning once again to the fact that he and Dr. Kuperstein had been paid expert witness fees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">This man was a professional witness just like Ira Kuperstein. He came here for one reason and one reason alone. He came here because he was paid. He was paid to testify. (Demonstrating.) The only thing that Dr. Krieger talked to you [about] when he got up on the stand was money. He had the nerve to say I\u2019m not charging my sixty-five hundred dollar fee because I\u2019m here because I think my civic obligation, my civic duty[,] calls me to right the wrongs that Dr. Presswalla made. That\u2019s nonsense just like everything else he said. Just like the 90 degrees and parallel lines. All nonsense. About the only thing Dr. Krieger told you that was true was his name. About the only thing that made any sense. Well, of course he did acknowledge the medical [mal]practiee. He seemed a little bit surprised by that. I guess he didn\u2019t know that I did my homework. You see, when Dr. Krieger was called to the stand I asked him about the death of that newborn mother and her newly born infant which cost him $675,000. He was also sued for leaving another person paralyzed. There were six malpractice cases that I went over. I\u2019m not going to clutter my chart. I have my note. I can read that to you. It\u2019s in the record. What did he say as the heat was turned up? Well, it was a residence, [sic] Oh, it was a business decision by the hospital. Oh, really? They picked up three mistakes? Actually it was the State. As if it was better to him. Oh, so the taxpayers had to pick up for your screw-ups, is that it? What kind of a doctor is this who comes in here for $2900 to exercise his civic duty and tells us that erratic driving means a person shot the gun? He was just like Ira Kuperstein, another professional witness. These guys, both of them, are not very good at their chosen profession. Kuperstein is a consultant which means he can\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>get a real job. Okay? That means he\u2019s got to pick up work in the courts as an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">The guy came in <em>here for $10,000 and </em>explained to you how he used his old convert [sic] sneaker to replicate how the victim\u2019s foot would have rested on the brake pedal. Explained to you how it took him three times to test the car. What he didn\u2019t want to admit to you was because a police officer in our office, Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, by the name of David Korey pointed out his mistakes. He was trying to pull the wool over your eyes by suggesting this Jaguar would hold on a grade without a foot applied to the brake because that\u2019s what he did on the first two tests, on ruddy concrete and on different road surfaces with underinflated tires and the like. When I told him [to] take it to the scene and [he] got a different result[,] he danced around the stand there to say all I wanted to do was check the brake light. Well, both Kuperstein and Krieger knew how to deflect and stick me and jab me with their opinions about coaching and the like, about how Ruppert can\u2019t see, and these guys, they get paid to do stuff like that because they\u2019re pros. If they were good at what they did they wouldn\u2019t be here. For Kuperstein\u2019s testimony, $10,000. What did he say that made any sense? He tried to fool you with a videotape that [defense counsell was a part of. The defense attorney drove the car in question that Kuperstein was sitting in the passenger seat with his camera. I guess you have to trust [defense counsel] as to the rate of speed when you look at this tape because Kuperstein says we practiced a couple times. We tried to get it at 25 miles an hour to replicate how Ruppert was driving by. Well, if you look at that [tape] the distances are off, the angles are off. The victim is barely noticeable or the exemplar I should say. This person that they use is the defendant\u2019s twin brother crouched in front of the car blocking the view. Jeffrey says the person was to the right. Again, $10,000 to fabricate evidence, to beat a murder charge. Great country, America, it really is, when you can pay a witness to come up with fraud like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I have to be heard at side bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">(The following is a discussion at side bar:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I made an objection some time ago about the prosecutor saying I concocted a story by the use ofr money. Now he said deliberately the second time that I fabricate, paid $10,000 to fabricate evidence, and <em>now </em>I think it\u2019s prejudicial. I ask for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Judge, it\u2019s clear that the tape was fabricated. It was produced. Fabricate takes on lots of different connotations, but this tape was put together. It was composed. It was created. I can\u2019t think of any other synonyms but it was put together by Dr. Kuperstein. It\u2019s my position that it\u2019s misleading given the angles, given the depth of field and focus, everything I asked when I crossed him on. There\u2019s no doubt this witness was paid. The jury is entitled to assess the witnesses] interest in the outcome of the case in determining the credibility of the witness. Dr. Kuperstein said from his point of view, from his eye, Ruppert couldn\u2019t see what he could see. I thought the whole videotape issue was objectionable. You let it in[,l and I respect your ruling[,l but it\u2019s evidence that was suspect right from the get go. It\u2019s not a coincidence from my point of view this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>man was paid $10,000 to come in and participate in these proceedings. The jury is entitled to know all that when they assess the credibility of the videotape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">THE COURT: Counsel, the term fabrication, however, has another connotation, that is, that the videotape was or is the product of a lie. [That\u2019s] essentially what the objection goes to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And I\u2019ll stand behind that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">THE COURT: There\u2019s been no evidence introduced before the jury that any witness lied. The jury has to make that determination with respect to the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">Counsel, I\u2019m going to deny your application for a mistrial. With respect to your application for curative instruction I\u2019ll hear you in the alternative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I think it\u2019s difficult for a curative instruction that\u2019s efficacious. A door has been opened. The cow is out of the barn. The toothpaste is out of the tube. It\u2019s difficult to put it back. Maybe you would give me a chance to sum up in rebuttal and I think I could deal with it but I don\u2019t see how a curative instruction, I can\u2019t imagine one because this is the second objection in summation to the exact same point and the impression that the jury is being left with is that I paid for a concocted story and I paid for fabricated evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">THE COURT: All right, counsel. I don\u2019t perceive it as being as difficult as you do. I am going to advise the jury that it\u2019s their job to determine the credibility of witnesses. I am also going to advise the jury, which they will be advised during my final charge, particularly with respect to expert witnesses, that it is not unusual in that it is usually the case that expert witnesses are paid for their testimony. I think that certainly will cure any prejudice that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the term fabricate which only does mean from all practical perspectives that a lie was concocted. That\u2019s a function for the jury to determine whether or not the experts and any other witness\u2019s testimony is credible and therefore worthy of belief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: May I say one thing about the reference to the lie that I submit was part and parcel of Kuperstein\u2019s testimony? I am clearly entitled to say when I think witnesses have lied. [Defense counsel] said that Abilio Cunha lied. I didn\u2019t get up here and start dancing making objections because I believe it\u2019s proper comment for lawyers in summation to allege lies from witnesses so now for [defense counsel] to say, well, the prosecutor can\u2019t call my witness a liar is a specious attack on my summation and it\u2019s meant to delay this proceeding. I\u2019d like to get in front of the jury so we can have your charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The attack I made on Mr. Cunha was supported by the record, by prior inconsistent statements. Here there is no evidence in the record that Dr. Kuperstein in any way in making this exemplar deviated from the facts that were in the record at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-15\">THE COURT: That\u2019s another question for the jury to determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think they need some curative instruction on fabricated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>THE COURT: I already told you I\u2019m going to give them an instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArD\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think we need it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">THE COURT: I intend to give it to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">(End of discussion at side bar.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">* # * sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, with respect to expert testimony, I will tell you this again during the course of my final charge, it is not unusual and it is commonplace for experts to be paid for coming to court and rendering testimony and there is nothing unusual about that. Now with respect to whether a witness fabricated testimony or lied, and is worthy of belief or not, is credible or not, is for you, the finder of fact, the jury, to determine, and that is solely within your purview to determine whether or not a witness is credible and therefore worthy of belief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">All right, counsel. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">LTHE PROSECUTOR]: [Defense counsel] has made certain statements about his case, brought these witnesses whose credibility you will determine; and with respect to the experts and their fees I\u2019ll remind you now that the judge will tell you one of the factors involved in assessing credibility is one\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case. People who are paid to testify want to win. They want to win on behalf of their client. For what reason? To get hired again. To come back in another trial and get more money. At $10,000 a pop Dr. Kuperstein has a large incentive to make it up to fit his case. He didn\u2019t know anything about engineering when it took him three times to do a very simple test on a car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">The prosecutor\u2019s summation eventually concluded -with a coda on the theme of expert witness compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">Nobody that was called by the State, especially the eyewitnesses that came by, had any ax to grind or paid to testify. They all came forward with their honest recollection of what happened. When you sum it all up there\u2019s only one thing you can do, that is to find this man guilty, guilty of murder. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">\u201cProsecutors are afforded considerable leeway in closing arguments as long as their comments are reasonably related to the scope of the evidence presented. * * * Indeed, prosecutors in criminal cases are expected to make vigorous and forceful closing arguments to juries.\u201d <em>State v. Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 727 A.2d 1 (citations omitted). Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he primary duty of a prosecutor is not to obtain convictions, but to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>128, 320, 524 A.2d 188 (1987)(quoted in <em>Frost). </em>\u201cIt is as much his duty to refrain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\u201d <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 105, 293 A.2d 176 (1972)(quoting <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 <em>U.S. </em>78, 88, 55 <em>S.Ct. </em>629, 633, 79 <em>L.Ed. </em>1314, 1321 (1935)(quoted in <em>Frost)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Whether particular prosecutorial efforts can be tolerated as vigorous advocacy or must be condemned as misconduct is often a difficult determination to make. In every instance, the performance must be evaluated in the context of the entire trial, the issues presented, and the general approaches employed. Here, there is no question that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of propriety. Some of the specific challenges to the testimony of defendant\u2019s experts, both in cross-examination and on summation, considered separately, might well have been allowable as instances of tolerable advocacy, but when viewed together in the light of the prosecutor\u2019s unsubtle and evidentially unsupported assertions that the experts had sold their integrity for their witness fees, the line established in <em>Smith </em>was crossed. The prosecutor would have been well advised to allow the logic of the State\u2019s theory to speak for itself, rather than engaging in a vituperative attack on the individuals conveying the message of the countervailing theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The summation in this ease began badly with an ill-conceived statement designed to prejudice the jury into viewing the State\u2019s case with undue favor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: * \u2019\u25a0 * I also want to tell you before I begin that this case has not been particularly easy for me. I represent the citizenry of our State. When I come into a courtroom like I did in this case and every other case there is no person sitting in a chair next to me. When that seat is there, it\u2019s empty, unlike [defense counsel] who has a specific client sitting next to him. I\u2019m here alone on behalf of the State. I want to make that point \u2018cause I want you to pretend that in that seat next to me are all your friends, neighbors and relatives in the community because it\u2019s on their behalf that I bring this case to you and as a public servant it\u2019s my obligation and my desire to seek out justice based upon the evidence that was presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Inappropriate enough under general principles governing a prosecutor\u2019s duty to refrain from excessive conduct calculated to produce a verdict based on the jurors\u2019 prejudices rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>evidence in the case, see <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 83, 727 A.2d 1; <em>Farrell, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 102-05, 293 A.2d 176 (1972); <em>State v. West, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>327, 338-39, 149 A.2d 217 (1959), that introductory statement, when considered in the light of the entire summation, served to magnify and concentrate all the ensuing improprieties as well as those that had already been perpetrated in cross-examination. The highly prejudicial power of all the defects was undiluted by any offsetting conduct of the prosecutor and could not be adequately remedied by the trial judge\u2019s wholly appropriate efforts to mitigate the harm through curative instructions to the jury. The misconduct was not \u201cslight or confined to a single instance, but ... was pronounced and persistent, with a probable cumulative effect upon the jury which cannot be disregarded as inconsequential.\u201d <em>Berger, supra, </em>295 <em>U.S. </em>at 89, 55 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 633, 79 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s summation in this case was a catalog of prohibited defects which \u201cover-stepped the bounds of propriety and created a real danger of prejudice to the accused.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 770 A.2d 255 (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>489, 511, 158 A.2d 11 (1960)). Many of the Supreme Court\u2019s requirements governing the conduct of prosecutors in summation, as elucidated in <em>Smith, </em>constitute a litany of the general misconduct which characterized this prosecutor\u2019s behavior. \u201c[P]rosecutors are not permitted to cast unjustified aspersions on the defense or defense counsel.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 177, 770 A.2d 255 (citing <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 86, 727 A.2d 1 (1999)). They may not, in ways that are excessive, \u201cdirectly demean[ ] the credibility of a defense witness.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 770 A.2d 255 (citing <em>State v. Rose, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>454, 548 A.2d 1058 (1988)). A \u201cprosecutor\u2019s comments [are] \u2018clearly improper\u2019 [when they] impl[y] that the expert\u2019s testimony was fabricated or contrived with the assistance of defense counsel.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 770 A.2d 255 (citing <em>Rose, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 518-19, 548 A.2d 1058). An argument that a defense or testimony was \u201cfabricated\u201d is impermissible in the absence of support in the record. <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 179-80, 770 A.2d 255 (adopting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the reasoning of the dissent in <em>State v. DiPaglia, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>288, 298-307, 315 A.2d 385 (1974)(Clifford, J., dissenting)). Prosecutors\u2019 summations \u201cdiscrediting the motivation of expert witnesses \u2018without support in the record\u2019 and \u2018apparently based only on the prosecutor\u2019s own opinion[,]\u2019 \u201d are to be avoided. <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 180, 770 A.2d 255 (citing <em>State v. Moore, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>420, 462, 585 A.2d 864 (1991)). It is improper for a prosecutor to make \u201ccomments ... unsupported by the record ... implying] that the experts\u2019 testimony had been scripted for them by defense counsel.]\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 181, 770 A.2d 255 (citing <em>State v. Marquez, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 172, 649 A.2d 114 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>99, 660 A.2d 1198 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We are cautioned, in turn, to review the record with care in evaluating prosecutorial performance. <em>See Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 83, 727 A.2d 1. And further, \u201c[a] finding of prosecutorial misconduct does not end a reviewing court\u2019s inquiry because, in order to justify reversal, the misconduct must have been \u2018so egregious that it deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 181, 770 A.2d 255 (quoting <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 83, 727 A.2d 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The foregoing cross-examination and summation excerpts speak for themselves. They clearly disclose a pattern of prosecutorial excesses that had every capacity to deny defendant the fair and impartial jury review to which he was entitled. <em>Smith </em>also instructs us, specifically, that there is a difference, on the one hand, between commenting upon payment to an expert witness as a basis for presenting the jury with an argument of bias and, on the other hand, with nothing more than the payment itself, concentrating so much on that fact as to transform the argument into an independent collateral issue in the case. <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 182-85, 770 A.2d 255. The prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case crossed the line. And, because the prosecutor\u2019s approach to the most critical proofs in the case was so comprehensively tainted by the conduct we have described, we are left without the requisite sense of confidence that the verdict was the result of a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>assessment of permissible considerations based on the evidence in the case. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 188-89, 770 A.2d 255. Accordingly, we are constrained to reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">With onr determination that the convictions must be reversed and the matter retried, the sentencing issues defendant raises are moot. By way of guidance for the future, however, we note that the record of the sentencing proceeding that occurred discloses no adequate articulation of the trial court\u2019s reasons for selecting a seventy-five year prison term from among the range of sentences available. <em>See State v. Kruse, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>354, 359-60, 521 A.2d 836 (1987); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 359-60, 471 A.2d 370 (1984); <em>see also State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989). Moreover, the rule of <em>State v. Manzie, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>113, 773 A.2d 659 (2001), <em>aff'g, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 762 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2000), decided since this matter was concluded at the trial level, holds that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, the \u201cNo Early Release Act,\u201d does not apply to murder convictions for crimes antedating the amendment of the statute effective June 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
