Colberg, Jr., presiding, granting respondent Richard Cosgriffe\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">One issue is before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">Whether \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, the statute of limitations for claims involving childhood sexual abuse, violates the state or federal constitutions because it provides for retroactive application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In January 1991, at the age of forty-one, the appellant Carol Cosgriffe filed a complaint in District Court pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, against respondent, Richard Cosgriffe, her natural father. Her complaint set forth several alleged instances of sexual abuse by respondent which she alleges occurred between the years 1965 and 1967, when she was between the ages of sixteen and nineteen. The appellant alleges that due to respondent\u2019s abuse she has sustained severe emotional and physical injuries, including damage to her self esteem, an inability to maintain gainful, continuous employment, drug and alcohol dependency, sexual promiscuity, and an inability to maintain meaningful, long-term relationships. Appellant further alleges that it was only after consulting a psychiatrist and through counseling she discovered her problems were caused by the alleged abuse and that the discovery occurred only a short time prior to the filing of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The respondent moved the court for summary judgment on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">1. Section 27-2-216, MCA, violates the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">2. Section 27-2-216, MCA, violates Article II, Section 17 (Due Process) and Section 31 (ex post facto laws) of the Montana Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">3. Section 27-2-216(3), MCA, is unconstitutional because it is vague, uncertain and indefinite.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">Following a thorough briefing of the matter before the District Court, the court granted respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">The legislative history indicates that \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, was enacted in response to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>E.W. v.D.C.H. </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 481, 754 P.2d 817. In that case, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">While this Court is aware of the horrifying damage inflicted by child molesters, it is not for us to rewrite the statute of limitations to accommodate such claims through judicial fiat. Such task is properly vested in the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-14\"><em>E.W., </em>754 P.2d at 821.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Section 27-2-216, MCA, enacted in 1989, states in its entirety: 27-2-216. Tort actions \u2014 childhood sexual abuse. (1) An action based on intentional conduct brought by a person for recovery of damages for injury suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse must be commenced not later than:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">(a) 3 years after the act of childhood sexual abuse that is alleged to have caused the injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">(b) 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that the injury was caused by the act of childhood sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">(2) It is not necessary for a plaintiff to establish which act, in a series of acts of childhood sexual abuse, caused the injury that is the subject of the suit. The plaintiff may compute the period referred to in subsection (l)(a) from the date of the last act by the same perpetrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">(3) As used in this section, \u201cchildhood sexual abuse\u201d means any act committed against a plaintiff who was less than 18 years of age at the time the act occurred and that would have been a violation of 45-5-502, 45-5-503, 45-5-504, 45-5-505, 45-5-507, 45-5-625, or prior similar laws in effect at the time the act occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">(4) The provisions of 27-2-401 apply to this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Turning our attention to the due process argument, respondent argues that \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, as passed by the legislature, improperly revives a claim after that claim is barred by the conventional tort statute of limitations. In substance his argument is that the retroactive application of the newly adopted statute of limitations denies his federal and state constitutional rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The real question is whether the legislature has the power to do what it did. Legislation repealing or extending the statute of limitations, with the effect of reviving claims previously barred, has consistently been upheld by the courts against due process objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">These cases take the view, which we believe is the better view, that such legislation does not take away any defenses which would have been a vested right in the defendant in the case. The respondent in this case still has the affirmative defense that his daughter knew or should have known within the statutory period that her injuries were caused by the act of childhood sexual abuse. This is a fact question a jury must decide later; not one to be decided by this Court. See <em>Chase Security Corp. v. Donaldson </em>(1945), 325 U.S. 304, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 89 L.Ed. 1628; see <em>Sum &amp; Substance of Constitutional Law, </em>4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Ed. Van Alstyne, Karst and Gerard (1986). Substantive due process arguments advanced by the respondent fail when the question is examined under the applicable restraints:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">[T]he restraints on legislation imposed by substantive due process as a source of constitutional protection for interests not specifically identified by explicit constitutional language could be summarized in a three-part formula: the legislation must: (a) seek to achieve a legitimate governmental purpose; (b) use means that are rationally related thereto; and (c) be neither arbitrary nor unreasonable in its effects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>Sum &amp; Substance of Constitutional Law, </em>at 258. Here, the respondent father concedes the legitimate governmental purpose of the legislation and that the means used are rationally related.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The District Court in granting summary judgment held, and the respondent argues, that the retroactive application of the newly adopted childhood sexual abuse statute of limitations places an unreasonable hardship and oppression on the respondent and that the statute, \u00a7 27-2-216(l)(b), MCA, basically destroys any limitations of actions and is unreasonable. This argument was very ably addressed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals. That court addressed the retroactive application of a statute which provides for sexual abuse claims and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">Respondents\u2019 arguments are without merit. Indeed, section 541.073 embraces a discovery rule, which, as respondents assert, may toll the start of the statute of limitations period for a long time after the abuse incident. Nonetheless, the statute plainly reflects awareness of the difficulty sexual abuse victims have in identifying and recognizing their injuries immediately. Research shows victims of sexual abuse may repress the memoiy of such incidents, and not discover the actual source of their problems for many years. [Footnote omitted.] In acknowledging this problem, the legislature, by enacting section 541.073, limits the possibility of the general statute of limitation barring a claim for sexual abuse, and holds the sexual abuser liable for his offenses. Because we are not in a position to judge the wisdom of the legislature, where, as here, the statute has a reasonable relation to the state\u2019s legitimate purpose of affording sexual abuse victims a remedy, we reject respondents\u2019 due process claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\"><em>K.E. v. Hoffman </em>(Minn. App. 1990), 452 N.W.2d 509, 513-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Respondent\u2019s argument, based on the Fourteenth Amendment prohibition of retroactive legislation when it divests any private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>vested interest, is inapplicable, as the respondent has no \u201cvested\u201d interest under these facts. The respondent argues that the running of the previously-applicable statute of limitations vests him with a right to be free from the appellant\u2019s claim after the expiration of the conventional statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Montana follows <em>Campbell v. Holt </em>(1885), 115 U.S. 620, 6 S.Ct. 209, 29 L.Ed. 483, in regard to due process and the retroactive application of statutes of limitation. This Court cited and explicitly adopted the majority holding of <em>Campbell </em>in <em>Guiterman v. Wishon </em>(1898), 21 Mont. 458, 461, 54 P. 566, 567, where the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">Statutes of limitation, being somewhat arbitrary in their nature, and founded in public needs and public policy, may shorten the periods in which actions shall be commenced, or may extend them, and yet not disturb vested rights, or rights of property. Such is the established rule of the federal courts since <em>Campbell v. Holt, supra, </em>decided long subsequent to <em>Gillette v. Hibbard, supra, </em>and upon this theory the codes of this state were adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We determine that Montana due process is not violated by the retroactive application of the statute here in question. The propriety of the actions of the state legislature in addressing a public need and a present public policy is not to be examined by this Court where we have previously stated that the statute has a reasonable relation to the legitimate purpose of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The appellant, in arguing that \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, was constitutional, notes that it is up to this Court to determine the statute\u2019s scope by determining the legislature\u2019s power, intentions and application of the statute, noting that the legislature\u2019s intent is to be followed if at all possible. Section 1-2-102, MCA. Further, whenever common law and statutes conflict, the statute will take precedence. Section 1-1-108, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The legislature has specific powers to extend the statute of limitations. <em>Western Holding Co. v. Northwestern Land and Loan Co. </em>(1941), 113 Mont. 24, 120 P.2d 557. This Court, in <em>Penrod v. Hoskinson, M.D. </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 277, 552 P.2d 325, indicated that the legislature could extend the statute of limitations and apply it retroactively to reverse barred claims. \u201c \u2018[0]ur Constitution does not forbid the enactment of retrospective laws generally ....\u2019\u201d <em>Penrod, </em>552 P.2d at 327; quoting <em>Dunham v. Southside National Bank of Missoula </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 466, 548 P.2d 1383. There are no constitutional or statutory obstacles to legislative enactments of statutes relating to remedies that are retroactive in operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The trial court held the statute to be unconstitutional, as it did not meet Montana\u2019s constitutional right to due process. In so holding, it failed to concede that <em>E.W. </em>was decided before the enactment of \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA. In finding the statute unconstitutional, the trial court incorrectly relied on <em>Coady v. Reins </em>(1872), 1 Mont. 424, for the proposition that the expiration of the statute of limitations is a vested right and that the respondent had a right to rely on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">This Court in its 1872 ruling in <em>Coady, </em>held that \u201c[t]he statute, then, that must determine the right of the plaintiff to bring this action, is the one in force when the same was brought.\u201d <em>Coady, </em>1 Mont. at 429. Some 84 years later, this Court, for all intents and purposes, reversed <em>Coady </em>in our holding in <em>Johnson v. St. Patrick\u2019s Hospital </em>(1966), 148 Mont. 125, 417 P.2d 469. In <em>Johnson, </em>we criticized <em>Coady, </em>impliedly overruled it and noted that in 84 years the holding was never cited and that on the facts it was clearly distinguishable from <em>Johnson. </em>This Court, in <em>Grey v. Silver Bow County </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 213, 425 P.2d 819, cited the <em>Johnson </em>case, and upheld the discovery rule in a medical malpractice case. So that there is no question on what <em>Johnson </em>held, we clarify the record and conclude that <em>Johnson </em>overruled the <em>Coady </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We find no merit in respondent\u2019s argument that the statute is unconstitutional on its face. Section 27-2-216, MCA, is presumed constitutional. See <em>Montana Milk Control Board v. Rehberg </em>(1962), 141 Mont. 149, 376 P.2d 508. Respondent must prove the unconstitutionality \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Here, respondent has failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We hold that the plain language of \u00a7 27-2-216(l)(b), MCA, expressly allows the appellant to bring claims for childhood sexual abuse within three years of discovering that the injuries were allegedly caused by the abuse. The statute clearly overturns the rationale of our holding in <em>E. W. </em>and coincides with this Court\u2019s suggestion that the legislature is the proper body to change the law. The plain meaning of the statute cannot lead to an interpretation that the respondent suggests, which is the appellant\u2019s action accrued upon her awareness of the injury and there is no requirement of discovery of the cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Courts throughout the country have applied the discovery rule to cases where plaintiffs were aware of the sexual assaults at or before the age of majority, but were unaware of the causal connection between the abuse and the physical and psychological problems they encountered. Annotation, Running of Limitations Against Action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Civil Damages for Sexual Abuse of Child, 9 A.L.R. 5th 321, 343-47 (1993). In so holding, these courts have structured a broad interpretation of the discovery rule, which tolls the running of the statute until there is: 1) a discovery of the injury; and 2) a discovery of the cause of the injury. See Annotation, Running of Limitations Against Action for Civil Damages for Sexual Abuse of Child, 9 A.L.R. 5th 321, 343-47 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We note that the discovery doctrine relied on in <em>E.W. </em>predated the legislative enactment of the statute of limitation of \u00a7 27-2-216, MCA, which extends the statute of limitation until \u201c3 years after the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that the injury was caused by the act of sexual abuse.\u201d Here, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to when the appellant knew or should have known of her injury and its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling of summary judgment and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
