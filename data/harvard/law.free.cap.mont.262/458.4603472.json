The Ninth Judicial District Corut, Teton County, granted summary judgment in favor of Haman and granted her a license effective July 15,1992. The State appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On July 12, 1991, the State received a license application from Haman. Haman sought a license \u201cto manufacture gambling devices that are not legal for public play in the state and are manufactured only for export from the state.\u201d See \u00a7 23-5-152(3)(a), MCA. Across the front of the application were these words: \u201cTo distribute pull tabs outside of Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The State attempted to clarify the activity for which Haman sought the license. Subsequently, Haman was notified that she would not be granted a license if she intended to purchase pull tabs, which were not legal for public play in the state (Montana-illegal), from a manufacturer in Montana and then export those pull tabs out of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Haman contacted her attorney, who attempted to persuade the State to change its decision. Haman\u2019s attorney and the State discussed the application on many occasions. Finally, the parties requested that the District Court answer the legal question of whether \u00a7 23-5-152(3), MCA, permitted the State to license Haman\u2019s proposed activities. The controversy centered on whether the statute specifically authorized a person to <em>purchase </em>Montana-illegal pull tabs in Montana (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The parties proceeded under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, which allows a district court to grant a declaratory judgment when the parties dispute the interpretation of a statute. The parties submitted a stipulation of the facts and legal issues along with Haman\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. On February 12,1993, the District Court granted Haman summary judgment because no rule specifically existed which precluded the State from granting her a license. Further, the court retroactively granted Haman a license effective July 15,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Although both parties raised several issues, we determine that one issue is dispositive: Whether the District Court erred by granting Haman a license pursuant to \u00a7 23-5-152(3), MCA, when it justified its decision by declaring that no specific rule prevented the State from granting Haman a license to conduct her proposed activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Gambling is a highly regulated activity in Montana. In examining gambling statutes, we are mandated to strictly construe the statutes to only allow gambling activity which is specifically authorized by the statutes. Section 23-5-111, MCA. Article III, \u00a7 9 of Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitution states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">[a]ll forms of gambling, lotteries, and gift enterprises are prohibited unless authorized by acts of the legislature or by the people through initiative or referendum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Further, \u00a7 23-5-111, MCA(1991), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">In view of Article III, section 9, of the Montana constitution, Chapter 642, [the gambling] Laws of 1989, must be strictly construed by the department [of Justice] and the courts to allow only those types of gambling and gambling activity that are specifically and clearly allowed by Chapter 642, [the gambling] Laws of 1989. Here, the District Court noted the constitutional and statutory</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A55\">directives of strict construction and specific authorization. The court, however, failed to follow these directives. Instead, the court granted Haman summary judgment because \u201c[t]he Department has never adopted a rule to specifically permit [the] denial of a license in the factual situation of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Strict construction and specific authorization do not require \u201ca rule to specifically permit [the] denial of a license ... .\u201d Rather, these directives require a gambling statute to specifically authorize the proposed activity; here, the in-state purchase of Montana-illegal pull tabs. We hold that the District Court erred by inverting the constitutional and statutory directives of strict construction and specific authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Haman contends, however, that \u00a7 23-5-152(3)(b), MCA (1991), authorized her to purchase the pull tabs in Montana and export them out-of-state. Section 23-5-152(3)(b), MCA (1991), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">A person may not <em>manufacture or possess </em>an illegal gambling device for export from the state without having obtained a license from the department [of Justice]. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Haman maintains that the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d allows a person to both manufacture and possess illegal gambling devices. She argues that inherent in the word \u201cpossess\u201d is the implication that a person can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>purchase </em>illegal gambling devices within Montana (emphasis added). She concludes that \u00a7 23-5-152(3)(b), MCA (1991), specifically authorized her to purchase and export Montana-illegal pull tabs and, therefore, she argues that the State should have created administrative rules which would have allowed her to obtain a license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We are guided by the directives of strict construction and specific authorization. The proposed activity is either specifically authorized or it is not. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201c[i]n construing a statute, it is our function as an appellate court to ascertain and declare what in terms or in substance is contained in a statute and not insert what has been omitted.\u201d <em>State v. Crane </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 235, 238, 784 P.2d 901, 903. Whenever possible, this court is to look to the plain meaning of the statute in determining legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. Roberts v. Public Service Commission </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 242, 790 P.2d 489.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\"><em>Holly Sugar v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 407, 412, 830 P.2d 76, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">A plain reading of \u00a7 23-5-153(3)(b), MCA (1991), reveals that Haman\u2019s proposed activity \u2014 purchasing Montana-illegal pull tabs within Montana \u2014 is not authorized. The word \u201cpurchase\u201d is not encompassed in the word \u201cpossess.\u201d Since \u201cpurchase\u201d does not exist in the statute, we refuse to insert that word into the statute. We hold that \u00a7 23-5-152(3)(b), MCA(1991), does not specifically allow a person to \u201cpurchase\u201d Montana-illegal pull tabs in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Moreover, \u00a7 23-5-152(3)(a), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">The department [of Justice] may adopt rules to license persons to <em>manufacture </em>gambling devices that are not legal for public play in the state and <em>are manufactured only for export from the state. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Section 23-5-152(3)(a), MCA, is clear: Montana manufacturers can only export gambling devices, they cannot sell gambling devices in the State of Montana. Thus, it necessarily follows that persons and companies in Montana cannot purchase gambling devices from Montana manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">In this case, Haman proposed to purchase pull tabs from WorldWide Ticket, a Montana manufacturer. World-Wide Ticket cannot sell pull tabs to in-state buyers. Thus, there is no possible way for Haman to legally purchase pull tabs from World-Wide Ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">While the District Court relied on Haman\u2019s argument that the State should have made administrative rules allowing her to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>a license, we will not fall into the same trap. The State is only required to proceed to rule-making when a gambling statute specifically authorizes the gambling activity. See \u00a7\u00a7 23-5-111 and -115(1), (2) and (3), MCA; \u00a7 2-4-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Here, \u00a7 23-5-152(3)(b), MCA (1991), does not specifically authorize the in-state purchase of pull tabs. Accordingly, we hold that the statute does not compel the State to establish rules for the licensing of persons who purchase Montana-illegal pull tabs within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We reverse the decision of the District Court. We remand this case and direct the court to render a decision consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Alz\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"ADO\">JUSTICES HUNT and TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"A9g4\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We concur in the results of the majority opinion, but not with all that is said therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b486-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AxN\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">While I agree with the result of the Court\u2019s opinion and with what is expressed therein, I am not persuaded that the statutory basis which supports the State\u2019s position is clearly enough set forth. I submit that the provisions of \u00a7 23-5-152(3), MCA, as regards licensing are dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Montana law requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">In the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. <em>Where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Section 1-2-101, MCA. Applying that canon of statutory construction to \u00a7\u00a7 23-5-152(3)(a), (b) and (c), MCA, and reading those sections <em>pari materia, </em>it is clear that the statute enacted by the legislature prohibits the conduct for which Haman claims she is entitled to a license, and that the statute would, likewise, prohibit the Department of Justice (department) from adopting rules to license that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Section 23-5-152(3)(a), MCA, authorizes the department to adopt rules to license persons who manufacture Montana-illegal gambling devices for export from the state. Section 23-5-152(3)(c), MCA, authorizes a person licensed under \u00a7 23-5-152(3), MCA, to import Montana-illegal gambling devices into the state after notifying and receiving authorization from the department. Section 23-5-152(3)(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>MCA, prohibits the manufacture or possession of Montana-illegal gambling devices for export <em>without a license.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The dispositive point, here, is that the <em>only </em>license which is authorized by \u00a7 23-5-152(3), MCA, is the one in subsection (3)(a), and that is the license for the <em>manufacture of Montana-illegal gambling devices for export. </em>There is no authorization in subsection (3) for the issuance of a license for possession without manufacture for export.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Even if it had a mind to, the department, under that statutory scheme, could not adopt rules to license possession of Montana-illegal gambling devices (or, as the Court\u2019s opinion points out, the \u201cpurchase\u201d of such devices) without manufacture for export. Any such rule would be in derogation of the statute and would be unlawful. <em>See Winchell v. Dep\u2019t of State Lands </em>(1993),_Mont._, 865 P.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Accordingly, I specially concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-7\">JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
