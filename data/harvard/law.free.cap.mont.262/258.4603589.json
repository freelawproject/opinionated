We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The only question on appeal is whether the District Court erred in determining that the New York law is substantially similar to the Montana law so that petitioner\u2019s driving license was properly revoked under Montana law?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">William J. Montanye (Montanye) is a Montana resident who was cited in the state of New York on February 29,1992, for driving while intoxicated. Montanye was convicted on March 6, 1992, of driving while ability impaired, which is a charge of lesser degree than the New York charge of driving while intoxicated. Montanye was assessed a $350 fine and $250 cost, and his license was suspended for 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">On April 9,1992, New York authorities notified the Motor Vehicle Division of the Montana Department of Justice of Montanye\u2019s conviction. This action was taken pursuant to the Uniform Driver License Compact which both New York and Montana have adopted. See \u00a7 61-5-401, MCA, which sets forth the Compact in Articles I through IX and which is cited as \u201cDriver License Compact.\u201d The Driver License Compact requires that states are to report convictions of charges occurring in their states to the home state of a violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Following notification, the Montana Department of Justice, Motor Vehicles Division, suspended Montanye\u2019s Montana\u2019s driver\u2019s license as of April 9, 1992, for a period of six months. On May 1, Montanye initiated this action in District Court seeking review of the driver\u2019s license suspension action. Montanye also sought a stay of the suspension which was granted on May 6,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The District Court, in an order filed October 9, 1992, determined that, under the Driver License Compact, the New York offense of Driving While Ability Impaired is substantially similar to the Montana offense of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). Further, the court determined that Montana should properly suspend Montanye\u2019s license for six months, less the 90 days for which Montanye had his driving privileges suspended in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Because of the substantive changes made in the statute by amendments, we set forth \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA (1991), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">61-8-401. Persons under the influence of alcohol or drugs. (1) <em>It is unlawful </em>and punishable as provided in 61-8-714 and 61-8-723 <em>for any person who is under the influence of:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">(a) <em>alcohol to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">(d) <em>alcohol and any dangerous or other drug to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle within this state.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">(2) The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (1) is or has been entitled to use alcohol or such a drug under the laws of this state does not constitute a defense against any charge of violating subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\n<em>(3) \u201cUnder the influence\u201d means that as a result of taking into the body alcohol, drugs, or any combination thereof, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle has been diminished.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(4) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person at the time alleged, as shown by analysis of the person\u2019s blood, mine, or breath, shall give rise to the following inferences:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">(a) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less, it may be inferred that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">(b) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.10, that fact shall not give rise to any inference that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(c) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it may be inferred that the person was under the influence of alcohol. The <em>inference </em>is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">(5) The provisions of subsection (4) do not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the issue of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As emphasized, \u00a7 61-8-401(3), MCA, defines a person under the influence of alcohol as one whose ability to safely operate a motor vehicle has been diminished. In comparison, N.Y. Veh. and Traf. Law \u00a7 1192 subd. 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">Driving while ability impaired. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Separate from the Driver License Compact provisions, Montana \u00a7 61-5-204, MCA, allows suspension of a resident\u2019s license upon conviction in another state, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">Suspending resident\u2019s license upon conviction in another state. The department is authorized to suspend or revoke the driver\u2019s license ... of any resident of this state ... to drive a motor vehicle in this state upon receiving notice of the conviction of the person in another jurisdiction of an offense in that jurisdiction which, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the driver\u2019s license ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Montana law provides that conviction of a DUI carries with it a fine, imprisonment, and possible revocation or suspension of license. Montanye was convicted in New York of driving while impaired by alcohol which carries with it a potential punishment of a fine, imprisonment or suspension of license.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Both laws deal with the driver\u2019s diminished ability to drive while under the influence of alcohol. Both states provide for suspension of driver\u2019s license as a punishment. The suspension is 90 days in New York and six months in Montana. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-5-208, MCA. Montanye contends that the two sets of laws are totally dissimilar and that he should not have his license suspended here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The declaration of policy in the Driver License Compact adopted by both states provides a guide to the policy behind the Compact, providing in \u00a7 61-5-401(l)(c), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjZ\">The law in New York prohibits a driver from driving when alcohol impairs his or her ability to drive. The Montana law prohibits a driver from operating a car when his or her ability to drive safely is diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">As pointed out by the District Court, while the New York statute does not define impaired or intoxicated, in the case of <em>People v. Miller </em>(1975), 373 N.Y.S.2d 312, 314, the New York court defined intoxication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Therefore, this court finds that it was the intention of the Legislature that a person be convicted of driving while intoxicated when it is established that he has consumed enough alcohol so that his physical and mental control are markedly <em>diminished-, </em>or putting it another way, that <em>his judgment and ability to operate a motor vehicle are adversely affected to a substantial degree. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">If driving while intoxicated is defined as having one\u2019s physical and mental abilities \u201cmarkedly\u2019 diminished, driving while alcohol impaired indicates that the degree of impairment is somewhat less than markedly diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The District Court here compared the similarities and differences between the Montana and New York law and concluded that while there were a few differences, the offenses are substantially similar. The District Court emphasized that the conviction of either offense could result in fine, imprisonment and loss of driving privileges. It also emphasized that under New York law, a Montana DUI conviction would be deemed driving while impaired and therefore would come within the Driver License Compact provisions. The District Court further concluded that the fact that the Montana violation is a misdemeanor and the New York violation is a traffic offense is not a significant difference. It pointed out that Montana law requires finding that the driver has a diminished capacity to operate his vehicle safely. New York law requires that impairment be found when as a result of the ingestion of alcohol, a driver\u2019s control of a vehicle is less than would be expected by a reasonably prudent driver. The court concluded that a reasonably prudent driver also would be a safe driver. The District Court therefore concluded that the New York offense of driving while impaired is similar to Montana\u2019s driving under the influence laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Under the Driver License Compact Montana is required to determine if the offenses described in New York are of a \u201csubstantially similar nature.\u201d Driver License Compact, Article IV, (3), \u00a7 61-5-401, MCA. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the New York offense of driving while impaired is substantially similar in nature to the Montana law of driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The dissent contends that since conviction in New York while \u201cimpaired\u201d requires a lesser degree of intoxication than Montana, the offenses are not substantially similar. The dissent seems to contend that under <em>City of Helena v. Davis </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 492, 723 P.2d 224, the only way in which a conviction can be obtained is to spell out the alcoholic concentrations as set forth in the present \u00a7 61-8-401(4), MCA. That analysis ignores the changes subsequently made to our statute after <em>Dav is </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">As noted, the 1991 \u00a7 61-8-401(4), MCA, provides for various inferences which are to be applied to alcohol concentrations at various levels. Apparently the dissent is suggesting that if these elements are not presented within jury instructions, then under Dae is there cannot be impairment which is different than the state of New York. We disagree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">As a result the 1987 amendment to \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, Montana is no longer limited to proof of alcohol concentration in a person\u2019s blood, urine or breath. While previous subsections of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, contain the cut-off levels of blood alcohol content, the 1987 amendment has added a definition by which \u201cunder the influence\u201d can be defined not by a chemical analysis of the blood, but by the observation that a \u201cperson\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle has been diminished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">This 1987 amendment undermines any controlling affect of the <em>Davis </em>decision. In <em>Davis, </em>we determined that the instruction given to the jury which attempted to define \u201cunder the influence\u201d was not correct because such an evaluation had become more precise. In 1987, the definition of \u201cunder the influence\u201d underwent another change, this time it grew to include a definition which considered the driver\u2019s ability to drive and not just his blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The <em>Davis </em>reasoning concerns an outdated 1955 instruction erroneously given to the jury in the 1986 case. That instruction did not take into consideration the assumptions raised when blood alcohol content was measured. Subsequent to 1955, the legislature added assumptions as to ability to drive based upon the alcoholic content of a person\u2019s blood. The law had been changed to reflect those specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>levels of alcoholic content in the blood. Thus, the <em>Davis </em>Court was correct in reversing because the jury instruction did not reflect the current assumptions contained in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In 1987, the legislature determined that \u201cunder the influence\u201d is not exclusively determined by the blood\u2019s alcoholic content. Such content levels create inferences. Now, \u201cunder the influence\u201d is defined by the diminution of a person\u2019s ability to drive a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">This is exactly what the New York law concerning \u201cimpairment\u201d was meant to do. It was meant to give police a tool to determine when a person\u2019s ability to drive was diminished, despite the lack of breath analysis at the scene. <em>People v. Cruz </em>(1979), 423 N.Y.S.2d 625, 628. We conclude that the additions to the Montana statutes are comparable to the additions to the New York statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Driver License Compact makes it reciprocal for states adopting the uniform law to comply with the traffic laws in sister adopting states. Montanye had not complied with New York\u2019s traffic laws. He was convicted of driving while impaired because of alcohol and had his driving privileges revoked for 90 days. This is half the time required by Montana law for a suspended license. The District Court concluded that Montanye\u2019s driver\u2019s license could not be suspended for more than a total of six months and therefore subtracted from the Montana suspension the New York revocation of 90 days. The State of Montana has not cross-appealed the issue of length of time for license revocation and we will not, therefore, consider this issue on appeal. In order to preserve an issue not raised by appellant, respondent must file notice of cross appeal. Rules 5(a), 14, M.R.App.R; <em>Neumann v. Rogstad </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 24, 757 P.2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We hold that the District Court did not err in determining that the New York law is substantially similar to the Montana law so that petitioner\u2019s driving license was properly revoked under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE, TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b288-10\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AL7\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The majority\u2019s opinion has not cited New York\u2019s statute in its entirety. In its entirety, it provides for three separate offenses which relate to operating motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol. They are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>1. Driving while ability impaired. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">2. Driving while intoxicated; per se. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while such person has a .10 of one per centum or more by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood as shown by chemical analysis of such person\u2019s blood, breath, mine or saliva, made pursuant to the provisions of section eleven hundred ninety-four of this Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">3. Driving while intoxicated. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law \u00a7 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Paragraphs 2 and 3 of New York\u2019s statute are substantially similar to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-406 and -401, MCA, respectively. However, defendant was convicted of subparagraph 1 of the New York law. There is no counterpart in Montana for that paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The New York statute does not define the degree to which a person must be under the influence of alcohol before he or she is, as a matter of law, \u201cimpaired.\u201d The majority cites <em>People v. Miller </em>(1975), 373 N.Y.S.2d 312, 314, for the principle that \u201cintoxicated\u201d means that a driver\u2019s ability to operate a vehicle is \u201cadversely affected to a substantial degree.\u201d However, in a more recent decision, which was controlling at the time of this defendant\u2019s conviction, the highest court of the State of New York held that the requirement for \u201cimpairment\u201d is satisfied by a much lesser degree of influence. In <em>People v. Cruz </em>(1979), 423 N.Y.S.2d 625, 628, 399 N.E.2d 513, 516, the New York Court of Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">On its face, however, the statute does not speak of degrees of impairment; it simply prohibits the driving of a motor vehicle when the driver\u2019s \u201cability to operate such vehicle is impaired.\u201d (Vehicle &amp; Traffic Law, s. 1192, subd. 1). <em>Thus driving a motor vehicle while there is any alcoholic impairment of the driver\u2019s \u201cability to operate such vehicle\u201d would constitute a violation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">... It is evident from the statutory language and scheme that the question in each case is whether, by voluntarily consuming alcohol, this particular defendant has actually impaired, to any extent, the physical and mental abilities which he is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>We have specifically held in Montana that the degree of impairment which the New York court found sufficient to convict under subsection 1 of its impairment law, is not sufficient to convict under Montana\u2019s statute which prohibits operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In <em>City of Helena v. Davis </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 492, 723 P.2d 224, we held that it was error to instruct a jury that a person could be convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, if the jury simply found \u201cany alcoholic impairment.\u201d In that case, the defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. The jury was instructed, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, that \u201c[i]f the ability of the driver of an automobile has been lessened in the slightest degree by the use of alcohol, then the driver is deemed to be under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>723 P.2d at 225. On appeal, the defendant contended that he could not violate \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, unless his driving ability was impaired <em>\u201cto a degree that [rendered] him incapable of safely driving a [motor] vehicle.\u201d Davis, </em>723 P.2d at 225 (underlining added). The defendant\u2019s position was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">Davis asserts, the statute he was charged and convicted of violating <em>does </em>contain a clear legislative directive as to the extent of influence of the intoxicants. The offense charged in this case does not say the law is broken if one drives while impaired to the \u201cslightest degree;\u201d rather, the law states an offense is committed if one\u2019s driving ability is impaired \u201cto a degree that renders him incapable of safely driving a [motor] vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\"><em>Davis, </em>723 P.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">This Court agreed with the defendant and held that the instruction given in the district court in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">[N]o longer [was] a proper statement of the law in this State and the instruction must either be revised or abandoned to conform with the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-401. As noted above, we find the legislature today had specifically spelled out in \u00a7 61-8-401 the extent of the influence of intoxicants necessary to be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As applied to the instant case, Davis is entitled to a new trial with the jury being instructed as to proper criteria set out in \u00a7 61-8-401 which is applicable to a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol <em>and/or </em>drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\"><em>Davis, </em>723 P.2d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In its reference to the dissent, the majority opinion totally misses the point. The point is that under New York\u2019s offense of driving while impaired, any degree of impairment is sufficient. Under Montana\u2019s offense of driving while intoxicated, any degree of impairment is not sufficient. The fact that Montana\u2019s statute sets out inferences based on various levels of alcoholic concentrations merely confirms that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The majority opinion states that \u201c[ajpparently the dissent is suggesting that if these elements are not presented within jury instructions, then under <em>Davis </em>there cannot be impairment which is different than the state of New York. We disagree with that analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The dissent has nothing to do with jury instructions. The dissent is based upon very clear distinctions between the New York statute for which defendant was convicted, and the Montana statute for which his license is being revoked. The difference, based upon prior decisions from that state and this state, is the degree of impairment necessary for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The majority opinion states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">As a result of the 1987 addition to \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, Montana is no longer limited to proof of alcohol concentration in a person\u2019s blood, urine or breath. While previous subsections of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, contain the cut-off levels of blood alcohol content, the newly added subsection (3) has added a definition by which \u201cunder the influence\u201d can be defined not by a chemical analysis of the blood, but by the observation that a \u201cperson\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle has been diminished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Subsection (3) of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, does not have anything to do with the method by which intoxication is proven and says nothing about observation of an accused\u2019s physical or mental capacities. It simply defines \u201cunder the influence\u201d to mean that as a result of alcoholic consumption, \u201ca person\u2019s ability to <em>safely </em>operate a motor vehicle has been diminished.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">For some reason which escapes me, the majority concludes that based upon the addition of this definition in the 1987 amendment to \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, the <em>Davis </em>decision has no precedential significance. However, that makes no sense. In <em>Davis, </em>we held that it was error to instruct a jury that \u201c[i]f the ability of the driver of an automobile has been lessened in the slightest degree by the use of alcohol, then the driver is deemed to be under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>723 P.2d at 225. We arrived at that conclusion because of statutory presumptions based upon blood alcohol content. We did not do so because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the absence of the definition which was added by amendment in 1987. In fact, according to the defendant in <em>Davis, </em>the definitional addition relied on by the majority was already present since the statute under which he was charged provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">(1) It is unlawful and punishable as provided in 61-8-714 for any person who is under the influence of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">(d) alcohol and any drug <em>to a degree that renders him incapable of safely driving a vehicle </em>to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle within this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Therefore, there was no change to Montana\u2019s DUI statute in 1987 which has any bearing on our holding in <em>Davis. </em>We simply held that any diminution in the ability to drive, no matter how slight, did not constitute a violation of our DUI statute. If anything, the amendment referred to in the majority opinion makes that conclusion even more inescapable today.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Since conviction of driving while \u201cimpaired\u201d in New York requires a lesser degree of intoxication than driving \u201cunder the influence\u201d in Montana, the offenses are not substantially similar as a matter of law. Indeed, if they were substantially similar, New York would not find it necessary to establish two separate offenses which differ only with regard to the degree of impairment an individual suffers from the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">For these reasons, I dissent from the majority opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-9\">JUSTICES GRAY and HUNT join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
