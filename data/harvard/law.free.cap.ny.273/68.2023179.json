The civil service list is inappropriate for medical examiner in the Board of Education. <em>(Matter of Fink </em>v. <em>Finegan, </em>270 N. Y. 356; <em>People ex rel.

West. F. I. Co. </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>91 N. Y. 574; <em>People </em>v. <em>Weinstock, </em>117 App. Div. 168.) A board of education has the power to rearrange the duties of its employees, even though such rearrangement will deprive a person on an eligible list from the possibility of receiving an appointment. <em>(Weider </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>112 N. J. L. 631; <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>136 App. Div. 721; <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>218 N.

(Cons. Laws, ch. 16, \u00a7 570.) Even if the Board had the power to appoint school medical inspectors, it has neither power nor right to call medical examiners school medical inspectors for the sake of unjustifiably avoiding the provisions of the Civil Service Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 7). <em>(Matter of Hirschfield </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>227 N. Y. 297; <em>People ex rel. Swift </em>v. <em>Luce, </em>204 N. Y. 478; <em>People ex rel.

It is conceded that these appointments are provisional only and that the positions are to be filled by final appointments from an eligible list to be established by the respondent Board of Education through open competitive examination in accordance with the Civil Service Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The order should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Crane, Ch.
