(Waste Management), commenced a suit against Waste Management alleging, inter alia, that its payroll formula violated G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, which mandates a particular minimum wage for certain public works contracts, and G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, which governs overtime compensation. On cross motions for summary judgment, the judge ruled that Waste Management\u2019s payroll formula complied with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, but violated G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The judge, on Waste Management\u2019s unopposed motion, reported the following two questions of law to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201c1) Whether the defendant complied with prevailing wage law [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F,] by paying wages which, when averaging overtime and straight earnings, meet the prevailing wage rate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">\u201c2) Whether the defendant violated prevailing overtime [wage] law [G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A,] by calculating overtime wages using a regular hourly rate less than the prevailing wage eligible employees must be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">We granted Waste Management\u2019s application for direct appellate review. Because the judge concluded that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>violation of the prevailing wage law and the plaintiffs did not challenge that ruling or brief it on appeal, we find it unnecessary to answer the first question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 1A, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees ... for a work week longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 27F, which is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires that the prevailing wage rate set by the director of the Department of Labor<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> be paid to waste disposal employees performing under municipal contracts. See <em>Perlera </em>v. <em>Vining Disposal Serv., Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 496 (1999) (\u00a7 27F ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>plies to municipal waste disposal contracts). An employer may prorate on an hourly basis qualifying health and welfare benefits paid on behalf of an employee and deduct that amount from the prevailing wage rate. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the undisputed material facts. Waste Management provides solid waste disposal services to various municipalities. Waste Management must pay employees the prevailing wage rate for work performed under contracts with those municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Waste Management utilizes a complicated payroll formula that assigns employees engaged in prevailing wage work a \u201cbase pay rate\u201d below the applicable prevailing wage rate. It determines the base pay rate based on an assumption as to how many hours, including overtime hours, an employee typically works each week,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and uses the base pay rate to calculate overtime pay, paying the employee the base pay rate for the first forty, \u201cstraight time\u201d hours worked and one and one-half times the base pay rate for each overtime hour. Waste Management then averages the employee\u2019s nonovertime and overtime pay in order to meet or exceed the prevailing wage rate after the deduction of qualifying health and welfare benefits. By using this base pay rate, Waste Management uses overtime compensation to \u201cinfluence\u201d an employee\u2019s gross wages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When an employee\u2019s average hourly rate in a given week falls below the prevailing wage rate because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>employee has worked fewer hours than projected, Waste Management issues a \u201cbuffer check\u201d payment to bring the employee\u2019s earnings into compliance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfA\"><em>Discussion. </em>Waste Management contends that so long as employees are paid an hourly wage not less than the prevailing wage after qualifying deductions for <em>all </em>hours worked, including overtime, the requirements of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, are satisfied. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>We interpret G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced.\u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 574, 577 (1984). \u201cWe do not overlay the words of a statute with a convention of statutory construction that \u2018would frustrate the general beneficial purposes of the legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 454-455 (2007), quoting <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Waste Management\u2019s use of a base pay rate below the prevailing wage rate frustrates the purposes of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 1A, was \u201cintended to be \u2018essentially identical\u2019 \u201d to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1) (2000). <em>Swift </em>v. <em>AutoZone, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 443, 447 (2004), quoting <em>Valerio </em>v. <em>Putnam Assocs. Inc., </em>173 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 1999). Compare 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1) (2000) with G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. Accordingly, we ascribe the legislative purposes underlying the FLSA to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, see <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>337 Mass. 522, 527 (1958) (\u201cThe adjudged construction by the Federal courts is to be given to the subsequent enactment by the Legislature\u201d), and conclude that G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, aims to reduce the number of hours of work, encourage the employment of more persons, and compensate employees for the burden of a long workweek. See <em>Walling </em>v. <em>Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Co., </em>325 U.S. 419, 423-424 (1945).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In light of the purposes underlying G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, Waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Management\u2019s payroll formula is untenable. Waste Management evades the economic disincentive to have an employee work more than forty hours a week in that it ultimately pays the employee an hourly wage equal to or nearly equal to the prevailing wage rate regardless of whether the employee works overtime. Using the hypothetical in note 10, <em>supra, </em>an employee would receive $22 per hour regardless of whether the employee worked forty or fifty hours. Even if an employee received slightly more than $22 per hour for having worked some overtime,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that marginal increase hardly provides Waste Management with the economic disincentive intended by G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. Moreover, unlike employers who may hire more employees in order to avoid paying existing employees overtime, Waste Management obviates the need to hire additional employees by using the \u201cinfluence\u201d of overtime compensation on an employee\u2019s gross earnings to produce an average hourly wage equal or nearly equal to the prevailing wage rate, which Waste Management would otherwise pay to additional employees. Waste Management\u2019s payroll formula also does not compensate employees for longer work weeks, as illustrated by the fact that an employee performing prevailing wage work receives approximately the same hourly wage regardless whether the employee works overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The frustration of the purpose of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, provides yet another reason for rejecting Waste Management\u2019s payroll formula. See <em>Larson </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Plymouth, </em>430 Mass. 719, 724 (2000) (related statutes should be construed harmoniously and to implement intent of Legislature). The prevailing wage law endeavors to achieve parity between the wages of workers engaged in public construction projects and workers in the rest of the construction industry. See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 377 (2005) (Sosman, J., concurring); <em>Felix A. Marino </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>426 Mass. 458, 460 (1998). Waste Management\u2019s formula subverts the purpose of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, by enabling Waste Management to offer its services for less than what is customarily charged by its competitors for nonpublic works contracts. In the hypothetical in note 10, <em>supra, </em>Waste Management may offer its services for substantially less ($20 per hour for straight time and $30 for each overtime hour) than other similarly situated service providers (who pay employees $22 per hour for straight time and $33 for overtime) by using a base pay rate lower than the prevailing wage rate to calculate overtime compensation. In so doing, Waste Management undermines the wage protections embodied in the prevailing wage laws. See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, supra </em>at <em>377 </em>(Sosman, J., concurring); <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., supra </em>at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Our conclusion that Waste Management\u2019s payroll scheme violates G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, is consistent with an opinion letter issued by the division of occupational safety, the division of the Department of Labor charged with implementing G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, and G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, during this litigation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The division concluded that Waste Management\u2019s payroll formula violated G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, because G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, required Waste Management to pay its employees an hourly wage equal to the prevailing wage rate minus qualifying deductions and that overtime compensation should have been calculated based on that figure. Because the agency\u2019s interpretation is not contrary to the plain language of the statutes or their underlying purposes, it is entitled to deference. See <em>Teamsters Joint Council No. 10 </em>v. <em>Director of the Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev., </em>447 Mass. 100, 109-110 (2006). Contrast <em>Swift </em>v. <em>AutoZone, Inc., supra </em>at 450 (opinion letter not entitled to deference because it was contrary to law).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>One final issue warrants discussion. The parties have expended considerable energy debating the meaning of the term \u201cregular rate\u201d in G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Title 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02(3) (2003) provides that the overtime rate, subject to certain exemptions not relevant here, shall be \u201c[o]ne and one half times an employee\u2019s regular hourly rate, such regular hourly rate not to be less than the basic minimum wage . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cRegular hourly rate\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he amount that an employee is regularly paid for each hour of work.\u201d 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 (2003). The regulation further explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cWhen an employee, other than an employee exempt from overtime under [G. L.] c. 151, \u00a7 1A, is paid on a piece work basis, salary, or <em>any basis other than an hourly </em>rate, the regularly [szc] hourly rate shall be determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>dividing the total hours worked during the week into the employee\u2019s total weekly earnings. Regardless of the basis used, whether time rate, commission basis or piece rate, an employee shall be paid not less than the <em>applicable minimum wage </em>each week. The regular hourly rate shall include all remuneration for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee, but shall not include: ...(b) sums excluded under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(e).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201c[I]nterpret[ing] [the] regulation in the same manner as a statute, and according to traditional rules of construction,\u201d <em>Warce-wicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 550 (1991), the clear implication of 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 is that the rate paid to hourly employees forms the basis for calculating overtime and that that rate shall not be less than the \u201capplicable minimum wage.\u201d See <em>id. </em>The applicable minimum wage for public works contracts is the prevailing wage. This interpretation finds support in other sections of G. L. c. 149 that describe the prevailing wage rate as a minimum wage rate. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26 (minimum wage rate). See also G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27 (minimum rate or rates of wages). If, as Waste Management contends, the term \u201capplicable minimum wage\u201d was intended to refer to the <em>basic </em>minimum wage, see G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1; 455 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02(1), then the regulations would have explicitly stated so. This is especially true where, as here, the regulations use the term \u201cbasic minimum wage,\u201d 455 Code Mass Regs. \u00a7 2.02(1), to refer to the absolute floor on wages set by G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1. See <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 324 (1998) (\u201cWhere the Legislature used different language in different paragraphs of the same statute, it intended different meanings\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even if the regulations do not expressly require an employer to calculate overtime using the prevailing wage rate, we will not interpret the regulations \u201cin a way that produces a result which \u2018is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>contrary to the plain language of [G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A,] and its underlying purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 13 (2000), quoting <em>Protective Life Ins.

The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-13\"> Two of the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims are derivative of their claim under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. After concluding that Waste Management violated G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, the judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on those claims. The judge denied Waste Management\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to whether its violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, was wilful, see G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 IB (permitting award of treble damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees for wilful violations); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150 (same), reasoning that there was a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted in support of the plaintiffs by the Attorney General, on behalf of the Commonwealth and the Department of Labor\u2019s division of occupational safety, and the Massachusetts Building Trades Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> Waste Management does not contend that any of the statutory exemptions set forth in G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A (l)-(20), apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 27F, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">\u201cNo agreement of lease, rental or other arrangement, and no order or requisition under which a truck or any automotive or other vehicle or equipment is to be engaged in public works by the commonwealth or by a county, city, town or district, shall be entered into or given by any public official or public body unless said agreement, order or requisition contains a stipulation requiring prescribed rates of wages, as determined by the commissioner, to be paid to the operators of said trucks, vehicles or equipment. Any such agreement, order or requisition which does not contain said stipulation shall be invalid, and no payment shall be made thereunder. Said rates of wages shall be requested of said commissioner by said public official or public body, and shall be furnished by the commissioner in a schedule containing the classifications of jobs, and the rate of wages to be paid for each job. Said rates of wages shall include payments to health and welfare plans, or, if no such plan is in effect between employers and employees, the amount of such payments shall be paid directly to said operators.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-12\"> Although G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, refers to the \u201ccommissioner,\" the statute defines \u201ccommissioner\u201d as \u201cthe director of the department of labor.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> In the plaintiffs\u2019 case, Waste Management determined the base pay rate by projecting that the plaintiffs would work approximately 55.6 hours per week. Based on this assumption, Waste Management set the plaintiffs\u2019 base pay rate at $18.98 per hour, which results in an average hourly rate of $21.64, the prevailing wage rate applicable to the plaintiffs after the deduction of qualifying health and welfare benefits [(40 x $18.98) + (15.6 x [$18.98 x 1.5])]/55.6 = $21.64],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 27F, does not state specifically that the prevailing wage rate is the hourly rate employees are to be paid for the first forty hours of weekly wages. Waste Management contends that because the statute does not equate the two rates, \u00a7 27F may be construed as requiring payment of the prevailing wage rate for the total number of hours each week, including overtime hours. Under this approach, the prevailing wage rate is a fixed rate, and the \u201cbase pay rate,\u201d the hourly rate for the first forty hours, is actually a floating weekly rate, depending on the number of overtime hours actually worked. Waste Management\u2019s use of the \u201cbuffer check\u201d is an artificial device designed to keep the base pay rate floating in the same place each week. The effect is to make the base pay rate appear fixed, or \u201cregular,\u201d when in fact it is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b552-5\"> A buffer check payment also includes payment of an overtime premium on the payment needed to bring the employee\u2019s wages into compliance with the prevailing wage statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> To illustrate Waste Management\u2019s formula, we offer the following hypothetical. The prevailing wage rate for waste removal services for a hypothetical municipality is set at $25 per hour. Waste Management may deduct $3 per hour from the prevailing wage rate for qualifying health and welfare benefits, and therefore must pay the employee $22 per hour. Waste Management anticipates that its employee will work exclusively on the contract with the municipality for fifty hours every week. Based on these assumptions, Waste Management will set its base pay rate at $20 per hour to ensure that the employee receives an average wage of at least $22 per hour for <em>all </em>hours worked, paying the employee $20 per hour for the first forty \u201cstraight time\u201d hours and $30 per hour for each overtime hour. Waste Management will determine the base pay rate, B, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">[(40 hours x B) + 10 hours (1.5 B)]/50 = $22 per hour</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\">[ 55 B]/50 = $22 per hour</p>\n<p id=\"A92\">B = $20 per hour</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">If the employee works only forty hours one week, then the employee will be paid $20 per hour for straight time, or $800, and receive a buffer check for $80 contemporaneous with the $800 check, resulting in an average hourly wage of $22. If the employee works forty-five hours in a particular week, the employee will receive $800 for straight time and $150 in overtime pay, resulting in an average hourly wage of $21.11. Waste Management will issue a buffer check for $ 42.38, consisting of $40.15 (to bring the employee\u2019s average hourly wage up to $22) and $2.23 (overtime earnings on the additional buffer check wages). The overtime earnings will be calculated as follows: $.89 (difference between an hourly wage of $22 and $21.11) x .5 (half time) x 5 overtime hours = $2.23. The employee\u2019s average hourly rate for that week will be $22.05 [($42.38 + $150 + 800)/45 = $2.05],</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">To illustrate how an employee\u2019s base rate actually floats, we use this same hypothetical, in which $992.38 is paid for a forty-five hour week. The base pay, when calculated solely through the use of rates and hours, and omitting buffer check calculations, is approximately $20.89 per hour [$20.89 x 40 hours = $835.60, plus overtime at 1.5 x $20.89 x 5 hours = $156.70, for a total pay of $992.30], There is in fact nothing \u201cregular\u201d about the rate of pay that Waste Management\u2019s employees earn for the first forty hours of any given week that contains overtime work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> Waste Management urges ns to infer the Legislature\u2019s sanction of its payroll formula from the fact that the Legislature has not amended either the prevailing wage statute or the overtime statute even though at least one of the Federal statutes similar to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, expressly requires overtime compensation to be calculated using the prevailing wage rate. See 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) (2000). Even if we assume, arguendo, that 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 is somewhat analogous to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, the legislative histories of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, and 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 do not support the inference Waste Management asks us to make. The enactment of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, in 1960, see St. 1960, c. 795, preceded the enactment of 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142, which was enacted in 1964. See Pub. L. 88-349, \u00a7 1, 78 Stat. 239 (1964). Therefore, the Massachusetts prevailing wage law was not modeled on 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). For this reason, we decline to infer the Legislature\u2019s rejection of the prevailing wage rate to calculate overtime compensation from its failure to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>prevailing wage or overtime statutes to correspond to Federal law. Contrast <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 432-433 (1983) (\u201cIf the language of a statute differs in material respects from a previously enacted analogous Federal statute which the Legislature appears to have considered, a decision to reject the legal standards embodied or implicit in the language of the Federal statute may be inferred\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> For example, if the employee worked forty-five hours, the employee would receive an average hourly wage of $22.05. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>In a fifty-five hour work week, the employee\u2019s average hourly wage would be $ 22.72 [40 x $20 + 15 x $30/55 = $22.72],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> Although an agency\u2019s determination is ordinarily entitled to great deference, see <em>Teamsters Joint Council No. 10 </em>v. <em>Director of the Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev., </em>447 Mass. 100, 106 (2006), \u201c[a]n administrative interpretation developed during, or shortly before, the litigation in question is entitled to less weight than that of a long-standing administrative interpretation of administrative rules.\u201d 1A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 31.6, at 730 (6th ed. rev. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> Waste Management, relying on the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that its payroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>formula did not violate the prevailing wage law, argues that the opinion letter erroneously assumes that an employer may not use a base pay rate below the prevailing wage rate and is therefore not entitled to deference. We disagree. Waste Management overstates the significance of the ruling below. The judge ruled that, \u201c[f]or purposes of complying with the prevailing wage law <em>only, </em>it makes no practical difference that the defendant\u2019s payroll method uses a formula with a base rate and buffer checks, as long as the average hourly rate of wages equals the prevailing wage rate\u201d (emphasis in original). The judge\u2019s decision, fairly read, suggests that while an employer\u2019s liability under the prevailing wage law can be determined independent of its liability under the overtime law, an employer\u2019s liability under the overtime law must be read in conjunction with the prevailing wage law where applicable. Although we do not address Waste Management\u2019s liability under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, we note that while the plain language of the prevailing wage statute does not expressly forbid the use of buffer checks, the division\u2019s position does not contravene either the plain language of the statute or its underlying purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> We last considered the meaning of this term in <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 174-177 (2000), which dealt with the calculation of overtime for a salaried employee.
