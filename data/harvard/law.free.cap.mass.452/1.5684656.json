We answer in the affirmative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we later explain more fully, the loss of chance doctrine views a person\u2019s prospects for surviving a serious medical condition as something of value, even if the possibility of recovery was less than even prior to the physician\u2019s tortious conduct. Where a physician\u2019s negligence reduces or eliminates the patient\u2019s prospects for achieving a more favorable medical outcome, the physician has harmed the patient and is liable for damages. Permitting recovery for loss of chance is particularly appropriate in the area of medical negligence. Our decision today is limited to such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">The case before us was tried before a jury in the Superior Court. In response to special questions, the jury found the defendant physician negligent in misdiagnosing the condition of the decedent over a period of approximately three years. They found as well that the physician\u2019s negligence was a \u201csubstantial contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>uting factor\u201d to the decedent\u2019s death. They awarded $160,000 to the decedent\u2019s estate for the pain and suffering caused by the physician\u2019s negligence, and $328,125 to the decedent\u2019s widow and son for the decedent\u2019s loss of chance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants appealed, asserting, among other things, that loss of chance was not cognizable under the Massachusetts wrongful death statute, see G. L. c. 229, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or otherwise. We granted their application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We conclude that recognizing loss of chance in the limited domain of medical negligence advances the fundamental goals and principles of our tort law. We also conclude that recognizing a cause of action from loss of chance of survival under the wrongful death statute comports with the common law of wrongful death as it has developed in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60, 71 (1972) (recognizing common-law origin of wrongful death actions in Commonwealth). The application of the doctrine to the evidence in this case supported the jury\u2019s findings as to loss of chance liability. Finally, although we determine that some portions of the jury instructions do not conform in all respects to the guidelines we set out below, they were broadly consistent with our decision today. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>On the record before us, the jury could have found the following: the defendant, Dr. Neil S. Birnbaum, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>board-certified internist and president of the board of the co-defendant, Dedham Medical Associates, Inc. (Medical Associates), became the primary care physician of the decedent, Kimiyoshi Matsuyama, in July, 1995, when the forty-two year old Matsuyama presented himself for a routine physical examination. Matsuyama\u2019s medical records at the time of his initial visit to Bimbaum disclosed complaints of gastric distress dating back to 1988. The records also indicated that in 1994 Matsuyama\u2019s previous physician had noted that Matsuyama might need an upper gastrointestinal series or small bowel follow-through to evaluate further his symptoms.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the physical Matsuyama complained, as Birnbaum testified at trial, of \u201cheartburn and difficulty breathing associated with eating and lifting.\u201d Bimbaum testified that he was aware at the time that Matsuyama, a person of Asian ancestry who had lived in Korea and Japan for the first twenty-four years of his life and had a history of smoking, was at a significantly higher risk for developing gastric cancer than was the general population of the United States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Bimbaum did not order any tests to determine the cause of Matsuyama\u2019s complaints. Based on his physical examination alone, Bimbaum diagnosed Matsuyama with gastrointestinal reflux disease and recommended over-the-counter medications to reheve Matsuyama\u2019s symptoms. Bimbaum followed a similar course of action in October, 1996, when Matsuyama returned for a sick visit, complaining that his heartburn was worse and that he had gastric pain after eating.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In September, 1997, Matsuyama consulted Birnbaum about moles that had recently developed on his body. On visual inspection, Bimbaum made a diagnosis of \u201cone benign seborrhea kera-tosis.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bimbaum testified at trial that such moles are \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>mon\u201d and \u201cnot something that I would [have] overly been that fearful of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Matsuyama next appeared for an office visit with Bimbaum on September 1, 1998, for a followup to a recent urgent care visit and for concerns about a mole over his left eye. Bimbaum was aware at the time that on August, 24, 1998, Matsuyama had presented himself at Medical Associates\u2019s urgent care facility complaining of severe stomach pain during the previous forty-eight hours, which the urgent care physician had diagnosed as gastritis. Bimbaum made a clinical diagnosis of nonulcer dyspepsia, again without the benefit of any evaluative gastrointestinal tests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, he did order a test on Matsuyama to determine the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a bacteria associated with gastric cancer, among other gastric maladies. When the test came back positive for H. pylori, Birnbaum directed his nurse to inform Matsuyama of the test results and to call in medications to treat Matsuyama\u2019s H. pylori. Neither the nurse nor Bimbaum told Matsuyama about the association of H. pylori with gastrointestinal diseases, of which Bimbaum was aware. By this time, Birnbaum testified, gastritis \u201cprobably was my leading diagnosis,\u201d but he did not order an endoscopy with biopsy or an upper gastrointestinal series, which he knew would definitively confirm or rule out his diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">When Matsuyama next appeared in Birnbaum\u2019s office in November, 1998, for a routine checkup and followup, Bimbaum noted that the patient \u201cwas feeling better\u201d and had no \u201csignificant symptoms\u201d of gastric distress. Such was not the case on May 3, 1999, when Matsuyama went to Birnbaum complaining of epi-gastric pain, vomiting, sudden weight loss, and premature feelings of fullness after eating. Birnbaum ordered a gastrointestinal series and an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed a two-centimeter mass in Matsuyama\u2019s stomach. Subsequent medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>procedures confirmed the presence of infiltrative gastric adenoid carcinoma, signet ring cell type. Matsuyama then began treatment with specialists. He succumbed to gastric cancer the following October, leaving his wife and his minor son.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">In June, 2000, the plaintiff filed suit against Birnbaum and Medical Associates. Her complaint, as amended, alleged wrongful death, breach of contract, and negligence against both defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Trial began in the Superior Court in July, 2004. The jury heard testimony from, among others,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Stuart Ira Finkel, a gastroenterologist. Finkel testified that, in his opinion, Bimbaum breached the applicable standard of care in evaluating and treating Matsuyama, resulting in Matsuyama\u2019s death. Specifically, Finkel opined that, in light of Matsuyama\u2019s complaints, symptoms, and risk factors, including the presence of H. pylori, his Japanese ancestry, his having lived in Japan or Korea for extended periods, his smoking history, and other well-known risk factors, an internist exercising the expected standard of care would have ordered an upper gastrointestinal series X-ray or an endoscopy, or referred Matsuyama to a specialist for endoscopy, beginning in 1995. The expert also testified that the appearance of Matsuyama\u2019s seborrheic keratosis in September, 1997, \u201ccould have and should have\u201d triggered a suspicion of stomach cancer \u201cright then and there.\u201d Finkel told the jury that if Bimbaum had ordered the appropriate testing on Matsuyama in 1995, the cancer \u201cwould have been diagnosed\u201d and \u201ctreated in a timely fashion when it might still have been curable.\u201d As a result of Bimbaum\u2019s failure to make a timely diagnosis, Finkel opined, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the cancer metastasized to an advanced, inoperable phase, resulting in Matsuyama\u2019s premature death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In the course of his testimony, Finkel offered an extensive discussion of the tumor-lymph nodes-metastasis (TNM) method for classifying gastric cancer into separate \u201cstages,\u201d from stage 0 to stage 4, with each higher stage signaling a more advanced cancer and carrying a statistically diminished chance for survival, as measured by the standard gastric cancer metric of five years' cancer free after treatment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Patients with stage 0, in which the cancer is confined to the stomach lining, have a better than 90% survival rate, Finkel averred; at stage 1, the survival rate drops to between 60% and 80%; at stage 2, between 30% and 50%; at stage 3, between 10% and 20%; and at stage 4, less than 4%.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finkel opined that, as a result of Bimbaum\u2019s breach of the standard of care, Matsuyama lost the opportunity of having gas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>trie cancer \u201cdiagnosed and treated in a timely fashion when it might still have been curable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Dr. Mark Peppercorn, a gastroenterologist, testified as an expert for the defense. He testified that Bimbaum did not deviate from the accepted standard of care over the course of his treatment of Matsuyama; that Matsuyama\u2019s type of stomach cancer had \u201ca different biology, a different characteristic from garden variety, if you want to use that poor term, cancer\u201d; and that his type of cancer did not manifest symptoms until it was in an advanced stage. Peppercorn testified that staging of cancers is done by oncologists for treatment, not actuarial, purposes, with the following presumed five-year survival rates: at stage 1, from 60% to 90%; at stage 2, 25% to 40%; at stage 3, up to 10%; and at stage 4, \u201cpractically zero; less than [5%], probably.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In addition to the medical expert testimony, the jury heard testimony from the plaintiff\u2019s forensic economist, Dr. Dana Hewins. Hewins testified that, using the standard statistical measures and methods in his field, Matsuyama, had he not died when he did, could have been expected to work an additional 17.7 years, during which time Matsuyama\u2019s net earnings from his income minus his personal consumption would have been $466,235.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Hewins also testified that Matsuyama could have been expected to live an additional 28.32 years (to age seventy-five), during which time the monetary value of his household services would have been $157,225. Thus, had Matsuyama attained his full work life and life expectancies, he would have contributed $623,460 to his household. Hewins did not offer any projections concerning what Matsuyama would have contributed in wages or services to his family had he died later than he did but earlier than his full work life and life expectancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">After a six-day trial, the case went to the jury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>to special questions, the jury found Bimbaum negligent in Mat-suyama\u2019s treatment, but found him not grossly negligent. They also found that Bimbaum\u2019s negligence was a \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d to Matsuyama\u2019s death,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and awarded Matsuya-ma\u2019s estate $160,000 for pain and suffering caused by the negligence. Then, in response to a special jury question, see note 51, <em>infra, </em>the jury awarded damages for loss of chance, which they calculated as follows: they awarded $875,000 as \u201cfull\u201d wrongful death damages,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and found that Matsuyama was suffering from stage 2 adenocarcinoma at the time of Bimbaum\u2019s initial negligence and had a 37.5% chance of survival at that time. They awarded the plaintiff \u201cfinal\u201d loss of chance damages of $328,125 ($875,000 multiplied by .375). Judgment entered against the defendants, jointly and severally, on the negligence-wrongful death count in the amount of $328,125, later amended to $281,310, see note 4, <em>supra. </em>A separate judgment entered against the defendants, jointly and severally, for damages in the amount of $160,000 on the counts for conscious pain and suffering.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">2. <em>Loss of chance. </em>Although we address the issue for the first time today, a substantial and growing majority of the States that have considered the question have indorsed the loss of chance doctrine, in one form or another, in medical malpractice actions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We join that majority to ensure that the fundamental aims and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>principles of our tort law remain fully applicable to the modem world of sophisticated medical diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The development of the loss of chance doctrine offers a win<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>dow into why it is needed. The doctrine originated in dissatisfaction with the prevailing \u201call or nothing\u201d rule of tort recovery. See generally King, Jr., Causation, Valuation, and Chance in Personal Injury Torts Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences, 90 Yale LJ. 1353, 1365-1366 (1981) (King I). Under the all or nothing rule, a plaintiff may recover damages only by showing that the defendant\u2019s negligence more likely than not caused the ultimate outcome, in this case the patient\u2019s death; if the plaintiff meets this burden, the plaintiff then recovers 100% of her damages.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, if a patient had a 51% chance of survival, and the negligent misdiagnosis or treatment caused that chance to drop to zero, the estate is awarded <em>full </em>wrongful death damages.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On the other hand, if a patient had a 49% chance of survival, and the negligent misdiagnosis or treatment caused that chance to drop to zero, the plaintiff receives nothing. So long as the patient\u2019s chance of survival before the physician\u2019s negligence was less than even, it is logically impossible for her to show that the physician\u2019s negligence was the but-for cause of her death, so she can recover nothing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, the all or nothing rule provides a \u201cblanket release from liability for doctors and hospitals any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>there was less than a 50 percent chance of survival, regardless of how flagrant the negligence.\u201d <em>Herskovits </em>v. <em>Group Health Coop. of Puget Sound, 99 </em>Wash. 2d 609, 614 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">As many courts and commentators have noted, the all or nothing rule is inadequate to advance the fundamental aims of tort law. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 901 (1979) (delineating distinct rationales for tort liability); K.S. Abraham, Forms and Functions of Tort Law 14-20 (3d ed. 2007) (same). Fundamentally, the all or nothing approach does not serve the basic aim of \u201cfairly allocating the costs and risks of human injuries,\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>422 Mass. 281, 288 (1996), quoting <em>Vertentes </em>v. <em>Barletta Co., </em>392 Mass. 165, 171 (1984) (Abrams, 1, concurring).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See King I, <em>supra </em>at 1377 (all or nothing rule places loss of chance losses \u201coutside tort law,\u201d thereby \u201cdistorting] the loss-assigning role of tort law\u201d). The all or nothing rule \u201cfails to deter\u201d medical negligence because it immunizes \u201cwhole areas of medical practice from liability.\u201d <em>McMackin </em>v. <em>Johnson County Healthcare Ctr., </em>73 P.3d 1094, 1099 (Wyo. 2003), <em>S.C., </em>88 P. 3d 491 (Wyo. 2004). It fails to provide the proper incentives to ensure that the care patients receive does not slip below the \u201cstandard of care and skill of the average member of the profession practising the specialty.\u201d <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968). And the all or nothing rule fails to ensure that victims, who incur the real harm of losing their opportunity for a better outcome, are fairly compensated for their loss. See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>255 Kan. 199, 209 (1994), quoting Keith, Loss of Chance: A Modem Proportional Approach to Damages in Texas, 44 Baylor L. Rev. 759, 760 (1992) (\u201cthe loss of chance doctrine serves to fairly compensate the plaintiff for the tortious deprivation of an opportunity to live longer or recover from a physical injury or condition inflicted by the defendant\u2019s wrongful act or omission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">As the Supreme Court of Wyoming recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cFirst, the loss of an improved chance of survival or improvement in condition, even if the original odds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>less than fifty percent, is an opportunity lost due to negligence. Much treatment of diseases is aimed at extending life for brief periods and improving its quality rather than curing the underlying disease. Much of the American health care dollar is spent on such treatments, aimed at improving the odds. In the words of the Delaware Supreme Court, \u2018[i]t is unjust not to remedy such a loss.\u2019 Second, immunizing whole areas of medical practice from liability by requiring proof by more than fifty percent that the negligence caused the injury fails to deter negligence conduct. As Judge Posner wrote in <em>DePass </em>v. <em>United States, \u2018A </em>tortfeasor should not get off soot free because instead of killing his victim outright he inflicts an injury that is likely though not certain to shorten the victim\u2019s life.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><em>McMackin </em>v. <em>Johnson County Healthcare Ctr., supra </em>at 1099, quoting <em>DePass </em>v. <em>United States, </em>721 F.2d 203, 208 (7th Cir. 1983) (Posner, J., dissenting). See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ohio Permanente Med. Group, Inc., 76 </em>Ohio St. 3d 483, 488 (1996), rev\u2019g <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc., 27 </em>Ohio St. 2d 242 (1971) (\u201cRarely does the law present so clear an opportunity to correct an unfair situation as does this case before us. The time has come to discard the traditionally harsh view we previously followed and to join the majority of states that have adopted the loss-of-chance theory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Courts adopting the loss of chance doctrine also have noted that, because a defendant\u2019s negligence effectively made it impossible to know whether the person would have achieved a more favorable outcome had he received the appropriate standard of care, it is particularly unjust to deny the person recovery for being unable \u201cto demonstrate to an absolute certainty what would have happened in circumstances that the wrongdoer did not allow to come to pass.\u201d <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 F.2d 626, 632 (4th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Despite general agreement on the utility of the loss of chance doctrine, however, courts adopting it have not approached loss of chance in a uniform way.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See Annot., Medical Malpractice: \u201cLoss of Chance\u201d Causality, 54 A.L.R.4th 10 (1987 &amp; Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>2008) (encyclopedic discussion of cases adopting distinct approaches). The unsettled boundaries of the doctrine have left it open to criticisms similar to those that the defendants have leveled here: that the loss of chance doctrine upends the longstanding preponderance of the evidence standard; alters the burden of proof in favor of the plaintiff; undermines the uniformity and predictability central to tort litigation; results in an expansion of liability; and is too complex to administer. See generally T.A. Weigand, Loss of Chance in Medical Malpractice: The Need for Caution, 87 Mass. L. Rev. 3 (2002); D.A. Fischer, Tort Recovery for Loss of a Chance, 36 Wake Forest L. Rev. 605 (2001). See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>833 A.2d 843, 847-849 (Vt. 2003); <em>Fennell </em>v. <em>Southern Maryland Hosp. Ctr., Inc., </em>320 Md. 776, 789-784 (1990). While these objections deserve serious consideration, the doctrine of loss of chance, when properly formulated, survives these criticisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Addressing the specific arguments advanced by the defendants is useful for delineating the proper shape of the doctrine. The defendants argue that the loss of chance doctrine \u201clowers the threshold of proof of causation\u201d by diluting the preponderance of the evidence standard that \u201chas been the bedrock of the Massachusetts civil justice system.\u201d Some courts have indeed approached the issue of how to recognize loss of chance by carving out an exception to the rule that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant \u201ccaused\u201d his injuries. See, e.g., <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Sun City Community Hosp., Inc., </em>141 Ariz. 597, 607-608 (1984) (adopting rule that \u201cpermits the case to go to the jury on the issue of causation with less definite evidence of probability than the ordinary tort case,\u201d and requiring jury to \u201cfind for the defendant unless they find a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>probability </em>that defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury\u201d [emphasis in original]). We reject this approach. \u201cIt is fundamental that the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing causation by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>411 Mass. 82, 91 (1991). Therefore, in a case involving loss of chance, as in any other negligence context, a plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">However, \u201cinjury\u201d need not mean a patient\u2019s death. Although there are few certainties in medicine or in life, progress in medical science now makes it possible, at least with regard to certain medical conditions, to estimate a patient\u2019s probability of survival to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. See <em>Herskovits </em>v. <em>Group Health Coop. of Puget Sound, 99 </em>Wash. 2d 609, 616 (1983); King I, <em>supra </em>at 1386-1387. See also <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 494-495 (1983). That probability of survival is part of the patient\u2019s condition. When a physician\u2019s negligence diminishes or destroys a patient\u2019s chance of survival, the patient has suffered real injury. The patient has lost something of great value: a chance to survive, to be cured, or otherwise to achieve a more favorable medical outcome. See <em>Herskovits </em>v. <em>Group Health Coop. of Puget Sound, supra </em>at 618, quoting <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F. Supp. 581, 587 (N.D. Cal. 1980) (\u201cno one can say that the chance of prolonging one\u2019s life or decreasing suffering is valueless\u201d). Thus we recognize loss of chance not as a theory of causation, but as a theory of injury. See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Scheid, </em>726 N.E.2d 272, 279 (Ind. 2000) (\u201closs of chance is better understood as a description of the injury than as either a term for a separate cause of action or a surrogate for the causation element of a negligence claim\u201d); <em>Jorgenson </em>v. <em>Vener, </em>616 N.W.2d 366, 371 (S.D. 2000) (\u201cThe key to a successful application of this doctrine is recognizing and valuing the lost chance as the compensable injury . . .\u201d)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Recognizing loss of chance as a theory of injury is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>with our law of causation, which requires that plaintiffs establish causation by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Summers, supra </em>at 91. See also <em>Woronka </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>320 Mass. 362, 365 (1946). In order to prove loss of chance, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the physician\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s likelihood of achieving a more favorable outcome to be diminished. That is, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the physician\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury, where the injury consists of the diminished likelihood of achieving a more favorable medical outcome. See <em>Jorgenson </em>v. <em>Vener, supra </em>(\u201cProperly applied, the loss of chance doctrine does not alter or eliminate the requirement of proximate causation. Rather, a plaintiff must still prove by a preponderance of evidence, or more likely than not, that the defendant\u2019s actions reduced her chance of a better outcome\u201d); King, Jr., \u201cReduction of Likelihood\u201d Reformulation and Other Retrofitting of the Loss-of-a-Chance Doctrine, 28 U. Memphis L. Rev. 491, 492 (1998) (King II). The loss of chance doctrine, so delineated, makes no amendment or exception to the burdens of proof applicable in all negligence claims.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We reject the defendants\u2019 contention that a statistical likelihood of survival is a \u201cmere possibility\u201d and therefore \u201cspeculative.\u201d The magnitude of a probability is distinct from the degree of confidence with which it can be estimated. A statistical survival rate cannot conclusively determine whether a particular patient will survive a medical condition. But survival rates are not random guesses. They are estimates based on data obtained and analyzed scientifically and accepted by the relevant medical community as part of the repertoire of diagnosis and treatment, as applied to the specific facts of the plaintiff\u2019s case. See <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, supra </em>at 494 n.4 (recognizing established use of clinical staging systems for cancer in medical prognoses). Where credible evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>establishes that the plaintiff\u2019s or decedent\u2019s probability of survival is 49%, that conclusion is no more speculative than a conclusion, based on similarly credible evidence, that the probability of survival is 51%.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The defendants also point out that \u201c[t]he cause, treatment, cure and survivability related to cancer is tremendously uncertain and complex,\u201d and argue that loss of chance is \u201crife with practical complexities and problems.\u201d Such difficulties are not confined to loss of chance claims. A wide range of medical malpractice cases, as well as numerous other tort actions, are complex and involve actuarial or other probabilistic estimates. Wrongful death claims, for example, often require, as part of the damages calculation, an estimate of how long the decedent might have lived absent the defendant\u2019s conduct. The calculation of damages in a claim for lost business opportunities may be similarly complex. See, e.g., <em>Roblin Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. (No. 2), </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 79 (1980).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The key is the reliability of the evidence available to the fact finder. In earlier periods, Massachusetts courts grappling with what we would now call loss of chance claims often lacked reliable expert evidence of what the patient\u2019s chances of survival or recovery would have been absent the alleged negligence. See, e.g., <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>287 Mass. 175, 176 (1934) (affirming directed verdict for defendant despite evidence of negligent failure to diagnose scarlet fever and negligence in moving decedent from maternity ward because \u201cthere is nothing to show any probability that [the patient] would have recovered or lived longer or suffered less, if due care had been used\u201d). More recently, as we noted above, at least for certain conditions, medical science has progressed to the point that physicians can gouge a patient\u2019s chances of survival to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, and indeed routinely use such statistics as a tool of medicine. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>Reliable modern techniques of gathering and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>analyzing medical data have made it possible for fact finders to determine based on expert testimony \u2014 rather than speculate based on insufficient evidence \u2014 whether a negligent failure to diagnose a disease injured a patient by preventing the disease from being treated at an earlier stage, when prospects were more favorable. See <em>Cusher </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 498 (1986) (upholding verdict against physician for negligent failure to diagnose ovarian cancer, on theory that \u201cif such tests had been ordered . . . the cancer would have been discovered and removed, preventing its spread throughout the plaintiff\u2019s body\u201d); <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, supra </em>at 494-495 (reversing judgment not withstanding verdict for defendant where there was expert evidence that negligent failure to diagnose patient\u2019s breast cancer caused cancer to progress from \u201cStage I,\u201d in which her chances of surviving ten years with proper treatment would have been 94%, to \u201cstage II,\u201d in which her chances of surviving ten years with proper treatment were \u201c50% or less\u201d). The availability of such expert evidence on probabilities of survival makes it appropriate to recognize loss of chance as a form of injury.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clement, supra. </em>See also <em>Aasheim </em>v. <em>Humberger, </em>215 Mont. 127, 133 (1985) (noting that loss of chance \u201crecognizes the realities inherent in medical negligence litigation\u201d). Through appropriate expert evidence, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case may be able to sustain her burden of showing that, as a result of defendant\u2019s negligence, a decedent suffered a diminished likelihood of achieving a more favorable medical outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We are unmoved by the defendants\u2019 argument that \u201cthe ramifications of adoption of loss of chance are immense\u201d across \u201call areas of tort.\u201d We emphasize that our decision today is limited to loss of chance in medical malpractice actions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Such cases are particularly well suited to application of the loss of chance doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>trine. See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm \u00a7 26 comment n (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005) (Draft Restatement). First, as we noted above, reliable expert evidence establishing loss of chance is more likely to be available in a medical malpractice case than in some other domains of tort law. <em>Id. </em>Second, medical negligence that harms the patient\u2019s chances of a more favorable outcome contravenes the expectation at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship that \u201cthe physician will take every reasonable measure to obtain an optimal outcome for the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See K.S. Abraham, Forms and Functions of Tort Law 117-118 (3d ed. 2007) (discussing argument that \u201chealth care providers undertake to maximize a patient\u2019s chances of survival, [and so] their failure to do so should be actionable. Ordinary actors who negligently risk causing harm have not undertaken such a duty\u201d). Third, it is not uncommon for patients to have a less than even chance of survival or of achieving a better outcome when they present themselves for diagnosis, so the shortcomings of the all or nothing rule are particularly widespread. Finally, failure to recognize loss of chance in medical malpractice actions forces the party who is the least capable of preventing the harm to bear the consequences of the more capable party\u2019s negligence. See Draft Restatement, <em>supra </em>at 326 comment n.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In sum, whatever difficulties may attend recognizing loss of chance as an item of damages in a medical malpractice action, these difficulties are far outweighed by the strong reasons to adopt the doctrine. We turn now to the defendants\u2019 argument that the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, does not allow for loss of chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">3. <em>Wrongful death statute. </em>The wrongful death statute imposes liability on anyone who \u201cby his negligence causes the death of a person.\u201d G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. The defendants contend that the language of the statute \u2014 \u201ccauses the death\u201d \u2014 precludes loss of chance claims and allows only claims that the defendant was a but-for cause of the decedent\u2019s death. This interpretation is not required by the wrongful death statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The purpose of the wrongful death statute is \u201cto compensate a decedent\u2019s survivors for the loss of the decedent\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Thi-bert </em>v. <em>Milka, </em>419 Mass. 693, 695 (1995). The origin of wrongful death actions in Massachusetts can be traced to England, where such actions are said to have sprung from \u201cthe ancient custom of compensating for wrongfully inflicted death.\u201d S.M. Speiser &amp; J.E. Rooks, Jr., Recovery for Wrongful Death \u00a7 1.1 (4th ed. 2005 &amp; Supp. 2007). \u201cIn the very early days of the Anglo-Saxons, homicide in all forms was regarded as a civil offense, a private wrong. In order to prevent feuds among clannish groups and to encourage peace, what we now call \u2018damages\u2019 for the killing of a person were payable to the deceased\u2019s relatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1.3. When the earliest colonists arrived in what is now Massachusetts, they brought with them and embraced as their own common law the wrongful death cause of action. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1.4, and cases cited (\u201cthe Massachusetts courts during the colonial period had consistently allowed compensation in death cases\u201d).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In the early Nineteenth Century, however, the common-law development of wrongful death actions was sidetracked by a single English decision, later repudiated by this court. In 1808, in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>1 Campb. 493 (1808), a case involving a husband\u2019s suit against owners of a stagecoach that had overturned, killing his wife, Lord Ellenborough, an English judge, stated that \u201cin a civil court, the death of a human being could not be complained of as an injury.\u201d See S.M. Speiser &amp; J.E. Rooks, Jr., Recovery for Wrongful Death, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 1.2; <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60, 68 (1972). For various reasons that do not concern us here, Lord Ellenborough\u2019s dictum quickly came to stand for the proposition, in both English and American courts, including this court, that no cause of action for wrongful death existed apart from statute. See, e.g., <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Berkshire R.R., </em>1 Cush. 475, 478 (1848), citing <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bolton, supra </em>(holding that \u201cthe death of a human being is not the ground of an action for damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Even as it was being cited as authority, however, Lord Ellen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>borough\u2019s role came under harsh criticism from courts and scholars as both unfounded and barbaric. See <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra </em>at 69-71. In <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375 (1970), the United States Supreme Court rejected Lord Ellenborough\u2019s dictum and held that a common-law action for wrongful death could be brought under United States maritime law. After a thorough and detailed historical discussion, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe history of the common-law role indicates that [Lord Ellenborough\u2019s role] was based on a particular set of factors that [have] long since been thrown into discard even in England, and that had never existed in this country at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Reasoning that where a duty exists at common law, \u201cnothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court therefore rejected Lord Ellenborough\u2019s role and held as a matter of common law that one may bring a wrongful death action under general maritime law. Although the Federal Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 761, 762 (as then codified), did not expressly provide any remedy for the wrongful death at issue in the case,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the Court held that act was never meant to preempt the \u201cevolving duty of seaworthiness\u201d from which the courts would recognize a common-law action for wrongful death. See <em>id. </em>at 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>this court, relying in part on the <em>Moragne </em>case, put Lord Ellenborough\u2019s mischief to rest in the Commonwealth. Rejecting the authority of Lord Ellenborough\u2019s dictum, we held that \u201cthe law in this Commonwealth has . . . evolved to the point where it may now be held that the right to recovery for wrongful death is of common law origin, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>so hold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71. In holding that wrongful death claims existed at common law, this court concluded that claims under the wrongful death statute are common-law claims that continue to evolve, even as the wrongful death statutes impose certain procedural requirements on such claims. See <em>id. </em>at 71-72.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201c [0]ur wrongful death statutes will no longer be regarded as \u2018creating the right\u2019 to recovery for wrongful death. They will be viewed rather as: (a) requiring that damages recoverable for wrongful death be based upon the degree of the defendant\u2019s culpability; (b) prescribing the range of damages recoverable against each defendant; (c) requiring that any action for wrongful death be brought by a personal representative on behalf of the designated categories of beneficiaries; and (d) requiring that the action be commenced within a specified period of time, as a limitation upon the remedy and not upon the right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 71. Thus, in <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>we allowed a wrongful death claim to be brought under the wrongful death statute where the terms of the statute did not provide the plaintiff with any right to recover. <em>Id. </em>at 71-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Like all common-law causes of action, our common law of wrongful death evolves to meet changes in the evolving life of the Commonwealth. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>414 Mass. 129, 134 (1993) (\u201cSound principles of common law evolve out of the interaction of the infinite variety of new patterns of human activity with principles crafted in response to already-experienced situations\u201d); <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra. </em>Although wrongful death did not traditionally encompass loss of chance of survival, we conclude that claims for loss of chance of survival are sufficiently akin to wrongful death claims as to be cognizable under the wrongful death statute, which governs the procedural requisites for such claims. See <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra </em>at 71.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Now that medical science has developed credible methods of quantifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the extent to which the malpractice damaged the patient\u2019s prospects for survival, and in light of the strong public policy favoring compensation for victims of medical malpractice and the deterrence of deviations from appropriate standards of care, loss of chance of survival rightly assumes a place in our common law of wrongful death, and we so hold.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The development of our law of wrongful death to encompass loss of chance of survival claims is entirely consistent with this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60, 71 (1972),<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>that the wrongful death statute will be viewed in part as \u201crequiring that damages recoverable for wrongful death be based upon the degree of the defendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d Our method of calculating loss of chance damages furthers and refines this requirement. Moreover, it remedies the illogical and harsh results of a rule that would permit a person who had a prenegligence chance of survival of 51% to recover full' damages while denying all recovery to the person whose prenegligence chance of survival was 49%.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We turn now to the proper measure of damages in a loss of chance medical malpractice case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">4. <em>Damages. </em>Our conclusion that loss of chance is a separate, compensable item of damages in an action for medical malpractice does not fully resolve the issues on appeal. We must consider, among other things, how the loss of the likelihood of a more favorable outcome is to be valued. The first question is <em>what </em>is being valued. In this case, the patient\u2019s prospects for achieving a more favorable outcome were measured in terms of the patient\u2019s likelihood of surviving for a number of years specified by the relevant medical standard: for gastric cancer, the five-year survival rate.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> There is no single measure that will apply uniformly to all medical malpractice cases. See, e.g., <em>Renzi </em>v. <em>Paredes, post </em>38, 42 (2008) (employing ten-year survival metric for breast cancer); <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Scheid, </em>726 N.E.2d 272, 279 (Ind. 2000) (measuring loss of chance damages in terms of \u201cdecreased life expectancy,\u201d measured in years); <em>DeBurkarte </em>v. <em>Louvar, </em>393 N.W.2d 131, 135 (Iowa 1986) (employing ten-year survival metric for breast cancer). Precisely what yardstick to use to measure the reduction in the decedent\u2019s prospects for survival \u2014 life expectancy, five-year survival, ten-year survival, and so on \u2014 is a question on which the law must inevitably bow to some extent to the shape of the available medical evidence in each particular case. See <em>McMackin </em>v. <em>Johnson County Healthcare Ctr., </em>73 P.3d 1094, 1100 (Wyo. 2003) (noting that \u201cno clear-cut rule\u201d can govern all measures of damages in loss of chance cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>A second, more challenging issue is how to calculate the monetary value for the lost chance. Courts adopting the loss of chance doctrine have arrived at different methods for calculating such damages. See generally <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Adrian, </em>670 N.W.2d 174, 187-189 (Iowa 2003) (Cody, J., concurring specially). The most widely adopted of these methods of valuation is the \u201cproportional damages\u201d approach. See <em>Cahoon </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>734 N.E.2d 535, 541 (Ind. 2000), and cases cited (holding that proportional damages is \u201cthe better approach\u201d). See also <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>255 Kan. 199, 217 (1994) (proportional damages approach constitutes proper view); <em>McKellips </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hosp., Inc., </em>741 P.2d 467, 475-477 (Okla. 1987) (same). Under the proportional damages approach, loss of chance damages are measured as \u201cthe percentage probability by which the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct diminished the likelihood of achieving some more favorable outcome.\u201d King I, <em>supra </em>at 1382. The formula aims to ensure that a defendant is liable in damages only for the monetary value of the <em>portion </em>of the decedent\u2019s prospects that the defendant\u2019s negligence destroyed. In applying the proportional damages method, the court must first measure the monetary value of the patient\u2019s full life expectancy and, if relevant, work life expectancy as it would in any wrongful death case. But the defendant must then be held liable only for the portion of that value that the defendant\u2019s negligence destroyed. See King II, <em>supra </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Deriving the damages for which the physician is liable will require the fact finder to undertake the following calculations:<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(1) The fact finder must first calculate the total amount of damages allowable for the death under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, or, in the case of medical malpractice not resulting in death, the full amount of damages allowable for the injury. This is the amount to which the decedent would be entitled if the case were <em>not </em>a loss of chance case: the full amount of compensation for the decedent\u2019s death or injury.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">(2) The fact finder must next calculate the patient\u2019s chance of survival or cure immediately preceding (\u201cbut for\u201d) the medical malpractice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">(3) The fact finder must then calculate the chance of survival or cure that the patient had as a result of the medical malpractice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">(4) The fact finder must then subtract the amount derived in step 3 from the amount derived in step 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">(5) The fact finder must then multiply the amount determined in step 1 by the percentage calculated in step 4 to derive the proportional damages award for loss of chance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">To illustrate, suppose in a wrongful death case that a jury found, based on expert testimony and the facts of the case, that full wrongful death damages would be $600,000 (step 1), that the patient had a 45% chance of survival prior to the medical malpractice (step 2), and that the physician\u2019s tortious acts reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the chances of survival to 15% (step 3). The patient\u2019s chances of survival were reduced 30% (i.e., 45% minus 15%) due to the physician\u2019s malpractice (step 4), and the patient\u2019s loss of chance damages would be $600,000 multiplied by 30% for a total of $180,000 (step 5). See, e.g., <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Adrian, supra </em>at 186-187 (Cody, J., concurring specially); <em>McKellips </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hosp., Inc., </em>741 P.2d 467, 476 (Okla. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We are not unmindful of the criticism of the proportional damages approach.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> However, we are in accord with those courts that have determined that the proportional damages method is the most appropriate way to quantify the value of the loss of chance for a more favorable outcome, because it is an easily applied calculation that fairly ensures that a defendant is not assessed damages for harm that he did not cause.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Pipe </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>274 Kan. 905, 910 (2002) (\u201cThe proportional damage approach ensures that a plaintiff recovers only the loss attributable to the loss of chance and not for an arbitrary amount awarded by the jury or for the total damages sustained\u201d); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ohio Permanente Med. Group, Inc., </em>76 Ohio St. 3d 483, 489 (1996) (proportional damages approach \u201cprovides an equitable method of apportioning damages consistent with the degree of fault attributable to the health care provider. Thus, rather than compensating the plaintiff for all damages allowed in a malpractice or wrongful death action, the defendant is liable only for those damages attributable to his percentage of negligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">From our analysis thus far, it should be evident that the value of \u201cthe loss of opportunity to allow events to play out in order to see if the plaintiff\u2019s condition was in fact amenable to restoration,\u201d King II, <em>supra </em>at 533, is a matter beyond the average juror\u2019s ken; the evidence will necessarily come from experts. Expert testimony is required to ascertain what measure of a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>favorable outcome is medically appropriate (for example, five-year survival as in this case), to determine what statistical rates of survival apply in what circumstances, for example, a 37.5% chance of survival, and to apply these rates to the particular clinical circumstances of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The defendants protest that such reliance on experts is likely to result in \u201cimprecise\u201d and \u201cskewed\u201d evidence on which to base a damages award. Our response is both general and specific. First, as a general matter, we disavow the defendants\u2019 claim that reliance on statistical evidence is \u201cgenerally disfavored in the law.\u201d As we have noted, probabilistic evidence, in the form of actuarial tables, assumptions about present value and future interest rates, statistical measures of future harm, and the like, is the stock-in-trade of tort valuation. See <em>DePass </em>v. <em>United States, 721 </em>F.2d 203, 209-210 (7th Cir. 1983) (Posner, J\u201e dissenting). For decades, judges, lawyers, jurors, and litigants have shown themselves competent to sift through such evidence in a variety of contexts, from mass toxic torts to single-car collisions. Second, in this particular case, all of the medical witnesses testified that the staging of cancer and the use of survival or recovery statistics derived therefrom are common practice with respect to gastric cancer. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>To the extent that expert testimony concerning the statistical likelihood of a more favorable outcome of Matsuyama\u2019s condition, or of any medical condition, may manifest a statistical bias or any other indicia of unreliability, that is a matter to be vetted in a pretrial motion to exclude the expert testimony, or at trial on cross-examination, or through the testimony of a defendant\u2019s own expert. See <em>Cusher </em>v. <em>Turner, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 491, 498 &amp; n.9 (1986), citing <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 494 n.4 (1983) (in medical malpractice case, \u201c[pjrecise evidence as to the \u2018staging\u2019 of the cancer is not required . . .\u201d). See generally King II, <em>supra </em>at 546-547 (successful application of loss of chance doctrine depends on the quality of the appraisal of the decreased likelihood of a more favorable outcome caused by defendants\u2019 tortious conduct). Our decision today should not be construed to limit a defendant\u2019s right or ability vigorously to challenge the statistical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We move now to a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">5. <em>Evidence of causation. </em>As a preliminary matter, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>there is no merit to the defendants\u2019 argument that the evidence does not support a verdict against Bimbaum for loss of chance. As we stated above, the crux of liability for loss of chance is that Birnbaum\u2019s negligence caused a diminution in Matsuyama\u2019s likelihood of achieving a more favorable outcome for his medical condition. From the record summarized above, there was ample evidence from which the jury reasonably could conclude that Bimbaum committed a breach of the standard of care by failing to take the necessary steps earlier in his treatment of Matsuyama to determine through appropriate medical testing whether Matsuyama had gastric cancer. The jury were also well within their charge to conclude from the evidence that, but for Birnbaum\u2019s breach of care, Matsuyama\u2019s chances of survival would have been greater.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> That the jury may have derived their conclusions by crediting the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert over the testimony of the defense expert was in the normal course of their acting as a jury.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The defendants claim that the evidence was insufficient to show that, as the judge instructed the jury, \u201can act or omission of Bimbaum was a substantially contributing factor to the death of Mr. Matsuyama.\u201d The \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d test is useful in cases in which damage has multiple causes, including but not limited to cases with multiple tortfeasors in which it may be impossible to say for certain that any <em>individual </em>defendant\u2019s conduct was a but-for cause of the harm, even though it can be shown that the defendants, in the aggregate, caused the harm.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The substantial contributing factor test is less appropriate, however, as an instruction as to cause in a loss of chance case in which one defendant\u2019s malpractice alone is alleged to have caused the victim\u2019s diminished likelihood of a more favorable outcome.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The proper test in a loss of chance case concerning the conduct of a single defendant is whether that conduct was the but-for cause of the loss of chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In the circumstances of this case, the judge\u2019s use of the \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d test did not prejudice the defendant. Requiring the plaintiff to prove that the negligence was a substantial contributing factor in Matsuyama\u2019s death \u2014 rather than merely requiring the plaintiff to prove that the negligence reduced Mat-suyama\u2019s chance of survival \u2014 arguably imposed a heightened burden of proof on the plaintiff. Indeed, it was Medical Associates, not the plaintiff, who proposed jury instructions incorporating the test that the \u201cnegligence was a substantial contributing cause of the alleged injury.\u201d The judge also clarified the \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d instruction in a way that, while somewhat inartful, suggested that the jury should understand \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d as indicating that the plaintiff was required to show that Bimbaum\u2019s negligence caused a loss of chance of survival. The judge instructed the jury that the word \u201csubstantial\u201d \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Matsuyama\u2019s chance of survival was fifty percent or greater, only that there was a fair chance of survival or cure had Dr. Bimbaum not been negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and had he conformed to the applicable standard of care.\u201d The judge\u2019s formulation did not use the words \u201cbut-for cause,\u201d but his definition of \u201csubstantial\u201d clearly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the idea that Bimbaum\u2019s negligence, if any, had to be a but-for cause of Matsuyama\u2019s losing a \u201cfair chance of survival.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We turn now to the defendants\u2019 claims of error in the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">6. <em>Jury instructions, </em>a. <em>Valuation. </em>The defendants challenge the jury instructions on valuation. Even were we to accept the loss of chance doctrine, the defendants say, and even if the evidence supports a finding against Bimbaum on that issue, the verdict against him must be reversed and the case retried because the judge gave improper instructions on valuation. While two instructions in particular were less than ideal, reversal is not required.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">We do not agree that the judge\u2019s instructions and special jury verdict \u201cforced the jury to find a loss of chance and precluded the defense from arguing that there was no loss of a substantial chance of survival based on the evidence.\u201d The defendants\u2019 focus here is on question 6 of the special jury questions, in particular the \u201cNote\u201d included in that question, and the judge\u2019s related instructions. That special jury question included survival rates for each stage of gastric cancer.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants that the determination of chance of survival was for the jury to decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>based on the conflicting evidence before them, and should not have been included in the special question.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> It will generally not be necessary for the judge to marshal such evidence for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">However, viewing the instructions as a whole, we conclude that the jury charge did not overstep the judge\u2019s broad discretion to fashion jury instructions. See <em>Cahalane </em>v. <em>Proust, </em>333 Mass. 689, 692 (1956); <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Pac. Elec. Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 684 (1985). \u201cOur decisions have consistently upheld the action of trial judges in putting before the jury possible conclusions warranted by the evidence in language that is \u2018comprehensively strong, rather than hesitatingly barren, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ineffective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cahalane </em>v. <em>Proust, supra </em>at 692-693, quoting <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Wellesley &amp; Boston St. Ry., </em>197 Mass. 495, 502 (1908). Nothing in the judge\u2019s instructions or the special questions themselves would indicate to a reasonable juror that the judge was weighing in on the ultimate question of liability or \u201cforcing\u201d the jury to find a certain damages amount, as the defendants maintain. Throughout his jury charge, the judge took pains to emphasize that the jury\u2019s view of the evidence is the only view that mattered. Finally, the defendants argued throughout the trial, and forcefully in closing argument, that Matsuyama was in fact not harmed by Bimbaum\u2019s actions; there was no indication that any mling or statement of the judge precluded the defendants from mounting a vigorous defense. The judge\u2019s instructions and jury verdict did not impermissibly weigh in on the question of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Further, for the reasons we have stated above, the judge did not commit reversible error in instructing on the viability of loss of chance as an item of damages, and he correctly chose to apply the proportional method to determine damages for Matsuyama\u2019s loss of chance. In conformity with the formula we have set out <em>supra, </em>he also required on the special jury questions that the jury determine full wrongful death damages and the percentage of Matsuyama\u2019s chances of survival but for Bimbaum\u2019s negligence. We recognize that the judge did not complete the proportional instruction we outlined above. As the defendants point out, the judge did not require the jury to determine Matsuyama\u2019s chance of survival as a result of Bimbaum\u2019s negligence, and to subtract that figure from Matsuyama\u2019s chance of survival prior to the negligence. In terms of the formula discussed <em>supra, </em>the judge correctly instructed the jury as to step 1 and step 2, but omitted steps 3 and 4. This compelled the jury to assume that Bimbaum\u2019s negligence (if any) reduced Matsuyama\u2019s chances of survival to zero: $875,000 multiplied by (.375 minus 0) equals $328,125, the damages awarded for loss of chance. In fact, the conflicting testimony at trial was that as a result of Bimbaum\u2019s negligence, Matsuyama had anywhere from 0 to a 5% chance of survival.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The judge should not have removed from the jury\u2019s consideration the question whether and to what extent Bimbaum\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>negligence left Matsuyama with any chance of survival, both critical factors in valuing Matsuyama\u2019s lost chance. See <em>Caha-lane </em>v. <em>Proust, supra. </em>See also G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 81.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">However, a remand will not be necessary. The record before us shows that both prior to and after the jury instructions, the defendants objected to question 6, not on the ground of the judge\u2019s apportionment formula but on more general, and wholly different, grounds.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This lack of a specific objection on point is fatal to their detailed objection on appeal. See <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>416 Mass. 62, 66 (1993) (\u201cA general objection to a portion of a charge will not save appellate rights\u201d). The defendants did argue in a supplemental trial brief that if this court were to recognize loss of chance, they should be entitled to an apportionment formula that takes account of the \u201cdifference\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>likelihood of survival, see note 57, <em>supra. </em>However, the defendants\u2019 proposed jury instructions contained no provision for calculating this difference. When the judge charged the jury in a way that lacked such a provision, none of the defendants\u2019 numerous objections either before or after the jury charge specifically touched on this issue. See note 56, <em>supra. </em>Nor have the defendants directed our attention to anything that would suggest that their general objections should be understood in context to refer specifically to this issue. Accordingly, we deem it waived. See <em>Neagle </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 348-349 (1998) (where counsel did not request special jury question on particular issue, and did not object to its omission from special jury questions, \u201cthis failure resulted in a waiver of the [party\u2019s] rights to have the issue . . . submitted to the jury and to raise the issue on appeal\u201d).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">b. <em>Gross negligence. </em>At the close of evidence, but prior to closing arguments, the judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s oral motion to amend her complaint to add a claim against Bimbaum for gross negligence. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>The judge subsequently proceeded to charge the jury on gross negligence.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In response to a special question, the jury found Bimbaum not grossly negligent in his care and treatment of Matsuyama. Nevertheless, Bimbaum asserts on appeal that the judge, by impermissibly commenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>on the evidence of gross negligence in his charge to the jury, left jurors with the impression that, at the very least, Bimbaum should be found liable in negligence.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 81 (\u201cThe courts shall not charge juries with respect to matters of fact, but they may state the testimony and the law\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Where, as here, the judge had determined that the evidence warranted an instruction on gross negligence, the judge correctly gave such an instmction, which had been requested by the plaintiff. In light of the evidence from expert and other medical witnesses that Birnbaum missed or ignored Matsuya-ma\u2019s known risk factors for gastric cancer for a period of almost four years, as well as Bimbaum\u2019s own testimony that the capitation contract he voluntarily entered into caused him \u201cdifficulty\u201d in providing patients like Matsuyama with \u201cthe best medical care,\u201d it was not error for the judge to include instructions on gross negligence.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> See <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 591-592 (1919) (\u201cThe element of culpability which characterizes all negligence is in gross negligence magnified to a high degree as compared with that present in ordinary negligence.

The jury heard conflicting testimony about whether Bimbaum\u2019s notes revealed the presence of one such lesion, as Bimbaum testified at trial, or more than one. The jury also heard testimony from Matsuya-ma\u2019s oncologist and the plaintiff\u2019s medical expert that the appearance of many seborrheic keratoses signals advanced stomach cancer. At the time of the examination, Birnbaum was unaware that seborrheic keratoses may signal gastric cancer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\"> Throughout the trial the jury heard evidence that gastritis and nonulcerative dyspepsia may be linked to gastric cancer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b29-6\"> The plaintiff alleged a separate count of \u201cnegligence-wrongful death\u201d against Birnbaum and \u201cnegligence\u201d against Dedham Medical Associates, Inc.

Birnbaum also testified regarding the capitation contracts between Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Matsuyama\u2019s medical insurance provider, and Medical Associates, which Bimbaum reviewed and approved as president of Medical Associates\u2019s board of directors. Among other things, the capitation contracts rewarded Medical Associates (and its physician shareholders, including Bimbaum) for keeping the costs of prescription dmgs and medical tests such as biopsies below a certain annual figure. Bimbaum testified that the capitation contracts governed his reimbursements for Matsuyama, and that they effectively meant that doctors in his practice \u201cha[d] difficulty\u201d providing capitated patients with \u201cthe best medical care for the patients.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\"> The plaintiff also called two of the physicians who treated Matsuyama for gastric cancer. Dr. Benjamin Smith, who performed the endoscopic evaluation on Matsuyama in May, 1999, testified that the existence of cancer cannot be determined by physical examination alone, and that endoscopy with biopsies was the acknowledged \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosing gastric cancer. Dr. Charles Fuchs, Matsuyama\u2019s oncologist, testified, among other things, that Matsuyama had several known risk factors for gastric cancer, that endoscopy with a biopsy was the best way to determine the presence of such cancer, and that early stage detection of gastric cancer portends a better chance of survival.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> These standards are well known. The National Cancer Institute\u2019s Dictionary of Cancer Terms defines \u201csurvival rate\u201d as: \u201cThe percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or treated for a disease, such as cancer. The survival rate is often stated as a five-year survival rate, which is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive five years after diagnosis or treatment. Also called overall survival rate.\u201d Survival is a term whose particular definition will depend on the medical evidence in a given case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> Fuchs, the oncologist who treated Matsuyama and was called as a witness by the plaintiff, also testified that \u201cthe metric in cancer is at five years, what fraction, what percentage are alive .... [I]f they\u2019re alive in five years, we typically say that they\u2019re cured or that the cancer is unlikely to come back.\u201d Finkel, the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, similarly referred to \u201csurvival rate\u201d and \u201cfive-year survival\u201d interchangeably. Dr. Mark Peppercorn, the defense expert witness, testified that the five-year survival rate is \u201cthe parameter most people use; it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re cured, but that\u2019s the parameter people use, five year survival.\u201d None of the experts or physicians who testified at trial offered an alternative metric for gouging the success of treating gastric cancer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\"> Both Birnbaum and his expert witness, Peppercorn, also testified that gastric cancer has \u201cstages,\u201d with a high probability for survival at stage 1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>5% probability or less at stage 4. Bimbaum agreed with the plaintiffs counsel that the five-year survival rate at stage 1 is 90% to 95%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\"> Hewins\u2019s figure for net loss of earnings assumed that Matsuyama would have used 30% of his gross earnings for personal consumption; his net loss of earnings figure did not consider taxes on Matsuyama\u2019s earnings. The evidence at trial showed that Matsuyama would not have been able to work to full capacity while he was being treated for cancer. Hewins testified that the work life statistics he employed to calculate income lost as a result of Matsuyama\u2019s death accounted for such contingencies as illness, disability, or retirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b31-10\"> At the close of the plaintiffs evidence, her counsel moved to add a count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>for gross negligence, which the judge allowed as to Bimbaum over his counsel\u2019s objection. On Bimbaum\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the judge dismissed only the claims for breach of contract and lack of informed consent.

However, the principle is enumerated in countless cases. See generally <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Chin, </em>405 Mass. 697, 714 (1989), and cases cited (in medical malpractice case, restating causal relationship rule, affirming damages award based on expert testimony of actuarial life expectancy).

We are in accord with the position taken by the Draft Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 26, Reporters\u2019 Note to comment n, that this reliance is misplaced. Section 323 of the Restatement (Second) imposes a duty of reasonable care on the part of those who \u201cundertake!], gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another,\u201d and imposes liability on such persons for \u201charm resulting\u201d when \u201cfailure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u00a7 323 is silent on the question whether loss of chance itself is a form of harm. The placement of \u00a7 323 in Topic 7, \u201cDuties of Affirmative Action,\u201d rather than in a topic concerning harm or causation, illustrates that \u00a7 323 is not an appropriate source for the doctrine of loss of chance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> The Draft Restatement points out that \u201crecognizing lost opportunity as harm is preferable to employing a diluted substantial-factor or other factual-causation test, thereby leaving recovery to the unconstrained inclination of any given jury and providing some fortunate plaintiffs with a full measure of damages for their physical harm while denying any recovery to others.\u201d Draft Restatement, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 26 comment n.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> The defendants claim that \u201cany percent loss of chance below 50% . . . would fundamentally shift the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant\u201d because \u201cthe only avenue of defense for the physician to escape liability is to establish with certainty that the negligence caused no harm.\u201d As we have implemented it, the loss of chance doctrine works no such shift in the burden of proof. The burden remains on the plaintiff to show that the physician\u2019s negligence more likely than not caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Las Vegas Med.

Corp., </em>342 Or. 152 (2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">One State\u2019s high court has held that loss of chance claims are cognizable under that State\u2019s survival statute, which explicitly provides for the survival of \u201ccauses of action for death,\u201d Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 537.020 (1986) (\u201cAction for personal injury or death to survive regardless of death of either party\u201d), but are not cognizable under the State\u2019s wrongful death statute on the grounds that statistical evidence does not \u201cprove that decedent\u2019s death resulted from the failure to properly diagnose and treat.\u201d <em>Wollen </em>v. <em>DePaul Health Ctr., </em>828 S.W.2d 681, 686 (Mo. 1992). The court\u2019s reasoning relies on the idea that the injury involved in a loss of chance of survival case is death, rather than the loss of chance itself. We do not so hold. In any event, in Massachusetts, a loss of chance claim brought under our survival statute, G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, rather than our wrongful death statute, would not appear to allow recovery for \u201cthe reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent.\u201d G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. See <em>Hallett </em>v. Wrentham, 398 Mass. 550, 556 (1986) (\u201cWe conclude that the wrongful death act, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, provides the exclusive action for the recovery of the damages it encompasses by the designated beneficiaries\u201d). Such a result would hardly be consistent with principles of fairness and deterrence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\"> Because all human beings eventually die, an ordinary wrongful death claim is in effect a claim that the defendant\u2019s conduct brought on the death of the decedent sooner than it would otherwise have occurred; this is particularly so in the area of wrongful death claims based on alleged medical malpractice, because the relevant relationship between the decedent and the defendant physician or other health professional was formed as a result of, or concerned, a disease or illness on the part of the decedent. The damages calculation in an ordinary wrongful death case thus often involves estimating the life expectancy that a decedent would have enjoyed, absent the wrongful conduct of the defendant that caused the decedent\u2019s untimely death. See, e.g., <em>Durdle </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>328 Mass. 460, 463 (1952); <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Meserve, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 659, 666 (1985). In a loss of chance wrongful death case, the logic is similar: a plaintiff must show that her prospects for survival were diminished from what they would otherwise have been, and the magnitude of that diminution will determine damages. See part 4. <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"> Nothing in our decision today disturbs the other requirements of the wrongful death statute enumerated in <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, supra </em>at 71, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>requirements regarding who may bring the action; when it must be commenced; and the range of damages that may be recovered from each defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> The jury found that Matsuyama had stage 2 gastric cancer when he first consulted Bimbaum, and that he had a 37.5% \u201cprobability of cure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\"> These calculations will determine the <em>loss of chance </em>damages. We pause to clarify the issue of damages for <em>pain and suffering, </em>of which there are potentially two kinds. First, a jury could find, on appropriate evidence, that a physician\u2019s negligence caused pain and suffering quite apart from the loss of chance. Compensatory damages for this type of pain and suffering should be awarded in the same manner as in any malpractice case; they are not part of the proportional damages calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Second, a jury could find, on appropriate evidence, that the ultimate injury \u2014 in this case, dying of gastric cancer \u2014 involved pain and suffering. This second category of pain and suffering would more likely than not have occurred even absent the physician\u2019s negligent conduct. Thus, the physician may only be held liable for this pain and suffering to the extent that his negligent conduct diminished the decedent\u2019s likelihood of avoiding this outcome. Thus, this second category of pain and suffering is properly subject to the proportional damages calculation set out here.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">In this case, the jury awarded $160,000 in compensatory damages for \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>pain and suffering of Kimiyoshi Matsuyama for which the negligence of Neil S. Bimbaum, M.D. was a substantially contributing factor.\u201d The judge instructed the jury that this figure was \u201cfor the conscious pain and suffering which was endured by Mr. Matsuyama during the period of his illness, if that period was caused by Dr. Bimbaum.\u201d While this instruction is not a model of clarity, we read it to refer to the first category of pain and suffering damages set out above: pain and suffering \u201ccaused by Dr. Bimbaum.\u201d There was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding, and it was proper for the judge to exclude this pain and suffering from the proportional damages calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Neither party requested jury instmctions about additional pain and suffering of the second type (the pain and suffering involved in dying of gastric cancer), which would, on appropriate evidence, have been part of the loss of chance proportional damage calculation set out here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b49-12\"> Our holding on damages is limited to loss of chance cases.

Nevertheless, the jury were entitled to believe Finkel\u2019s explanation that Matsuyama\u2019s cancer was at an early stage in July, 1995, when he first saw Birnbaum, and thus more susceptible to treatment at that time, over Peppercorn\u2019s explanation that Matsuyama\u2019s gastric cancer was of an unusual type that essentially is asymptomatic until stage 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\"> The defense, among other things, faults Finkel for not providing more certain testimony about when Matsuyama would have died absent Bimbaum\u2019s negligence. Because Bimbaum\u2019s own negligence was the reason that Matsuyama\u2019s fate (but for the negligence) is ultimately unknowable, this charge avails the defense nothing.

If I say, if, you should in your discretion at the end of the day conclude that there was liability for negligence, there is evidence in this case, ladies and gentlemen, upon which you have the legal authority to find that Dr. Bimbaum\u2019s conduct was, as to loss, grossly negligent. So, I want to tell you basically what the definition of gross negligence is. Gross negligence is evidence which is substantially higher and appreciably higher magnitude than ordinary negligence. It is materially greater want of care under the circumstances with respect to the legal duty that is owed. . . . If it\u2019s a relatively small want of inattention which is nonetheless negligent, then so be it. It\u2019s a great departure from the obligation of attentiveness and it\u2019s gross inattention, then you have the authority in this case to find that Dr. Bimbaum on the facts of this case was negligent. I do not, obviously, suggest to you that you should or you shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m merely telling you that there are facts in which you could make that determination from this case, and that is entirely up to you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> Birnbaum does not fault the judge\u2019s instructions on the elements of a cause of action for gross negligence. See <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 593 (1919).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> Our decision today should not be construed to suggest that a finding of gross negligence and an award of punitive damages cannot be secured in a loss of chance case. Where gross negligence is found in a loss of chance case, the fact finder will determine an amount of punitive damages exactly as in any other gross negligence case: according to the fact finder\u2019s determination of the egregiousness of the tortious conduct or in accordance with any statutorily prescribed amount. Punitive damages are not part of the proportional loss of chance damages calculus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
