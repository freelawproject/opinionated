The affidavit in support of the warrant application described Santiago as an active drug dealer with a lengthy criminal history including twenty-five \u201carraignments\u201d for \u201cnarcotics offenses,\u201d four \u201carraignments for firearms violations,\u201d and arraignments \u201cfor an assault and battery and violation of an abuse prevention order.\u201d The affidavit also included information that Santiago owned two dogs, one being a \u201cpit bull,\u201d that he kept on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Out of concern for the safety of the police officers that would be executing the warrant, the application sought permission to enter the residence without following the \u201cknock and announce\u201d protocol. A clerk-magistrate granted the search warrant authorizing the police \u201cto enter the premises without announcement.\u201d On its execution, the police safely seized the BB pistol and the stolen property. They also seized cocaine, heroin, and materials for drug packaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Santiago filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not justify the inclusion of the so-called \u201cno-knock\u201d provision. A Superior Court judge granted the motion, reasoning that there was no evidence in the affidavit that Santiago intended to use the BB pistol rather than merely store it for use by others, or that Santiago had been \u201cresistant\u201d in his past encounters with the police, or that the dogs \u201cwere aggressive or were present to be used as weapons.\u201d The Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 519 (2007). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We vacate the allowance of the motion to suppress, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">1. <em>Discussion. </em>It is well settled that police officers must \u201cknock and announce\u201d their presence and purpose before executing a search warrant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 215 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, </em>429 Mass. 698, 700 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antwine, </em>417 Mass. 637, 638 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, </em>387 Mass. 413, 418 n.5 (1982). The rule arises from a long common-law tradition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 140-147 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981) (tracing common-law rule to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Seventeenth Century England). It has also been incorporated into the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 934 (1995). The purposes of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule are threefold: to protect the privacy interests of individuals; to minimize the likelihood of property damage; and to reduce the possibility of violence after an unannounced entry. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 393 n.5 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, supra </em>at 701; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, supra </em>at 140-141.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The \u201cknock and announce\u201d mle may be suspended when there is a risk that announcement of the officers\u2019 presence would allow the destruction of evidence or put officer safety at risk. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra </em>at 216. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antwine, supra </em>at 639; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, supra </em>at 418; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, supra </em>at 147 n. 15, and cases cited. See also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra </em>at 936. To set aside the rule, the Commonwealth must establish that there is probable cause to believe that, in the particular circumstances of the search to be undertaken, compliance would create one or both of those risks. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the absence of exigent circumstances, this showing is to be made in the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra </em>at 216-217. Whether the affidavit here was sufficient to establish the requisite risk to officer safety is the only question before us in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The affidavit included information relevant to the clerk-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>magistrate\u2019s consideration of that risk, including Santiago\u2019s possession of a dangerous (if not deadly) weapon; his lengthy criminal history including arrests for narcotics and firearm possession and assault; and the presence of two dogs, one of which was a pit bull. Although the investigation for which the search warrant was sought was not a drug investigation, and the warrant did not include authorization to search for narcotics, the affidavit also included substantial information about Santiago\u2019s involvement in the drug trade, and the use of his residence to cut, package, and store heroin. This information came principally from the robbery suspect, who had purchased heroin from Santiago on many occasions during the previous six months, and who had \u201cstayed with him in his residence for lengths of time.\u201d It was corroborated through contacts with the Springfield police narcotics unit, which confirmed that there was an ongoing investigation of drag activity at that residence, and that controlled purchases of \u201cnarcotics\u201d had been made there.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The affidavit concluded with the applicant\u2019s averments that it is a \u201ccommon practice of narcotics dealers to keep weapons in the locations where they secret [sic] their narcotics, money, and perform sales\u201d; that a pit bull is \u201cknown to be dangerous and aggressive\u201d; and that if Santiago was given advance warning of the presence of the police \u201cthe [pit bull] could be placed in a position to confront and harm the officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\u201c[Affidavits in support of search warrants are to be approached with a view toward common sense, read in their entirety and with considerable latitude allowed for the drawing of inferences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra </em>at 218. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alessio, </em>377 Mass. 76, 82 (1979) (magistrate may properly rely on \u201c[Reasonable inferences and common knowledge\u201d when determining probable cause). Their sufficiency is to be decided \u201con the basis of a consideration of all of its allegations as a whole, and not by first dissecting it and then subjecting each resulting fragment to a hypertechnical test of its sufficiency standing alone.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 715 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747, 751 (1971). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>441 Mass. 170, 176 (2004) (facts in affidavit must be examined \u201ctogether, rather than in isolation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>(1991) (factors \u201cinnocent of themselves,\u201d when combined may amount to probable cause). The magistrate is also to \u201ctak[e] into account the police officers\u2019 expertise and experience\u201d when determining whether the probable cause standard was met. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortega, supra. </em>See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>440 Mass. 772, 784 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 498 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 470 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In allowing Santiago\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge dissected the affidavit and tested each of its fragments standing alone, not allowing for the reasonable inferences that a magistrate could draw from the entire array of information presented to him. In doing so, for example, the judge noted that the search warrant \u201cdid not seek narcotics,\u201d and therefore discounted the relevance of the information that Santiago and his residence had been involved in the drug trade on the question of officer safety, essentially concluding that in the absence of drugs, there would be no reason for the dogs to hold the police at bay. This hypertech-nical analysis of the affidavit was error. While more information regarding the particulars of Santiago\u2019s criminal history or the use of his dogs might have been helpful to the magistrate, we cannot say that the affidavit was inadequate in its absence. The magistrate was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from all of the allegations, in the aggregate, to use his common knowledge, and to credit the applicant\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Although the probable cause standard is more rigorous than that of reasonable suspicion, it does not require \u201cdefinitive proof.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>451 Mass. 59, 69 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 184 (1993). It does require the articulation of facts and circumstances present in the specific case, which, with the benefit of inference, experience, and the application of common sense, establish a substantial basis for concluding that officer safety would be at risk. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747, 749-752 (1971). The expression of \u201cgeneral averments\u201d or \u201ccategorical assertions\u201d will ordinarily be inadequate to satisfy this standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 219 (2002) (probable cause requires unique facts, not references to \u201ccommon\u201d practices of drug dealers). Consequently, we agree with Santiago that the mere assertion that the owner of a residence to be searched owns a dog, even of a breed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>commonly known to be aggressive, would, standing alone, be insufficient to meet the probable cause standard. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d 119, 125 (D. Mass. 2001) (presence of Rottweiler dog alone without evidence that \u201cthe defendant himself was violent\u201d did not constitute sufficient safety risk to justify \u201cno-knock\u201d entry), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>60 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1995) (prior record of convictions of violent offenses combined with knowledge that defendant owned pit bull dog \u201cmore than adequate to justify a \u2018no-knock\u2019 warrant\u201d), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStefano, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 542 (1986) (information that defendant suspected of drag dealing previously possessed firearm, had \u201cone or more Doberman pinschers on the premises,\u201d and had at one time been fugitive, sufficient to justify unannounced nighttime entry to execute warrant). However, that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Here, the magistrate had information that the officers would be entering premises that regularly had been used to facilitate the trafficking of narcotics, not merely the residence of someone suspected of receiving stolen property who happened to own two dogs. Additionally, the magistrate had information that Santiago was in possession of a weapon capable of being fired and inflicting injury, and that he had a prior record of arrests for the possession of other firearms, for acts of violence, and for the disobedience of court orders. Finally, the magistrate knew that the defendant possessed a type of dog which, in the officer\u2019s experience, was known to be dangerous and aggressive, and could be used to confront the officers. These factors, when combined, provided a substantial basis for the clerk-magistrate to conclude that there was probable cause that an announced search would put the safety of the officers at risk. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jewell, supra </em>at 24 (\u201cFourth Amendment did not require the police to risk having to fight off a forewarned attack dog before executing their warrant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We vacate the allowance of the motion to suppress, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> The United States Supreme Court has held that a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that evidence might be destroyed or officer safety put at risk is sufficient to abrogate the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 394 (1997). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, </em>429 Mass. 698, 701 (1999), we declined to depart from the standard of probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 216-217 n.3 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> In the Superior Court, the Commonwealth also contended that the \u201cno-knock\u201d provision was justified because the defendant might have destroyed evidence. The judge, however, correctly found that the police were authorized to search only for stolen property and a BB pistol, not items subject to ready destruction such as drugs. The Commonwealth conceded this point before the Appeals Court and does not press that argument here. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 522 n.4 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\"> The United States Supreme Court has held that violations of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Amendment\u2019s \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule do not warrant suppression of seized evidence. See <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586 (2006). Because we conclude that the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant was properly granted in this case, we need not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b600-8\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"arc-dedup-1\">(concurring). While I agree that the motion to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>press should have been denied in this case, I disagree with the court\u2019s dictum that \u201cthe mere assertion that the owner of a residence to be searched owns a dog, even of a breed commonly known to be aggressive, would, standing alone, be insufficient to meet the probable cause standard.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 577-578. The court takes the view that the presence of a potentially dangerous dog on the premises is merely one factor tending to support the validity of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, one that must be combined with other factors (such as the nature of the criminal enterprise, the presence of weapons, and the violent tendencies of the defendant in this case) for the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">It is with this portion of the court\u2019s reasoning that I disagree. In my view, where a police officer applying for a warrant includes information in an affidavit that the premises are likely to contain a dangerous dog, this information should be enough to permit the issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. The police should not be required to establish, as a prerequisite to obtaining a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, that the particular dog is dangerous, nor should they need to point to other factors indicating a threat to officer safety. Rather, the fact that the dog is in the home and is of a breed known to be dangerous, either in the officers\u2019 own experience or through common knowledge, should be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We have recognized that police will be justified in dispensing with the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule where adherence to the requirement would put officer safety at even greater risk than that normally inherent in the execution of a search warrant. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valerio, </em>449 Mass. 562, 573-574 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>441 Mass. 170, 176-178 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 147 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). See also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 934-936 (1995). Where the police have probable cause, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macias, </em>429 Mass. 698, 701 (1999), to believe that the premises contain a dangerous dog, we should not force officers to exacerbate the already considerable danger by requiring them to knock and announce their presence. As certain other courts have recognized, the requirement that police entry into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>home be reasonable does not require the police to risk having to fight off a forewarned attack dog before executing their warrant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Esser, </em>451 F.3d 1109, 1113 (10th Cir. 2006); <em>United States </em>v. Buckley, 4 F.3d 552, 558 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>510 U.S. 1124 (1994) (Fourth Amendment to United States Constitution does not require police to \u201carous[e] armed defendants, or their dog\u201d); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>201 Ga. App. 12, 14 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>740 P.2d 1363, 1367 (Utah Ct. App. 1987) (statutory provision that \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant may be issued where \u201cphysical harm may result to any person if notice were given\u201d satisfied by fact that \u201c[t]wo large watch dogs are always present and might pose a hazard to arresting officers\u201d). Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d 119, 124-125 (D. Mass. 2001) (presence of Rottweiler dog, absent \u201cevidence of any potential for violence on the part of defendant or the dog,\u201d insufficient to justify \u201cno-knock\u201d entry on officer safety grounds); <em>People </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>258 Ill. App. 3d 253, 260-261 (1994) (breed or type of dog alone insufficient to support finding that dog was \u201cvicious\u201d so as to justify officers\u2019 noncompliance with \u201cknock and announce\u201d mie). Where this kind of exposure to danger is present, it is my view that nothing in the Constitution requires that officers arbitrarily reduce their ability to use surprise to neutralize the threat or otherwise to take full control of the situation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>423 Mass. 735, 743-746 (1996) (upholding use of \u201cflash-bang\u201d device in execution of \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant as reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In short, the only question that the clerk-magistrate should have considered in deciding whether to authorize a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry was whether the dog might pose a danger to the police. Regardless whether the defendant specifically used the dog as a guard, the animal could have posed a significant threat to officer safety by virtue of its size, strength, and the general temperament of its breed. This should be sufficient.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b602-6\">Ireland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aef\">(dissenting, with whom Marshall, C.J., and Bots-ford, J., join).
