Before the board, Doe filed a motion for funds to retain an expert witness under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1), part of the sex offender registration law, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q (registration law); the motion was denied. Doe challenges the board\u2019s classification decision on a number of grounds, but the principal issue we consider in this appeal is Doe\u2019s challenge to the board\u2019s denial of his motion for expert funds. We conclude that \u00a7 178L (1) gives the board discretion to grant a motion for funds filed by an indigent sex offender in a case such as the present one, even though the board itself does not intend to rely on the testimony or report of an expert witness. We remand the case to the board for consideration of Doe\u2019s motion for expert funds and further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>Doe was classified as a level two sex offender based on convictions of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16; the convictions occurred in 1992 and 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of his final classification Doe was a forty-nine year old man who had suffered from bipolar disorder, manic type, for over twenty-five years. Doe, who lives with his mother, receives outpatient treatment for his mental illness through the Department of Mental Health, and takes medication under the supervision of a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">On April 28, 2005, the board recommended that Doe be classified as a level two sex offender on his convictions of open and gross lewdness. A level two classification is given to sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>offenders whose risk of reoffense is moderate. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 12, 2005, Doe made a timely request for a de nova hearing to challenge his classification. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) (c); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.07 (2004). Doe also requested that an attorney be appointed to represent him at the hearing. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (2); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.08 (2004). The board determined that Doe was indigent, granted his request that counsel be appointed, and scheduled a de nova hearing for November 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">On November 1, 2005, through his attorney, Doe filed a motion for funds to retain an expert witness to assist him on specific issues related to his classification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Doe also filed a motion to exclude records related to allegations of sexual misconduct that did not result in convictions. On November 14, 2005, the hearing examiner denied Doe\u2019s motion for expert funds, stating that the \u201cmotion may be re-filed if the Board, in fact, introduces testimony and/or a report from its own expert witness which shall have been prepared specifically for the purposes of the classification hearing.\u201d See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.09(2) (2002). The hearing examiner took Doe\u2019s motion to exclude certain records of alleged sexual misconduct under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The hearing examiner conducted the requested de nova hearing on November 16, 2005. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L; 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.10-1.21 (2002). The board presented no witnesses, expert or otherwise, but offered in evidence the board\u2019s April 28, 2005, classification report along with ten attachments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Doe did not testify at the hearing. He presented as evidence a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>letter from the director of an agency providing vocation rehabilitation services; a letter from the assistant director of clinical services at the Elliot Center, where Doe was receiving weekly therapy and medication for his mental illness; two letters from friends; and two studies on recidivism.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Doe called his mother as a witness; she testified, inter alla, that he had been on medication since 1992 and that there were no incidents of sexual misconduct between 1992 and 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">On February 27, 2006, the hearing examiner issued a written decision in which he found that Doe \u201cposes a moderate danger to the public and a moderate risk to re-offend\u201d and ordered him to register as a level two sex offender. In his decision, the hearing examiner adopted his prehearing ruling denying Doe\u2019s motion for expert funds (because the board had not presented an expert witness or report prepared for the classification hearing), and also denied Doe\u2019s motion to exclude records related to allegations of sexual misconduct that had not resulted in convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The hearing examiner stated in his decision that \u201c[t]he record reflects that [Doe] has suffered from bipolar disorder manic type for over [twenty-five] years,\u201d and he took administrative notice of the fact that the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 2000) (DSM-IV) defines \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d as a type of mood disorder characterized by manic episodes. <em>Id. </em>at 345. The hearing examiner also noted that \u201caccording to the DSM-IV discussion of Manic Episode . . . \u2018[t]he increase in goal-directed activity often involves excessive planning of . . . multiple activities (e.g. sexual . . .). Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present.\u2019 \u201d He concluded his consideration of the DSM-IV with the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>comment: \u201cI do not reference the learned treatise text herein to . . . infer that the presence of a Bipolar Disorder in and of itself creates a risk to criminally re-offend. In this case, however, taking the totality of the record evidence and factor analysis into account, I find that the condition serves to exacerbate the substantial level of risk of reoffense already present in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On April 4, 2006, Doe filed a complaint for judicial review of the board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. He later filed a motion for funds, pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, to retain an expert. Cross motions for judgment on the pleadings were thereafter filed. On May 7, 2007, a Superior Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision after determining that the hearing examiner\u2019s denial of Doe\u2019s motion for expert witness funds was proper and that substantial evidence supported the level two classification. The judge also denied Doe\u2019s motion for funds under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G. Doe filed a timely notice of appeal, and we granted Doe\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Motion for expert witness funds. </em>Doe\u2019s motion, which he filed with the hearing examiner before the de nova hearing, sought funds to retain an expert to provide, at least in part, information and possibly testimony on the relationship between his mental illness (bipolar condition) and his risk of recidivism. As has been noted, the hearing examiner denied the motion in substance because the board did not seek to introduce any expert witness testimony or report. Although not specifically stated in the denial, it is apparent that the hearing examiner based his decision on the provisions of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1). We turn to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Section 178L (1) (c) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">\u201cIn the case of any sex offender not in custody, ... the board shall promptly notify such sex offender of the board\u2019s recommended sex offender classification, his duty to register, if any, and his right to petition the board to request an evidentiary hearing to challenge such classification and duty, his right to retain counsel to represent him at such hearing and his right to have counsel appointed for him if he is found to be indigent as determined by the board us<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ing the standards under chapter 21 ID; <em>provided, however, that such indigent offender may also apply for and the board may grant payment of fees for an expert witness in any case where the board in its classification proceeding intends to rely on the testimony or report of an expert witness prepared specifically for the purposes of the classification proceeding . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.06 (2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Doe reads \u00a7 178L (1) to mean that a hearing examiner may grant an indigent petitioner\u2019s motion for funds to retain an expert <em>only </em>if the board intends to rely on \u201cthe testimony or report of an expert witness prepared specifically for the purposes of the classification hearing.\u201d He points out, correctly, that the board did not intend to rely on such an expert witness in his case, and further contends that the board has never sought to rely on such expert evidence in a classification hearing. Doe argues that as a result, no indigent sex offender may obtain funds to retain an expert witness, and that \u00a7 178L (1), so read, violat\u00e9s his Federal and State constitutional rights to equal protection and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In particular, Doe argues that his right to equal protection is violated because unlike indigent sex offenders, nonindigent sex offenders are permitted to present expert testimony and reports to challenge the board\u2019s recommended classification at the evi-dentiary hearing provided under \u00a7 178L (1), to meaningful effect, and there is no rational basis for this distinction between nonindigent and indigent offenders.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With respect to due process, Doe contends that he has a liberty interest at stake in his clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>sification proceedings; his liberty interest is violated by a procedure that does not ensure, to the extent possible, the accuracy of his classification; and his inability to use expert evidence fatally injures his chances of receiving an accurate classification.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The board also reads \u00a7 178L (1) to authorize the board to grant expert funds to an indigent petitioner only if the board itself intends to rely on expert evidence prepared specifically for the proceeding. The board concedes that it did not rely on evidence provided by an expert witness in this case and generally does not. Relying on, inter alla, <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., </em>406 Mass. 301, 309 (1989), the board asserts that Doe\u2019s equal protection argument fails because the Legislature had a rational basis, involving cost and efficiency considerations, for limiting expert funds for indigent petitioners to cases in which the board intends to call an expert witness. With respect to due process, the board argues that Doe\u2019s liberty interests are limited; that existing procedural safeguards in the classification process were and are sufficient to safeguard this limited liberty interest; and that increasing the amount of expert assistance available to indigent offenders would be costly, inefficient, and of limited value.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We need not resolve the issue whether, as interpreted by both Doe and the board, \u00a7 178L (1) violates Doe\u2019s equal protection or due process rights because we read the statute to provide the board with the discretion to grant an indigent petitioner\u2019s motion for expert witness funds in circumstances beyond those in which the board intends to rely on an expert witness or report prepared specifically for the classification hearing. See <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 72-73, 76-77 (1995) (avoiding constitutional question by reading workers\u2019 compensation statute to confer on commissioner author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ity to grant indigent individuals waivers of statutory appeal fee despite absence of express statutory waiver provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Section 178L (1) specifically identifies one situation in which the board may grant expert funds to an indigent sex offender, but nothing in the language of the statute prohibits or precludes the board from granting fees to retain an expert witness in other situations. Nor has our review of the legislative history of the 1999 registration law, St. 1999, c. 74, of which \u00a7 178L (1) was a part, revealed any evidence of an underlying legislative intent that the board confine the allowance of such funds to the single circumstance where the board intends to rely on expert witness testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion mindful of the principle that a \u201cstatute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 226 n.5 (1981), quoting <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>379 Mass. 846, 853, vacated and remanded on other grounds, 449 U.S. 894 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>383 Mass. 838, rev\u2019d, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); <em>Worcester County Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>340 Mass. 695, 701 (1960). Cf. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 98 (1998) (where right to due process entitled sex offenders to evidentiary hearing on appropriateness of risk classification but 1996 version of registration statute did not provide for such hearing, court would not strike statute but would prescribe eviden-tiary hearings to carry out legislative intent that there be viable risk classification procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">It is consistent with the purpose and structure of the registration law to read \u00a7 178L (1) to authorize the board to grant an application for expert witness funds in situations beyond the (to date hypothetical) case where the board intends to rely on expert evidence prepared specifically for the hearing. The purpose behind the law is the protection of \u201cthe vulnerable members of our com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>munities from sexual offenders,\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, emergency preamble, through a registration system that classifies offenders \u201con an individualized basis according to their risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness,\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass. 780, 784 n.8, 789-790 (2008). See also <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750, 760 (2006). We have recognized, however, that because the registration law implicates significant liberty interests of sex offenders, see, e.g., <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass, at 790-791, it is necessary that the law be tailored to achieve its purpose and that it provide the procedural protections required by due process. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 446, 451, 455 (2001) (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass, at 102 (in context of sex offender registration statute due process requires that \u201cfact finder . . . make particularized, specific, and detailed findings ... to demonstrate that close attention has been given to the evidence as to each offender and that the classification for each is appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Pursuant to the statutory mandate spelled out in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1), the board has promulgated guidelines \u201cfor determining the level of risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public,\u201d and it uses these as the basis for deciding the classification level of each sex offender. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40. The guidelines set out twenty-four specific factors that flesh out those identified by the Legislature in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1), as relevant to risk classification decisions. Many of the twenty-four factors focus on matters of historical fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Three factors, however, focus on a sex offender\u2019s mental or physical condition, and specifically reference assessments and opinions of licensed health care professionals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>itself has indicated that the proper use of these three factors in the classification process requires professional or expert opinions. It goes without saying that the validity and significance of a particular expert opinion are often subject to debate. When the classification of a particular sex offender implicates one or more factors, the accuracy of the classification decision may well be enhanced by the addition to the evidentiary record of additional expert evidence in the form of testimony or reports.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this regard, we note that although the registration law requires the board itself to include among its seven members at least three licensed psychologists or psychiatrists with \u201cspecial expertise in the assessment and evaluation of sex offenders\u201d and \u201cknowledge of the forensic mental health system,\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1), the evidentiary classification hearing may be conducted by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>individual board member or hearing examiner who is not required to have any such expertise or even training. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (2). Moreover, under the board\u2019s regulations, the board member\u2019s or hearing examiner\u2019s decision automatically becomes the final decision of the board without any further review. 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.23 (2004). As this court has stated, with reference to the statutory classification process, \u201c[i]t is in everyone\u2019s best interests \u2014 including the best interests of sex offenders themselves \u2014 that the board work from accurate, up to date, and thorough information.\u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass, at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The conclusion that the board has the discretion to grant an indigent petitioner\u2019s motion for expert witness funds even where the board does not intend to use expert evidence is consistent with our decision in <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10216 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 779, 785-786 (2006). The plaintiff sex offender in that case argued that the board was required to base its classification decision on expert testimony because sex offender recidivism predictions and the assessment of an offender\u2019s risk level are \u201cbeyond the ken of the fact finder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784. We disagreed, stating that the language of \u00a7 178L (1), insofar as it \u201cuses the permissive word \u2018may\u2019 in relation to the use of expert witnesses in classification proceedings, clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the use of experts to be discretionary, not mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785. We were referring to the discretionary use of experts by the board because that was the issue raised, but we were focusing on precisely the same language in \u00a7 178L (1) (a) that we consider in this case, namely, \u201cthe board may grant payment of fees for an expert witness in any case where the board in its classification proceeding intends to rely on the testimony or report of an expert witness prepared specifically for the purposes of the classification proceeding.\u201d We hold today that this language also signifies that the board has discretion to grant funds to an indigent sex offender for an expert witness or report, whether or not the board itself intends to rely on this type of expert evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The board argues that the cost of providing funds for indigent sex offenders to retain experts will be prohibitively high. However, the argument appears to be premised on an assumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>that in <em>every </em>registration case involving an indigent sex offender, the board will be required to grant funds for an expert. That is not the case for at least two reasons. First, it appears that of the many sex offenders who are required to register and for whom the board prepares a recommended classification, a considerable number do not seek a de nova hearing, and thus are not in a position to ask for expert witness funds. Second, the decision whether to grant an individual sex offender funds for an expert is a discretionary one, to be based on the facts presented in an individual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">As indicated previously, of the many factors included in the board\u2019s classification guidelines, there are three \u2014 factors 1, 13, and 15 (see note 15, supra) \u2014 that appear to us to concern issues for which expert evidence presented on behalf of the sex offender may be most relevant and material. Moreover, in moving for expert witness funds, the burden will be on the sex offender to identify and articulate the reason or reasons, connected to a condition or circumstance special to him, that he needs to retain a particular type of expert. A general motion for funds to retain an expert to provide an opinion on the sex offender\u2019s risk of reof-fense, without more, would appear to be insufficient.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In the case before us, Doe asserted in his motion for expert funds that \u201cindigency prevents him from addressing evidence concerning his mental health status available to the board.\u201d Because the hearing examiner did not appear to believe he had discretion to allow the motion in light of the board\u2019s intention not to use an expert witness at the de nova hearing, there is no indication that he considered the motion on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">A remand to the board for such consideration is appropriate. We make this determination because Doe\u2019s motion focused on an issue that (1) is particular to him \u2014 the relationship of his long-standing bipolar disorder to the risk of recidivism, (2) is not a matter of common knowledge or experience, and (3) clearly had a bearing on Doe\u2019s classification, at least in the opinion of the hearing officer, as demonstrated by his use of the DSM-FV\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>discussion of bipolar disorder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The DSM-IV itself cautions against the use of its diagnostic criteria and descriptions by individuals who are not clinically trained<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or for purposes other than diagnosis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In seeking to arrive at an accurate assessment of Doe\u2019s particular risk level in this case, the board might greatly benefit from testimony or a report by an appropriately trained and qualified mental health professional on the issue of Doe\u2019s bipolar disorder \u2014 or at least the board should consider whether it might so benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We turn to two issues that may arise on remand.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">b. <em>Consideration of evidence of sex offenses not resulting in convictions. </em>Doe argues that the hearing examiner committed reversible error in considering two alleged incidents of sexual misconduct that did not lead to convictions. The first related to allegations that in June, 1991, two thirteen year old girls had seen Doe standing in a doorway and touching his exposed penis. Based on these allegations, Doe had been charged with open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, but thereafter Doe admitted to sufficient facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>concerning the charge, and it was continued without a finding and later dismissed. The second alleged incident concerned a June, 1991, report to the police by a female neighbor of Doe\u2019s that she had observed him waving obscene pictures from his apartment window while children were walking by.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The hearing examiner described these two alleged incidents in his decision. He found that Doe\u2019s 1991 open and gross lewdness charge that was continued without a finding related to misconduct similar to that underlying the 1992 and 2003 convictions that formed the basis of the requirement that Doe register as a sex offender; he also stated that the alleged misconduct could be seen as \u201cconsistent with a pattern of behavior as tends to lend credibility to the victims\u2019 [of the 1992 and 2003 incidents] already detailed] accounts.\u201d At a later point in the decision, he \u201caccepted] [the evidence of the charge that had been continued without a finding] as useful information tending to prove that in the era of 1991-1992 [Doe] exhibited poor judgment manifested] by an inability to maintain appropriate behavioral boundaries with children.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">There was no error in the hearing examiner\u2019s use of Doe\u2019s 1991 continuance without a finding (CWOF). While a hearing examiner may not consider a CWOF a \u201cprior offense\u201d in relation to the classification factor that looks at the dates, number, and nature of prior offenses,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> he is permitted to take into account the misconduct underlying the CWOF on the issue whether the sex offender\u2019s conduct was repetitive and compulsive. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass, at 764-765 &amp; n.12. The hearing examiner followed these guidelines, never mentioning the CWOF as a separate prior charge, but rather viewing the underlying conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>(1) as suggesting a pattern of behavior; and (2) inferentially, as supporting his finding that Doe exhibited a compulsive and impulsive choice of \u201cmultiple stranger victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Doe also argues that even if the hearing examiner in theory could consider the conduct underlying Doe\u2019s CWOF on the issue of repetitive and compulsive behavior, he could not do so in this case because the actual evidence constituted unreliable hearsay. We disagree. As the Superior Court judge noted, \u201c[a] CWOF means that Doe admitted, and a sentencing judge found, that the prosecution had sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 845 (1982).\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, the police report of the incident that ultimately resulted in the CWOF, in reporting the victims\u2019 observations, contained a level of detail that supports its reliability. See <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>439 Mass. 766, 786 (2003) (in conducting adjudicatory proceeding, administrative agency entitled to rely on hearsay so long as it \u201chas indicia of reliability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">c. <em>Motion for funds under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, in the Superior Court. </em>In connection with his appeal from the board\u2019s classification decision to the Superior Court, Doe filed and then renewed a motion pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27B,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> for $3,000 in funds to retain an expert witness. The judge denied the motion, reasoning that any funds sought under \u00a7 27B must relate to a pending trial or appeal, and that the funds Doe sought related to the underlying administrative proceeding before the board \u2014 because Doe had indicated that if the motion for funds were allowed, he would move \u201cfor leave to present additional mitigating evidence to the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The judge\u2019s ruling was correct. Doe\u2019s civil action in the Superior Court was in substance an appeal, under G. L. c. 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>\u00a7 178M, and c. 30A, \u00a7 14, from the board\u2019s adjudicatory decision. It is true, as Doe argues, that \u00a7 27B by its terms applies to both civil actions and appeals, and that the general legal definition of an \u201cappeal\u201d includes a reference to an appeal from a decision of an administrative agency.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the statutory scheme governing indigent fees and costs, G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, read as a whole, makes clear that it is concerned with fees and costs that relate directly to the prosecution or defense of actions and appeals pending in a court. Thus, the definition of \u201c[njormal fees and costs\u201d in \u00a7 27A refers solely to fees and costs connected to court proceedings, and the term \u201c[ejxtra fees and costs\u201d is defined in the same section to include fees that are required for or at least connected to the prosecution or defense of the party\u2019s \u201ccase.\u201d Section G. L. c. 261, 27C (4), in tom, states that if the court finds a person indigent, the court \u201cshall not deny any request with respect to extra fees and costs if it finds the document, service or object is reasonably necessary to assure the applicant <em>as effective a prosecution, defense or appeal as he would have if he were financially able to </em>pay\u201d (emphasis supplied). The point of focus in each of these provisions is on fees and costs necessary or appropriate for conducting the actual proceeding pending in a court, not an underlying adjudicatory proceeding before an administrative agency. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>410 Mass. 680, 684 (1991) (after unsuccessful direct appeal, convicted defendant sought fees pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C [4], to conduct DNA testing on certain trial evidence to support a motion for new trial; court held motion \u201cnot cognizable under ... \u00a7 27C [4], because the funds sought are not related to a pending trial or appeal\u201d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Doe\u2019s request for funds from the Superior Court is similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the defendant\u2019s motion for funds in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, supra. </em>Doe sought the funds in order to obtain an expert report and perhaps expert testimony that would not be used directly for the Superior Court action but would rather serve as the basis for a motion under G.

Whatever expertise an agency may possess, the record of an adjudicatory hearing must reflect the evidence on which the agency relies. Technical or specialized facts must be supported by expert testimony, or taking official notice of facts under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Agency expertise is no substitute for necessary evidence. See <em>D\u2019Amour </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Dentistry, </em>409 Mass. 572, 585 (1991) (board\u2019s decision not supported by substantial evidence where board substituted its expertise for evidence without putting in record basis for its expertise); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>405 Mass. 103, 113, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989) (agency could not discount magistrate\u2019s negative credibility findings by merely professing expertise in dynamics of psychiatrist-patient relationship). Although an agency may not use its expertise to build the case for or against a litigant, it may apply its expertise to evaluate the evidence. See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra; Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 381 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The hearing examiner\u2019s recourse to the DSM-IV in this case poses certain additional problems. First, the hearing examiner\u2019s familiarity with cases involving sex offender registration and classification does not qualify him to provide expert opinions in such cases. Where he lacked psychiatric or psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>expertise, the hearing examiner was not qualified to opine how Doe\u2019s bipolar disorder might bear on his risk of reoffense. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>365 F.2d 554, 558 (6th Cir. 1966) (error for social security hearing examiner to disregard uncontradicted expert medical opinion evidence, undertake scientific research of his own, and decide case on what he thought medical text meant). Cf. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 113 (board\u2019s professed expertise in dynamics of psychiatrist-patient relationship insufficient to discount credibility findings of administrative magistrate). But see <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>331 F.2d 426, 428-429 (4th Cir. 1964) (social security appeals council may use medical publications to explain or refute expert medical opinions as long as claimant is given opportunity to challenge and contradict such publications).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">A second problem is the hearing examiner\u2019s apparent failure to provide notice to Doe of his intention to use the DSM-IV or to give Doe an opportunity to present evidence to refute the hearing examiner\u2019s determination that his bipolar condition \u201cexacerbate[d] the substantial level of risk to reoffense already present in this case,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5). In the absence of Doe\u2019s opportunity to respond, the hearing examiner\u2019s reliance on the DSM-IV was error. See <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>354 Mass. 332, 336 (1968) (facts not properly before department where petitioner did not have opportunity to contest facts). The significance of this error is magnified because the hearing examiner\u2019s consideration of Doe\u2019s bipolar disorder on his risk of reoffense raises a disputable and critical factual question, which requires that Doe be afforded greater procedural protection. See 2 R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law \u00a7 10.6, at 754 (4th ed. 2002) (suggesting that when facts are specific to parties, \u201cadjudicative, disputed and critical, nothing less than the opportunity to present evidence at a hearing will normally suffice\u201d); 2 C.H. Koch, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 5.55, at 207 (2d ed. 1997) (\u201cwhere an adjudicative fact is crucial to the central factual controversy in an adjudication, it must, of course, be proven through traditional methods\u201d). Because the hearing examiner introduced facts from the DSM-IV that bore on the ultimate issue, the hearing examiner\u2019s use of the DSM-IV and the conclusion he drew therefrom amounted to reli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>anee \u201con the testimony or report of an expert witness prepared specifically for the purposes of the classification proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) (c). Accordingly, Doe\u2019s application for funds to retain an expert witness should have been considered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\"> General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201cAgencies may take notice of any fact which may be judicially noticed by the courts, and in addition, may take notice of general, technical or scientific facts within their specialized knowledge.
