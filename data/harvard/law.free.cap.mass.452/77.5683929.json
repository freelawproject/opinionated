The Appeals Court reversed that judgment, concluding that the will did not give the wife a life estate. See <em>Hershman-Tcherepnin </em>v. <em>Tcherepnin, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 218 (2007). We conclude that the testator devised to the wife and each child a one-fifth present possessory interest in the home as tenants in common, and granted the wife a right against partition. We also conclude that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the wife\u2019s filing of a petition for partition terminated her protection against partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>In June, 2004, after the will was probated, the wife filed a petition for partition in the Probate and Family Court. She claimed that the will granted her \u201ca right to occupy [the house] for life . . . which [she] wishes to hold separately\u201d \u2014 i.e., a life estate \u2014 and that the will also granted her and each of her four stepchildren a future, one-fifth remainder interest in the house. The wife requested that, if the property could not be partitioned in kind \u201cwithout great inconvenience,\u201d that it be \u201cset off\u201d to her for an amount \u201cas the commissioners award to make the partition just and equal.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alternatively, she requested that the property be sold at a private sale for not less than $670,000, and that the proceeds be divided among her and the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See generally G. L. c. 241, \u00a7 6 (specifying form of partition).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In March, 2005, the four children filed a response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>wife\u2019s petition and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They argued that the will granted the wife and each child a one-fifth present possessory interest in the house \u2014 i.e., concurrent interests as tenants in common. The children further claimed that the testator\u2019s grant to the wife of the \u201cright to remain [in the house] for as long as she desires\u201d confers not a life estate but only \u201ca mere right of occupancy and a defense to ouster and partition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In September, 2005, a judge in the Probate and Family Court allowed the wife\u2019s motion, concluding that the will is unambiguous and that it devised to the wife a life estate, as well as a one-fifth remainder interest. She concluded that the four children were each given a one-fifth remainder interest and no present possessory interest. The judge further concluded that the wife\u2019s petition for partition did not \u201camount to a relinquishment of her interest in the . . . property,\u201d i.e., that the wife was \u201cwithin her rights, as a life tenant, to seek partition of the property without relinquishing her interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Thereafter, in January, 2006, the wife moved for the appointment of a commissioner and for an order to sell the real estate by private sale. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, noting that a partition by sale was premature as none of the parties had yet presented evidence showing the need for a partition, or evidence that a physical partition would be inconvenient or nonadvantageous, making a private sale necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge noted that the focus of the litigation up to that point had been the interpretation of the will, and that in allowing the wife\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>for summary judgment the judge had resolved only the matter of the respective interests of the parties in the property and had concluded that the wife could proceed to <em>seek </em>a partition of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In June, 2006, the judge entered separate and final judgment on the children\u2019s counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). Consistent with her allowance of the wife\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge declared that the will unambiguously granted the wife a life estate and a one-fifth remainder interest in the property, \u201csubject to [pjartition pursuant to the provisions of [G. L. c.] 241.\u201d The judge \u201cspecifically reserve[d] for later adjudication those aspects of the [petition for partition] relating to the value of the assigned interests in the [property.\u201d Thereafter, the children filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">2. <em>Factual background,.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a. <em>The will. </em>The testator\u2019s will provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\u201cFOURTH: If I do not leave property in this will to one or more of the children or grandchildren whom I have identified above [he identified his four children but no grandchildren], my failure to do so is intentional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Under the heading \u201cSPECIFIC BEQUESTS OF PROPERTY,\u201d the will states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cSIXTH: <em>I give one fifth (Vs) ownership of the property at 96 Russell Avenue, Watertown, Ma., the right to remain there for as long as she desires, and her choice of furnishings </em>and bric-a-brocs in my house and office, my Macintosh Ilci, monitor and TI laserprinter, fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars in cash or stocks, my 1987 SAAB automobile and the print \u2018Boy and Bug\u2019 by Margo Hoff <em>to Sue Ellen </em>Hershman-Tcherepnin. . . .<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201cTENTH: <em>I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown and its furnishings, </em>and all photos and documents pertaining to my mother, <em>to Sarina </em>Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201cELEVENTH: <em>I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown and its furnishings, </em>the Macintosh 5300 powerbook and accessories and the Sharp video-camcorder and tripod <em>to Nicholas </em>Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cTWELFTH: <em>I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown and its furnishings, </em>Macintosh 660AV and accessories, psalteries and santur, electronic music instruments, including Serge Modular stuff, and the Steinway grand piano <em>to Stefan </em>Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201cTHIRTEENTH: <em>I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown, one fifth (J/s) of all furnishings, </em>all photographic equipment and the Sony Hi-8 videocam and accessories <em>to Sergem</em><footnotemark><em>[9]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Tcherepnin, my son . . . .\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Under the heading \u201cRESIDUARY ESTATE,\u201d the will provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201cFOURTEENTH: I give my residuary estate to my children, Sarina, Nicholas, Stefan and Serge Tcherepnin and my wife, Sue Ellen Hershman-Tcherepnin. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>And under the heading \u201cDIVISION OF BEQUESTS,\u201d the will provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cSEVENTEENTH: Any specific bequest or residuary bequest made in this will to two or more beneficiaries shall be shared equally among them, unless unequal shares are specifically indicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">b. <em>Circumstances of the making of the will. </em>The house came into the Tcherepnin family in 1981, when it was acquired by the parents of the testator\u2019s former wife, Anne, the mother of the testator\u2019s four children: Sarina, Nicholas, Stefan, and Sergei. In 1983, the property was transferred from Anne\u2019s parents to Anne and the testator. Seven years later, in 1990, the testator and Anne divorced. In 1994, Anne transferred title solely to the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">All of the children lived in the house through the 1980\u2019s, and two of them (Stefan and Sergei) lived there longer. Sergei lived in the house until 1993, when, at approximately age twelve, he moved to Falmouth to live with his mother. He kept his bedroom in the Watertown house, however, and visited nearly every weekend. Stefan also lived in the house until 1993, when, at approximately age fifteen, he apparently moved out. Later, at age sixteen or seventeen, Stefan returned to live in the testator\u2019s house for approximately five more years: from \u201capproximately 1994 to 1999\u201d (according to Stefan), or from July, 1995, to \u201csome time in 2000\u201d (according to the wife).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Stefan\u2019s girl friend also lived in the house, from \u201capproximately 1997 to 1998,\u201d according to Stefan, or \u201c[s]ome time in the [flail of 1997 to the [s]pring of 1998,\u201d according to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The wife, a musician (like the testator), met the testator at various concerts in the early 1980\u2019s. She moved into the house in 1995, and occupied Safina\u2019s bedroom.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The same year, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>testator became ill and his illness progressed over the next few years. In late December, 1997, approximately three and one-half months before he died, the testator married the wife. Following the marriage, the testator encouraged his children to welcome the wife into the family, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The testator executed his will on March 13, 1998, approximately one month before he died on April 11, 1998. He \u00bfrafted the will himself using a computer software program (the record is devoid of any information about the will-drafting software).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the wife claimed, in her answers to interrogatories, that it was her \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the testator met privately with Attorney Robert DiLibero \u201cto discuss execution of his will,\u201d the wife also asserted that she did not \u201cknow\u201d whether the testator \u201cconsulted anyone regarding the drafting of his will,\u201d and that she did not herself assist him.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">At the time the testator executed the will (and at the time of his death), the children\u2019s ages were as follows: Satina, twenty-nine; Nicholas, twenty-seven; Stefan, twenty; and Sergei, sixteen. Stefan was living in the house (apparently with his girl friend), and Sergei, while living with his mother in Falmouth, visited the house nearly every weekend. In fact, all three sons, including Nicholas, \u201cmaintained\u201d their own bedrooms in the house. According to the sons, \u201ceveryone\u201d \u2014 including the testator \u2014 considered the property the \u201c \u2018family\u2019 home.\u201d None of the children currently lives in the house.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>3. <em>Discussion. </em>The fundamental rule for the construction of wills \u201cis to ascertain the intention of the testator from the whole instrument, attributing due weight to all its language, considered in the light of the circumstances known to him at the time of its execution and to give effect to that intent unless some positive rule of law forbids.\u201d <em>Fitts </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>307 Mass. 449, 454 (1940). Accord <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>432 Mass. 665, 667-668 (2000); <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>366 Mass. 261, 266 (1974); <em>Tucci </em>v. <em>DiGregorio, </em>358 Mass. 493, 495-496 (1970); <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>202 Mass. 512, 516 (1909). \u201cAll the language in the will is to be given effect, if at all possible. The court will look to the testator\u2019s general plan in the will and interpret the will so as to harmonize its provisions if that is possible.\u201d S.M. Dunphy, Probate Law and Practice \u00a7 30.2, at 575 (2d ed. 1997) (Dunphy).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Although the interpretation of a will begins with the four corners of the instrument, see G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 1A (2) (\u201cintention of a testator expressed in his will shall control the legal effect of his dispositions\u201d), it does not necessarily end there. See 2 T.H. Belknap, Newhall\u2019s Settlement of Estates and Fiduciary Law in Massachusetts \u00a7 33:30, at 381; \u00a7 33:33, at 388 (5th ed. 1997) (\u201cThe principal rule is that the primary purpose of construction is to ascertain the intention of the testator, and that this intention is to be gleaned from the four comers of the instrument. All other mies are supplementary to this. ... A will is construed in the light of the surrounding circumstances as they existed at the time of its execution. Consequently evidence is always admissible to show the surrounding facts so far as they are relevant, such as the nature and size of the testator\u2019s estate, his family and relatives and his relations toward them, etc.\u201d); Dunphy, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 30.12, at 596-597 (same).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201cIn all cases, evidence of surrounding facts and circumstances known to the testator may be received into evidence for the purpose of placing the court in a setting as near as possible to that occupied by the testator at the time the will was written so that it can more clearly ascertain the testator\u2019s intention as expressed in the provisions of the will. But when the will contains a latent [ambiguity, i.e., one that becomes apparent only when the court attempts to apply seemingly clear terms of the will to people or things] or [a] patent ambiguity [i.e., inconsistencies created by obvious conflicts in the language of the will] which cannot be resolved by recourse to evidence of circumstances existing at the time the will was executed, the court has approved the admission of additional extrinsic evidence of facts known to the testator and in light of which he viewed the ambiguous language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Smith, The Admissibility of Extrinsic Evidence in Will Interpretation Cases, 64 Mass. L. Rev. 123, 124, 128 (1979). Accord <em>Clymer </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>393 Mass. 754, 770 (1985); Dunphy, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 30.12, at 596-597.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Not all ambiguities can be defined neatly as patent or latent. See 15 R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 85.19[1], at 85-338 (M. Wolf ed. 2007) (\u201cAmbiguity exists where a word, phrase or provision of a will is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations or meanings\u201d); Dunphy, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 30.2, at 575 (will is unambiguous \u201c[w]here no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>exists as to the property bequeathed or the identity of the beneficiary . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">a. <em>The testator\u2019s will is ambiguous. </em>Although it is clear that the testator granted the wife and each of his four children a one-fifth ownership interest in the house,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it is not clear whether those interests are present estates or future (remainder) estates, in light of the additional grant to the wife of the \u201cright to remain there for as long as she desires.\u201d That language creates an ambiguity because it is susceptible to two meanings: a life estate or a mere right of occupancy (a right or privilege not to be removed from the house). Put another way, the phrase leaves some doubt about the property bequeathed, i.e., the quantum of the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>given to the wife. We may resolve the ambiguity on the summary judgment record before us as a matter of law; no party raises a genuine dispute of material fact about the extrinsic facts surrounding the making of the will that would warrant a trial. See Massachusetts Jurisprudence, Decedents\u2019 Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5:51, at 157-158 (1994).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">b. <em>The will created a tenancy in common with protection for the wife against removal. </em>Although no authority in Massachusetts or elsewhere resolves this case, analogous cases and general principles governing the creation of estates in real property guide our determination of the nature of the interests created here. We conclude, as did the Appeals Court, that the will devised five concurrent present ownership interests to the wife and children \u2014 i.e., that it created a tenancy in common. <em>Hershman-Tcherepnin </em>v. <em>Tcherepnin, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 219 (2007). We also conclude, however, that the wife was given something more than the children by the will\u2019s inclusion of the \u201cright to remain\u201d language: not an additional estate in the property, but special protection against being removed from the home by partition, as the children concede. Finally, we conclude that, in the particular circumstances of the testator\u2019s wishes, the wife terminated her protection against partition by pursuing a petition for partition. We begin by examining whether the will conveys to the wife a life estate and five remainder interests. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Typically, \u201ca conveyance \u2018to B during his life\u2019 or \u2018to B until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>his death\u2019 or other similar words of limitation will create a life estate in B.\u201d H.J. Alperin &amp; L.D. Shubow, Summary of Basic Law \u00a7 17.15, at 584 (3d ed. 1996) (Alperin &amp; Shubow).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See cases cited in <em>Hershman-Tcherepnin </em>v. <em>Tcherepnin, supra </em>at 222-223. Here, the testator used neither \u201clife\u201d nor \u201cdeath,\u201d nor did he use comparable wording. Contrast <em>Bernat </em>v. <em>Kivior, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 957, 958 (1986) (conveyance of property to four sisters \u201csubject to . . . rights [of fifth sister] to occupy the granted premises for the rest of her life\u201d gave life estate to fifth sister and future interests in remainder to other sisters).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Where a will does not employ the language typically used to create a life estate, the will may nonetheless create a life estate if other factors are present, such as where the will grants the premises to the person in question or requires that person to maintain the property and pay taxes and Insurance on it. See Annot., Quantum or Character of Estate or Interest Created by Language Providing Premises as a Home, or Giving or Granting Same for Such Use, 45 A.L.R.2d 699, 707 (1956) (\u201cIn most instances in which the language of disposal does not include a use of the expression \u2018for life,\u2019 or a similar one, but gives or grants the premises \u2018for so long as\u2019 the conveyee shall occupy the same as a home, or in similar terms, the conclusion reached has been that a life estate was given\u201d). See also cases cited in <em>Hershman-Tcherepnin </em>v. <em>Tcherepnin, supra </em>at 223-225.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In this case, however, the testator did not give or grant the premises \u2014 i.e., the entire house \u2014 to the wife for so long as she desired to live there; he gave her only one-fifth of the house and the right to remain there for as long as she desired. Nor did he require, through his will, that the wife maintain the property or pay taxes or insurance on it. That the wife voluntarily assumed those duties in 2000 does not change the fact that the will did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>require her to do so, and it is the testator\u2019s intent as reflected in the will that controls. Compare <em>Wilmarth </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>113 Mass. 407, 408, 410 (1873) (daughter received life estate where testator gave her \u201cthe use and improvement of all my real estate ... so long as she chooses personally to occupy and improve the same; on condition of her keeping the building in repair and paying the taxes and costs of insurance\u201d), with <em>Hesseltine </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>236 Mass. 77, 79, 81 (1920) (where will granted widow \u201cthe use and occupation\u201d of house \u201cso long as she shall desire to reside therein,\u201d but devised ownership of house to testator\u2019s daughters, widow did not receive life estate; daughter\u2019s ownership of house was \u201csubject to the personal right of the widow to use and occupy it\u201d; widow\u2019s \u201cprivilege of the use of this property as a residence was an interest in real estate of an unascertained, and probably indeterminate, value\u201d). The indicia of a life estate that might make up for the absence of the use of traditional language to create such an estate are missing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Another reason that we conclude that the will did not create a life estate and five remainder interests is the absence of remainder language. Ordinarily, a future estate is created by language such as: \u201c \u2018to B for life, remainder to C and his heirs\u2019 \u2014 B has a present life estate, and C has a remainder in fee simple.\u201d Al-perin &amp; Shubow, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 17.25, at 595. Another example is: \u201cto B for life, then to C and his heirs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. See <em>Wil-marth </em>v. <em>Bridges, supra </em>at 408, 410-411 (remainder created where property devised to daughter for \u201cso long as she chooses to\u201d occupy it, and \u201cwhenever [she] shall cease [to do so], that the whole shall be divided among my children\u201d). Here, no such comparable language was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Moreover, to read the will to grant the wife a life estate would be to give her a disproportionate share of the house \u2014 a one-fifth interest <em>plus </em>a life estate. The will and the circumstances under which it was created belie that reading and instead show that the testator intended to divide the house equally. The specific bequests in clauses six and ten through thirteen give the wife and each child a one-fifth interest in the house and its furnishings (with the wife getting first choice of the furnishings). And the seventeenth clause provides: \u201cAny specific bequest or residuary bequest made in this will to two or more beneficiaries shall be shared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>equally among them, unless unequal shares are specifically indicated.\u201d The testator did not specify unequal shares in ownership of the house \u2014 he did not give the wife a life estate <em>plus </em>a one-fifth ownership interest; he gave her and each child only a one-fifth ownership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The wife began living in the home only in 1995 \u2014 relatively late compared to the children, who had grown up in the house in the 1980\u2019s. And even after the sons moved away, they continued to maintain their bedrooms in the house; \u201ceveryone,\u201d including the testator, considered the house the \u201c \u2018family\u2019 home.\u201d Moreover, at the time the will was created, Stefan was living in the house, and Sergei was visiting nearly every weekend. When the testator died, he had been married to the wife for a few months. Those circumstances support the view that the testator intended to give the wife not a disproportionate share of the house, but to give her and each child equal shares of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">By giving the wife and the children equal, present shares in the house, the testator created a tenancy in common. See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 7 (\u201cA conveyance or devise of land to two or more persons . . . shall create an estate in common\u201d); <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>A\u2019Hearn, </em>338 Mass. 695, 697 (1959) (devise of land and buildings to parties \u201cshare and share alike\u201d created tenancy in common). Accord Alperin &amp; Shubow, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 17.43, at 610. As such, each \u201chas an equal right of entry, occupation and enjoyment, the possession of one being presumed to be the possession of all.\u201d <em>Muskeget Island Club </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>228 Mass. 95, 96 (1917).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">But the testator also gave the wife something above and beyond what he gave the other cotenants: the \u201cright to remain\u201d in the house \u201cfor as long as she desires.\u201d The testator was not an attorney, and so we consider the literal meaning of the words he used. See <em>Hershman-Tcherepnin </em>v. <em>Tcherepnin, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 225-226 (2007), citing <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>208 S.W.2d 598, 601, 605 (Tex. Ct. App. 1948). The context in which the will was made indicates that the testator\u2019s intention in providing the wife with the \u201cright to remain\u201d was to ensure that the children could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>not force her out of the house. Although the children welcomed the wife into the family after she and the testator were married, she was relatively new to living in the house and was even newer as a member of the family. The children together were given a much greater share of the house than the wife (four-fifths versus one-fifth). Accordingly, even though a tenancy in common, by its very nature, protects each cotenant from exclusion or ouster, see Alperin &amp; Shubow, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 17.44, at 610-611, it is reasonable to conclude (in the absence of evidence indicating that the testator understood the legal rights created by a tenancy in common) that the testator used the \u201cright to remain\u201d language to ensure that the children understood that, despite her relatively short time in the house and in the family, and despite the fact that the children were given four-fifths of the house, the wife was entitled to stay in the house after the testator\u2019s death. See <em>Hershman-Tcherepnin </em>v. <em>Tcherepnin, supra </em>at 226-227. In other words, the \u201cright to remain\u201d language gave the wife not an estate in the property but a right or privilege not to be excluded from the home.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, supra </em>at 605, 607 (\u201cwill and wish\u201d that child \u201ccontinue to live\u201d in home \u201ctill and unless she wishes to change her residence\u201d conferred nontransferable right of occupancy with no market value).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">That the law of tenancies in common protects each cotenant from ouster is not to say, however, that the \u201cright to remain\u201d language is mere surplusage. We must give effect to that language, if possible. See Dunphy, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 30.2, at 575; note 15, <em>supra. </em>We conclude that the \u201cright to remain\u201d language, while unnecessary to ensure the wife\u2019s protection from ouster, is meaningful as a means to accomplish the testator\u2019s intent to provide the wife with a home insofar as it protects her from losing her possessory interest through a partition (a point conceded by the children).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">While a tenancy in common carries with it protection from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ouster, it also carries with it an absolute right to partition. See G. L. c. 241, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAny person . . . owning a present undivided legal estate in land . . . shall be entitled to have partition in the manner hereinafter provided\u201d); Dunphy, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 16.3, at 247 (\u201cPartition is either voluntary or compulsory .... Compulsory partition is a partition by judicial proceedings at the insistence of one or more of the co-tenants without regard to the wishes of the other tenants. Partition is a matter of absolute right, it is not dependent on the consent of any of the co-tenants or the discretion of the court\u201d); Alperin &amp; Shubow, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 17.44, at 612-613. Pursuant to the absolute right to partition, each cotenant is potentially vulnerable to being divested of his possessory interest in the property if another cotenant seeks partition and a physical division of the property is inconvenient or nonadvantageous.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See notes 2 &amp; 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Thus, consistent with the testator\u2019s intent that the wife be protected against removal from the house by the children, we conclude \u2014 consistent with the children\u2019s concession \u2014 that he intended that she be protected against partition. In other words, we conclude that, in these circumstances, the testator\u2019s use of the \u201cright to remain\u201d language is tantamount to a restraint on the children\u2019s ability to partition the property for as long as the wife chooses to remain there (i.e., no longer than her lifetime). See Dunphy, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 16.3, at 247 (\u201cA testator could restrict partition by his devisees for a reasonable period of time\u201d). See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>10 R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 77.08, at 77-35 to 77-37 (M.

By creating a tenancy in common, he gave them such rights; but through the \u201cright to remain\u201d language he also prevented them from removing the wife from the house by partition.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Although we conclude that the testator granted the wife protection from partition, in the particular circumstances of this case we conclude that the wife relinquished that protection by seeking partition. First, although she contended in her petition for partition that she held a life estate in the property and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>she and each child held a one-fifth remainder interest, on that view she would not have held a concurrent possessory interest with the children and thus would not have been entitled to a partition at all. \u201cExcept for rare exceptions, future interests are not subject to a partition action brought by the sole owner of the entire possessory estate. Historically, partition serves to sever concurrent interests and is not to be used for an attempted severance of successive interests.\u201d 3 R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 21.05[3][b], at 21-78 to 21-79 (2007). See 2 Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 476, at 315-317 (3d ed. 1939 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u201cone who has as life tenant the sole right of possession cannot usually maintain [a partition] proceeding as against the reversioners or remaindermen, even though he himself had an undivided interest in reversion or remainder, though as to the latter there is authority to the contrary, generally by reason of statute\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Massachusetts partition statute, G. L. c. 241, does not authorize the partition of future interests by a life tenant, and historically we have denied such partition. See G. L. c. 241, \u00a7 4 (\u201ccourt may make partition ... of the land included in the petition of which the parties thereto are co-tenants\u201d); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Libbey, </em>140 Mass. 82, 83-84 (1885) (where widow held life estate in land as undivided one-half possessory interest shared with heirs, present possessory interests could be partitioned but not reversionary interests); <em>Judkins </em>v. <em>Judkins, </em>109 Mass. 181, 182 (1872) (where life estates devised to petitioner and brother as tenants in common and remainder interests devised to heirs, partition \u201ccan extend only to the interest of which [the brothers] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>are seised [i.e., the Ufe estates], and does not affect the rights of those who may have title to the remainder\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 Allen 196, 196-198 (1863) (petitioner who held life estate with wife and acquired remainder interests in five-sixths of property could not partition property; \u201c[a]s tenant for life he cannot ask it, because he is in lawful possession and has the pernancy of the rents and profits of the entire estate[, and] as grantee of the remainder in fee . . . he cannot have it, because ... a petition for partition shall not be maintained by one who has only an estate in remainder or reversion\u201d). Cf. <em>Bernat </em>v. <em>Kivior, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 957, 959 (1986) (\u201cThe holder of a remainder interest only may not maintain partition proceedings\u201d). Cf. also <em>Beech </em>v. <em>Beech, 74 </em>P.3d 1, 3-5 (Colo. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In any event, that the wife could have pursued a partition as an owner of a one-fifth interest in the property as a tenant in common with the children does not guarantee that the wife would have been able to obtain sole possession of the house by purchasing the children\u2019s shares, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>or that she would even have been able to remain in the house. See note 23, <em>supra. </em>In fact, unless the house can be partitioned in kind, which seems doubtful, it will have to be sold. See notes 2, 3, &amp; 23, <em>supra. </em>That the wife anticipated the sale of the house is buttressed by the fact that she not only petitioned for partition, but she also moved for the appointment of a commissioner and an order directing that the property be sold. In sum, while not relinquishing her one-fifth ownership interest in the house, the wife, by seeking to partition the property, has demonstrated her willingness to give up her \u201cright to remain\u201d there \u201cfor so long as she desires.\u201d Cf. Alperin &amp; Shubow, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 17.13, at 580 (defeasible fee may be created by language indicating duration, e.g., \u201cas long as\u201d; \u201cwhen the specified state of affairs ceases to exist or the specified event occurs, the estate expires by operation of law\u201d). We thus conclude that, in the unique circumstances of this case, the wife has terminated her protection against partition.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The testator\u2019s will devised to the wife and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>each of the four children one-fifth ownership of the house as tenants in common. Through the \u201cright to remain\u201d language, the will also granted the wife protection against partition. In the particular circumstances of this case, however, the wife terminated that protection by seeking a partition. The judgment of the Probate and Family Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings and a declaration of the parties\u2019 rights consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> General Laws c. 241, \u00a7 14, provides: \u201cIf a part of the land cannot be divided without great inconvenience to the owners, or is of greater value than the share of any party, or if all the land cannot be divided without such inconvenience, the whole or any part thereof may be set off to any one or more of the parties, with his or their consent, upon payment by him or them to any one or more of the others of such amounts of money as the commissioners award to make the partition just and equal.\u201d See <em>King </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>11 Gray 490, 491-492 (1858) (to whom property should be set off depends on circumstances of parties \u2014 divestment of estate may be more injurious to one cotenant than another; one may be willing to pay more than appraised value).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> General Laws c. 241, \u00a7 31, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIn partition proceedings the court may order the commissioners to sell and convey the whole or any part of the land which cannot be divided advantageously, upon such terms and conditions and with such securities for the proceeds of the sale as the court may order, and to distribute the proceeds so as to make the partition just and equal....

Whether the house here can be divided in kind has not yet been litigated, as the Probate and Family Court judge noted when she denied without prejudice the wife\u2019s motion for appointment of a commissioner and for an order to sell the property at a private sale. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>We note, however, that physical partition of a single-family house has often been considered impossible. See, e.g., <em>DeRosa </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>22 Conn. App. 114, 115 (1990) (single-family house and lot \u201cobviously impossible physically to divide\u201d); <em>Fain </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>478 S.W.2d 816, 821 (Tex. Ct.

See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Meeker County Abstract &amp; Loan Co., </em>128 Minn. 207, 208-209, 212-213 (1915) (two-story commercial building with physically divided offices could be partitioned despite cotenant\u2019s right of occupancy); <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>208 S.W.2d 598, 602-603, 607 (Tex.
