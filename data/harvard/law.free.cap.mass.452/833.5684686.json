A judge in the Housing Court concluded that Bridge-waters had violated a provision of his lease by \u201ccommitting a crime on the public housing development grounds that threatened the health and safety of another resident.\u201d Bridgewaters appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Bridgewaters, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 757, 768 (2007). We granted his application for further appellate review limited to his claim for a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Bridgewaters has a mental disability. Central to this appeal is his assertion that the BHA failed to explore the feasibility of a reasonable accommodation of his disability before concluding that continuation of his tenancy would constitute a threat to the safety of other tenants. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(9) (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bridgewaters also asserts that the judge erred in concluding that he failed at trial to raise a request for a reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">Before a public housing authority may conclude that a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>abled tenant poses \u201ca significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\" 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131(b) (2008), the authority \u201cmust make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131(c) (2008). We conclude that, in this case, the public housing authority was on notice prior to trial that Bridgewaters was disabled. We further conclude that, at trial, Bridgewaters raised both his disability and a request for a reasonable accommodation. In these circumstances, the failure of the BHA to make the individualized assessment described above before concluding that Bridgewaters posed a threat to others was error. We vacate the judgment of the Housing Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>On March 22, 2004, the BHA brought an eviction action against Bridgewaters by filing a summary process complaint in the Housing Court. The BHA claimed that Bridgewaters had caused serious physical harm to another tenant, his twin brother. Trial commenced and was concluded on April 22, 2004. On May 17, 2004, the judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered judgment for possession for the BHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Bridgewaters, now represented by counsel, moved for reconsideration and for relief from judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 59, 365 Mass. 827 (1974), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>365 Mass. 828 (1974). The judge treated the motion as one under rule 59, and denied it, concluding that a reasonable accommodation request had not been raised at trial, and that, because Bridgewaters \u201ctook [a] guilty plea to violent activity, no reasonable accommodation [would] be required,\u201d citing <em>Peabody Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>418 Mass. 603 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Bridgewaters filed a notice of appeal, together with motions to waive the appeal bond and costs, and to stay execution pending appeal. One week later, he moved in the Housing Court for relief from the judgment under rule 60 (b). After a hearing, the judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Bridgewaters appealed to a single justice of the Appeals Court for a stay of execution pending appeal. The stay was granted, subject to Bridgewaters\u2019s continued treatment for his disability and compliance with the terms of his lease with the BHA. The Appeals Court then affirmed the judgment and the Housing Court judge\u2019s orders denying the postjudgment motions, concluding that \u201can individual who engages in conduct that violates a housing authority\u2019s rules and that is significantly inimical to an authority\u2019s obligation to provide a physically safe environment for its tenants is not a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019 entitled to an authority\u2019s general obligation to provide reasonable accommodations for its handicapped tenants,\u201d and that, \u201c[u]nder that standard,\u201d Bridgewaters was not a qualified handicapped person. <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Bridgewaters, supra </em>at 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">2. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the judge, supplemented by undisputed facts of record and uncontested affidavits and exhibits considered by the judge in Bridge-waters\u2019s posttrial motions. The BHA owns and operates Holgate Apartments, a federally assisted residential complex for the elderly and the disabled, where Bridgewaters resides. His twin brother, Eric, also resided at Holgate, in a different apartment. In the late evening of January 9 or the early morning of January 10, 2004, Bridgewaters assaulted Eric, inside Eric\u2019s apartment. As a result of the altercation, Eric, who was paralyzed on the left side of his body due to a stroke he suffered as a child, sustained severe injuries and temporary paralysis in his right leg.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>sault, the BHA brought this action; the BHA had not previously attempted to terminate Bridgewaters\u2019s tenancy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">During the trial, Bridgewaters, who was not represented by counsel, testified that he had not initiated the assault, that he had punched his brother once, and that had thrown water at him. Bridgewaters also testified that he suffers from a mental disability, which he termed manic depression or bipolar disorder. He stated that he had been prescribed medication, but that he was unmedicated at the time of the assault on the advice of his physician. Bridgewaters also testified that, after the altercation, he had received treatment for his disability and is \u201cin a better situation today\u201d than he was at the time of the assault. The BHA offered no evidence to refute Bridgewaters\u2019s testimony about his course of medication or his treatment for disability. The BHA, however, did state that it would not reevaluate its decision to evict Bridgewaters: counsel asserted that the BHA was \u201cnot interested in preserving this tenancy\u201d and was \u201cnot interested in any sort of mediation [because] of the severity of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">In support of his posttrial motion, Bridgewaters submitted affidavits and exhibits that elaborated on his trial testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These materials indicate that Bridgewaters had been determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration and unable to support himself, and that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time of the assault, his medication had been suspended because it caused negative side effects, and he had recently transitioned from his therapist of five years to a new therapist. The only treatment he was receiving for his disabilities at the time of the assault was a weekly psychotherapy session. The documents further disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>that, after the assault, Bridgewaters was hospitalized as an inpatient in a mental health facility for three weeks, from which he was discharged to the community after his caregivers determined that he was safe to return with adequate support. Finally, the documents disclosed that Bridgewaters was under the care of a physician and a social worker. Both submitted letters stating that Bridgewaters was determined to control his mental illness and that he was receiving appropriate medication and treatment to stabilize his condition. Bridgewaters also submitted a letter from his brother, Eric, stating that the brothers had reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">We reserve for later discussion facts related to whether the judge should have considered Bridgewaters\u2019s disability-based defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Because the issue whether Bridgewaters made a reasonable accommodation request arises meaningfully only if the BHA is obligated to entertain his request, we first address whether Bridgewaters\u2019s misconduct foreclosed consideration of any reasonable accommodation request.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">a. <em>The \u201cdirect threat\u201d exception. </em>Much of this case turns on what is known as the \u201cdirect threat\u201d exception to a public housing authority\u2019s ordinary obligation to accommodate tenants with disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(9) (2000).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The exception is incorporated in both the Federal regulatory scheme that governs federally assisted public housing authorities, such as the BHA, and in the BHA\u2019s own policies. We begin with the Federal scheme, which is expressed in both the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601 et seq. (2000), and regulations promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 24 C.F.R. Part 9 (2008).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In 1988, Congress enacted the FHAA, making it unlawful to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>\u201cdiscriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of . . . that buyer or renter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To address concerns that passage of the FHAA would prevent landlords from evicting handicapped tenants who posed a threat to others, the House Judiciary Committee Report<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> explains that a handicapped tenant would not qualify for protection if \u201che or she would pose a threat to the safety of others, unless such threat can be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 100-711, 28 (1988), 1988 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2173, 2189. See note 15, <em>infra. </em>The House rejected a more sweeping provision than the one referenced in the House Report, which would have excluded \u201ca category of individuals with disabilities from the [antidiscrimination] protections of the [FHAA].\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 100-711, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">HUD subsequently promulgated regulations<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> establishing procedures for public housing authorities to follow in order to determine whether a disabled tenant poses a direct threat to others, such that a reasonable accommodation is not warranted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>procedures mandate that, after a disabled tenant requests a reasonable accommodation and prior to terminating a lease, federally assisted housing authorities such as the BHA must conduct an individualized, fact-specific, and objective inquiry into whether an accommodation can mitigate the risk to other tenants. HUD defines \u201c[djirect threat\u201d as \u201ca significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131(b). Furthermore, where a disabled tenant has requested a reasonable accommodation, HUD regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">\u201cIn determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the agency <em>must </em>make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. </em>v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 86 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>The directive of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131 to consider objectively and specifically whether a reasonable accommodation will sufficiently mitigate the risk posed by the continued tenancy of a disabled person is not optional. In drafting \u00a7 9.131, HUD stated in response to public comments that \u201c[tjhis new section provides that the agency <em>must </em>determine whether reasonable modifications of its policies, practices or procedures will mitigate the risk posed by the individual determined to present a direct threat to the health or safety of others\u201d (emphasis added). 59 Fed. Reg. 31,036, 31,041 (1994).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Thus, \u00a7 9.131 does not prevent a public housing authority from evicting a disabled tenant where the landlord can demonstrate that no accommodation is available that would protect the health or safety of other tenants. It does not require automatic accommodation of tenants who would harm other residents. It does, however, require a public housing authority to assess individually whether, given a proposed request for a reasonable accommodation, a disabled tenant poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Accordingly, before a federally assisted public housing authority such as the BHA may lawfully evict a disabled tenant who requests a reasonable accommodation as posing a threat to others, it must either demonstrate the failure of an accommodation instituted at the request of the tenant, or demonstrate that no reasonable accommodation will acceptably minimize the risk the tenant poses to other residents. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Housing Auth. of Boulder, </em>909 F. Supp. 814, 822-823 (D. Colo. 1995) (\u201cassuming Roe is handicapped or disabled, before he may lawfully be evicted [the housing authority] must demonstrate that no \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 will eliminate or acceptably minimize any risk Roe poses to other residents\u2019\u2019); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Sugar River Mills Assocs., </em>820 F. Supp. 636, 640 (D.N.H. 1993) (\u201cassuming plaintiff is handicapped, the Act requires defendants to demonstrate that no \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 will eliminate or acceptably minimize the risk he poses to other residents before they may lawfully evict him\u201d); <em>Arnold Murray Constr. </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>621 N.W.2d 171, 175, 176 (S.D. 2001) (eviction affirmed where court held landlord had \u201cestablished that no reasonable accommodation would curb the threat [the tenant] poses,\u201d and concluding that when \u201clandlord shows that no reasonable accommodation will curtail the risk, its duty to accommodate ceases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Cornwell &amp; Taylor LLP <em>vs. </em>Moore, Minnesota Court of Appeals, No. C8-00-1000 (Dec. 22, 2000), is instructive. In that case, a landlord subject to the requirements of the FHAA attempted to evict a tenant with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder. After the tenant stopped taking his medication, he entered a delusional state, hit and choked his wife, and then took a loaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>rifle to a public park, where he was arrested. Subsequent to his arrest, the tenant received treatment as an inpatient at a psychiatric facility, and received new medication that reduced his symptoms. His landlord nevertheless commenced eviction proceedings. The tenant stated that medication could control his condition as it had in the past, and requested a reasonable accommodation. The court concluded that once a reasonable accommodation had been requested, \u201cthe burden is on the landlord\u201d to \u201cdemonstrate that no reasonable accommodation will eliminate or acceptably minimize any risk\u201d that tenant \u201cimposes on other residents.\u201d See <em>West Orange </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>8 F. Supp. 2d 408, 428 (D.N.J. 1998) (describing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604[f][9] direct threat exception as \u201can affirmative defense available to landlords\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Echoing the Federal regulatory framework, the BHA\u2019s reasonable accommodation in housing policy and procedures (reasonable accommodation policy) also prohibits it from summarily concluding, after a reasonable accommodation request has been raised and before an individualized assessment of a disabled tenant has been conducted, that no accommodation will sufficiently reduce the risk of harm. The reasonable accommodation policy provides, among other things, that a conclusion that a disabled tenant poses a direct threat to others \u201cshould be founded on a history of actions by an applicant or resident, provided that there have not been changes in the meantime which make it likely that such actions would not recur. Also, if a reasonable accommodation could eliminate or sufficiently reduce the risk to health or safety, that accommodation must be provided.\u201d The reasonable accommodation policy also acknowledges that the BHA bears the burden of showing that no accommodation is reasonable: \u201cif it can be shown that no reasonable accommodation is possible to lessen the risk of harm, then no accommodation is necessary.\u201d Where not contradicted by the FHAA and HUD regulations, the BHA is bound by its own procedures. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In short, the FHAA, HUD regulations, and the BHA\u2019s own policies make clear that the BHA cannot satisfy its requirement to explore reasonable accommodation for a disabled tenant who has committed an act of violence by summarily concluding, as the BHA\u2019s counsel stated to the judge, \u201c[FjranUy your Honor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>we\u2019re not interested in preserving this tenancy.\u201d The FHAA, HUD regulations, and the BHA\u2019s own policies demand a more stringent inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We turn now to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">b. <em>Reasonable accommodation request. </em>Because the BHA\u2019s obligation to assess individually whether Bridgewaters posed a threat to the health or safety of others turns on whether Bridge-waters requested a reasonable accommodation, we now address whether the BHA knew that Bridgewaters was disabled and whether he made a request for a reasonable accommodation, leaving for later discussion the BHA\u2019s claim that no causal link existed between Bridgewaters\u2019s disability and the assault on his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">As a predicate to obtaining a reasonable accommodation in federally financed public housing, a disabled tenant must, if his landlord is not already aware, inform the landlord that he has a disability and must request some accommodation. Cf. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>LePage Bakeries, Inc., </em>244 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir. 2001) (employee must make employer \u201csufficiently aware that she had a disability . . . and consequently needed some sort of <em>special </em>accommodation\u201d [emphasis in original]). We have held that, if a tenant informs a \u201clandlord that the tenant is a qualified handicapped person, and that the tenant is currently being denied an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling,\u201d the tenant has requested an accommodation. <em>Andover Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Shkolnik, </em>443 Mass. 300, 313 (2005). The BHA argues that Bridgewaters did not raise his disability or request a reasonable accommodation at trial. It also claims that there is no evidence that Bridge-waters is disabled, and that it was unaware that Bridgewaters was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">We reject the BHA\u2019s assertion that Bridgewaters is not disabled under State and Federal disability law. Bridgewaters receives Federal disability benefits, which evidences that the Social Security Administration has determined that he has \u201can inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d by reason of his physical or mental impairment because \u201che is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (2000). HUD regulations define an individual with a handicap as \u201cany person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.3 (2008). \u201cWorking\u201d is one of several \u201c[mjajor life activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See Wiesner vs. 321 W. 16th St. Assocs., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 00-Civ.-1423 (RWS) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2000) (\u201c[tenant], who suffers from a psychological illness and is entitled to Social Security Disability Income payments, is deemed to be a disabled individual within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act\u201d). A 2004 joint statement of HUD and the United States Department of Justice (joint statement), see note 16, <em>supra, </em>informs that \u201c[p]ersons who meet the definition of disability for purposes of receiving . . . Social Security Disability Insurance . . . benefits in most cases meet the definition of disability under the Fair Housing Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We also reject the BHA\u2019s assertion that it did not know that Bridgewaters was a disabled person who might require a special accommodation. Several weeks before trial, the Housing Court referred Bridgewaters to the Boston Tenancy Preservation Project (TPP), a \u201ccooperative effort\u201d between the Housing Court and private nonprofit agencies that assists tenants \u201cwhose mental illness . . . may be jeopardizing their tenancies.\u201d Annual Report on the State of the Massachusetts Court System, Fiscal Year 2003, at 16 (Feb. 14, 2004). Before trial TPP contacted the BHA regarding Bridgewaters. Even if the BHA was \u201cnot interested\u201d in mediation, as its counsel stated at trial,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it certainly was on notice that it was dealing with a tenant with a mental disability. In addition, the BHA must have been aware that Bridge-waters was the recipient of Social Security disability benefits because it was annually required to recertify Bridgewaters\u2019s income. The BHA also screened Bridgewaters for tenancy eligibility in an apartment complex that the BHA itself represents as \u201cdesignated as housing for elderly and disabled persons.\u201d Bridge-waters is not elderly; he was thirty-nine years old at the time of the assault. Taken together, these facts were more than sufficient to put the BHA on notice of Bridgewaters\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Although the BHA was on notice that Bridgewaters was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>abled, when it commenced eviction proceedings against him it did not apprise Bridgewaters of his rights as a disabled tenant. On February 10, 2004, the BHA served Bridgewaters with a notice of termination that did not include his right to request a reasonable accommodation or provide instructions on how to make such a request, as required by the lease and the BHA\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Even though Bridgewaters had not been fully apprised of his disability-related rights, at trial Bridgewaters did make the judge aware of his disability, testifying about his mental disability, the cessation in treatment at the time of the assault on his brother, and his subsequent treatment program. Bridgewaters did dispute that he had assaulted his brother, but he also argued: \u201cI take full responsibility to a certain degree for my actions. ... I was not on my medication.\u201d He was explicit about his mental disability (\u201cI have a disability in which I suffer from bipolar and I\u2019m manic depressive\u201d) and testified that the assault occurred after his doctor suspended his medication due to negative side effects (\u201c[A]t the time [my doctor] did not have me on my medication. I was taking [Depakote] but I was taken off of it\u201d), and that he was currently receiving effective treatment (\u201c[B]ut I can honestly say that I am in a better situation today than what I was on the [day of the assault], . . . I\u2019m taking Topamax, I\u2019m taking Seroquel\u201d). The judge acknowledged Bridgewaters\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>on this point,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but his decision made no reference to it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>\u201cWhere a resident faces eviction proceedings because of a lease violation(s) and the lease violation(s) is related to a disability, he or she shall be advised by management of the right to request reasonable accommodation. Both the <em>Notice of Private Conference </em>and <em>Notice of Termination/Notice to Quit </em>sent to residents shall set forth the basis for the proposed lease termination, and shall state that if the resident or a household member has a disability, he or she has the right to request reasonable accommodation to enable compliance with the lease on forms available at the development management office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>At trial, Bridgewaters also fulfilled the second requirement of a reasonable accommodation request by apprising the judge of his need for an accommodation. By opposing his eviction, asking to remain in his apartment, and stating that he was being successfully treated for his disabilities, Bridgewaters indicated that the relief he sought was that the BHA depart from its policy of evicting tenants for engaging in a violent act,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and reinstate his tenancy. Combined with Bridgewaters\u2019s assertions at trial that he was mentally disabled and had been successfully treated following the assault, this amounted to a request for an accommodation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">To make a reasonable accommodation request, no \u201cmagic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>words are required. The joint statement resolved that, under the FHAA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">\u201c[A disabled resident or an applicant for housing] makes a reasonable accommodation request whenever she makes clear to the housing provider that she is requesting an exception, change, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service because of her disability .... An <em>individual making a reasonable accommodation request does not need to mention the Act or use the words \u2018reasonable accommodation. </em>\u2019 However, the requester must make the request in a manner that a reasonable person could understand to be a request for an exception, change, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service because of a disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Cf. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Phoenixville Sch. Dist., </em>184 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 1999) (where employee became psychotic at work due to her bipolar condition, and employer knew she had been hospitalized for three weeks for her condition, employer was on notice that employee had disability, and it was only necessary that employer be informed that employee needed accommodation); 5 Emp. Coordinator \u00a7 9:55, at 9-66 (West 2008) (\u201cThe employee need not use the phrase \u2018reasonable accommodation,\u2019 or make the request in writing. It is enough that the employee communicate the need in plain English that he or she has a disability and wants assistance for it\u201d). Bridgewaters\u2019s request to remain in his apartment should have set in motion the fact-specific, objective inquiry we have outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">c. <em>The nexus requirement. </em>Under the FHAA, a refusal reasonably to accommodate a disabled tenant is discriminatory when \u201csuch accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B). In other words, a reasonable accommodation is required where there is a causal link between the disability for which the accommodation is requested and the misconduct that is the subject of the eviction or other challenged action. The BHA claims that Bridgewaters has not established a nexus or causal link between his disability and the assault on his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Although the relationship between Bridgewaters\u2019s disabilities and his acts is clearly implicit in his repeated assertions at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>that he was not on any medication at the time, the BHA is correct that Bridgewaters did not expressly establish a causal link between his mental disability and the violent assault on his brother that occurred when he was not medicated. This does not end the inquiry. The BHA\u2019s reasonable accommodation policy provides that \u201c[u]nless the BHA can identify specific reasons for doing otherwise, the BHA should accept . . . that the accommodation is related to disability.\u201d That policy also provides that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances shall the BHA deny a request for reasonable accommodation based on a lack of sufficient information without first informing the applicant of its need for additional information.\u201d The BHA has not identified specific reasons for refusing to accept that the accommodation is related to Bridgewaters\u2019s disability,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> nor has it requested additional information about Bridgewaters\u2019s disability. The reasonable accommodation policy, incorporated into Bridgewaters\u2019s lease with the BHA, and the BHA\u2019s failure to follow that policy foreclose it from denying that there is a causal link between Bridgewaters\u2019s disability and his acts that triggered the eviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The case <em>Peabody Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>418 Mass. 603 (1994) <em>(Sherman), </em>on which the BHA relies, does not compel a different result. In that case a tenant was engaged in illegal drug activity when proceedings to terminate his lease were commenced. Illegal drug activity in which a tenant is engaged is the FHAA\u2019s sole exclusion from the definition of handicap. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602(h) (\u201c[the term \u2018handicap\u2019] does not include current, illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance\u201d). This case does not involve illegal drug activity. Moreover, in <em>Sherman, </em>the offending conduct was ongoing and \u201ccurrent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606-607. Here, Bridgewaters established, and the BHA does not challenge, that his violent conduct was limited to one serious assault that occurred after his doctor had directed him to suspend his medication for his bipolar disorder. The direct threat exception and attendant regulations apply directly to circumstances such as these.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Bridgewaters\u2019s twin brother has the right to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>safe and secure in his home, as do all tenants of public housing. We do not minimize the severity of the attack on him. However, the law mandates that, before a public housing authority may terminate the lease of a disabled tenant such as Bridgewaters because he poses \u201ca significant risk to the health or safety of others\u201d that cannot be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131(b), the housing authority \u201cmust make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.131(c).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>such individualized assessment has taken place in this case as it must.
