Ciampi, commenced an action in the nature of certiorari, G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, against the defendants challenging the validity of the Department of Correction\u2019s (department\u2019s) regulations and substance abuse policy that allow it to withdraw funds from a prisoner\u2019s savings and personal account to satisfy a restitution sanction in a disciplinary action. In his complaint he alleged, inter alla, that the seizure of his account violated his State and Federal constitutional rights, and he sought declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A and damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). A Superior Court judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment, concluding, inter alla, that the department lacked the statutory authority to promulgate regulations authorizing the withdrawal of money from an inmate\u2019s account as restitution. The defendants appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. Because we conclude that restitution as a disciplinary sanction is a part of the Commissioner of Correction\u2019s (commissioner\u2019s) broad grant of statutory authority to maintain prison discipline and that withdrawing funds from the plaintiff\u2019s account to satisfy a restitution sanction did not violate any statutorily protected property interest he may have had, we reverse the order granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and grant summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\"><em>Background. </em>The material facts are not in dispute, thus we present them in summary form, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues. On September 13, 2002, a correction officer searched the plaintiff\u2019s cell and found a bottle of \u201chome brew.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the plaintiff was served with a disciplinary report and was told that if he was found guilty, he might be given a restitution order in the amount of $144 to cover the costs of twelve months of mandated testing for controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">On the same day, a urine test administered to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tested positive for alcohol, resulting in a second disciplinary report. The plaintiff was notified that a disciplinary hearing for the offenses charged in both reports would be held on September 27, 2002, given a copy of the confirmatory screen results from the laboratory, and given two notices regarding restitution to cover the costs of periodic substance abuse testing and of the urine test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">After a process consisting of a disciplinary hearing and an appeal, several sanctions were imposed on the plaintiff, including paying $144 in restitution. The money was withdrawn from his prison account by the department on October 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In granting summary judgment for the plaintiff, the judge found that pursuant to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 48A, the plaintiff had a protected property interest in the monies in his account. Relying on Welsh vs. Department of Correction, Middlesex Superior Court, No. 2000-4998F (April 9, 2001), a case concerning a deduction from an inmate\u2019s account to cover the cost of a deoxyribonucleic acid assessment, the judge concluded that the department exceeded the statutory authority of G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33, in promulgating regulations that allowed the defendants to withdraw money from the plaintiff\u2019s account to satisfy a restitution sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. General Laws c. 124, \u00a7 1, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\u201cIn addition to exercising the powers and performing the duties which are otherwise given him by law, the commissioner of correction . . . shall <em>...(b) </em>maintain security, safety and order at all state correctional facilities . . . <em>(i) </em>investigate grievances and inquire into alleged misconduct within state correctional facilities; <em>. . . (q) </em>make and promulgate necessary rules and regulations incident to the exercise of his powers and the performance of his duties including but not limited to rules and regulations regarding . . . safety, <em>discipline . . . </em>and custody for all persons committed to correctional facilities\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 33, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cThe superintendents of all institutions under the jurisdiction of the department of correction and the superintendents and keepers of jails and houses of correction shall cause <em>all necessary means to be used to maintain order </em>in the institutions under their supervision, [and] <em>enforce obedience . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The defendants argue that regulations and policies were properly promulgated pursuant to these statutory provisions. The regulations expressly authorize restitution as a sanction in disciplinary proceedings. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.09,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 430.25 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the superintendent is allowed to deduct from or impound an inmate\u2019s account to satisfy a restitution sanction imposed by a disciplinary proceeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 405.17 (1999).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, an internal substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>abuse policy establishes guidelines for department staff using restitution as a disciplinary sanction. 103 DOC \u00a7 525 (2001).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The plaintiff contends that the commissioner exceeded her authority pursuant to G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), (i), </em>and <em>(q), </em>and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33, in enacting the regulations authorizing debiting accounts for restitution. \u201cA highly deferential standard of review governs a facial challenge to regulations promulgated by a government agency.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002). \u201c[A] properly promulgated regulation has the force of law . . . and must be accorded all the deference due to a statute (citation omitted).\u201d <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 723, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). Although deference does not mean abdication, <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Water Resources Auth., </em>421 Mass. 463, 468 (1995) (\u201cregulation that is irreconcilable with an agency\u2019s enabling legislation cannot stand\u201d), it requires that we \u201capply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). See <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 596 (1992) (enforcement of regulations should be refused only if they are \u201cplainly in excess of legislative power\u201d). A party challenging a regulation bears the burden of proving that the regulation is \u201cillegal, arbitrary, or capricious.\u201d <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The plaintiff acknowledges that G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (b), and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33, \u201cgive the [commissioner the power to maintain security, safety and order in jails\u201d; that G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (/), \u201cgives the [cjommissioner the power to investigate grievances and inquire into alleged misconduct\u201d; and that G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (q), \u201cdoes contain a general provision of authority to the [department.\u201d However, he contends that the \u201cgeneral grant of authority does not give the [c]ommissioner the power to promulgate regulations authorizing [the debiting of] money from inmate accounts as restitution,\u201d because an agency may not use a broad interpretation of a statute where the legislative intent of that statute is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The plaintiff argues that, because the Legislature has specifically enumerated in what circumstances the department is authorized to make deductions from an inmate\u2019s account, the Legislative intent is clear. He cites G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (r) (authorizing commissioner to deduct money from inmate\u2019s account for haircuts); G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 16A (authorizing commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations for reimbursement of medical expenses by persons in prerelease facilities); G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 48 (authorizing commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations for \u201chours, conditions of employment, wage rates . . . and deductions from said wages pursuant to the provisions of [G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 86F]\u201d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 48A (superintendent may expend one-half of money earned by inmate for \u201carticles for the use of the inmate\u201d and may expend on inmate\u2019s written request \u201cexpenses related to family illness or death, legal defense, provision of essential articles of personal use\u201d), to support his argument that because restitution as a disciplinary sanction is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>part of this list of deductions it should not be permitted by resorting to \u201ccatchall statutes,\u201d citing G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>(/), and <em>(q), </em>or broad general grants of authority. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Each of the challenged regulations and policy is entirely within the commissioner\u2019s broad grant of authority, under G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(q), </em>to maintain prison discipline and is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent. When the Legislature vests an agency with \u201cbroad authority to effectuate the purposes of an act \u2018the validity of a regulation promulgated thereunder will be sustained so long as it is \u201creasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 524 (1979), quoting <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). The commissioner stated in an affidavit that restitution is an \u201cessential disciplinary tool\u201d that serves several penological functions such as protecting the staff, deterring future misconduct, and holding an inmate accountable for his actions. Because maintaining internal security within a correctional facility is \u201ccentral to all other corrections goals,\u201d <em>Blackbum </em>v. <em>Snow, 771 </em>F.2d 556, 562 (1st Cir. 1985), quoting <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 527 (1984), the challenged policy and regulations that authorize restitution as a disciplinary sanction are reasonably related to the overarching goal of maintaining safety and discipline in prisons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>385 Mass. 421, 434 (1982), quoting <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979) (\u201cPrison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption ... of policies and practices that ... are needed to preserve internal order and discipline . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Moreover, \u201c[a]n express grant carries with it by implication all incidental authority required for the full and efficient exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of the power conferred.\u201d <em>New England Med. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 46, 52-53 (1981), quoting <em>Scannell </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 494, 501 (1949). Therefore, a regulation need not be \u201ctraced to specific words\u201d in a statute because \u201can agency\u2019s powers to promulgate regulations \u2018are shaped by its organic statute taken as a whole . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 770 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>373 Mass. 345, 354 (1977). See <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979) (\u201cregulation may be authorized even where it cannot be traced to specific statutory language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In any event, the fact that there is nothing in G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 (1) <em>(q), </em>that specifically authorizes the department to debit money from a prisoner\u2019s account is not dispositive. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>230 Mass. 236, 237 (1918) (maxim that expression of one thing is implied exclusion of other things \u201cis not conclusive of legislative intent, but is to be considered with regard to the object sought to be obtained by the entire legislation of which the subject-matter to which it relates is but a part\u201d). See also <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 484 (1980) (statutory expression of one thing is implied exclusion of other things omitted from statute not followed where it would frustrate general beneficial purpose of statute); <em>Forcier </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>329 Mass. 668, 671 (1953) (same). Here, the general purpose of G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>(/), and <em>(q), </em>and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33, is to maintain safety and discipline in correctional facilities. As discussed <em>supra, </em>restitution as a disciplinary sanction is an \u201cessential disciplinary tool\u201d that, if eliminated, would frustrate the commissioner\u2019s ability to carry out the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">2. The plaintiff next argues that \u201cthe seizure of funds from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>[his] inmate account violates his protected property interest.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Prison inmates \u201cmay not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974). However, the protections of procedural due process apply only if there is an existing liberty or property interest at stake. <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>415 Mass. 132, 135 (1993). We assume without deciding that, in the Commonwealth, prisoners have a statutorily protected property interest in the funds in their prison accounts entitling them to due process protection. See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 3 (\u201c[The department] shall keep a record of all money or other property found in possession of prisoners . . . and shall be responsible for the safekeeping and delivery [of property when the prisoners are discharged]\u201d). See also <em>Gillihan </em>v. <em>Shillinger, </em>872 F.2d 935, 938-939 (10th Cir. 1989) (statutes that create expectation that money not used will be returned to inmate at end of his incarceration create protected property interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">At a minimum, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that there be notice and an opportunity for a hearing before a person is deprived of a protected property interest. See <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>455 U.S. 422, 428, 434 (1982). In a disciplinary proceeding where a prisoner\u2019s liberty interest is at stake he must be given \u201c(1) advanced written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and to present evidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, supra </em>at 138, quoting <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst. at Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985) and citing <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 439, 563-567 (1974). Thus, a \u201cproperly conducted prison disciplinary hearing generally satisfies due process.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>607 F. Supp. 251, 256-257 (E.D. Pa. 1984). See <em>Ruley </em>v. <em>Prison Comm\u2019rs, </em>628 F. Supp. 108, 110 (D. Nev. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Here, before any deduction was made from the plaintiff\u2019s account, he received written advanced notice of the disciplinary hearing. At the disciplinary hearing itself, the plaintiff pleaded not guilty to the charges under the first disciplinary report and guilty to the charges under the second disciplinary report. During the hearing, he was allowed to make a statement, call witnesses, and present evidence in his defense. When he was found guilty of the charges, he was provided with a written statement from the hearing officer detailing the evidence the officer relied on and stating the reasons for the sanctions. On the first disciplinary report, the plaintiff received (1) loss of visits for one year; (2) loss of canteen privileges for one year; (3) loss of 200 days of statutory good time; and (4) restitution in the amount of $288. On the guilty plea on the second disciplinary report, he received thirty-days\u2019 isolation and restitution in the amount of $37.50 for the urine test.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the sanctions he received as a result of both disciplinary reports. The superintendent denied his appeal from the second disciplinary report, but granted his appeal from the first. As a result, the plaintiffs sanctions under the first disciplinary report were reduced to loss of visits and loss of canteen privileges for six months and $144 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In sum, the plaintiff received due process for the deprivation of his property through the disciplinary hearing and subsequent appeal; nothing more was required. See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, the grant of summary judgment is vacated and summary judgment shall enter for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\"> The plaintiff calls the substance \u201cfermented fruit juice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> The first notice stated that if he was found guilty at the hearing he might be given a restitution order in the amount of $288 to cover the cost for two years of periodic substance abuse testing.

Regs. \u00a7 430.09 (1995) states, in pertinent part, that where a disciplinary officer determines that restitution is an appropriate sanction, that officer must provide the inmate with an itemized list of damages or costs associated with the misconduct.

Moreover, in the <em>Cepulonis </em>case, cited by the dissent, <em>post </em>at 176 n.10, the court implicitly approved a restitution order of $10,774 when it stated that a fine has a remedial and a deterrent aspect. <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1998) (restitution order did not implicate double jeopardy clause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> The parties devote much time to discussing whether the judge, in granting summary judgment for the plaintiff, properly relied on Welsh <em>vs. </em>Department of Correction, Middlesex Superior Court, No. 2000-4998F (April 9, 2001), or whether, as the defendants contend, Cook vs. Marshall, Middlesex Superior Court, No. 2000-2830 (Oct. 17, 2001), was more apt. In the Welsh case, the judge concluded that the commissioner\u2019s general grant of authority pursuant to G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>{q), </em>does not encompass the authority to promulgate regulations authorizing deductions for deoxyribonucleic acid assessment fees without an inmate\u2019s consent because there is no statute expressly authorizing such a deduction.

I agree with the court that the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner) has broad authority to maintain security, safety, and order in State correctional facilities. <em>Ante </em>at 168. See G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33. I do not question that a prisoner\u2019s violation of the commissioner\u2019s substance abuse policy is serious, necessitating appropriate discipline. But the commissioner does not have the authority to seize funds from either a prisoner\u2019s savings or personal account as a sanction for any and all disciplinary offenses. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The authority of the commissioner to seize a prisoner\u2019s funds has been extensively regulated by the Legislature; numerous statutes have been enacted and amended establishing precisely for what purpose and from which source funds can be seized. See, e.g., G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 48, and 48A. Indeed, the Legislature has spoken explicitly regarding the commissioner\u2019s authority to withdraw funds from inmate accounts because of inmate misconduct. See G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (s) (authorizing commissioner to make \u201creasonable deductions\u201d from inmate\u2019s account to repay costs of medical treatment for injuries \u201cself-inflicted or inflicted by the inmate on others\u201d). The Legislature has not authorized the commissioner to withdraw funds from inmate accounts as restitution or punishment for disciplinary offenses generally. In view of the comprehensive statutory scheme that specifies in great detail, and circumscribes with particularity, the commissioner\u2019s authority to seize only specific funds for specific purposes from prisoner accounts, the commissioner\u2019s broad assertion of authority beyond the scope of those constraints is in derogation of legislative delegation and contrary to the expressed intent of the Legislature. See <em>Bureau of Old Age Assistance of Natick </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>326 Mass. 121, 124 (1950) (administrative officer has \u201cno authority\u201d to promulgate regulations that exceed authority conferred by Legislature).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The commissioner does not dispute that the Legislature has comprehensively regulated the circumstances in which he may withdraw funds from inmate accounts. Authority has been given to deduct funds from prisoner accounts for expenses ranging from the relatively trivial (for example, the cost of a haircut, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 [r])<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to payments for family and other compelling needs (see G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 48A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature has authorized the commissioner to deduct \u201creasonable fees for the maintenance and administration of inmate accounts.\u201d G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (m). It has authorized the commissioner to deduct \u201ca reasonable fee for any medical and mental health services provided, including prescriptions, medications, or prosthetic devices.\u201d G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 (s).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has regulated the access of prison officials to inmate accounts in other respects. General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 3, authorizes a superintendent of a correctional institution to transmit to a court \u201cany part or all of the monies earned or received by any inmate and held by the correctional facility\u201d in order to satisfy judicially imposed victim and witness assessments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature has authorized the commissioner to deduct funds from inmate earnings to satisfy a judicial order for the support of a spouse or child. See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 86F.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>commissioner has the authority, pursuant to G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(q), </em>to promulgate \u201cnecessary rules and regulations incident to the exercise of powers and the performance of his duties,\u201d nothing in that statute, or any other statute relevant to the Department of Correction\u2019s supervision and maintenance of prisons, authorizes the commissioner to seize money from a prisoner\u2019s account, at least not without the prisoner\u2019s consent, beyond the specific authorizations just described.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It is a settled canon of statutory construction that the \u201cstatutory expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute.\u201d <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975). Had the Legislature intended to authorize the commissioner to seize a prisoner\u2019s money to pay for drug testing imposed as restitution, or as a sanction for any other disciplinary offense, it would have said so expressly. Today the court turns a blind eye to the specific statutory authorizations to seize funds in prisoner accounts, concluding that to read these provisions as an implied exclusion of others would \u201cfrustrate\u201d the general purpose of G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33, to maintain safety and discipline in correctional facilities. <em>Ante </em>at 169. That reasoning is unpersuasive. First, it renders nugatory all of the statutory provisions that explicitly authorize the commissioner to withdraw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>funds from prisoner accounts in circumscribed circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Second, the claim of \u201cfrustration]\u201d is sweeping: the commissioner\u2019s broad assertion of authority is particularly troublesome where he has failed to articulate in any respect in what circumstances the costs he incurs in connection with discipline can be charged as restitution, or whether there is any limit on the amounts that may be imposed. Where it has authorized the seizure of funds, the Legislature has specified that the costs must be \u201creasonable.\u201d The court places no limit on the commissioner, leaving him free to impose costs however unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The commissioner may act only within the bounds of the authority conferred on him by the Legislature. See <em>Telles </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>410 Mass. 560, 564-565 (1991) (\u201ccommissioner may not issue a regulation which is in conflict with statutes which control his authority\u201d). He cannot, by regulation or otherwise, exceed the bounds of his authority. Where the Legislature has so comprehensively regulated the subject, the commissioner cannot \u201cfurther regulate [it] by the adoption of a regulation which is repugnant to the statute.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Med. Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 347 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson Wholesale Perfume Co., </em>304 Mass. 452, 457 (1939). We are informed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the commissioner has not challenged, that restitution has been imposed as a sanction in a wide range of circumstances, and for large sums of money. Funds have been seized from inmate accounts for the costs of transportation of an injured inmate to a hospital, as well as for staff overtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>salary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Commissioners have imposed substantial costs associated with locating, apprehending, and returning inmates who have escaped<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; costs related to drug testing; and the costs of assembling officers to quell a demonstration in an inmate\u2019s cell.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The commissioner does not suggest, and the court today does not impose, any limit on the commissioner\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d authority to deduct any amount, however unreasonable, for any reason, from an inmate\u2019s account. The court simply ignores the petitioner\u2019s substantive due process claim challenging the regulations that purport to give the commissioner that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Where the Legislature has spoken, and spoken with clarity, it is not for this court to substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature. If the commissioner has concluded that certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>costs related to disciplinary infractions \u2014 the costs of drug testing, for example \u2014 should be paid by an offending prisoner, the avenue for relief is clear. He should seek the authority to do so from the Legislature. There is no authority, judicial or otherwise, for the commissioner to bypass the constraints so carefully articulated by the Legislature.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-5\"> General Laws c. 124, \u00a7 1 (r), requires the commissioner to adopt policies and procedures establishing \u201creasonable\u201d fees for haircuts and permits him to deduct the fees from the inmates\u2019 accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 48A, permits a superintendent of a correctional institution, on an inmate\u2019s written request and in circumstances of \u201ccompelling need,\u201d to expend funds from the money the inmate has earned for \u201cexpenses related to family illness or death, legal defense, provision of essential articles of personal use or any other such circumstances of compelling need.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> General Laws c. 124, \u00a7 1 (.?), also provides that \u201can inmate shall not be refused medical treatment for financial reasons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\"> General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 3, provides that a superintendent of a correctional institution \u201cshall keep a record of all money or other property found in possession of prisoners committed to such institutions, and shall be responsible to the commonwealth for the safe keeping and delivery of said property to said prisoners or their order on their discharge or at any time before. The superintendents of correctional institutions of the commonwealth and the superintendents and keepers of jails, houses of correction and of all other penal or reformatory institutions shall, upon receipt of an outstanding victim and witness assessment, transmit to the court any part or all of the monies earned or received by any inmate and held by the correctional facility, except monies derived from interest earned upon said deposits and revenues generated by the sale or purchase of goods or services to persons in correctional facilities, to satisfy the victim witness assessment ordered by a court pursuant to [G. L. c. 258B, \u00a7 8]. Any monies derived from interest earned upon the deposit of such money and revenue generated by the sale or purchase of goods or services to persons in the correctional facilities may be expended for the general welfare of all the inmates at the discretion of the superintendent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\"> General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 48, directs the commissioner to establish educa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tian, employment, and training programs and to make provisions for deductions from wages earned in those programs \u201cpursuant to the provisions of [\u00a7 86F].\u201d General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 86F, in turn, provides for the establishment of county work release programs, and specifically authorizes a sheriff, except the sheriff of Suffolk County, to deduct funds from a participating inmate\u2019s earnings, inter alla, to satisfy victim and witness assessments or court orders for support of the inmate\u2019s spouse or children, to reimburse the county for the actual and necessary food, travel and other expenses when released for employment under the program, and, as voluntarily agreed, for family allotments and for personal necessities while confined. Section 86F provides that any balance of earnings \u201cshall be credited to the account of the inmate and shall be paid to him upon his final release.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\"> The Legislature\u2019s concern regarding access to inmate accounts is fine-tuned and ongoing. Thus, the provision in G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1, for haircut fees was added in 1999, see St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 132; for medical services, in 2000, see St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 228; and for account maintenance fees, in 2003, see St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7 367. The Legislature amended G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 3, in 1994 to permit a superintendent of a correctional institution to transmit an inmate\u2019s funds to courts to satisfy victim and witness assessments. See St. 1994, c. 60, \u00a7 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> We have not previously been asked to consider whether the commissioner may impose restitution as a disciplinary sanction. Contrary to today\u2019s holding, other courts considering the question have paid closer attention to the statutory scheme in place. See, e.g., <em>Longmire </em>v. <em>Guste, </em>921 F.2d 620, 623-624 (5th Cir. 1991) (upholding constitutionality of restitution for property damage and medical expenses where Louisiana statute allows for restitution from offender who, inter alla, \u201cdamages or destroys property\u201d or causes \u201cinjury to himself,\u201d see La.
