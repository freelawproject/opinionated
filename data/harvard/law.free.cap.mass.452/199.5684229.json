L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>to forfeit money connected to an illegal drug transaction, what is the appropriate disposition of the forfeited funds? In two separate cases, a judge in the District Court answered this question by ordering that the money be deposited in the Commonwealth\u2019s General Fund, rather than shared between the law enforcement trust funds of the prosecuting district attorney and police department involved in each underlying criminal case. The petitioners here \u2014 the district attorney for the northwestern district, the district attorney for the Hampden district, and the police department of the town of Had-ley (collectively, petitioners) \u2014 petitioned for relief from the judge\u2019s two orders. We agree with the petitioners that money ordered forfeited under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47, is properly directed to the prosecuting district attorney or Attorney General and the investigating police department, as specified in \u00a7 47 <em>id), </em>even when the forfeiture is sought and obtained in the District Court by means of a motion brought pursuant to \u00a7 47 <em>(b). </em>Accordingly, we vacate the judge\u2019s two orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">1. <em>Background </em>The petitions arise from two criminal prosecutions in the District Court Department, one in the Eastern Hampshire Division and one in the Springfield Division. In each case, the defendant pleaded guilty to (or admitted to facts sufficient to warrant conviction of) drug-related crimes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also in each case, the Commonwealth filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>for forfeiture of money that had been seized from the defendant and that, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Commonwealth alleged, was connected to the drug transactions that were the subjects of the criminal charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both motions were allowed (with no apparent opposition by the respective defendants), and in each case the judge ordered the forfeited monies to be distributed to the Commonwealth\u2019s General Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (\u00a7 47), governs the forfeiture of assets involved in or derived from violations of G. L. c. 94C, the Controlled Substances Act (Act). Section 47 <em>(a) </em>provides that \u201c[t]he following property shall be subject to forfeiture to the commonwealth and all property rights therein shall be in the commonwealth . . . .\u201d The section then lists eight separate categories of such property, including controlled substances and drug-manufacturing equipment, as well as conveyances (for example, automobiles, boats, and aircraft), money, and real estate involved in or acquired as a result of illegal narcotics transactions. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>(l)-(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Section 47 <em>(b) </em>provides that certain categories of property subject to forfeiture under \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>\u201cshall, upon motion of the attorney general or district attorney, be declared forfeit by any court having jurisdiction over said property or having final jurisdiction over any related criminal proceeding brought under any provision of this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 47 (\u00a3&gt;), however, contains no description of such a forfeiture proceeding. Thus, it contains no procedural guidelines, and, more importantly, it does not specify how the property shall be disposed of, apart from directing that controlled substances declared forfeit shall be destroyed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Like \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>\u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>also provides for the forfeiture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>certain categories of property listed in \u00a7 47 <em>(a), </em>albeit fewer than \u00a7 47 (\u00bf&gt;).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 47 <em>(d) </em>allows a district attorney or the Attorney General to \u201cpetition the superior court in the name of the commonwealth in the nature of a proceeding in rem to order forfeiture.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>first par. But unlike \u00a7 47 (b), \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>contains detailed procedural requirements, provisions for the sale of forfeited conveyances and real estate, and a mandate that \u201c[t]he final order of the court shall provide that said moneys and the proceeds of any such sale shall be distributed equally between the prosecuting district attorney or attorney general and the city, town or state police department involved in the seizure.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (d), first &amp; second pars. Section 47 <em>id) </em>then establishes law enforcement trust funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to receive these monies for each prosecutorial agency and police department and describes the purposes for which they may be expended. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>third &amp; fourth pars.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In denying the district attorneys\u2019 respective requests to deposit the forfeited money in the law enforcement trust funds described in \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>the judge reasoned that the Superior Court alone, in an in rem proceeding brought under \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>had authority to direct forfeited funds to the prosecutor and police. He concluded that the District Court, which only has jurisdiction to consider a motion for forfeiture brought under \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>must look to \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>to determine disposition of forfeiture proceeds. He further stated that \u00a7 47 (a)\u2019s declaration that enumerated property \u201cshall be subject to forfeiture <em>to the commonwealth </em>and all property rights therein shall be <em>in the </em>commonwealth\u201d (emphasis by judge) indicated that all forfeited money must be directed to the General Fund.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to the judge, when the Legislature amended \u00a7 47 in 1984 to allow the prosecutor and police to retain forfeited funds, it deliberately made that financial benefit available only in a separate, procedurally enhanced in rem action so as to \u201cmake certain [that] plea discussions would not involve law enforcement agencies receiving forfeited funds as a part of a sentencing agreement\u201d and to \u201cavoid even the appearance of impropriety, conflict of interest or a quid pro quo of asset surrenders for favorable prosecution recommendations.\u201d He therefore ordered that the monies forfeited by motion brought under \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>as part of the criminal prosecutions in the underlying cases, be deposited in the Commonwealth\u2019s General Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The petitioners filed petitions for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court, seeking orders to have the forfeited funds distributed not to the General Fund but instead to the law enforcement trust funds of the prosecutors and police departments involved in the two cases; the petitions respectively named as respondents the Eastern Hampshire District Court and the Springfield District Court (collectively, respondents).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>justice of this court allowed a motion of the respondents to consolidate the two petitions, and reserved and reported them to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>A survey of the relevant development of \u00a7 47 through legislative amendment and judicial interpretation informs our analysis of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In 1971, the Legislature enacted the Act, and included \u00a7 47 as part of the new statutory scheme. St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1. As originally enacted, \u00a7 47 (a) provided for forfeiture of four categories of property: (1) controlled substances; (2) \u201cmaterials, products and equipment . . . used ... in manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, dispensing, distributing, importing or exporting\u201d controlled substances in violation of the Act; (3) conveyances used to transport or otherwise facilitate illegal traffic in controlled substances; and (4) \u201cbooks, records and research\u201d used in violation of the Act. <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 47 (b), items described in the first, second, and fourth categories of \u00a7 47 (a) could be declared forfeit by any court with jurisdiction over the property or over a related criminal proceeding. <em>Id. </em>Items in the third category of \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>\u2014 conveyances \u2014 could only be declared forfeit under \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>by the Superior Court in an in rem proceeding involving procedural protections such as notice, hearing, and an appealable final order. <em>Id. </em>Section 47 <em>(d) </em>provided that the balance of proceeds from any sale of a forfeited conveyance, after payment of the expenses of the forfeiture proceeding and sale, \u201cshall be deposited in the treasury of the commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Although the legislative history of the Act fails to shed definitive light on the rationale underlying this bifurcation of forfeiture procedures, it seems reasonable to infer that \u00a7 47 (b) and <em>(d) </em>was originally formulated to fit the different characteristics of property forfeitable. It would make sense to enable illegal narcotics and the equipment and documentation necessary for manufacturing and distributing illegal narcotics to be declared forfeit as part of the disposition of the related criminal prosecution, in which they were likely to be used as evidence. No provision for distribution of the proceeds of such forfeitures was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>necessary, because illegal drugs were to be destroyed, and any associated equipment and documentation were not items that would likely produce revenue through sale. Forfeiture of vehicles and other conveyances, by contrast, might reasonably be considered to require the enhanced procedures outlined in \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>because the owner of the vehicle might in fact be someone other than the criminal defendant, and in any event, whether a vehicle was connected to the illegal drug transactions of its owner may be subject to legitimate dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>specifically provided for disposition of forfeited conveyances or the proceeds of their sales because vehicles, unlike narcotics and associated equipment, had resale value for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">However, while this rationale may explain the original separation of forfeiture proceedings in \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>and <em>(d), </em>subsequent amendments to \u00a7 47 soon inserted additional categories of property to the list of items that could be forfeited under \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>without ever adding any dispositional provisions to \u00a7 47 <em>(b). </em>Thus, in 1977, the Legislature amended \u00a7 47 to add monies involved in or derived from narcotics transactions to the list of property subject to forfeiture under \u00a7 47 <em>(a), </em>St. 1977, c. 556, \u00a7 1, and added reference to such monies to <em>both </em>\u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>and \u00a7 47 (&lt;f).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See St. 1977, c. 556, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3. Since 1977, then, \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>has allowed for forfeiture of property (money) having undoubted value to the Commonwealth, without making specific provision for its disposition. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>as amended by St. 1977, c. 556, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The amendment primarily at issue in this case was passed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>1984. See St. 1984, c. 486, \u00a7 2. It deleted the sentence in \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>providing for the balance of any forfeiture proceeds to be deposited in the treasury of the Commonwealth, and replaced it with an instruction that the proceeds should be divided equally between the prosecuting district attorney or Attorney General and the police department involved in the case, to be expended for law enforcement purposes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In 1986, this court considered a challenge to a forfeiture of money ordered pursuant to \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>as part of the criminal proceedings on the related indictments charging violation of the narcotics laws. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>398 Mass. 201, 201-202 (1986) <em>(Goldman). </em>The defendant in <em>Goldman </em>argued that forfeiture could not be effected as part of the criminal proceedings themselves, and that the Commonwealth was required to bring a separate proceeding under \u00a7 47 <em>(d). Id. </em>at 202. The court concluded that \u201cthe provision in \u00a7 47 <em>{b) </em>for the forfeiture of property on order of a judge has independent significance and permits a judge to enter a judgment of forfeiture without the Commonwealth first filing a petition under \u00a7 47 <em>{d).\u201d Id. </em>However, the court also held that \u201c[fundamental due process considerations entitle the defendant to a hearing on the question of the connection, if any, between his illegal drug operations and the funds seized,\u201d and directed that the \u00a7 47 <em>{b) </em>proceeding should adhere to the provisions of \u00a7 47 <em>{d) </em>regarding burden of proof, conclusions of law, and issuance of a final order. <em>Id. </em>at 204 &amp; n.5. The court thus imported some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>procedural protections of \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>to account for the fact that \u00a7 47 (b) now covered property \u2014 cash \u2014 in which a defendant might have a legitimate interest unrelated to illegal narcotics activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>426 Mass. 475 (1998) <em>(Brown), </em>this court again considered a challenge to an order forfeiting money under \u00a7 47 <em>{b) </em>as part of a related criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court reaffirmed the holding of <em>Goldman, supra, </em>that \u201c[although the Commonwealth initiated the proceeding by forfeiture motion filed pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>{b), </em>the applicable standards of proof are set forth in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>{d)C Brown, supra </em>at 477 n.3. However, while the court in <em>Brown </em>agreed with the defendant that he was entitled to notice in advance of the hearing on a forfeiture motion, it declined to import the \u201cmore onerous notice requirements\u201d of \u00a7 47 <em>{d), id. </em>at 480 n.5, and, characterizing the forfeiture proceeding under \u00a7 47 <em>{b) </em>as itself a \u201ccivil proceeding in rem,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 483, applied instead the notice requirements applicable by rule to motions filed in other civil proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 480 &amp; n.5. What <em>Goldman </em>and <em>Brown </em>thus establish is that forfeiture proceedings brought pursuant to motions under subsection <em>(b) </em>of \u00a7 47 are civil in nature and must provide certain procedural protections to the defendant, and that we look to \u00a7 47 <em>{d) </em>for many, but not all, of the applicable protective procedures.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In sum, the Legislature has amended \u00a7 47 over time to expand what can be forfeited under \u00a7 47 <em>{b) </em>without any addition of dispositional language, while at the same time changing, with great specificity, the dispositional provisions in \u00a7 47 <em>(d). </em>Mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>while, this court\u2019s opinions have held that forfeiture can certainly be ordered under \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>independently of \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>but have generally not dealt with the question of disposition. It is against this background that we consider the arguments made by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The petitioners argue that because this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Goldman </em>and <em>Brown, supra, </em>have grafted the procedural provisions of \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>(including the requirement of a \u201cfinal order\" deemed important by the District Court judge, see note 8, <em>supra), </em>onto \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>motion proceedings, we should also import the distributional provisions of \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>to govern \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>forfeitures. However, the court in <em>Brown, </em>in permitting more relaxed notice procedures under \u00a7 47 (b), explicitly declined to incorporate all of \u00a7 47 (d)\u2019s procedural provisions directly into \u00a7 47 <em>(b). Brown, </em>426 Mass, at 480 n.5. Moreover, the reasons that require the importation of some \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>procedures into \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>\u2014 namely, to provide due process protections in relation to assets in which a defendant in the criminal case could plausibly have a legitimate property interest \u2014 do not justify the importation of its distributional provisions as well. How the Commonwealth disposes of such assets once they have been declared forfeit in a proper proceeding has no bearing on the rights of the former owner; the logic of <em>Goldman </em>and <em>Brown </em>does not extend to \u00a7 47 <em>(d)\u2019s </em>provisions regarding distribution of forfeited property.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">However, the interpretation of the statute adopted by the judge and advanced here by the respondents is itself not convincing. As has been noted, the 1984 amendment to \u00a7 47 added the provision to \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>directing that forfeited monies or the proceeds from the sale of other forfeited property be divided between the prosecutor and the police department involved in the case. St. 1984, c. 486, \u00a7 2. The judge determined that the Legislature specifically intended to separate criminal prosecutions from related forfeiture proceedings in which the prosecutor stood to benefit financially in order to avoid unseemly conflict of interest issues on the part of the prosecutor. Our review of the available legislative history of this amendment reveals nothing that might serve as evidence of the intention the judge ascribed to the Legislature. Indeed, it seems equally plausible that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the Legislature amended \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>without amending \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>because only \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>contained the provision targeted for replacement, namely, the sentence directing proceeds to the State treasury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As for textual analysis, the judge\u2019s interpretation rests on the view that \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>is the key provision and that the language \u201call property rights [in forfeited items] shall be in the commonwealth\u201d indicates that forfeited property must be deposited in the General Fund. This construction misreads \u00a7 47 (a). Tracking, or at least analogous to, its Federal counterpart,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u00a7 47 (a) simply identifies the types of property that are subject to forfeiture; it says nothing with regard to disposition. Indeed, the interpretation urged by the judge and the respondents makes little sense, because it is difficult to see how many of the categories of forfeitable property listed under \u00a7 47 (a), such as, for example, drug-manufacturing equipment and records, or real estate, could have any relationship to the General Fund.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We are confronted, then, in \u00a7 47 <em>(b), </em>with a statute that over time has been amended to authorize a court to order a wide variety of property forfeited to the Commonwealth but, from the time of its original enactment, has never provided any direction as to the disposition of that property (with the exception of illegal narcotics). As already explained, it appears that the absence of any distributional provision in \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>may be an artifact of its original use solely for forfeiture of items that were likely to have no monetary value to the Commonwealth. Likewise, the Legislature\u2019s placement of the provision directing funds to the prosecutor and police only in \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>may reflect the fact that, because the only dispositional provisions in the statute were in \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>all changes to disposition have been changes to \u00a7 47 <em>(d). </em>In the absence of any indication that the Legislature intended different treatment of assets forfeited under \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>once it had been expanded to encompass items with residual value, we conclude that the Legislature intended that all assets forfeited pursuant to \u00a7 47 would be distributed according to the provisions outlined in \u00a7 47 (if).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Wherever possible, \u201cstatutes should be interpreted as a whole to constitute a consistent and harmonious provision.\u201d <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>389 Mass. 784, 788 (1983). \u201c[I]t is our task to construe the statute in such a way as to make it an effective piece of legislation, . . . and in that connection every phrase should be given some effect\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercy Hosp., </em>364 Mass. 515, 521 (1974). In this case, the sensible reading, as the legislative history and this court\u2019s prior decisions seem to support, is that \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>supplies the dispositional provisions for forfeitures under \u00a7 47, regardless whether the forfeiture is effected pursuant to \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>or \u00a7 47 (\u00bf&gt;).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The cases are remanded to the single justice to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>an order vacating the judge\u2019s orders directing that money forfeited under \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>be deposited in the General Fund as contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted in support of the petitioners by the district attorneys for the Suffolk, Essex, Northern, Norfolk, Berkshire, Plymouth, Cape and Islands, Middle, and Bristol districts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\"> The defendant in the Eastern Hampshire District Court case was charged with distribution of a Class D substance (subsequently amended to possession with intent to distribute a Class D substance), in violation of G.

The proceeds of any such sale shall be used to pay the reasonable expenses of the forfeiture proceedings, seizure, storage, maintenance of custody, advertising, and notice, and the balance thereof shall be distributed as further provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cThe final order of the court shall provide that said moneys and the proceeds of any such sale shall be distributed equally between the prosecuting district attorney or attorney general and the city, town or state police department involved in the seizure. If more than one department was substantially involved in the seizure, the court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceeding shall distribute the fifty percent equitably among these departments.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> The judge also concluded that \u00a7 47 <em>(d)\u2019s </em>mention of a \u201cfinal order of the court\u201d that shall provide for division of proceeds between the prosecutor and the police refers only to an in rem judgment of the Superior Court as described earlier in \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>and not to a ruling on a motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> The respondents concede that the issue raised by the petition is likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>recur, and they accordingly do not object to the exercise of our superintendence powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Indeed, the Legislature indicated its concern with these very possibilities by providing, in \u00a7 47 (c) (l)-(3), for various exceptions to the forfeiture of conveyances if the owner of the vehicle was not aware of or involved in its use for transporting narcotics. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (c), inserted by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> A 1977 letter from the then first assistant attorney general to the secretary and counsel for the House Committee on Ways and Means in support of the bill that became this amendment suggests that the Attorney General and the district attorneys were at that time reading the dispositional provisions in \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>as governing \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>forfeitures as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> Further expansion of the scope of \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>took place over the following years. In 1981, the Legislature added drug paraphernalia to \u00a7 47 <em>{a), </em>St. 1981, c. 669, \u00a7 3, and the following year it made the new category forfeitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>under \u00a7 47 (\u00a3&gt;). St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 17. As part of the 1984 amendment (see <em>infra), </em>the Legislature added real estate used in furtherance of illegal drug activity to the list of property subject to forfeiture under \u00a7 47 <em>(a). </em>G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 (a) (6A), as amended through St. 1984, c. 486, \u00a7 1. However, the Legislature did not at that time add reference to this new category of property to either \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>or \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>leaving it unclear what procedure, if any, could be invoked to declare real estate forfeit under \u00a7 47. Subsequently, in 1989, the Legislature expanded the category of forfeitable monies under \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>(5) to include real estate and other things of value purchased with proceeds traceable to an illegal narcotics transaction, St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 74, and added real estate to both \u00a7 47 <em>(b) </em>and \u00a7 47 <em>(d). Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 76, 79. Also in 1989, the Legislature added property used as a container for drugs to \u00a7 47 <em>(a) </em>and made this category forfeitable under \u00a7 47 <em>(b). </em>St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7\u00a7 75, 76. At no point in the gradual accretion of \u00a7 47 <em>(b)\u2019s </em>coverage has the Legislature added any dispositional provisions to \u00a7 47 <em>(b).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> The criminal prosecution at issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>426 Mass. 475 (1998) <em>(Brown), </em>took place in the Boston Municipal Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> The opinion in <em>Brown </em>indicates in a footnote, without comment, that the judge\u2019s order in that case distributed the forfeited $142 \u201cin equal shares to the Boston police department and the office of the district attorney for Suffolk County, as provided in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47 <em>(d).\u201d Brown, </em>426 Mass, at 477 n.2. The petitioners cite this footnote in arguing that distribution of the proceeds of a \u00a7 47 <em>{b) </em>forfeiture according to the provisions of \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>is approved by this court. The respondents, however, correctly point out that distribution of the proceeds was not at issue in <em>Brown </em>and that the court\u2019s recitation of the facts of that case does not necessarily indicate approval, and does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b231-5\"> The respondents also assert that apart from legislative intent, public policy dictates that a prosecutor be required to bring a separate civil action to forfeit funds seized as part of an illegal drug transaction in order to eliminate the potential for prosecutorial conflict of interest in connection with plea negotiations over disposition of criminal charges. The argument falls flat. There is nothing to prevent a prosecutor from negotiating a plea for a criminal charge based on a defendant\u2019s willingness not to contest a separate civil proceeding in the Superior Court to forfeit any monies or other property at issue. Nothing, in terms of bargaining positions or interests, would be changed by requiring the prosecutor to bring a separate proceeding in the Superior Court in order to effectuate forfeiture. The respondents\u2019 view of the situation elevates appearances over substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\"> See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a) (2000), which unlike our version contains headings, and which designates \u00a7 881(a) \u201c[sjubject property.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1986 Volkswagen GTI Auto., </em>417 Mass. 369, 373 (1994), and cases cited (\u201cBecause our statute tracks the Federal statute, we have looked to the Federal . . . law for guidance in interpreting our forfeiture statute\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> We also disagree with the judge\u2019s assertion that, if \u00a7 47 <em>(d) </em>did apply to the proceedings before him, he could nevertheless order the money deposited in the General Fund on the basis of the language in \u00a7 47 <em>(d), </em>first par., reading, \u201csaid final order shall provide for disposition of said conveyance, real property, moneys or any other thing of value by the commonwealth or any subdivision thereof in any manner not prohibited by law, including official use by an authorized law enforcement or other public agency, or sale at public auction or by competitive bidding.\u201d This sentence describes how forfeited items may be either used directly or converted to cash by sale.
