L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 24 (\u00a7 24),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> bars an employee\u2019s parents from bringing a wrongful death claim against his employer where the employee is injured at work but no workers\u2019 compensation payments are paid for the injury. Here, the employee, Cristian Ribeiro Giambrone, who had no dependents, died almost immediately. Accordingly, no benefits were paid under the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31 (benefits payable to employee\u2019s dependents on death of employee).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Giambrone\u2019s parents, Taciana Ribeiro Saab and Mark S. Giam-brone, commenced an action under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking recovery for loss of consortium and punitive damages from Massachusetts CVS Pharmacy, LLC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>(CVS), the successor in interest to the CVS store where Giam-brone worked at the time of his death. CVS moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (1), (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). It argued, among other things, that the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme barred the parents\u2019 claims, irrespective of whether workers\u2019 compensation benefits had been paid on his behalf. A judge in the Superior Court agreed and allowed the motion. The plaintiffs appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the determination whether an employee\u2019s injury is compensable under the act \u2014 and thus whether the exclusivity provision, \u00a7 24, applies \u2014 does not turn on whether a claimant is entitled to or actually receives compensation under the act. Because Giambrone\u2019s work-related injuries were compensable, his parents are barred from maintaining any action against his employer, CVS. We affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The operative facts are not in dispute. Giam-brone was employed at a CVS store on Longwood Avenue in Boston. In February, 2004, while at work, Giambrone and other employees attempted to apprehend a suspected shoplifter. The suspect responded violently, stabbing Giambrone in the neck with a knife. Giambrone died at the scene shortly thereafter. At the time of his death, Giambrone was an eighteen year old high school student who lived at his mother\u2019s home. He was financially dependent on both parents and had no dependents himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We begin with a brief review of the act\u2019s well-established purpose, focusing on its exclusivity provisions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>act \u201cwas designed to replace tort actions,\u201d <em>Alves\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 171, 177 n.9 (2008), by providing \u201ca uniform, statutory remedy for injured workers, in contrast to a piecemeal, tort-based system.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 559-560 (1996), quoting <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>First Essex Sav. Bank, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 377, 380 (1994). Employees injured in the course of their employment \u2014 and their dependents \u2014 may receive predictable compensation at a time of hardship while employers have the benefit of relative cost certainty. See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 369 (2005) (Sosman, J., concurring) (\u201cProtecting the injured worker from the sudden loss of that cash income ... is the goal of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme\u201d); <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass 342, 349 (1983) (workers\u2019 compensation laws represent \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s balance of competing societal interests\u201d); <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 594 (1982), quoting <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 494-495 (1916) (\u201cThe \u2018purpose [of the act] is to treat the cost of personal injuries incidental to . . . employment as a part of the cost of business\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In exchange for \u201cthe possibility of obtaining compensation for loss of wages or earning capacity caused by a work-related injury, regardless of the fault of their employers or the foreseeability of harm,\u201d the act \u201crequires that participating employees waive their right to sue in tort for work-related injuries.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 222 (1993). In other words, the employer \u201cobtains an immunity from actions at law by his employees.\u201d L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 26.1, at 313 (3d ed. 2003). \u201cIt was undoubtedly the intention of the Legislature ... to take away from employees who should become subject to its provisions all other remedies that they had against their employers for injuries happening in the course of their employment and arising therefrom, and to substitute for such remedies the wider right of compensation given by the act.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 422 (1914). See <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>408 Mass. 614, 616 (1990) (employees get \u201cguaranteed right of recovery,\u201d but they are in turn barred from \u201crecovering against their employers for injuries received on the job\u201d); <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 615, 621 (1990) (workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>pensation law provides fixed compensation for employees; employers are granted immunity in return). The exclusivity provisions applicable to injured workers now extend to their families and dependents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Section 24 and related exclusivity provisions of the act, see, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201chave always been a part of the workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>389 Mass. 35, 44 (1983). They are its \u201ccornerstone.\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 652, 656 (1993) (dealing with \u00a7 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Since the 1985 amendment to the act extending the exclusivity provisions to the parents of employees, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>this court has made clear that \u00a7 24 bars the claims of the parents of an employee who suffers a work-related injury, whether or not the parents are dependent on the child. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Boston Wyman, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 1005, 1006 (1991) (clarifying that \u00a7 24 applies to employee\u2019s spouse, parents, or children regardless whether any such relative is financially dependent on employee). Moreover, in <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 627 (1992), a case where workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid in the wake of a work-related injury (the employee was rendered a paraplegic), we held that \u00a7 24 foreclosed an action for loss of consortium brought by the employee\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In this case the parents argue, in essence, that the unavail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ability of compensation for or on behalf of their son under the act nullifies \u00a7 24 as applied to them. But see note 4, <em>supra. </em>They recognize that had their son been survived by dependents, his dependents would have been eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31. But where such benefits are utterly unavailable under the statutory scheme because Giam-brone left no dependents, it cannot be, they contend, that there can be no recovery for the death of their son against his employer, particularly where \u2014 they allege \u2014 CVS was wilfully and grossly negligent in the operation of its store on Longwood Avenue. <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, supra, </em>has no application, they argue, because in that case benefits were paid to the injured worker, thereby triggering the application of \u00a7 24 and barring additional recovery by his parents. Here, in contrast, no compensation has been paid on account of the death of their son, and as such, the injury is not \u201ccompensable\u201d and \u00a7 24 does not apply. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The \u201ckey\u201d to whether the act precludes a common-law right of action \u201clies in the nature of the injury for which plaintiff makes claim.\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood, Inc., supra </em>at 655, quoting <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 553 (1980). In other words, the key is whether the injury is compensable. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 26, \u201cexplains when injuries are compensable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Klemm, </em>446 Mass. 572, 579 n.8 (2006). Under \u00a7 26, an injury is compensable where the plaintiff is an employee who suffers a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d that arises \u201cout of and in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 558 (1996), quoting <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., supra </em>at 548-549. Cf. <em>Haslam\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 101, 107-108 (2008) (injury that occurred while employee was driving home not compensable because it did not arise \u201cout of and in the course of employment\u201d); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., supra </em>at 551 (injury to reputation not compensable because it is not \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u00a7 26). If a work-related injury <em>is </em>compensable under the act, then \u00a7 24 applies and the exclusivity provision bars any other remedies against the employer. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>(\u00a7 24 applicable where plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress resulted from injury that met \u00a7 26 factors); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., supra </em>at 550. Here Giambrone was an employee who suffered a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d that arose \u201cout of and in the course of his employment.\u201d His injury is therefore \u201ccompensable\u201d irrespective of whether compensation for his injury is available under the act. Accordingly, any remedies against CVS for any wrong suffered as a result of his injury are subject to the strictures of \u00a7 24. To hold otherwise \u2014 to condition compensability on the payment of compensation \u2014 risks \u201cundercutting] the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 349-350.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">A related question has been addressed in other courts. In Massachusetts a Federal judge construed the application of \u00a7 24 in deciding that an employee cannot recover in tort when the employee suffers a work-related injury that causes harm for which no workers\u2019 compensation is payable to the employee under the act. See <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Memorex Corp., </em>588 F. Supp. 27, 30 (D. Mass. 1984) (\u201cWhen an injury is within the class of those covered by the workmen\u2019s compensation statute, but no compensation is available because the injury is not disabling as defined in the statute, the exclusivity provision nonetheless bars a tort suit against the employer\u201d). And courts in other jurisdictions construing the exclusivity provisions of their States\u2019 respective workers\u2019 compensation statutes have reached similar conclusions. See, e.g., <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Dow Chem. Co., </em>112 Mich. App. 198 (1982) (tort claim for sterility barred by exclusive remedy provision even though compensation not payable for sterility); <em>Fetterhoff </em>v. <em>Western </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Block Co., </em>44 A.D.2d 1001, <em>1001 (N.Y. </em>1975) (State\u2019s high court \u201chas consistently held that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law precludes injured employees from asserting personal injury actions against covered employers based on injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, even though the employee suffers some loss not specifically compensated under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law\u201d); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>South Carolina State Hosp., </em>285 S.C. 183, 191-192 (1985) (\u201c[T]he fact that no actual monetary award can be made pursuant to the [workers\u2019 compensation act] . . . has no bearing whatever on the Act\u2019s exclusivity. . . . [T]he Act provides the exclusive remedy for injuries resulting from an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, whether or not the particular injury may be compensated by a monetary award under the Act\u201d). See also 6 A. Larson &amp; L.K. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 100.05[1], at 315 (2008), and cases cited; L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 26.1 (3d ed. 2003) (\u201cThe cases nationwide bar a tort action against the employer\u201d where act \u201cclearly covers the injury and thereby bars a common law remedy, but the act provides no compensation for the particular harm suffered\u201d). If the exclusivity provisions of workers\u2019 compensation schemes deprive employees of remedies against their employers for work-related injuries where no compensation is available to them for those injuries, those same exclusivity provisions assuredly apply to family members of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Giambrone\u2019s parents also argue that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, violates their rights under art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights by depriving them of a remedy for the loss of their child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similar arguments concerning the act\u2019s exclusivity provisions previously have been considered and rejected. See <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., supra </em>at 45 (concluding that \u201clegislative abrogation of the common law right of indemnity [by \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 24] does not offend art. 11\u201d); <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Gotham Ink of New England, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 923 (1992) (reject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ing claim that 1985 amendment expanding scope of \u00a7 24 violated art. 11 by failing to provide substitute remedy for family members of employees). Article 11 \u201chas never been construed to grant to any person \u2018a vested interest in any rule of law entitling [such person] to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., supra </em>at 44, quoting <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>White, </em>243 U.S. 188, 198 (1917). The plaintiffs have offered us no persuasive reason to revisit the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The result we reach today may leave some injured workers or their families without a remedy against an employer for a work-related injury caused by the employer\u2019s negligence. The judge in the Superior Court noted that the events underlying this case were heart-rending. Without expressing any view on the merits of the damages sought by the parents against their son\u2019s employer, he found it troubling that there appeared to be no remedy available to the parents against the employer for a claimed wrong. Cf. 6 A. Larson &amp; L.K. Larson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 100.05[l][a] (\u201cThe most troublesome cases are those in which the act clearly covers the injury and thereby bars all common-law rights, but because of the failure of the compensation system to award benefits for the particular kind of harm, gives the worker nothing in return\u201d). As the judge correctly noted, however, it is not the role of courts to create a more comprehensive or logical system of compensation. See <em>Doherty's Case, </em>294 Mass. 363, 366 (1936). That is a task for the Legislature. See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 349 (workers\u2019 compensation laws are \u201ceconomic regulations representing the Legislature\u2019s balance of competing societal interests and ... the courts have no place in reshaping public policy in the face of such comprehensive legislation\u201d); <em>Longever </em>v. <em>Revere Copper &amp; Brass Inc., </em>381 Mass. 221, 225 (1980) (\u201cDeficiencies in the compensation awards pursuant to the [workers\u2019 compensation] statute are matters of concern for the Legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 24, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201cIf an employee has not given notice to his employer that he preserves his right of action at common law as provided by this section, the employee\u2019s spouse, children, parents and any other member of the employee\u2019s family or next of kin who is wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of such employee at the time of injury or death, shall also be held to have waived any right created by statute, at common law, or under the law of any other jurisdiction against such employer, including, but not limited to claims for damages due to emotional distress, loss of consortium, parental guidance, companionship or the like, when such loss is a result of any injury to the employee that is compensable under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> CVS Caremark Corporation paid for certain of Giambrone\u2019s funeral expenses.
