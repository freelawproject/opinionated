(Wal-Mart), who were paid by the hour (hourly employees). On behalf of themselves and others similarly situated they allege that Wal-Mart wrongfully withheld compensation for time worked and denied or cut short rest and meal breaks to which they were entitled. The plaintiffs appealed from a Superior Court judge\u2019s allowance of summary judgment on certain counts of their complaint and also filed an application for direct appellate review. The judge reported the case to the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Civ. R 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111. See also note 40, <em>infra. </em>Wal-Mart also filed an application for direct appellate review. We granted both applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">In essence we are asked to determine (1) whether the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>abused his discretion by (a) allowing Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 principal expert, Dr. Martin Shapiro, as unreliable, and (b) allowing Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to decertify the class of approximately 67,500 current and former hourly workers employed by Wal-Mart in Massachusetts for more than a ten-year period<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (2) whether the judge erred in granting summary judgment to Wal-Mart on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims concerning meal breaks, as well as certain of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the payment of wages law, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, for failure to compensate the plaintiffs for the time they worked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the judge\u2019s orders. We conclude, inter alla, that the judge abused his discretion in allowing Wal-Mart\u2019s motions to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert and to decertify the class. We further conclude that the judge erred in granting partial summary judgment to Wal-Mart. We remand the case for the entry of an order certifying the class and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">1. <em>Facts.'</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Wal-Mart is a national mass-merchandising retail chain headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas (home office), with stores located throughout Massachusetts. The operations of individual Wal-Mart stores, including payroll controls, are directed by corporate-wide policies established, disseminated, and carefully controlled by the home office. The central labor policies and payroll controls relevant to this litigation include the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Wal-Mart policy required all hourly employees (called \u201cassociates\u201d by Wal-Mart) to adhere to stringent timekeeping procedures, including clocking in and out at the beginning and end of each shift and at other prescribed times. Wal-Mart\u2019s uniform timekeeping requirements were communicated to hourly employees from their first day of work and consistently throughout their employment at Wal-Mart through, among other channels: an employee handbook intended for every hourly employee nationwide,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> oral and written materials presented in orientation sessions designed by the home office that newly hired hourly employees were required to attend, oral and written \u201ccoaching\u201d (disciplinary) actions, and posters and other materials posted near store time clocks and elsewhere throughout Wal-Mart stores.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The timekeeping instructions given to hourly employees embodied the substance of two corporate-wide Wal-Mart policy directives applicable uniformly to all hourly employees. The policy directives were known internally as PD-07 and PD-43.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> PD-07 provided that, unless otherwise required by State law, all hourly employees were entitled to one paid, fifteen-minute rest break for every three hours of consecutive time worked (to a maximum of two rest breaks), and an unpaid meal break of at least thirty minutes for work in excess of six consecutive hours.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>PD-07 in effect until February 10, 2001, stated that hourly employees \u201cwhose break or meal period is interrupted to perform work would receive compensation for the entire period at their regular rate of pay and be allowed an additional break or meal period.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Until that date, PD-07 required employees to clock in and out for both rest and meal breaks. Thereafter, employees were required to clock in and out for meal breaks but not for rest breaks. Neither PD-07 nor any other Wal-Mart policy directive has ever expressly permitted hourly employees to waive breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">PD-43 stated that hourly employees should never be required to work \u201coff-the-clock,\u201d that is, work when the employees\u2019 hours are not being recorded for compensation. The same policy directive also generally prohibited employees from working overtime. PD-43 obligated store managerial personnel to investigate every instance where it was determined that an employee worked off-the-clock and to complete a working off-the-clock notice, to be signed by the supervisor or manager, the employees, and a \u201cwitness\u201d who was required to be a salaried employee. Wal-Mart repeatedly warned its hourly employees that they would be subject to an escalating series of disciplinary \u201ccoaching,\u201d including termination, for violating company policy concerning breaks and off-the-clock work.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs introduced numerous policy directives and other internal documents, as well as affidavits and deposition testimony, specifying that Wal-Mart\u2019s policies regarding work breaks (as well as its policies regarding off-the-clock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>work) were, in the words of an internal Wal-Mart memorandum, among the company\u2019s \u201cnon-negotiables.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The day-to-day responsibility for ensuring that hourly employees followed company timekeeping policies fell on individual store managers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For store managers, the responsibility for payroll came with considerable pressure from the home office to boost profits by, among other things, minimizing labor costs, one of the corporation\u2019s largest controllable expenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Store managers were rewarded for keeping payroll costs low. Conversely, if they exceeded Wal-Mart\u2019s stringent labor cost guidelines, they might lose their bonuses or lose their jobs. According to documents proffered by the plaintiffs, Wal-Mart informed Massachusetts store managers of the precise margins by which their payrolls exceeded the labor cost guidelines and ordered the store managers to cut those payroll costs accordingly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">At least since 1989, senior Wal-Mart home office executives have been made aware that, despite the written policy directives to the contrary, store managers were sometimes \u201c[ajltering time cards to decrease reported payroll expenses\u201d and \u201c[ijnstructing associates to work off the clock . . . .\u201d Further, at least since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>1998, the home office was aware that some hourly employees \u201care not receiving scheduled breaks and lunches.\u201d One Wal-Mart payroll audit, known as the \u201cShipley audit,\u201d dated July 17, 2000, surveyed 128 Wal-Mart stores nationwide. Among other things, the Shipley audit documented that in a two-week period, 127 \u201c[s]tores were not in compliance with company and state regulations concerning the allotment of breaks and meals as 76,472 exceptions were noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Wal-Mart was also aware, during the class period, of allegations of \u201ctime shaving\u201d by store managers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Two time-shaving techniques in particular feature prominently in this litigation. The first was the insertion by Wal-Mart supervisors of meal break periods into hourly employees\u2019 time records, allegedly when no meal break had in fact been taken. This effectively deprived hourly employees of compensation for the amount of time of the inserted meal break period.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The second was a practice known as the \u201cone-minute clock-out,\u201d in which a manager inserted a \u201cclock-out\u201d one minute after the hourly employee had clocked in (either for a shift, or on returning from a break) even though the employee had actually worked for longer than one minute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The plaintiffs, Crystal Salvas and Elaine Polion, averred that, as hourly employees at Wal-Mart during the class period, they worked off-the-clock and were denied rest and meal breaks.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The plaintiffs augmented their affidavits with evidence from other hourly employees.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This evidence includes, among other things, letters, records of telephone calls to an internal \u201cgrass roots\u201d complaint hotline for hourly employees, and other communications to superiors from Massachusetts hourly employees in various Wal-Mart stores throughout the Commonwealth complaining about time-shaving practices and missed rest and meal breaks.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Wal-Mart submitted countervailing affidavits from Massachusetts hourly employees stating that they did not work off-the-clock and were not denied rest or meal breaks.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Some of the evidence proffered by the plaintiffs consists of an expert\u2019s analysis of Wal-Mart\u2019s business records, which were obtained by the plaintiffs through discovery from Wal-Mart\u2019s home office. See part 3, <em>infra. </em>As noted, the home office closely monitored the payroll activities of all of its stores, including its Massachusetts stores. For example, each store\u2019s electronic time clock, which was programmed and maintained by the home office, transmitted each employee\u2019s time clock punches to the home office every fifteen minutes. Wal-Mart required that payroll and timekeeping data be recorded on a uniform set of forms. Some of these forms factor into this litigation. Among these is Wal-Mart\u2019s time clock exception report (exception report), in effect after 2001. The exception report consists of a list of all hourly employees whose records revealed timekeeping anomalies, such as missed punches at the end of the day or an overly long or overly short lunch period. Managers at each Wal-Mart store are required to investigate every item generated by an exception report. If an exception report showed that an hourly employee had not taken a lunch or a rest break or had otherwise missed a punch, the manager was expected to inquire of the hourly employee and, if a punch or punches had been missed, to complete a time adjustment request (TAR) that both the hourly employee and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>manager were required to sign, or later, to use an electronic time adjustment system.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Another report, the time clock archive report (archive report), recorded and transmitted to the home office the total number of times each hourly employee swiped in and out during every shift of each pay period, and tallied the hourly employee\u2019s total hours of work recorded for the pay period. Store managers were required to investigate and resolve any discrepancies appearing on the archive report before the payroll was finalized. Hourly employees were required to review and sign off on the accuracy of the archive report prior to receiving their paychecks. Wal-Mart\u2019s time clock punch error report (punch error report) also captured daily punch errors in hourly employees\u2019 timekeeping. The home office would not finalize daily store payroll until the errors on the punch error report were corrected.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These reports, along with others, together comprise the business records analyzed by the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Shapiro, as discussed more fully <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>On August 21, 2001, two former WalMart hourly employees<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> filed a complaint against Wal-Mart alleging multiple causes of action in implied-in-fact contract, tort, and Massachusetts wage statutes for wrongful failure to compensate hourly employees for time worked and to provide them with rest breaks and meal breaks to which they were entitled.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought to represent a class of approximately 67,500 current and former Wal-Mart hourly employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>worked at forty-seven Wal-Mart stores in Massachusetts during the class period. In January, 2004, a Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify the class.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Civ. P. 23 (a) and (b), 365 Mass. 767 (1974).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Wal-Mart appealed from the decision to the Appeals Court. In June, 2004, a single justice of the Appeals Court vacated the class certification order and remanded the matter to the Superior Court. Among other things, the single justice concluded that the Superior Court judge had erroneously side stepped his obligation to determine whether the statistical proffer that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>proposed as a justification to proceed on a class rather than an individual basis was \u201creliable enough to be admissible\u201d and whether its admission would infringe Wal-Mart\u2019s rights of due process.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The single justice faulted the motion judge for failing to \u201cgive careful consideration\u201d to whether, in light of the tactical decision by the named plaintiffs to waive any claim under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> in order to avoid removal to Federal Court,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> they could adequately represent the class.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Following the single justice\u2019s order, and after they claimed to have discovered new evidence of Wal-Mart\u2019s allegedly wrongful labor practices, the plaintiffs renewed a motion previously denied to amend their complaint a second time to add a claim for violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. They also made a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>motion for class certification. A second Superior Court judge allowed the motion to amend the complaint.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> On remand of the class certification issue, the judge who allowed the initial certification motion declined to revisit his findings concerning predominance and concluded that the plaintiffs had met their burden of proving the requirements for class certification for their claims under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. Thus, in December, 2004, he again certified the class, now expanded to cover claims under \u00a7 148.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Two years later, on September 21, 2006, a third Superior Court judge allowed in part and denied in part a motion by Wal-Mart for partial summary judgment. Specifically, the judge allowed Wal-Mart\u2019s motion on all claims concerning missed, interrupted, or shortened meal periods, on the ground that, because meal breaks were unpaid, the plaintiffs would be unable to show harm for meal breaks that were shortened or eliminated.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As for the claims predicated on missed, interrupted, or shortened rest breaks, the judge granted summary judgment on the counts alleging breach of the implied covenant of good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>faith and fair dealing (count three), unjust enrichment (count four),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> promissory estoppel (count five), and conversion (count six). In addition, the judge allowed Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to shorten the class period to between August 21,1998, and December 31, 2005 (shortened class period), on the remaining \u00a7 148 claim (count nine), on the ground that defining the class period to begin earlier would violate the three-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 148. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. Thus, what remained of the plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint after summary judgment was (1) the breach of implied contract claim (count one) for failing to provide or compensate the plaintiffs for their earned rest breaks; (2) at the plaintiffs\u2019 election, the breach of implied contract claim (count two) or the unjust enrichment claim (count four) for failure to provide compensation for off-the-clock work, and (3) damages, including treble damages, (a) under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> for failure to pay overtime (count seven); (b) under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> for failure to pay minimum wage (count eight); and (c) under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, for failure to provide compensation for certain off-the-clock work, limited to the shortened class period (count nine).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On November 7, 2006, the same Superior Court judge who had ruled on the motion for partial summary judgment allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>an earlier filed motion by Wal-Mart to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Shapiro, and to decertify the class, a decision we discuss in detail <em>infra. </em>The judge stayed both decisions pending resolution of the questions he reported to the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We granted both parties\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We consider first the judge\u2019s decision to allow Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert and to decertify the class. We begin with the portion of that motion seeking to exclude Shapiro\u2019s expert testimony as unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">3. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cIf the process or theory underlying a scientific expert\u2019s opinion lacks reliability, that opinion should not reach the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lanigan, 419 Mass. 15, 26 (1994). See <em>Dau-bert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We review the motion judge\u2019s decision to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness for an abuse of discretion. <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 312 (2000) (\u201capplying an abuse of discretion standard on appellate review will allow trial judges the needed discretion to conduct the inherently fact-intensive and flexible <em>Lanigan </em>analysis, while preserving a sufficient degree of appellate review to assure that <em>Lanigan </em>determinations are consistent with the law and supported by a sufficient factual basis in the particular case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">b. <em>Shapiro\u2019s evidence. </em>Shapiro, the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>professor of psychology at Emory University with a doctorate in psychology and mathematics who works primarily in the area of statistics. He has testified as an expert on both sides in employment discrimination cases. He has spent \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of hours, indeed by his own account \u201cabout fifty per cent\u201d of his time for the preceding four and one-half years, on his work as a consultant and testifying expert in this case and approximately twenty other similar wage and hour claims against Wal-Mart. Shapiro reviewed Wal-Mart\u2019s timekeeper databases, described <em>supra, </em>along with dozens of other related Wal-Mart data sources and records including documents detailing the codes and variables involved in Wal-Mart\u2019s databases, Wal-Mart policy documents, internal audit reports, depositions, and other materials. He produced a written report, which the plaintiffs submitted to the court, and testified at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Shapiro performed four tasks for the plaintiffs. First, he counted what was in the records Wal-Mart provided. Because many of the records Wal-Mart produced were in paper rather than electronic form, this was an enormous and expensive task.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Second, Shapiro used standard statistical methods to extrapolate from the available data, primarily to account for data that were missing either because Wal-Mart did not retain the records or because the paper records it did produce were unreadable.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Third, Shapiro multiplied the duration of each putative violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>he identified in the database by the wage rate of the applicable individual hourly employee to arrive at figures representing the total damages that Wal-Mart would owe the plaintiff class if all the putative violations Shapiro counted were, indeed, violations requiring compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Fourth, Shapiro offered his own expert opinions as to why various features of either the data themselves, the means by which they were collected, or both, should lead a fact finder to conclude that Wal-Mart had indeed deprived the plaintiffs of compensation, rest breaks, and meal breaks to the extent suggested by the data. For example, Shapiro noted that the missed breaks were not randomly distributed: more of the missed rest breaks were at busy, peak times in the afternoon rather than in the morning. Shapiro opined that this fact supported the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that \u201cit is simply not true that people didn\u2019t swipe in and out for rest breaks\u201d; rather, because of understaffing for example, hourly employees \u201csystematically or generally didn\u2019t take certain rest breaks,\u201d generally at busy times. Shapiro similarly argued that the mechanics of how the various data were generated by timecard swipes and subsequent manager edits \u2014 especially the processes Wal-Mart put in place for correcting any erroneous \u201cexceptions\u201d \u2014 made it probable that Wal-Mart\u2019s records were by and large accurate, and that nearly all of the incidents of time shaving and missed rest and meal periods that the data appeared to suggest were, in fact, violations.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Shapiro performed each of these four tasks with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>four distinct categories of data. (1) Shapiro counted so-called \u201cone-minute clock-outs,\u201d in which a Wal-Mart manager or supervisor edited an hourly employee\u2019s time swipe records to clock the affected hourly employee out one minute after the hourly employee clocked in.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> (2) He counted the total number of missed and interrupted rest breaks appearing in the timekeeper data from August, 1995, through February, 2001; he also used a linear method of statistical estimation to arrive at an estimate of the number of rest breaks that were likely missed, if past trends continued, from February, 2001, when Wal-Mart stopped collecting the data, through the end of the class period.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> (3) He counted instances of off-the-clock work by cashiers, as measured by instances in which cashiers were not swiped in to work, according to the timekeeper databases, yet were in fact logged in to their cash registers, as recorded in a separate point-of-sale database.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>(4) Shapiro counted instances in which hourly employees did not swipe out for a meal break during their shift, but managers subsequently inserted a meal period of exactly thirty or sixty minutes into the shift.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Wal-Mart countered with its own expert, Denise Martin, senior vice-president of National Economic Research Associates, Inc., who holds a doctorate in economics. Martin testified at the evidentiary hearing and prepared a report that was marked as an exhibit at that hearing. Martin reviewed Shapiro\u2019s analysis and made numerous criticisms, essentially concluding that one-minute clock-outs inserted by managers may reflect actual time worked<footnotemark>50</footnotemark>; that inserted meal periods may reflect meals actually taken<footnotemark>51</footnotemark>; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>many of the missed rest breaks in the timekeeper data may not be what they appear because hourly employees may take rest breaks without swiping out<footnotemark>52</footnotemark>; that in any event, some missed rest breaks may be voluntary<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>; and that the purported off-the-clock work by cashiers that Shapiro identifies may simply mean that one hourly employee is working at the cash register \u201cunder another [hourly employee\u2019s] ID, either intentionally or inadvertently.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Thus, Martin opined, Shapiro\u2019s estimate of alleged damages is speculative, unreliable and inaccurate: \u201cGiven the data he has available, it is impossible for him to identify properly any instances of missed or short rest breaks.\u201d His other estimates of alleged damages, she testified, are similarly unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">c. <em>Analysis. </em>The motion judge, \u201caccepting] Martin\u2019s criticisms of Shapiro\u2019s methodology,\u201d found that \u201cthe unreliability of Shapiro\u2019s opinions <em>and, indirectly, of Wal-Mart\u2019's records </em>do not provide an acceptable basis for supporting a finding of harm, with de minimis exceptions, to 67,500 members of the associate class\u201d (emphasis added). He characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and their use of Shapiro\u2019s expert opinion in the following way: \u201cthe plaintiffs will have Shapiro imbue Wal-Mart\u2019s rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ords with the ability to speak for class members or qualifying representatives in identifying specific instances when they have been injured or harmed by Wal-Mart\u2019s actions or policies.\u201d The motion judge took the plaintiffs to be arguing, \u201cwith dependence largely on Shapiro, that the Wal-Mart records are so error free that they can be relied upon to identify specific associates who suffered missed breaks, time shaving, and off-the-clock work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This was error in two respects. First, in the liability phase of this putative class action, it is not the representative plaintiffs\u2019 burden to identify every \u201cspecific\u201d instance in which a member of the plaintiff class has been \u201cinjured or harmed by Wal-Mart\u2019s actions or policies.\u201d Rather, the plaintiffs\u2019 burden is to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Wal-Mart engaged in an over-all, class-wide practice of time shaving, denying or discouraging rest breaks or meal breaks, and requiring off-the-clock work by its hourly employees. See part 4(c), <em>infra. </em>Cf. <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 360 (1977) (evidence of \u201ceach person\u201d harmed by general policy not required in order to prove that over-all policy existed). See generally part 4, <em>infra. </em>Second, the plaintiffs are not using Shapiro to \u201cimbue\u201d Wal-Mart\u2019s business records with eviden-tiary value the records do not already possess. The motion judge\u2019s decision to exclude Shapiro\u2019s testimony as unreliable turns fundamentally on his conclusion that \u201c[t]he time records of Wal-Mart are not adequate of themselves to establish entitlement to compensation in a case like this . . . .\u201d This formulation misstates the test. The question is not whether Wal-Mart\u2019s records are dispositive evidence, conclusively establishing liability and damages \u201cof themselves.\u201d Rather, the test is whether the business records are <em>admissible </em>evidence, probative of Wal-Mart\u2019s liability. If so, then Shapiro\u2019s efforts to count and summarize them \u2014 the first of the four pieces of evidence offered by Shapiro, as delineated above \u2014 are similarly admissible unless his methods of counting and summarizing those records are themselves unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Shapiro\u2019s methods for reconstructing and summarizing the contents of Wal-Mart\u2019s records are uncontested.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Martin\u2019s criticisms are directed elsewhere, primarily at the fourth category of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>evidence Shapiro provided, as outlined <em>supra: </em>his independent expert opinion that all the violations apparent on the face of the data, such as the missed rest breaks, are, indeed, violations to be compensated. Martin also challenges certain of Shapiro\u2019s statistical extrapolations to cover missing data \u2014 part of the second category of evidence Shapiro provided. She does not challenge Shapiro\u2019s extensive technical project of recreating Wal-Mart\u2019s timekeeper databases from paper backups and counting certain of the data. Nor does she challenge Shapiro\u2019s calculations in the third category of evidence he provided, in which he multiplied the putative violations by hourly employees\u2019 wage rates to arrive at figures for what the damages would be if all those putative violations were to be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In excluding even the portion of Shapiro\u2019s report and testimony that consisted of counting data found in Wal-Mart\u2019s own business records, the motion judge acted not on the basis of any challenge to Shapiro\u2019s methodology, but essentially on his view that the records themselves were insufficiently reliable.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> This was error. Business records have a special place in our law of evidence. By statute, business records are admissible even when they would otherwise be inadmissible \u201chearsay or self-serving\u201d if \u201cthe entry, writing or record was made in good faith in the regular course of business and before the beginning of the civil or criminal proceeding . . . and that it was the regular course of such business to make such memorandum or record at the time of such act, transaction, occurrence or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. Courts necessarily rely on the accuracy of business records that satisfy these requirements. \u201cReliability is presumed because entries in these records are routinely made by those charged with the responsibility of making accurate entries and are relied on in the course of doing business.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPlante, </em>416 Mass. 433, 442 (1993). Courts attach this presumption of reliability to business records because businesses themselves rely on their accuracy. \u201cSuch entries are dealt with ... in the most important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>undertakings of mercantile and industrial life. They are the ultimate basis of calculation, investment, and general confidence in every business enterprise. ... It would seem that expedients which the entire commercial world recognizes as safe could be sanctioned, and not discredited, by courts of justice.\u201d <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 410 (1982) (Liacos, J., concurring), quoting 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1530, at 452 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1974).<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Wal-Mart\u2019s business records at issue in this case satisfy all of the requirements to be afforded the usual presumption of reliability. Both the timekeeper records and the point-of-sale register records were \u201cmade in good faith in the regular course of business\u201d before this action began. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. The digital records of hourly employees\u2019 card-swipes and their supervisors\u2019 subsequent insertions and amendments were all made \u201cat the time of such act, transaction, occurrence or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d Wal-Mart has relied on these records for purposes of compensating its hourly employees, evaluating its store managers, and presumably reporting its payroll expenditures to the Commonwealth, to the Federal government, and to its own shareholders in the form of financial results.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">This presumption of reliability is not irrebuttable. Wal-Mart may, through admissible evidence at trial, challenge the veracity of its own records, just as it may challenge the conclusions that Shapiro and the plaintiffs draw from those records.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> But the records themselves, and the portions of Shapiro\u2019s testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>consist of reconstructing and counting those records in an uncon-testedly reliable fashion, are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Wal-Mart\u2019s criticisms of the remaining portions of Shapiro\u2019s expert testimony go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Wal-Mart\u2019s expert essentially argues that, for a series of reasons, not all of the putative violations Shapiro identifies are actual violations; she contends that accounting for a series of additional factors, variables, and data sources would undercut Shapiro\u2019s conclusions. As the United States Supreme Court stated in a case involving statistical regression analysis: \u201cNormally, failure to include variables will affect the analysis\u2019 probativeness, not its admissibility.\u201d <em>Bazemore </em>v. <em>Friday, </em>478 U.S. 385, 400 (1986). \u201cThere may, of course, be some regressions so incomplete as to be inadmissible as irrelevant; but such was clearly not the case here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 n.10. Here, the evidence at issue does not involve statistical regression, but a similar principle applies: any failure to take account of additional factors affects the probativeness, rather than the admissibility, of Shapiro\u2019s evidence. It cannot be said that Shapiro\u2019s analysis of Wal-Mart\u2019s data is so incomplete as to be \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the question of Wal-Mart\u2019s class-wide liability, or, in the event that the fact finder concludes Wal-Mart is liable, to the question of damages. Any failure of Shapiro to account for the factors Martin identifies may render his analysis \u201cless probative than it otherwise might be,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 400, but would not render his analysis inadmissible.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to exclude Shapiro\u2019s testimony should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>We turn now to the judge\u2019s decision allowing Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to decertify the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">4. <em>Class certification, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>A judge has broad discretion to certify or decertify a class. Our review asks only whether that discretion has been abused. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., </em>434 Mass. 81, 84-85 (2001). Indicia of an abuse of discretion include errors of law or judicial action that is \u201carbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious . . . such as when a judge grants class status on the basis of speculation or generalization regarding satisfaction of the requirements of rule 23, or denies class status by imposing, at the certification stage, the burden of proof that will be required of the plaintiffs at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85. See <em>Smilow </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>323 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 2003) (Federal District Court abuses its discretion \u201cwhen it relies significantly on an improper factor, omits a significant factor, or makes a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors\u201d or \u201cif the court adopts an incorrect legal rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Before applying these principles to the decertification order, we describe it in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">b. <em>Decertification order. </em>The decertification order was predicated on the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the predominance of common over individual issues, as required by rule 23 (b). The judge concluded that the factual record demonstrated that the class was \u201clikely to consist of a not insubstantial number\u201d of hourly employees who were not harmed by Wal-Mart. In reaching his conclusion, the judge focused principally on the reliability of Wal-Mart\u2019s payroll records described <em>supra, </em>and on Shapiro\u2019s expert testimony. The judge reasoned that, although the payroll records indicated how an hourly employee\u2019s work time was recorded, they were mute as to the reasons a particular hourly employee recorded time as he or she did. In light of affidavits submitted by Wal-Mart from several Massachusetts hourly employees stating that they had shortened or omitted break periods for reasons having nothing to do with WalMart\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, see note 23, <em>supra, </em>the judge said that individual inquiries of each hourly employee would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>required to determine whether Wal-Mart was at fault. He surmised, relying on <em>Secretary of Labor </em>v. <em>DeSisto, </em>929 F.2d 789 (1st Cir. 1991) <em>(DeSisto), </em>that the plaintiffs might have been able to overcome Wal-Mart\u2019s showing that common issues would not predominate had they presented a trial plan that included \u201ctestimony of witnesses representative of the different positions held in each of the forty-seven Massachusetts stores covering the entire class period who could make the case of violations experienced by all class members\u201d by offering \u201cfirst-hand\u201d testimony of such violations.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Absent the presentation of such a trial plan, he concluded, the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proving that the number of uninjured class members would be de minimis, as he concluded was required by <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381 (2004). Thus, at the heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is the question whether they have met their burden of proof under the predominance requirement of rule 23 (b). We now take a closer look at that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">c. <em>Predominance. </em>Rule 23 (b) calls for the plaintiff to demonstrate, among other things, \u201cthat the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d The predominance requirement seeks to ensure, in part, that the economies of class action will be realized in the particular litigation. See 2 A. Conte &amp; H.B. Newberg, Class Actions \u00a7 4.24, at 154 (4th ed. 2002) (Newberg) (\u201cJudicial economy factors and advantages over other methods for handling the litigation as a practical matter underlie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the predominance and superiority requirements for class actions . . .\u201d). We recognize that questions of predominance under rule 23 (b) \u201cintroduce a highly discretionary element\u201d into a motion judge\u2019s decision. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Gas Co., </em>394 Mass. 595, 601 (1985), quoting <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33, 40 (1975). That discretion, however, \u201cmust be exercised in accord with the purposes sought to be achieved by class actions.\u201d <em>Sniffin </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 723 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u201cThe predominance test expressly directs the court to make a comparison between the common and individual questions involved in order to reach a determination of such predominance of common questions in a class action context.\u201d Newberg, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.23, at 154. At the pretrial stage, the burden is on the moving party to prove that it has satisfied the predominance requirement. That burden, as we have often stated, is of a different order than the party\u2019s burden of proof at trial. At the pretrial class action stage, the plaintiffs must \u201cprovid[e] information sufficient to enable the motion judge to form a reasonable judgment that the class meets the requirements of rule 23; they do not bear the burden of producing evidence sufficient to prove that the requirements [of rule 23] have been met.\u201d <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., supra </em>at 87. See <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974). If a plaintiff satisfies this certification burden, then \u201cneither the possibility that a plaintiff will be unable to prove his allegations, nor the possibility that the later course of the suit might unforeseeably prove the original decision to certify the class wrong, is a basis for declining to certify a class which apparently satisfies the Rule.\u201d <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., supra </em>at 84-85, quoting <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Barrack, </em>524 F.2d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 816 (1976); <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., supra </em>at 92, quoting <em>Waste Mgt. Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mowbray, </em>208 F.3d 288, 296 (1st Cir. 2000) (plaintiff must prove that \u201csufficient constellation of common issues bind class members together\u201d); <em>Spear </em>v. <em>H.V. Greene Co., </em>246 Mass. 259, 266 (1923) (\u201cThe persons suing as representatives of a class must show by the allegations of their bill that all the persons whom they profess to represent have a common interest in the subject matter of the suit and a right and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>interest to ask for the same relief against the defendants. It is not essential that the interest of each member of the class be identical in all aspects with that of the plaintiffs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Because the salient inquiry is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are <em>\u201csufficiently </em>cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,\u201d no rote formula can determine whether the plaintiffs have met their certification burden on the question of predominance (emphasis added). <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 623 (1977). See <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., </em>434 Mass. 81, 92 (2001). The judge must engage in \u201can individualized, pragmatic evaluation of the relationship between and the relative significance of the common and individual issues.\u201d <em>In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., </em>231 F.R.D. 52, 70 (D. Mass. 2005), quoting <em>In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., </em>218 F.R.D. 337, 343 (D. Mass. 2003). Class certification may be appropriate where common issues of law and fact are shown to form the nucleus of a liability claim, even though the appropriateness of class action treatment in the damages phase is an open question. See <em>Smilow </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>323 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2003), quoting <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Barrack, supra </em>at 905 (\u201cThe amount of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">d. <em>Analysis. </em>We first consider the issues of fact. The evidence offered by the plaintiffs in support of class certification included not only the payroll evidence and expert evidence provided by Shapiro, but additional nonpayroll, nonexpert materials such as documents and materials that Wal-Mart distributed to its hourly employees and other information that the judge grouped into seven broad categories (collectively, additional material), which we set forth in the margin below.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the additional material alone, absent payroll records or Shapiro\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>testimony, is sufficient to meet their pretrial certification burden on the issue of predominance. We need not resolve that question, because we have determined, as described <em>supra, </em>that it was an abuse of discretion to exclude Shapiro\u2019s testimony. Nonetheless, we discuss the additional material offered by the plaintiffs to explain why, in combination with Shapiro\u2019s testimony, this evidence amply demonstrates that common issues of fact predominate for purposes of rule 23 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In this case the plaintiffs have asserted contract, tort, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>statutory claims, all predicated on the allegation that Wal-Mart engaged in \u201ca uniform and systematic scheme of wage abuse against [its] hourly paid associates in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d With little comment, the judge dismissed the additional material as insufficiently specific to Massachusetts and thus inadequate to meet the plaintiffs\u2019 certification burden. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We agree with the judge\u2019s observation that the great bulk of the additional material concerned Wal-Mart\u2019s national, corporate-wide labor policies and practices that make no specific reference to Massachusetts. Other material submitted by the plaintiffs, such as the Shipley Audit, does not focus in any significant way on the Commonwealth. But neither does any of this material, either directly or indirectly, exempt Massachusetts stores or Massachusetts hourly employees from labor and payroll directives imposed nationally by the home office. Because the gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims is that Massachusetts hourly employees were subjected to Wal-Mart\u2019s nationwide, uniform, wrongful actions, the dearth of specific references to Massachusetts in the additional material is not fatal to class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The plaintiffs present the additional materials, including policy directives, employee handbooks, and the like, as evidence of an implied-in-fact contract or enforceable promise concerning work breaks and off-the-clock work. See <em>LiDonni, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>355 Mass. 580, 583 (1969) (\u201cIn the absence of an express agreement, a contract implied in fact may be found to exist from the conduct and relations of the parties\u201d). The judge found these general corporate materials (among other things) sufficiently specific to the contract issue to survive a challenge on summary judgment. They are no less persuasive on the issue of class certification, where all members of the class were unarguably the beneficiaries of identical terms of employment. The necessary bridge to liability in Massachusetts is provided by the sworn and unsworn statements of Massachusetts hourly employees and managers about missed and shortened breaks and uncompensated work.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The judge nevertheless concluded that class treatment was not warranted on the liability issues because no Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>law requires paid rest breaks and no Wal-Mart policy forbids hourly employees from waiving breaks. The error was twofold. First, the absence of Massachusetts law on work breaks, while relevant to statutory claims, does not resolve the question whether Wal-Mart contractually or otherwise promised breaks to its hourly employees. Second, the waiver issue was a factual matter that the judge should have reserved to the jury. The judge acknowledged in his decertification order that \u201cthere exist no Wal-Mart policies allowing a waiver of rest breaks and, in fact, that there were policies in place, including disciplinary, which were intended to discourage associates from not taking their earned rest breaks.\u201d Wal-Mart\u2019s evidence that some Massachusetts hourly associates felt free to skip or shorten their breaks points to a disputed issue of material fact with regard to an affirmative defense (waiver) that Wal-Mart might offer. See <em>Smilow </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>323 F.3d 32, 39 (1st Cir. 2003) (\u201cEven in the unlikely event that individual waiver determinations prove necessary, the proposed class may still satisfy the predominance requirement. . . . Courts traditionally have been reluctant to deny class action status under Rule 23 (b) (3) simply because affirmative defenses may be available against individual members\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In short, the essential factual questions of liability in this case \u2014 Did a contract or agreement exist? On what terms? Did Wal-Mart commit a breach of the contract or agreement? \u2014 rest on a \u201csufficient constellation of common issues [to] bind[] class members together\u201d for purposes of certification. <em>Waste Mgt. Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mowbray, </em>208 F.3d 288, 296 (1st Cir. 2000). See <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., </em>434 Mass. 81, 91 (2001) (certification of plaintiff class appropriate where \u201c[although the contracts . . . appear to have been the product of independent, parallel negotiations, every contract created largely identical contractual obligations . . . and the program appears to have been administered in a substantially similar manner across the board\u201d); <em>Sniffin </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 724 (1981) (class action appropriate where, among other things, common questions \u201care so tightly interwoven in the dispute that they directly affect its resolution\u201d); <em>Smilow </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., supra </em>(predominance requirement met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>where \u201ccommon factual basis is found in the terms of the contract, which are identical for all class members\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Many of the judge\u2019s conclusions concerning the insufficiency of the additional material to demonstrate predominance, and the arguments advanced by Wal-Mart on this point, are more properly directed to questions of damages than to questions of liability. As we noted above, classes may be certified for the purpose of determining liability even where individual inquiries may be necessary on the issue of damages. See <em>Smilow </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., supra </em>at 40, quoting <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Barrack, </em>524 F.2d 891, 905 (9th Cr. 1975) (\u201cThe amount of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment\u201d). See also <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 361 (1977) (authorizing \u201cadditional proceedings after the liability phase of the trial to determine the scope of individual relief\u201d). Where damages issues are likely to require more individualized treatment, a judge has available a number of creative methods of managing questions of remedy in a manner that protects the defendant\u2019s rights while redressing harms to individual plaintiffs. See generally Newberg, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4:32, at 287-288 (\u201cCourts have developed several innovative management techniques to eliminate or minimize court burdens arising from management difficulties posed by class actions. With reference to problems of complexity or numerousness of individual questions remaining in a class action, courts have pointed to or have agreed to use devices such as conditional class certification[,] . . . limitation of the class to particular issues[,] . . . bifurcated trials for liability and damages, common proof of class damages, use of special masters or magistrates, use of liaison and lead counsel for the parties, class recovery distribution techniques involving cy pres notions, and monitoring procedures for time expended by class counsel to avoid duplication or excessiveness of hours\u201d). The judge should have recognized the availability of these alternatives before essentially denying thousands of potentially meritorious, yet small, claims.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997), quoting Kap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Ian, Continuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (I), 81 Harv. L.

See <em>Waste Mgt. Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mowbray, supra </em>at 295 (\u201cAn abuse of discretion . . . occurs [in class certification orders] if the court adopts an incorrect legal rule\u201d). The judge concluded, among other things, that <em>DeSisto, supra, </em>required, in the absence of allegedly reliable corporate records proving liability, that in order to maintain a class action, the plaintiffs\u2019 trial plan had to include \u201ctestimony from witnesses representative of the different positions held in each of the forty-seven Massachusetts stores covering the entire class period who could make the case of violations experienced by all class members.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\"><em>DeSisto </em>was brought pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 et seq. (2000). As the judge acknowledged, the FLSA contains specific provisions and a distinct jurisprudence governing when a plaintiff may bring an FLSA action in a representative capacity. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b); <em>DeSisto, supra </em>at 792 n.l (discussing representative<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ness in FLSA litigation). Thus, the case cannot fairly be read to establish any precedent in Massachusetts concerning class actions under our rule 23.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Nor has the case been cited, to our knowledge, by an appellate court in other class certification litigation under rule 23, much less to hold that a class action plaintiff seeking to carry his burden of proof under rule 23 or its equivalent must produce a trial plan containing testimony from witnesses with first-hand knowledge of every shift in every position at every store in the class during the class period.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In this case, the burden the judge imposed on the plaintiffs would be both onerous and unproductive in light of overwhelming evidence that all of the class members \u2014 people who staff the grill counter, receivers, cashiers, and so on \u2014 were subject to the identical terms and conditions regarding breaks and off-the-clock work, which (according to company policy) were to be followed stringently.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Additionally, citing <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381 (2004), the judge concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the number of uninjured class members was \u201cde minimis.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 398 n.21; <em>id. </em>at 405 (Cordy, J., dissenting). The judge\u2019s reliance was misplaced. In the <em>Aspinall </em>case, a class of Massachusetts consumers brought an action under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9 (2), against the manufacturer of a so-called \u201clight cigarette.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> They alleged that the defendant deceptively marketed the cigarettes as delivering lower amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>of tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes, when in fact the defendant knew that few, if any, smokers would derive such benefits from its product. <em>Id. </em>at 383 n.4. We concluded that class certification was proper where the class harm claimed was economic, that is, where members of the class alleged that they purchased the cigarettes at a price that was higher than it would have been had the true properties of the cigarettes been honestly advertised. <em>Id. </em>at 397-398. Parenthetically, we distinguished the case from those in which the defendant\u2019s marketing claims could be objectively tested, such as claims to produce certain health benefits. In the latter cases, we suggested, individual determinations might be necessary to prove individual harm, and class action treatment might not be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 397 n.19, 398 n.21. The dissent in <em>Aspinall </em>noted agreement with the court that \u201cclass certification should not be impeded by the presence of a de minimis number of uninjured class members who are difficult to identify with specificity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405 (Cordy, J., dissenting). The court\u2019s opinion does not mention a \u201cde minimis\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The dicta in the <em>Aspinall </em>case cited by the judge does not, either directly or by necessary implication, graft a separate, de minimis test onto rule 23 class actions to narrow or solidify the traditional analysis of predominance that we discussed above. One of the great strengths of the rule 23 class action device is its plasticity. Case-by-case considerations of practicality and fairness have enabled rule 23 certification decisions to adapt appropriately to a variety of contexts, even within the same litigation. See generally Newberg, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4:32 (listing techniques for managing class actions). By undercutting that intended flexibility, a bright-line de minimis requirement would vitiate the purpose of class actions.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> See <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997); Newberg, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.36 at 314 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(\u201cClass actions were designed not only to compensate victimized group-members, but also to deter violations of the law, especially when small individual claims are involved\u201d); <em>Iliadis </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>191 N.J. 88, 105 (2007), quoting <em>Riley </em>v. <em>New Rapids Carpet Ctr., </em>61 N.J. 218, 225 (1972) (noting that restrictive readings of class-action rule that require individual suits for small individual losses result in \u201cno deterrence to further aggressions\u201d).<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the judge abused his discretion in allowing Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to decertify the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">5. <em>Meal periods. </em>The motion judge reported his decision to grant partial summary judgment to Wal-Mart on \u201call aspects of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint regarding meal periods.\u201d See note 40, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Wal-Mart deprived class members of their meal periods comprised two legal claims: a statutory claim, based on G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 100,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and a contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">a. <em>Statutory claim. </em>As to the statutory claim, the motion judge correctly found that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 100, which requires that employers provide employees who work six hours or more with a thirty-minute meal period, does not create a private right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of action. The statute creates no explicit private right of action. Although \u00a7 100 is silent about the methods by which it may be enforced, an earlier section in the chapter, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cThe attorney general shall, except as otherwise specifically provided, enforce the provisions of this chapter, and shall have all necessary powers therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Certain sections of G. L. c. 149 do specifically provide for private rights of action, but \u00a7 100 does not. Thus G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, authorizes employees claiming to be aggrieved by violations of certain sections \u2014 specifically \u00a7\u00a7 148, 148B, 150C, 152, and 152A (relating to wages) \u2014 to \u201cinstitute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf, or for himself and for others similarly situated, a civil action for injunctive relief and any damages incurred, including treble damages for any loss of wages and other benefits.\u201d This provision does not, however, mention \u00a7 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Where the Legislature has not expressly provided for a private right of action, we may nonetheless infer an implied private right of action unless the Legislature explicitly prohibits us from doing so. <em>Loffredo </em>v. <em>Center for Addictive Behaviors, </em>426 Mass. 541, 544-545 (1998). Here, the Legislature\u2019s express language providing for enforcement by the Attorney General, \u201cexcept as otherwise specifically provided,\u201d combined with its specific provision of a private right of action for certain other sections of G. L. c. 149, but not for \u00a7 100, weighs heavily against recognizing a private right of action under \u00a7 100. See <em>id. </em>at 547, quoting <em>Transamerica Mtge. Advisors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 19 (1979) (\u201cwhere a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The plaintiffs argue that finding no implied right of action in \u00a7 100 would \u201crender the statute ineffective\u201d: \u201cNot only will the underlying purpose of [\u00a7] 100 best be served if employees are able to protect their right to obtain meal periods, it is highly unlikely that employees will come forward to report violations if there is no remedy for those wrongs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">b. <em>Contract claim. </em>The lack of a statutory private right of action presents no bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Wal-Mart vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>lated a contractual duty to provide meal periods to the plaintiff class. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the question whether a contract existed at all between Wal-Mart and its hourly employees, and the further question of what specific terms any such contract contained, are questions of fact to be resolved by the fact finder at trial.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> If Wal-Mart was, in fact, obligated by contract to provide meal breaks to the plaintiff class and Wal-Mart committed a breach of its contract by failing to provide such meal breaks, then the class members were harmed and may be awarded damages equal to the value of the bargained-for benefit of which they have been deprived. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 912 (2006), quoting <em>VMark Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 611 n.2 (1994) (\u201cThe long-established general rule for breach of contract recovery ... is that the wronged party should receive the benefit of his bargain . . .\u201d). Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 comment a (1981) (\u201cContract damages are ordinarily based on the injured party\u2019s expectation interest and are intended to give him the benefit of his bargain by awarding him a sum of money that will, to the extent possible, put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The motion judge concluded that \u201cgiven the undisputed fact that meal periods are unpaid, a missed meal period does not result in economic damages.\u201d Therefore, he reasoned, absent any independent private right of action under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 100, there can be no contract claim for missed meal periods. He therefore allowed Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue. However, merely because meal periods are unpaid, it does not follow that they have no value. To an hourly employee at Wal-Mart, the opportunity to stop work and eat a meal in peace during a busy workday may constitute a benefit of significant value. Wal-Mart argues that any employees who were made to work through their meal breaks were paid for that work, and so were unharmed by any breach of contract. Essentially, Wal-Mart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>argument is that only wages have value, and that other bargained-for benefits that may be part of an employment contract, such as meal breaks or indeed any form of unpaid leave, are valueless. We decline to reach such a sweeping conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The monetary value of a meal break cannot be held as a matter of law to be zero. Rather, the value of this putative contractual benefit is a question of fact to be resolved by the fact finder. Like any other party deprived of the benefit of their bargain, the plaintiffs should be awarded damages that are \u201cthe equivalent in money for the actual loss sustained by the wrong of another.\u201d <em>F.A. Bartlett Tree Expert Co. </em>v. <em>Hartney, </em>308 Mass. 407, 412 (1941). Summary judgment to Wal-Mart should not have entered on all matters relating to meal periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">6. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>In his summary judgment order, the judge concluded that the three-year statute of limitations provision of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, barred the plaintiffs from bringing any claims under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, for unpaid wages resulting from one-minute clock-outs and unauthorized insertions of meal periods that predate August 21, 1998. See <em>Malapanis </em>v. <em>Shirazi, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 383 (1986) (\u201cOn an appropriate record, summary judgment may be granted on the question whether a particular statute of limitations has run\u201d). The plaintiffs assert that the limitations period should be equitably tolled under either a theory of fraudulent concealment or the discovery role, because class members could not have known of Wal-Mart\u2019s time-shaving practices prior to the publication of the New York Times article on April 4, 2004, that exposed the practices. See note 33, <em>supra. </em>We agree with the judge that the plaintiffs have failed to make their case with respect to fraudulent concealment. However, we conclude that the plaintiffs have shown a disputed issue of material fact on the question whether equitable tolling is appropriate under the discovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">As to the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of fraudulent concealment, \u201c[wjhen a defendant fraudulently conceals a cause of action from the knowledge of a plaintiff, the statute of limitations is tolled under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 12, for the period prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of the cause of action.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 519 (1997).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Absent a fiduciary or other special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>duty, which the plaintiffs do not here assert, active fraud is ordinarily required to prove fraudulent concealment. See <em>Geo. Knight &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Watson Wyatt &amp; Co., </em>170 F.3d 210, 215-216 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying Massachusetts law). Wal-Mart presented evidence that its hourly employees had a \u201cmyriad of ways to determine whether they\u2019d been properly paid.\u201d These included checking their hours at the time clock or in the personnel office, checking the payroll archive report that hourly employees were required to sign prior to receiving their paychecks, checking their total hours and pay on their pay stubs, and (later in the class period) checking and adjusting their hours on the electronic time adjustment system. Wal-Mart also submitted affidavits from several hourly employees attesting that they regularly kept track of their hours, compared their personal records with Wal-Mart records, and, if they noticed inaccuracies, had them corrected by Wal-Mart. The plaintiffs, as the judge noted, did not dispute that hourly employees had access to the means of checking payroll. Rather, they alleged that Wal-Mart fraudulently concealed its allegedly wrongful practices by never providing hourly employees with information about or training to detect payroll discrepancies. This allegation, supported only thinly on summary judgment by references to brief statements in a handful of employees\u2019 affidavits, was not sufficient to create a disputed issue of material fact concerning fraudulent concealment. <em>Geo. Knight &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Watson Wyatt &amp; Co., supra. </em>See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In the alternative, the plaintiffs invoke the discovery rule. In essence, they claim that the time shaved from individual hourly employees\u2019 pay generally was sufficiently small that a reasonable person in the position of a class member would not know or could not reasonably have been expected to know that he was being denied compensation. See <em>Koe </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>450 Mass. 97, 101 (2007), quoting <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>408 Mass. 204, 205-206 (1990) (\u201cUnder [the] discovery rule, the statute of limitations starts when the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>have discovered, \u2018that [he] has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct\u2019 \u201d); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 245 (1991) (\u201cOnly if a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position would have been able to discern the harm or the cause of the harm will the cause of action accrue and the limitations period begin to run\u201d). Wal-Mart argues that its employee affidavits represented what the reasonable Wal-Mart employee would or should have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The reasonable person standard does not take into account \u201c[individual variations in judgment, intellect, or psychological health . . . unrelated to the complained-of conduct .... The reasonable person who serves as the standard in this evaluation, however, is not a detached, outside observer assessing the situation without being affected by it. Rather, it is a reasonable person who has been subjected to the conduct which forms the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally the question whether a plaintiff in a particular position knew or should have known of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct is for the fact finder. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>439 Mass. 281, 283-284 (2003) (\u201cThe question when the plaintiff knew or should have known that the defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of her injuries is one of fact . . .\u201d). Here, the factual issue is not so clear cut as to remove it from the fact finder\u2019s consideration. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In this case the plaintiffs presented evidence from former Wal-Mart managerial and payroll personnel in Massachusetts and elsewhere that they personally inserted meal breaks or one-minute clock-outs in hourly employees\u2019 time records or witnessed others doing so. They submitted documents attesting to Wal-Mart\u2019s awareness over many years that the problem of time shaving was widespread.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> And they argue that, given that most class members made the minimum wage and had small amounts of time allegedly shaved from their records, the individual losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>may have been too small to be readily detectable.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> We conclude that in the circumstances of this case, this evidence is sufficient to send to the jury the factual question whether a reasonable hourly employee would or should have known that time was being shaved from their paychecks, even though some hourly employees may have monitored their paychecks very closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We do not agree with the judge, or with Wal-Mart, that application of the discovery rule necessitates an individual inquiry about what each class member knew or should have known about Wal-Mart\u2019s alleged knowledge or condoning of time-shaving practices. The reasonable person test is an objective test. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra </em>at 283. Thus it presumptively operates as to all class members on the question of equitable tolling, even though a more individualized inquiry may be required on the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the order allowing Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert and decertify the class. We vacate the portions of the judge\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment to Wal-Mart that were reported to the Appeals Court. We remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of an order certifying the class and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> The putative class period extends from August 21, 1995, through December 31, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> In addition to the questions reported by the Superior Court judge, the plaintiffs argue in their application for direct appellate review that the judge \u201cerr[ed] in making factual determinations from affidavits drafted by WalMart\u2019s defense counsel that the jury may have rejected upon learning that those witnesses later recanted the statements at deposition and testified that they felt coerced to sign the affidavits.\u201d In light of our disposition we need not address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> Our summary of the salient facts is taken from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and order excluding the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert and decertifying the class, his memorandum of decision and order granting partial summary judgment to Wal-Mart, other orders related to this litigation, and additional material of record. We reserve for later discussion, as appropriate, the recitation of certain additional facts. Except as otherwise stated, the summary covers alleged actions and events occurring throughout the class period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\"> For example, one earlier version of the employee handbook states, among other things: \u201cOur expectation is very clear. Always clock in to begin your workday and at other appropriate times; ask your Supervisor for specific details. . . .

Wal-Mart, in answers to interrogatories posed by the plaintiffs, admitted that it intended that its handbook would be distributed to every hourly employee and that new hourly employees generally were required to attend orientation sessions, although it denied knowledge whether every hourly employee had in fact received the handbook and denied that all orientation sessions were conducted in an identical manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\"> The employee handbook, the orientation session, and other key documents in this litigation were amended from time to time throughout the class period.

Hourly employees who worked overtime without permission had their next week\u2019s schedules reduced by the amount of overtime worked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">A memorandum distributed to store managers stated that Wal-Mart\u2019s policy regarding breaks and off-the-clock work was one of the company\u2019s five \u201cnon-negotiables.\u201d The plaintiffs submitted portions of an affidavit from a Wal-Mart executive averring that Wal-Mart\u2019s break and off-the-clock policies could not be waived by Massachusetts hourly employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">In addition, the plaintiffs submitted posters, memoranda to employees, and other materials disseminated throughout the class period reminding hourly employees that they were required to follow company policy concerning breaks and overtime. We do not, of course, pass on the admissibility or credibility of this material at trial, which Wal-Mart vigorously contests through, among other materials, countering affidavits, which we discuss below. Wal-Mart contends that employees could, in fact, choose to waive their breaks. See note 53, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> During the class period, Wal-Mart sent numerous internal memoranda to store managers and other store-level managerial personnel reminding them to adhere strictly to the terms of PD-07 and PD-43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> The home office set \u201clabor guidelines\u201d for each store, consistent with Wal-Mart\u2019s business model, which, among other things, called for minimizing labor costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\"> For example, the plaintiffs submitted, among other things, numerous memoranda from Wal-Mart management to Massachusetts store managers demanding that particular store managers slash payrolls, eliminate overtime, and take other measures to control payroll expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\"> \u201cTime shaving\u201d is the practice of deleting time worked from employee payroll records or databases so that the employee receives less compensation than the amount to which he or she is entitled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> The plaintiffs submitted depositions from mid-level managers at Massachusetts Wal-Mart stores who testified either that they were instructed by store managers, or that it was their regular practice, to insert meal breaks into hourly employees\u2019 records even when employees had missed the meals. These managers also testified that some hourly employees complained or left WalMart because they were not getting their meals or their breaks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> Because meal break periods are unpaid, if an employee did not in fact take a meal period, but a supervisor nonetheless inserted the record of a meal period, that insertion would shave the length of the meal period (typically either thirty minutes or sixty minutes) from the employee\u2019s total hours and total compensation for that week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> A one-minute clock-out typically occurred when an hourly employee failed to swipe out at the end of a shift. The Wal-Mart manager then inserted a record of a clock-out one minute after the hourly employee had last clocked in. In some cases, these one-minute clock-outs were later corrected to reflect the actual shift worked by the hourly employee. Sometimes, however, the one-minute clock-out was not corrected, and so the hourly employee was not compensated for any work beyond the first minute. See note 46, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> The two time-shaving practices just described do not exhaust the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>allegations of time shaving. For example, the plaintiffs submitted deposition testimony from one Massachusetts Wal-Mart manager who testified that she was instructed by her store manager to \u201cput it back to the six-hour mark\u201d when employees worked longer than a six-hour shift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> For example, Polion averred that she was required to \u201czone\u201d (restock) areas of the store after she punched out for the evening; Salvas, in her answers to interrogatories, stated that, among other things, she was \u201cforced to work through . . . meal and rest breaks\u201d and that she \u201cwitnessed numerous other employees miss and/or have their breaks interrupted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> Here again, we make no judgment about the admissibility or credibility of this evidence, at least some of which is disputed by Wal-Mart.

For instance, one current Wal-Mart hourly employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>in Massachusetts attested: \u201cThere are . . . times when I make the choice not to take a full 15-minute break because I would rather spend my time on the job than sitting around.\u201d Another stated that she often did not take her second break because \u201cI had a lot of energy in the afternoon and just wanted to keep working.\u201d A third stated, \u201ca couple of times when it was really busy the [customer service manager] told me to go ahead and take my 15-minute rest break, but I chose not to. When I take my rest breaks I always smoke cigarettes, so if I choose to skip a break then I feel that I\u2019ve saved another <em>lxh </em>minutes of my life by not smoking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Nearly all of the affidavits of current hourly employees submitted by Wal-Mart include the statement (or minor variations thereof): \u201cBefore speaking with the attorney for Wal-Mart, I was informed that they represented Wal-Mart and did not represent me. I was also told that I did not have to answer any questions and could stop the interview at any time. I was informed that the interview was purely voluntary and that if I did not wish to speak, there would be no impact on my job.\u201d The plaintiffs claim that when they deposed \u201ca random selection of those affiants, each such witness recanted the statements drafted by Wal-Mart\u2019s defense counsel\u201d and testified that he or she had been \u201cintimidated\u201d into signing.

R. Civ. R. 23 (b), 365 Mass. 767 (1974). The judge dismissed Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201cconventional\u201d argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims would necessarily entail inquiries into each class member\u2019s state of mind and particular circumstances relative to Wal-Mart\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct. He concluded that \u201cfor certification purposes, the Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence that Wal-Mart had a consistent corporate policy . . . [that] is based on Wal-Mart\u2019s allegedly uniform promises to the Plaintiffs and the class\u201d concerning rest and meal breaks and off-the-clock work. The judge further stated that, although there \u201cmay be \u2014 and .indeed demonstrably are \u2014 numerous innocuous reasons\u201d why individual hourly employees may not have been compensated for their labor, the plaintiffs intended to produce \u201cexpert statistical analysis which will be probative and admissible, and which, in its predicate, will discount individualized nonactionable reasons for WalMart\u2019s failures to compensate.\u201d He concluded that Wal-Mart\u2019s own internal audits and time records permitted him to credit the existence of statistical facts sufficient for class certification, and that the admissibility and persuasiveness of such facts, and the issue of damages, were not appropriate to determine at the class certification stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Rule 23 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 767 (1974), provides: \u201cOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Rule 23 (b) provides: \u201cAn action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> The single justice noted, inter alla, that because the plaintiffs represented that they intended to rebut claims that individual issues would require separate trials by relying on certain statistics and methodologies, these means of capturing data \u201care the justification for proceeding on a class rather than on an individual basis.

L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, in spite of the fact that leave to amend the complaint to add the \u00a7 148 cause of action previously had been denied. See Altering of Worker Time Cards Spurs Growing Number of Suits, New York Times, April 4, 2004, at 1, 16.

However, Wal-Mart provided only paper records for the period from August, 1995, through January, 2001, having purged the electronic records from its system. At Shapiro\u2019s direction, the plaintiffs retained independent contractors to recreate electronic records from the hard copies. Shapiro notes that Wal-Mart, \u201cin return for sharing a portion of the costs of that project (which [in total] costs exceeded $350,000), negotiated the terms of the vendor protocol and requested that additional information and quality control measures be used by the document restoration vendors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Wal-Mart retained legible paper records for 86.38 per cent of the pay periods between August, 1995, and January, 2001.

Where data were available only for a portion of the class period, he used that data to make an estimate regarding the remainder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>class period; and in one instance, he used a sample of twenty-five Massachusetts Wal-Mart stores to draw conclusions about all forty-seven Massachusetts stores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> Pressed repeatedly at the evidentiary hearing whether he assumed that the records were perfectly accurate, Shapiro testified, \u201cI never assume anything is all or none, or never or always.

And outside of, you know, the very occasional affidavit that you now drag up, you know, five or ten years later, there\u2019s no evidence that the company employees didn\u2019t do what the company employees are recorded to have done.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> Shapiro also offered his opinion that certain rules of Wal-Mart\u2019s timekeeper system operate in a manner that itself amounts to time shaving. For example, if an hourly employee\u2019s shift is between three and six hours, so that the hourly employee is entitled to a rest break but no meal break, if the hourly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>employee takes a rest break of 25 minutes or longer, the <em>entire </em>break is coded as an unpaid \u201cmeal break\u201d and the hourly employee does not receive his or her 15 minutes of paid rest break.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">For an explanation of one-minute clock-outs, see note 18, <em>supra. </em>Shapiro counted only those cases in which the one-minute clock-out remained uncorrected at the close of the week\u2019s payroll, and furthermore, no adjustment in the form of a cash payment was made within seven days of the end of the payroll period. Shapiro counted 29,176 records of uncompensated one-minute clock-outs during the putative class period, resulting in $879,238 in lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Although not relevant for purposes of deciding the issues here, Shapiro used a seven-day period because of the requirement of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, that wages be paid \u201cwithin seven days of the termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned,\u201d or sooner depending on the number of days worked by the employee. Shapiro\u2019s calculation was challenged by Wal-Mart\u2019s expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The proportion of all shifts containing a missed rest break was high (more than fifty per cent) throughout the class period, but was slowly declining. Shapiro\u2019s estimates for missed rest breaks after 2001 projected that this slow rate of decline would continue in a linear fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Shapiro noted and interpolated a total of 4,911,737 missed rest breaks, with a monetary value of $9,935,594, during the period from August 21, 1995, through February 8, 2001 (from the start of the putative class period to the date of the policy change regarding clocking in for rest breaks). See note 9, <em>supra. </em>Shapiro estimated that from 2001 to 2005, if the slow rate of decline continued, there would have been 6,297,913 missed rest breaks with a monetary value of $15,288,184.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Cashiers are the only group of hourly employees for which this separate database was available, and Shapiro considered it reliable for a subset of cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>registers only: so-called \u201coperator-accountable\u201d registers, for which the individual cashier is responsible for any shortages in the cash drawer. Operator-accountable registers also automatically log cashiers out after a period of inactivity. Shapiro counted apparent off-the-clock work at that subset of registers, and imposed certain other restrictions on the data. Reliable data were available only for the years 2001-2005. Shapiro noted that in 2003, Wal-Mart implemented a software change that prevented hourly employees from logging on to a cash register unless they were clocked in for work. He then averaged the prevalence of off-the-clock work in the 2001-2003 data to extrapolate backward and arrive at estimates for the years from 1995 to 2000. Also, in this calculation only, Shapiro utilized the merged point-of-sale and timekeeper data from \u201ca representative, unbiased sample of twenty-five of the forty-seven stores for which data was produced\u201d to make an estimate as to the remaining stores. Wal-Mart challenges Shapiro\u2019s estimates on a variety of grounds not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Shapiro estimated a total figure of $423,010 for the lost wages due to off-the-clock work by cashiers during the putative class period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Shapiro considered only inserted meal periods of exactly thirty or sixty minutes. Shapiro\u2019s report acknowledged that his estimate of the total damages resulting from improperly inserted meal breaks would drop when time adjustment requests (TARs) (by hourly employees to managers) are taken into account. Presumably, he suggested, when an hourly employee requested that a supervisor insert a meal break, that meal break was actually taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Before taking account of the TARs, Shapiro estimated, the monetary value of the inserted meal periods was $94,779.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\"> Martin noted that hourly employees sometimes request such insertions, and also argued that Shapiro should have looked beyond a seven-day window for subsequent cash payments restoring hourly employees\u2019 pay. See note 46, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> Martin noted that hourly employees sometimes request that managers insert meal periods for a previous day either orally or through TARs; she also noted that prior to May, 2001, hourly employees could authorize a change by initialing an exception report, and that Shapiro did not tabulate this additional data source.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\"> Martin contended that Shapiro\u2019s estimate of the number of missed rest breaks during the 2001-2005 period (after Wal-Mart eliminated swiping for rest breaks in 2001, see note 9 and accompanying text, <em>supra) </em>is unreliable because it assumes that the trend (a slight decline) in missed rest breaks continued throughout the period, taking no account of the fact that Wal-Mart \u201cundertook various initiatives regarding meal and rest break compliance\u201d during the period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> The parties dispute whether it was permissible under the pertinent WalMart policies for an employee to miss a break voluntarily, or whether, as asserted by the plaintiffs, the breaks were nonwaivable. In addition, in the event that Wal-Mart is correct that the breaks are waivable, the parties also dispute whether the rest breaks were, in general, voluntarily waived, or whether, as asserted by the plaintiffs, hourly employees generally missed breaks because they were assigned to complete tasks that could realistically be completed only by missing breaks. These two separate issues \u25a0\u2014 the waivability of breaks under the relevant policy, and whether employees in fact waived them voluntarily \u2014 are both issues of fact that must be resolved by the fact finder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> Martin claims that the failure of the timekeeping system\u2019s clock and the point-of-sale system\u2019s clock to be synchronized could lead to inflated estimates of off-the-clock work, although Shapiro contends that he takes this factor into account. Martin also asserts that Shapiro has no basis for assuming that his sample of twenty-five stores, see note 43, <em>supra, </em>accurately reflects the other twenty-two stores open in Massachusetts during the class period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> See note 42, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> At the evidentiary hearing, the motion judge stated: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out whether the records are reliable. Okay? That\u2019s really what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d In his order excluding Shapiro\u2019s testimony, the motion judge concluded, \u201cthe plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Shapiro\u2019s analysis of the records supplies the records with any credibility as to their accuracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\"> The motion judge was not presented squarely with a motion to exclude Wal-Mart\u2019s business records from evidence, and he did not analyze the question of their admissibility. However, because he concluded that the question of the admissibility of much of Shapiro\u2019s testimony turned essentially on the admissibility of Wal-Mart\u2019s records, see note 56, <em>supra, </em>his assessment of the admissibility of those records should have been informed by the usual standards for the admissibility of business records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"> Neither Wal-Mart nor the plaintiffs seek to rely entirely on, or to challenge in their entirety, Wal-Mart\u2019s business records. Rather, the parties draw different conclusions from those records. For example, with respect to meal breaks, the plaintiffs generally contend that the records of employees\u2019 time clock punches accurately reflected time worked, <em>prior </em>to the thirty or sixty-minute meal period insertions by managers; Wal-Mart contends that those insertions corrected inaccuracies and rendered the data more accurate. Such disagreements about how to interpret Wal-Mart\u2019s business records are to be resolved by the fact finder. They do not render the records inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The motion judge\u2019s additional criticisms of Shapiro\u2019s methodology likewise go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. For example, the motion judge speculates that the pattern of missed rest breaks Shapiro identifies might be explained if \u201cthe associates might have felt less energized to take the trouble to walk to the time clock\u201d in the afternoons. This proposition of the judge, unsupported by any reference to the record, at most affects the weight rather than the admissibility of Shapiro\u2019s argument on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">More broadly, the motion judge would have preferred that Shapiro \u201clegitimize [his] methodology\u201d by \u201cconducting an investigation into whether the records correspond to the reality of the system Wal-Mart had in place,\u201d an investigation that, the motion judge suggested, might take the form of \u201crepresentative inquiries\u201d of class members Shapiro could randomly select from the class list. Additional investigation of the kind suggested might be probative. But any criticism of Shapiro on the ground that he did not employ additional potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>investigative methodologies the judge might have preferred be undertaken again goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The judge stated, among other things, that \u201cat a minimum, the plaintiffs would need to establish that every [hourly employee] was actually working during the period for which there are missing swipes for an earned rest break, and that the [hourly employee] did not take the rest break and/or that the [hourly employee] did not voluntarily come back early from a break and was in fact performing work during the minutes the break was short of fifteen minutes . . . [and] that every [hourly employee] was the actual [hourly employee] working on the operator-accountable register which he was logged on to during the alleged \u2018off-the-clock\u2019 period . . . and that every [hourly employee] performed work for the shifts in which allegedly unauthorized one-minute clock-outs appear.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The judge premised his conclusion on a trio of cases decided under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 et seq. (2000): <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680 (1946) <em>(Anderson), Rural Fire Protection Co. </em>v. <em>Hepp, </em>366 F.2d 355 (9th Cir. 1966) <em>(Rural Fire), </em>and <em>Secretary of Labor </em>v. <em>DeSisto, </em>929 F.2d 789 (1st Cir. 1991) <em>(DeSisto).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> The judge stated: \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 class liability evidence falls into a number of categories. Without attempting to be exhaustive in cataloging all of the evidence the plaintiffs will rely upon, these categories, beyond Wal-Mart\u2019s timekeeping databases, include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">\u201c(a) Wal-Mart\u2019s corporate internal communications, before and during the class period, which acknowledge the widespread existence of time shaving and off-the-clock work caused by payroll pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">\u201c(b) Grass roots complaints, some from Massachusetts associates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and cashier survey results for several years indicating ongoing problems with large numbers of associates, all pressured to cut short or miss their meal or rest breaks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c(c) Audit Reports of store internal audits from September, 1999, through July, 2000, also indicating that a significant number of associates might not have been or in fact were not obtaining the meal and rest breaks to which they were entitled. None of the results were specific to Massachusetts stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c(d) A 1999 Store Audit Program which instructs auditors to determine missed breaks by using Wal-Mart\u2019s payroll records in the same way the plaintiffs and Shapiro are now using them to identify missed breaks. This document is supplemented by a series of audits in 2000 which implemented these instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201c(e) An audit report of July 17, 2000 (\u2018Shipley Audit\u2019), supplemented by Wal-Mart corporate follow-up treatment, which also indicated, based on a large number of exceptions appearing on the Exception Report, that Wal-Mart was not providing to associates in significant numbers the meal and rest breaks to which they were entitled. The Shipley Audit involved 128 stores across the United States, two of which were from Massachusetts. No specific results from the two Massachusetts stores are available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">\u201c(f) Depositions and affidavits of the class representatives and of other Wal-Mart associates, a small number from Massachusetts and others from outside Massachusetts, who state they missed meal or rest breaks because of understaffing at their stores, and, in fewer numbers, who state they were subject to unauthorized meal insertions and one-minute clock-outs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">\u201c(g) Testimony of a relatively small number of current and former associates of Wal-Mart at corporate and store levels, acknowledging the practice of cost-cutting policies and their adverse impact on the ability of associates to obtain meal and rest breaks, acknowledging in fact the unauthorized existence of store managers using the one-minute clock-out and inserting meals, and acknowledging that Wal-Mart\u2019s policies were designed to encourage and condone such conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> Wal-Mart claims on appeal that although the judge did not ground his decertification decision on due process grounds, \u201c[cjonsiderations of due process . . . counsel against reversal\u201d of his order because class action procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>might thwart \u201cWal-Mart\u2019s right to present a defense.\u201d Wal-Mart\u2019s brief argument on this point is entirely theoretical. Wal-Mart has ably and robustly presented its defenses thus far. It has not identified, and we do not discern, a lack of concern for Wal-Mart\u2019s due process rights on the part of any of the judges who have ruled on this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> In citing to <em>DeSisto, supra, </em>the judge also appeared to conflate the requirement of representativeness under rule 23 (a) with that of predominance under rule 23 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> We do not consider either <em>Anderson, supra, </em>or <em>Rural Fire, supra, </em>germane to our discussion of class action certification under rule 23 because, as in <em>Desisto, </em>those two cases concern representative actions quite different from those brought pursuant to rule 23. Moreover, these cases concern the computation of damages on the basis of business records, a matter that is premature in the early stage of this litigation. See <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 694 (remanding case for determination of computation of amount of off-the-clock and on-the-clock time devoted to work activities); <em>Rural Fire, supra </em>at 359 (noting use by plaintiffs and District Court of employer\u2019s own time records in computation of time worked).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"><em> Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381 (2004), notes that rule 23 class actions differ from G.

R 23\u201d). \u201cAlthough the requirements of rule 23 (a) provide a \u2018useful framework for an analysis,\u2019 we have cautioned a judge deciding a motion for class certification under G. L. c. 93A to avoid equating the similarity requirements of rule 23 (a) with requirements of \u00a7 9 (2) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>parties seeking certification are \u2018similarly situated\u2019 and have suffered a \u2018similar injury\u2019 as members of the class they seek to represent.\u201d We noted that a judge has broader discretion under rule 23 than under G. L. c. 93A to determine the propriety of class certification. <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., supra </em>at 391-392, quoting <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Gas Co., </em>394 Mass. 595, 605 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> Nor can the instant case be analogized, as the judge held, to <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Gas Co., supra </em>at 603-604, a case in which different companies represented the defendant and \u201cquestions relating to proximate cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>specific injuries, levels and sources of formaldehyde, installation mechanics, knowledge of defect or danger, adoption of representations, reliance upon misrepresentations, and time of discovery all require individualized proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. Here, as discussed and without considering the merits, the plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence by way of Wal-Mart documents, including audits, to establish that common issues of fact and law will predominate on the key issues of liability: Wal-Mart\u2019s legal obligations, if any, to its hourly employees for breaks and compensation and its alleged class-wide breach of those obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> In its brief to this court, Wal-Mart asserts in cursory fashion that to certify the class would harm the interests of class members, who cannot under Massachusetts law opt out of the class. It is difficult to envision how bringing a class action under the plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint would hamper the rights of those who have either not been damaged by the alleged conduct or do not care to press their claim for damages.

P. 23 (d) (judges \u201cmay\u201d take action to ensure absent class members are fairly and adequately represented).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 100, provides: \u201cNo person shall be required to work for more than six hours during a calendar day without an interval of at least thirty minutes for a meal.
