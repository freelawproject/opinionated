A judge in the District Court concluded that the appeal was timely. The Appeals Court disagreed and reversed. <em>Pavian, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. <em>477 </em>(2007). We granted the employee\u2019s application for further appellate review, and now affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Robert Hickey, Jr., was employed by Pavian, Inc. (Pavian), as a chef. On December 8, 2004, Pavian discharged Hickey for the alleged theft of plastic bags and for serving the remains of a leg of lamb to himself and another employee as an employee meal. Hickey applied for unemployment benefits to the division, which approved his application. Pavian then requested and received a hearing before a review examiner, who concluded that Hickey was not entitled to benefits because he had been discharged for \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. c. \u00a7 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2). The transmission memorandum accompanying the examiner\u2019s decision notified Hickey that he \u201cmay Appeal this Decision to the Board of Review. The last date to file an Appeal is April 15, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Title 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b) (postmark rule), applicable to proceedings before the board and other administrative agencies, provides that \u201c[a]ll papers filed by U.S. mail shall be deemed filed on the date contained in the U.S. postal cancellation stamp or U.S. postmark . . . .\u201d Represented by counsel, and in reliance on the regulation, Hickey mailed his appeal to the board in an envelope postmarked April 15, 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board received the application on April 19, 2005. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>somewhat extended proceedings before the board,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the board reversed the decision of the review examiner and on August 25, 2005, concluded that Hickey was entitled to receive unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, Pavian then filed a complaint for judicial review in the District Court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> claiming for the first time that Hickey\u2019s appeal to the board was not timely.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A judge in the District Court disagreed, holding that the \u201ceffective\u201d date of the appeal was the date on which it was postmarked. The Appeals Court disagreed. In essence, the Appeals Court concluded that by applying the postmark rule of 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b) to the thirty-day period to \u201cfile an application for a review\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, the District Court judge impermissibly overrode the Legislature\u2019s intent that application for review actually be received by the board within the appeal period (\u201creceipt rule\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Pavian, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hickey, supra </em>at 482-483. The Appeals Court reversed the judgment in favor of Hickey and remanded the case for dismissal of Hickey\u2019s appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>In reversing the District Court, the Appeals Court relied principally on our decision in <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 814 (2006). There we held that the court would defer to the decision of the Civil Service Commission (commission) to apply the postmark rule to its administrative appeals where the relevant statutory provision provided that a griev-ant may \u201cappeal in writing\u201d to the commission, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, and where the Legislature empowered the commission to adopt the procedural rules necessary to conduct its business, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (g). <em>Id. </em>at 815, 817. We reasoned that, because the statutory language neither specifies \u201cany particular act required to perfect an appeal,\u201d nor identifies any particular place in which an appeal must be filed, we would not unsettle the longstanding reliance on the postmark rule. <em>Id. </em>at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">General Laws c. 151A nowhere defines the term \u201cfile.\u201d Thus, although G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 40, permits the construction reached by the Appeals Court and urged by Pavian, neither the statute itself nor our decision in <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>demands it. The substantial deference owed to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is charged to enforce \u201cincludes approving an interpretation of statutory language that may be read in two ways.\u201d <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 50-51 n.6 (2006). Such deference is particularly appropriate here because the legislative history of the statute does not evince any legislative intent to dislodge the postmark rule in determining the timeliness of appeals to the board. Moreover, the issue arises against the backdrop of a legislative directive of thirty years to provide uniformity to the procedural rules of agency determinations, of which the postmark rule is one.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In 1978, the Commissioner of Administration,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>by the Legislature, promulgated the Standard Adjudicatory Rules of Practice and Procedure, 801 Code Mass. Regs, \u00a7\u00a7 1.00, 138 Mass. Reg. 167-205 (Dec. 29, 1978) (standard rules). Among other regulations, the standard rules contained the postmark rule. <em>Id. </em>at 191-192.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the Appeals Court recognized, \u201cthe standard adjudicatory rules include the postmark rule,\u201d <em>Pavian, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hickey, supra </em>at 483, and the standard rules \u201capply to the board proceeding in question in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479. In view of this long-standing practice of the board, we may defer to the agency\u2019s rule-making decision. This is so for another reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In 1990, after the postmark rule had been in force for eighteen years specifically for the board, and for twelve years generally in the standard rules, the Legislature revisited and extensively amended G. L. c. 151 A, governing unemployment compensation. St. 1990, c. 154. Among other changes, G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, see St. 1970, c. 421, was amended to increase the appeals period from ten days to thirty days, see St. 1990, c. 154, \u00a7 29. The amendment did not undermine the division\u2019s long-standing use of the postmark rule in such circumstances. When the Legislature revisits and amends a statute without changing the language at issue after a court or agency has construed it, we may conclude that the Legislature intended to incorporate authoritative agency and judicial interpretations of the language into the amended statute. We may presume the Legislature was aware of the board\u2019s long-standing application of the postmark rule to appeals lodged before it, and certainly the Legislature knew how to direct the board to apply a different procedural rule. See <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 820 n.8 (\u201c[W]e may presume that the Legislature has been aware of the commission\u2019s adoption of the postmark rule during the last twenty-five years. . . . The absence of any legislative objection whatsoever during that time is telling\u201d [citation omitted]). See also <em>Alves\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>171, 180 (2008) (because we presume \u201cthat the Legislature is aware of the 2002 decision by the board . . . and has not acted to amend the statute, we cannot state that the board\u2019s continual reliance on its holding ... is unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">To a lesser extent, the Appeals Court also relied on our holdings in <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>412 Mass. 464, 466-467 (1992), and <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 417, 420 (1985). Those opinions are distinguishable for two reasons. First, the statutes at issue expressly state that filing is perfected in a particular place.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, those cases concerned judicial review and not administrative appeals, and therefore did not carry with them the postmark rule\u2019s long history of use and persistent vitality in standard administrative procedure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Although the Appeals Court concluded that the postmark rule was incompatible with the word \u201cfile\u201d in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, there are many regulatory and statutory circumstances in which the date of \u201cfiling\u201d is defined as the date of mailing. As described above, the standard rules include the postmark rule. See 801 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b). Other agencies have expressly defined \u201cfile\u201d to include the postmark rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Many rules that refer to filing set forth criteria for determining the moment at which filing has occurred. See, e.g, Mass. R. Civ. P. 77 (c), 365 Mass. 837 (1974) (papers \u201cshall be deemed to have been filed as of the date of receipt\u201d). Indeed, the filing deadlines with which claimants may be most familiar \u2014 the Commonwealth\u2019s and the United States\u2019s annual deadlines to \u201cfile\u201d taxes \u2014 both employ the postmark rule.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Construing the filing requirement of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, to permit the postmark rule also comports with the statute\u2019s general purpose. The Legislature has directed the unemployment benefits statute to be \u201cconstrued liberally in aid of its purpose, which purpose is to lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his family.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 74. Workers who are discharged from their jobs through no fault of their own face hardship and anxiety, which should not be exacerbated by administrative procedures governing their appeals. There is only one division office in the Commonwealth. Exclusive use of the receipt rule could force hardship on many claimants requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>appeals by requiring them either to travel great distances or to pay for expedited means of transmission (such as facsimile or messenger service) with funds they do not have or cannot afford to pay. No matter how far in advance a claimant mails his or her application for review, he or she can never be certain that it will be received on time. It would be excessively burdensome and costly to require claimants remote from the division\u2019s office to monitor rigorously the transmission of their applications to be certain that their appeals were timely, as exclusive use of the receipt rule would require.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that by enacting G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, the Legislature did not intend to reject the postmark rule as it applies to appeals to the board of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-18\"> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 40, provides: \u201cA claimant or interested party may, within thirty days after mailing to him of notice of the decision, file an application for a review of such decision by the board of review.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> A decision by a review examiner of the division of unemployment assistance (division) of an unemployment insurance claim is re viewable by its board of review (board).

We rejected the argument that, under Mass. R. Civ.
