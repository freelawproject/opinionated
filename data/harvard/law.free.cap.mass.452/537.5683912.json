Redstone and his brother, Edward, breached their fiduciary duties to their children in connection with the redemption of shares in a family business, National Amusements, Inc. (NAI), that Sumner and Edward at various times held in trust for their children. Sumner\u2019s children are Brent and Shari; Edward\u2019s children are Ruth Ann and Michael David (Michael). The plaintiffs are Michael and the current trustees of three trusts that once held shares in NAI for the benefit of Sumner\u2019s and Edward\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The plaintiffs commenced their action in the Superior Court in 2006, complaining about redemptions of NAI stock that occurred decades earlier, in 1972 and 1984. They claim that in 1972, Edward wrongfully converted shares of NAI that he allegedly had been holding in trust for Ruth Ann and Michael, and sold those shares to NAI pursuant to a redemption agreement authorized by Sumner personally and on NAI\u2019s behalf (the plaintiffs claim that Sumner aided and abetted Edward\u2019s wrongdoing). The plaintiffs also claim that, in 1984, Sumner orchestrated the redemption of additional shares of NAI held in trust for Ruth Ann and Michael, as well as shares held in trust for Brent and Shari, for inadequate consideration. Through the two redemptions, Edward (as to the first) and Sumner (as to both) allegedly breached their fiduciary duties and duties of loyalty, engaged in self-dealing, and became unjustly enriched. See G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A (personal liability of trustee for breach of trust). The plaintiffs seek rescission of the redemptions and re-conveyance of the redeemed shares, or money damages representing the current value of those shares; they also seek disgorgement of all profits realized by Sumner and Edward pursuant to the redemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">As for the plaintiffs\u2019 delay in commencing their action, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>claim that they did not become aware of their claims until 2004, when, in connection with unrelated family litigation, documents and other information concerning the 1972 and 1984 redemp-tions were discovered. The defendants \u2014 Sumner, Edward, and NAI \u2014 moved to dismiss the action, principally on statute of limitations grounds (each brother filed his own motion; NAI joined Sumner\u2019s).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They argued that the three-year statute of limitations applicable to claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, expired in 1987 because the operative facts underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were known in 1984 to a successor trustee, James R. DeGiacomo. They also claimed that, in 1984, Michael (who was then approximately twenty-seven years old) had the requisite knowledge, at least of the 1984 redemption, for the statute of limitations to commence on his claim regarding that redemption. In support of their motions, the defendants filed numerous exhibits relating to the redemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">A judge in the Superior Court, noting that the statute of limitations claims were \u201cstrongly presented,\u201d but \u201crest ... in significant part on facts outside the four comers of the complaint,\u201d denied the motions to dismiss without prejudice to the defendants\u2019 raising the same claims at a later juncture. The judge stayed discovery except for that which he deemed relevant to the statute of limitations issue: the deposition of DeGiacomo and the production of NAI\u2019s financial statements from 1983 and 1984.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Following discovery as limited by the judge, the defendants jointly moved for summary judgment solely on statute of limitations grounds. The judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>judge concluded that, as of 1984, DeGiacomo had the requisite knowledge of both the 1972 and 1984 redemptions \u201cto have brought suit against Sumner and Edward for any breaches of their fiduciary duties.\u201d Relying on <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 523 (1997), the judge opined that the three-year statute of limitations \u201cwould seem to begin to run against a trust and its beneficiaries when knowledge is gained by a prior trustee not involved in a predecessor\u2019s malfeasance.\u201d The judge also concluded that, in 1984, Michael had the requisite knowledge of the 1984 redemption to start the running of the limitations clock on his claims concerning that redemption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the judge, none of the plaintiffs \u201cdemonstrated facts that take this case outside the impact of the three-year statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The plaintiffs appealed. We granted their application for direct appellate review. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendants\u2019 joint motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 1959, Michael \u201cMickey\u201d Redstone (Mickey), the father of Sumner and Edward, formed NAI as a closely held corporation to own and operate open-air movie theaters. Mickey caused 300 shares to issue, one hundred registered in his name and one hundred registered in the names of each of his two sons. See generally 12 W.M. Fletcher, Private Corporations \u00a7 5489 (rev. ed. 2004) (discussing purposes of registering stock transfers on corporate books, including identifying shareholders). No copies of any stock certificates appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>In 1968, Mickey created the Michael Redstone Trust (Grandchildren\u2019s Trust) for the benefit of Sumner\u2019s and Edward\u2019s children, and their heirs. At the time, Sumner\u2019s children, Brent and Shari, were approximately eighteen and fourteen years old; Edward\u2019s children, Ruth Ann and Michael, were approximately fourteen and eleven years old. Mickey funded the trust with his remaining fifty shares in NAI (sometime earlier, NAI had redeemed Mickey\u2019s other fifty shares). The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust specified that the fifty shares were to be divided in equal parts among the four grandchildren \u2014 i.e., that twelve and one-half shares would be held in trust for each grandchild. The trustees of the trust were Mickey\u2019s wife, Bella; Sumner; and Edward. The trust included no specific provision addressing the procedure to be followed in case the shares were redeemed by NAI. The principal of the trust was to be distributed to each beneficiary when he or she reached thirty-five years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">a. <em>The 1972 redemption. </em>In the late 1960\u2019s, disagreements arose between Mickey and Sumner on the one hand and Edward on the other, resulting in Edward\u2019s leaving NAI in 1971. At the time, Edward was an employee of NAI; Mickey was withdrawing from NAI but was still involved with decisions that affected the company; and Sumner was president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board of directors. Edward demanded but did not receive the one hundred shares registered in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Edward then retained attorney James R. DeGiacomo to help him obtain the shares. Toward that end, DeGiacomo commenced two actions in the Superior Court against Mickey, Sumner, NAI, and Northeast Theater Corporation (an affiliate of NAI). Thereafter, DeGiacomo, on behalf of Edward, engaged in settlement negotiations with Sumner and Mickey. At an early point in the negotiations, DeGiacomo explored whether Edward could remain associated with the family business in some capacity. When it became clear that such a resolution was impossible, the negotiations focused on the redemption of Edward\u2019s shares of NAI.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">During the negotiations, there was disagreement about Edward\u2019s entitlement to all one hundred shares registered in his name. Mickey and Sumner contended that Edward was entitled at most to fifty shares because, according to Mickey and Sumner, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>1959, in connection with the issuance of the one hundred shares registered in the names each of Sumner and Edward, Mickey had established oral trusts whereby Sumner and Edward, as trustees, each held fifty shares of NAI in trust for their respective children and fifty shares individually. Edward denied that any such oral trusts had been established.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The dispute over Edward\u2019s ownership of the shares was settled in 1972. The settlement was reduced to a written agreement. De-Giacomo negotiated the terms of the agreement. The agreement provided, among other things, that since NAI\u2019s formation (in 1959), Edward had been \u201cholding a certain portion\u201d of the one hundred shares registered in his name for the benefit of his children, but that Edward \u201cdispute[d] the percentage thereof.\u201d The agreement further stated that Mickey \u201chas asserted\u201d that, when NAI was formed, \u201cthere was an agreement\u201d that \u201cnot less than 50%\u201d of the stock registered in Edward\u2019s name would be \u201cheld by him in trust for the benefit of his children,\u201d and that Edward \u201cdid not own said 50% . . . though registered in his name.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The settlement agreement represented a \u201ccompromise\u201d (in DeGiacomo\u2019s words), through which the parties agreed that Edward owned sixty-six and two-thirds shares of NAI; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>would sell those shares to NAI for $5 million; and that with respect to the remaining thirty-three and one-third shares registered to him, he would execute written, irrevocable declarations of trust for Ruth Ann and Michael \u2014 each trust to hold sixteen and two-thirds shares of NAI. Thus, the total number of shares Edward agreed to be put in trust were sixteen and two-thirds fewer than the fifty shares that Mickey and Sumner alleged Edward held pursuant to the preexisting oral trusts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parties also agreed that Sumner would be appointed as initial sole trustee of both trusts (Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s); that Edward would serve as trustee of neither trust; and that Edward would relinquish his role as cotrustee of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust (he was replaced by NAI\u2019s general counsel, Louis Winer; Winer joined Bella and Sumner as cotrustee). The settlement agreement was signed by all of the parties to the two actions that DeGiacomo had filed on Edward\u2019s behalf, and by DeGiacomo as a witness. Sumner signed in both his individual capacity and as president of NAI. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, NAI paid DeGiacomo $135,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for his work on the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In a separate agreement signed by Edward and Sumner (as president of NAI), NAI redeemed Edward\u2019s sixty-six and two-thirds shares for $5 million; payment was made solely to Edward.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Edward also executed irrevocable declarations of trust for Ruth Ann and Michael, and their heirs \u2014 the Ruth Ann Redstone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Trust (Ruth Ann Trust) and the Michael David Redstone Trust (Michael Trust) \u2014 with each trust holding sixteen and two-thirds shares of NAI. Sumner and DeGiacomo negotiated the provisions of those trusts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The trusts stated, in pertinent part, that they were intended to \u201cmemorialize\u201d prior \u201coral trust[s]\u201d under which Edward had been holding shares of NAI for Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s benefit; that neither Ruth Ann nor Michael was entitled to receive any principal of the trusts before reaching forty years of age; that Sumner would serve as sole trustee of each trust (with the power to appoint successor trustees); that the trustee (initially Sumner) could sell the shares of NAI held in each trust if he determined such a sale to be in the beneficiaries\u2019 best interests; and that the trustee (initially Sumner) would be immune from any liability in connection with such a sale.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the event of a proposed sale of the shares, NAI would have the right of first refusal; arbitration proceedings could be used to arrive at an agreeable sale price; and the interests of the beneficiaries \u201cshall be represented by independent counsel selected and compensated by the trustee [initially Sumner] . . . out of trust funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">At the time of the 1972 settlement and redemption, Ruth Ann was approximately eighteen years old, and Michael was fifteen years old; neither was represented by a guardian ad litem or independent counsel. Shortly after the redemption, DeGiacomo met with Ruth Ann and explained that there had been a \u201cdispute over the ownership of shares,\u201d and that some of the shares had been placed in trusts for the benefit of her and Michael. The record does not indicate, however, whether Ruth Ann knew specifically of Mickey\u2019s and Sumner\u2019s position that fifty shares of NAI had been held in oral trusts for Ruth Ann and Michael since 1959. DeGiacomo did not discuss the redemption with Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">b. <em>The 1984 redemption. </em>To effectuate Ruth Ann\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Michael\u2019s expressed desires that their shares be redeemed, Sumner, in 1982, began exploring the possibility of NAI\u2019s redeeming the shares held in the Ruth Ann, Michael, and Grandchildren\u2019s Trusts. In December, 1982, Sumner appointed DeGiacomo \u2014 who had represented Edward in the 1972 dispute \u2014\u25a0 as independent counsel for the beneficiaries of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. In that role, DeGiacomo considered it his duty to determine whether a redemption was in the best interest of the beneficiaries, and to determine the fair value of the shares to be redeemed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The shares were nondividend-paying and nonmarketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Although there was no provision in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust for the appointment of an independent counsel, DeGiacomo considered his role as independent counsel under the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts to include representing the interests of Ruth Ann and Michael vis-a-vis their shares held in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust. With respect to the other beneficiaries of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, Brent and Shari, DeGiacomo did not consider himself to be acting as independent counsel for them, although he thought that his determination as to the fairness of the redemption of Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s shares would apply to Brent\u2019s and Shari\u2019s shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Sumner asked Samuel Rosen, a certified public accountant, to appraise the fair market value of the fifty-eight and one-third shares of NAI held in trust for Ruth Ann and Michael (thirty-three and one-third shares held in the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts, and twenty-five shares held in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust for Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s benefit). Rosen was NAI\u2019s accountant and was both Sumner\u2019s and Edward\u2019s personal accountant. In February, 1983, Rosen placed the value of the fifty-eight and one-third shares at $9.9 million.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rosen delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>a copy of his valuation and the financial information on which it was based to DeGiacomo.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">DeGiacomo then obtained independent expert reviews of Rosen\u2019s valuation by four Citibank representatives, including Citibank vice-president Samuel D. Daume (at Edward\u2019s recommendation; Daume had been Edward\u2019s banker). According to DeGiacomo, the Citibank experts concluded that Rosen\u2019s valuation was too low because it failed to take into account the value of NAI\u2019s real property, the methodology was flawed, and the valuation improperly discounted the value of the shares by thirty-five per cent for lack of marketability of the minority interest.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">DeGiacomo involved Edward in reviewing the value of the trust beneficiaries\u2019 shares because he considered Edward knowledgeable about the movie theater business. Contrary to Sumner\u2019s and Rosen\u2019s pessimistic views about the future of the movie theater business based on information showing that the business was suffering losses because of the advent of pay television and other new technologies, Edward pointed to other industry data showing that movie theater ticket sales were still healthy. DeGia-como thought NAI\u2019s attempt to paint itself as a company in decline was mere \u201cposturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">DeGiacomo informed Sumner that, in order to fulfil his obligations as independent counsel, it was necessary to resolve the question of the value of the shares according to the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>provisions in the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. Specifically, he proposed that he and Sumner agree on a \u201chigh-low\u201d range for the price of the shares and then submit that range to a panel of arbitrators for decision. In the following weeks, DeGiacomo and Sumner continued to disagree about Rosen\u2019s valuation \u2014 particularly the need to value NAI\u2019s real property. Sumner became impatient with DeGiacomo and suggested that he (Sumner) could terminate the redemption process if he wished. DeGiacomo disagreed, threatening that, if Sumner sought to do so, DeGia-como would take the matter to court. Sumner did not terminate the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">As the negotiations continued, DeGiacomo proposed to Sumner a \u201chigh-low\u201d range of $15 million to $5 million \u2014 \u201ca range that would have been discussed with the experts at Citi[bank],\u201d according to DeGiacomo in 2007. As for the value of NAI\u2019s real estate, DeGiacomo testified that, while there were no current valuations available from NAI and no independent appraisal was done, DeGiacomo had property \u201ctax bills,\u201d and Edward had \u201cvery, very intimate knowledge\u201d of NAI\u2019s real property. Sumner countered DeGiacomo\u2019s \u201chigh-low\u201d range with a range of $12.5 million to $7.5 million. DeGiacomo insisted on his range, however, and Sumner finally agreed to it. But before any arbitration proceedings began, in November 1983 Sumner agreed to NAI\u2019s redemption of the shares for $15 million \u2014 the top of DeGiacomo\u2019s proposed range. DeGiacomo testified that he satisfied himself, with the aid of the Citibank experts and Edward, that the price was fair and in the beneficiaries\u2019 best interest. Daume testified that he did not recall what conclusions he had made regarding the fairness of the price, but did not deny that he had opined that the $15 million price was fair. See note 16, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">During the months leading up to the parties\u2019 agreement on the redemption price, DeGiacomo kept abreast of NAI\u2019s financial condition. Although he testified, when shown a copy of NAI\u2019s 1983 financial statement during his 2007 deposition, that \u2014 twenty-four years after the fact \u2014 the statement was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d to him, he asserted that, before agreeing on the redemption price, he periodically requested and received current financial information from NAI. For instance, he would ask Sumner for \u201clast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>quarter\u2019s reports.\u201d \u201cI did request [financial] documentation from time to time from [NAI], and . . . it\u2019s my recollection that in each instance what I requested was furnished and was then passed on to financial people who were involved. That\u2019s my recollection, but I do not have a specific recollection of the documents that were requested or that were received.\u201d DeGiacomo knew of no instance when financial documentation was requested from NAI but not provided.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On March 8, 1984, NAI redeemed fifty-eight and one-third shares of NAI held in trust for Ruth Ann and Michael (thirty-three and one-third shares in the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts, and twenty-five shares in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust held for Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s benefit) for $15 million \u2014 $5.1 million more than Rosen\u2019s valuation. NAI also redeemed the remaining twenty-five shares in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, held for Brent\u2019s and Shari\u2019s benefit, for $6.4 million. The total price paid for all of the redeemed shares was $21.4 million. Payment was made to the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">On the day of the redemption, immediately before it took place, Sumner appointed Rosen to serve as cotrustee with Sumner of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. Also before the redemption took place (during the previous month), Rosen was appointed a cotrustee of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust (Rosen replaced Bella, joining Sumner and Winer as cotrustee). The redemption was reduced to a written agreement, which was signed on March 8, 1984, as follows: Sumner as president of NAI; Sumner and Rosen as cotrustees of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts; Sumner, Rosen, and Winer as cotrustees of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust; and DeGiacomo as independent counsel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> With respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>DeGiacomo\u2019s role vis-a-vis the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, the redemption agreement stated that DeGiacomo \u201crequested that all of the [NAI] shares held by The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust be redeemed by [NAI].\u201d The agreement also stated that the trustees of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust concurred in the determination of DeGiacomo, Sumner, and Rosen that \u201cit is in the interest of [Ruth Ann and Michael] as well as the other beneficiaries of The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust that the [NAI] shares held by The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust be redeemed by [NAI].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On the same day the agreement was signed, Brent, Shari, and Michael \u2014 by that time, all adults \u2014 signed a statement asserting that they \u201curged, and do approve and endorse the redemption ... at the price and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the redemption agreement.\u201d Ruth Ann\u2019s signature does not appear on the document; at the time of the redemption she had been missing for some time.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> DeGiacomo testified in 2007 that he did not recall consulting with Michael about the redemption in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">According to the affidavit of Thomas M. Blake, an accountant retained by the plaintiffs for purposes of this litigation, the redemption price \u201cmaterially underestimated the value of NAI\u2019s common stock as of the [transaction date.\u201d Acknowledging that his analysis was only \u201cpreliminary,\u201d Blake concluded that Rosen\u2019s methodology was flawed. Blake also concluded that the value of NAI\u2019s income, assets, and investments as reflected in its financial statements \u2014 particularly those from 1983 and 1984 (after Rosen had produced his valuation) \u2014 showed that the redeemed shares held in trust for Ruth Ann and Michael were worth approximately three to five times the $15 million paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The day after the redemption agreement was signed, the trustees of the various trusts changed as follows. Sumner resigned as cotrustee of the Ruth Ann Trust and appointed DeGiacomo to serve as cotrustee with Rosen (DeGiacomo resigned in 1992; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Rosen resigned in 2005). Sumner remained cotrustee with Rosen of the Michael Trust and appointed DeGiacomo to join them (Sumner resigned in 1986; DeGiacomo resigned in 1992; Rosen resigned in 2005). Sumner and Rosen remained cotrustees of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust; Sumner resigned as cotrustee in 1991, and it is not clear for how long Winer remained a cotrustee after the redemption agreement was signed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The current trustees of all three trusts, Thomas N. O\u2019Connor and Patricia Gatto, were appointed in 2006.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the defendants refer to other trastees who were apparently appointed before the current trustees (George Duncan, William Eisen, and Mark Schuster), the record does not indicate the trusts for which those trustees served or the periods of such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Following the 1984 redemption, the only shares of NAI that remained outstanding- were the sixty-six and two-thirds owned by Sumner and the thirty-three and one-third held in trust for his children (of the original 300 shares, NAI had redeemed fifty from Mickey; sixty-six and two-thirds from Edward; fifty from the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust; and thirty-three and one-third from the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts). In other words, in 1984, for the first time Sumner became the majority shareholder of NAI.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The plaintiffs were thus required to allege facts that, if proved at trial, would take their claims outside the limitations period. We conclude that the plaintiffs have carried their burden with respect to certain claims but not others.

The plaintiffs also claim that Sumner aided and abetted Edward\u2019s wrongdoing through Sumner\u2019s participation (individually and on behalf of NAI) in the settlement and redemption agreements.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendants do not argue that the statute of limitations regarding the 1972 redemption commenced based on Ruth Ann\u2019s or Michael\u2019s actual knowledge of Sumner\u2019s and Edward\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. In any event, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>record fails to show that at any time before 2004 either child had actual knowledge of Sumner\u2019s or Edward\u2019s alleged wrongdoing in connection with the 1972 redemption.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harbor Schs., Inc., </em>446 Mass. 245, 254-255 (2006); <em>Lattuca </em>v. <em>Robsham, </em>442 Mass. 205, 213 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Neither Ruth Ann nor Michael (both were minors at the time) was represented in 1972 by a guardian ad litem or independent counsel. See note 29, <em>supra. </em>After the redemption took place, however, Ruth Ann and Michael came to be represented by Sumner: when, in 1972, Edward and Sumner \u201cmemorialize!)!] \u201d the oral trusts in writing, Sumner became sole trustee of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. Sumner served in that role until 1984 for the Ruth Ann Trust, and until 1986 for the Michael Trust. Thus, assuming without deciding the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that Mickey had created oral trusts for Ruth Ann and Michael in 1959, and that Edward had been the trustee of those trusts (before he memorialized the trusts in writing in 1972), Sumner, in 1972, became a successor trustee to Edward.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The defendants do not claim, however, that the statute of limitations began to run during Sumner\u2019s tenure as trustee. In any event, Sumner\u2019s knowledge that Edward allegedly ended up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>owning some of his children\u2019s shares did not start the running of the limitations period because Sumner \u2014 in furthering his own, Mickey\u2019s, and NAI\u2019s interests in resolving their dispute with Edward \u2014 agreed to the compromise that resulted in Edward\u2019s owning sixty-six and two-thirds of the one hundred shares registered in his name. In other words, Sumner, in pursuit of his own interests and those of NAI, agreed in 1972 that thirty-three and one-third shares, rather than fifty, were held in trust for Edward\u2019s children. In these circumstances, the statute of limitations did not commence based on Sumner\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances underlying the redemption. Cf. <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 522-523 (1997) (in shareholder derivative action for breach of fiduciary duty by corporate directors for usurping corporate opportunities, statute of limitations tolled because, among other things, defendant directors \u201ceither benefited from, or acquiesced in, the activities that are the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claims on behalf of the corporations\u201d; court focused on \u201cthe impracticality of expecting corporate wrongdoers to bring suits against themselves\u201d; limitations period should not run until disinterested and independent directors are in position to act in corporation\u2019s behalf against corporate wrongdoers). Cf. also <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Aiello, </em>447 Mass. 388, 399-407 (2006) (adopting adverse domination doctrine, where statute of limitations in shareholder derivative action tolled if corporate plaintiff under complete domination of wrongdoing directors; action not tolled where one innocent director was able and willing to bring suit on behalf of corporation against three wrongdoing directors).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Sumner was succeeded as trustee by DeGiacomo and Rosen, who became cotrustees of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts in 1984 (DeGiacomo served until 1992; Rosen served until 2005). The defendants argue that the statute of limitations for the 1972 redemption was no longer tolled and began to run based on De-Giacomo\u2019s position as successor cotrustee of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There is no question that DeGiacomo, as Edward\u2019s attorney in connection with the 1972 settlement agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ment and redemption, had intimate knowledge of Mickey\u2019s and Sumner\u2019s position at the time that Edward had held fifty shares of NAI for his children under oral trusts created by Mickey in 1959, and not thirty-three and one-third shares as provided in the settlement agreement. DeGiacomo also had intimate knowledge of the terms of the settlement agreement and declarations of trust executed in 1972, which included statements that could be read to suggest that Edward had been holding shares for his children under preexisting oral tmsts. Thus, DeGiacomo had the requisite knowledge of potential claims for breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the 1972 redemption for the statute of limitations ostensibly to have begun to ran. Cf. Restatement (Third) of Tmsts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 76 comment d; Restatement (Second) of Tmsts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 327 &amp; comment 1; G.G. Bogert, Tmsts and Tmstees, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 954, at 675-676.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">That DeGiacomo had the requisite knowledge to start the running of the limitations period does not, however, end the matter. DeGiacomo, as Edward\u2019s attorney in the 1972 dispute, was Edward\u2019s agent, acting on behalf of Edward for purposes of negotiating the settlement. See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 1.01 &amp; comments c, g (2006); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 26 &amp; comment b, at 198 (2000) (acts of lawyers \u201cin an important sense . . . really are acts authorized by the principal\u201d). Thus, when asked whether it was Edward\u2019s position that no oral tmsts existed, DeGiacomo said, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d adding, \u201cmy position as well, and . . . that\u2019s why I brought the suit.\u201d In the particular circumstances of this case where DeGiacomo, acting as Edward\u2019s agent in 1972, repeatedly asserted that no oral tmsts had been established for the grandchildren in 1959, we conclude that, despite DeGiacomo\u2019s knowledge of the 1972 transactions, the statute of limitations did not begin to run.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., supra. </em>Cf. also <em>Aiello </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>v. <em>Aiello, supra; Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co. of Worcester, </em>339 Mass. 101, 112-113 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">That the limitations period was tolled when DeGiacomo became a successor trustee in 1984 because of DeGiacomo\u2019s role as the agent of Edward (the alleged wrongdoer) in 1972 does not imply that DeGiacomo engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the 1972 redemption, or in connection with the 1984 redemption. The record before us would warrant a finding that DeGiacomo\u2019s actions regarding both redemptions demonstrated good faith. Nor should our ruling on the limitations question be taken as expressing any opinion on the propriety of Edward\u2019s actions in 1972. Our sole concern is with the statute of limitations, and on the record before us we conclude that the limitations period was tolled in 1984 with respect to the 1972 redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Accordingly, with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the 1972 redemption, we remand the case for further proceedings. On remand, the only questions will be whether oral trusts were in fact created by Mickey in 1959 for Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s benefit and, if so, whether they could be revoked or modified; how many shares of NAI were held in the trusts for Ruth Ann and Michael; and who was appointed trustee of the oral trusts and when. See notes 9 &amp; 10, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, discovery should be limited to the depositions of Sumner, Edward, and anyone else with personal knowledge bearing on the questions we have outlined, as well as any documentary evidence relevant to resolving those questions. Substantively, the discovery at any such deposition should focus only on those same questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">If it is established that oral trusts were created in 1959 \u2014 a proposition that seems doubtful on the record before us, see note 9, <em>supra </em>\u2014 then and only then should the issue of damages be considered. On the matter of damages: if it is established that oral trusts were in fact created in 1959, all of the shares under those trusts (including the sixteen and two-thirds shares that Edward allegedly wrongly converted from his two children) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>would have been redeemed in 1984, because the record in this case shows without dispute that at that time, Ruth Ann and Michael desired that NAI redeem all of their shares. As we explain below, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the 1984 redemption of shares in the Ruth Ann, Michael, and Grandchildren\u2019s Trusts are time barred. Therefore, because any shares originally held in oral trusts for Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s benefit that should not have been \u201ctransferred\u201d to Edward in 1972, would have been redeemed in 1984 \u2014 consistent with the children\u2019s wishes \u2014 we conclude that the plaintiffs, assuming the oral trusts are established, would be allowed to receive damages only in the amount of the price per share paid in 1984, together with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">c. <em>1984 redemption. </em>The plaintiffs claim that, in 1984, Sumner breached his fiduciary duty as cotrustee of the Ruth Ann, Michael, and Grandchildren\u2019s Trusts by causing NAI to redeem the shares held in those trusts for inadequate consideration \u2014 i.e., that, by concealing from DeGiacomo the true worth of NAI, he improperly caused the shares to be sold to NAI for less than their fair value.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> After a careful review of all of the facts relevant to the inquiry, we conclude that, in 1984, DeGiacomo (now acting as successor trustee to Sumner) possessed the requisite knowledge to start the running of the statute of limitations, and that the limitations period was not tolled. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of the 1984 transaction are therefore time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">When he became cotrustee of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts in 1984, DeGiacomo knew of the financial condition of NAI leading up to the time of the redemption. He was aware of the Rosen valuation and the financial information on which it was based (current through NAI\u2019s fiscal year 1982), as well as NAI\u2019s financial information current as of the date of the redemption, March 8, 1984. In addition, DeGiacomo had knowledge of the value of NAI\u2019s real estate through property tax records and Edward\u2019s personal knowledge of NAI\u2019s real estate, at least. And throughout the redemption process, DeGiacomo obtained expert advice from Citibank representatives regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>value of NAI. That DeGiacomo, during his deposition in 2007, did not specifically recall certain particulars of NAI\u2019s financial statements from 1983 and 1984, and that NAI\u2019s real estate was not independently appraised for purposes of the redemption, are of no consequence: the record before us establishes that DeGia-como had sufficient knowledge in 1984 of the financial condition of NAI to put him on notice of any potential claim against Sumner (the predecessor trustee and alleged wrongdoer) regarding the fairness of the price for which NAI redeemed the shares. Accordingly, where DeGiacomo (now the successor trustee) had knowledge of any potential claim against the predecessor trustee, the statute of limitations began to run in 1984, with respect to the redemption of shares in the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. Cf. Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 76 comment d; Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 327 &amp; comment 1; G.G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 954, at 675-676.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Similarly to the 1972 redemption, DeGiacomo\u2019s knowledge is not the only consideration in the unusual circumstances of this case, and we therefore examine his status in relation to the 1984 redemption. In contrast to his role as Edward\u2019s attorney in the 1972 redemption, DeGiacomo had no disqualifying agency or other relationship to Sumner (the alleged wrongdoer). The record shows that DeGiacomo never represented Sumner as his counsel and was not paid by Sumner or NAI with regard to the 1984 redemption (the only evidence of DeGiacomo\u2019s payment in connection with the 1984 redemption was $27,000 paid from the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust). DeGiacomo\u2019s role as independent counsel in the redemption process was to make sure the share price was fair to the two trusts\u2019 beneficiaries, Ruth Ann and Michael. In that position, he rejected Sumner\u2019s accountant\u2019s valuation of NAI (the Rosen valuation) and obtained advice from independent experts at Citibank. DeGiacomo negotiated forcefully and persistently with Sumner over several months concerning the value of the shares; in fact, when Sumner became impatient with DeGia-como and indicated that he could unilaterally terminate the process, DeGiacomo threatened to take Sumner to court over the matter. And through DeGiacomo\u2019s persistent negotiation, Sumner, on NAI\u2019s behalf, agreed to a redemption price of $15 million for Ruth Ann\u2019s and Michael\u2019s shares \u2014 the top of the range that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>DeGiacomo had proposed; $2.5 million more than the top of the range that Sumner had proposed; and $5.1 million more than Rosen had proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In light of those circumstances, we conclude as a matter of law that a potential claim against Sumner by DeGiacomo would not be tolled.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In other words, we conclude that at the point that DeGiacomo became the successor trustee of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts in 1984, the statute of limitations began to ran in 1984 with respect to the redemption of shares in the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. Cf. Restatement (Third) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 76 comment d; Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 327 &amp; comment 1; G.G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 954, at 675-676.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Although DeGiacomo was not appointed as a trustee of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust in 1984 (or at any time), for the reasons we describe we conclude that he stood in a fiduciary relationship to all of the beneficiaries of that trust: Ruth Ann, Michael, and Sumner\u2019s two children, Brent and Shari. See <em>Warsofsky </em>v. <em>Sherman, 326 </em>Mass. 290, 292 (1950) (\u201ccircumstances which may create a fiduciary relationship are so varied that it would be unwise to attempt the formulation of any comprehensive definition that could be uniformly applied in every case\u201d). Accord- \u2022 ingly, for the same reasons that the limitations period commenced in 1984, with respect to the claims regarding the Ruth Ann and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Michael Trusts, so too did it commence with respect to the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">When the redemption took place on March 8, 1984, DeGia-como was acting as independent counsel for the beneficiaries of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. In that capacity, DeGiacomo assumed the duty to ensure that any sale of shares held in those trusts was in the interest of the beneficiaries of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts, and was for a fair price. With respect to the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, DeGiacomo acknowledged that he had a duty to represent the interests of Ruth Ann and Michael vis-a-vis their shares held in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust. And with respect to the other beneficiaries of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust \u2014 Brent and Shari \u2014 DeGiacomo, although he did not consider himself to be acting as independent counsel for them (the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust contained no specific authorization for him to hold that particular title), understood that his determination as to the fairness of the redemption of Ruth Ann and Michael\u2019s shares would also apply to Brent and Shari\u2019s shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Of particular importance, the redemption agreement stated that DeGiacomo \u201crequested that all of the [NAI] shares held by The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust be redeemed by [NAI].\u201d The agreement also stated that the trustees of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust concurred in the determination of DeGiacomo, Sumner, and Rosen that \u201cit is in the interest of [Ruth Ann and Michael] as well as the other beneficiaries of The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust that the [NAI] shares held by The Grandchildren\u2019s Trust be redeemed by [NAI].\u201d In other words, the redemption agreement shows that DeGiacomo was the party who, on behalf of all beneficiaries of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, instigated the sale of the shares held in that trust to NAI. The agreement also shows that he was one of the parties that determined the sale was in the best interest of all beneficiaries of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust. Moreover, according to the record, the only payment made to DeGiacomo in connection with the 1984 redemption was $27,000 paid by the Grandchildren\u2019s Tmst.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>In light of these circumstances \u2014 especially the fact that, according to the terms of the redemption agreement, DeGiacomo sought (\u201crequested\u201d) the sale of property held in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, after determining such a sale to be in the beneficiaries\u2019 interest \u2014 we conclude that DeGiacomo was, as a matter of law, a fiduciary of the beneficiaries of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust. Cf. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harbor Schs., Inc., </em>446 Mass. 245, 252-253 (2006), citing <em>Warsofsky </em>v. <em>Sherman, supra </em>(deciding on summary judgment record that fiduciary relationship existed based on nature of parties\u2019 interactions, despite denial by fiduciary of existence of fiduciary relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">DeGiacomo\u2019s knowledge with respect to NAPs financial condition at the time of the 1984 redemption was the same in his role as fiduciary of the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust as it was in his role as trustee of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. We therefore conclude that just as the statute of limitations commenced in 1984, with respect to the redemption of the shares in the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts, it also commenced in 1984, with respect to the redemption of the shares in the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust. Accordingly, where the plaintiffs did not commence their action until 2006, their claims regarding the 1984 redemption of shares in all of the busts are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part. The matter is remanded for further proceedings with respect to the claims concerning the 1972 redemption, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> The defendants also argued that the trustee plaintiffs, appointed in 2006, lack standing because the trusts allegedly expired by their own terms no later than 2004. That issue was neither resolved in the trial court nor briefed before this court, and we do not address it. Moreover, the trustee plaintiffs, \u201cout of an abundance of caution to obtain judicial confirmation that the trusts at issue have not terminated by their terms,\u201d have initiated trust interpretation actions, which are currently pending in the Probate and Family Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> The defendants had moved that the judge defer all discovery other than that relative to whether DeGiacomo\u2019s knowledge of the facts underlying the redemptions could be attributed to the plaintiffs \u2014 specifically, whether De-Giacomo was \u201cconflicted\u201d in 1984 such that his knowledge could not be attributed to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs opposed the motion unsuccessfully (except with regard to NAI\u2019s financial statements from 1983 and 1984). The plaintiffs argued that discovery on the statute of limitations issue was \u201cinextricably intertwined with discovery on liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> The judge concluded, sua sponte, that Michael would \u201cappear\u201d only to have \u201cequitable rights to proceed against <em>current </em>trustees\u201d (emphasis added), and that only the current trustees (Thomas N. O\u2019Connor and Patricia Gatto) can bring claims against the prior trustees (Sumner and Edward). On appeal, the defendants echo the judge\u2019s point, relying on Godfrey vs. Kamin, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 99-C-3230 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 14, 2000), citing <em>Axelrod </em>v. <em>Giambalvo, </em>129 Ill. App. 3d 512, 518 (1984); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Trust Co. of Ga., </em>214 Ga. 339, 345 (1958); <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Swicegood, </em>162 N.C. App. 457, 466-467 (2004); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 282 (1959). It has yet to be determined, however, whether the current trustees are proper plaintiffs. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, it would be premature to decide whether Michael has standing. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>(\u201cbeneficiary cannot maintain a suit in equity against [a] third person, except ... if there is no trustee [and] suit is necessary to protect the interest of the beneficiary\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> As noted earlier, the record contains no copies of NAI stock certificates. There is also nothing in the record to suggest that any actions taken by NAI between 1959 and 1972 were done with the consent of the grandchildren (through any alleged trustee). See 12 W.M. Fletcher, Private Corporations \u00a7 5489, at 254 (rev. ed. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> DeGiacomo testified in his 2007 deposition that he never saw a stock certificate stating that Edward was holding any shares in trust, nor was there any evidence, at the time of the 1972 redemption, that Mickey had in any way restricted the shares registered to Edward.

Fletcher, Private Corporations, <em>supra </em>at 257 (requirement that issuer register transfer of security \u201cintended for the benefit and protection of persons who may purchase or take a pledge of the shares of the corporation\u201d). During the negotiations, Mickey never said that he had told Edward in 1959 that he wanted Edward\u2019s children to own an interest in NAI. DeGiacomo never heard nor saw any evidence that Mickey had paid gift taxes in 1959 as part of Mickey\u2019s alleged gift to his grandchildren through the alleged oral trusts. In addition, DeGiacomo never saw any written evidence suggesting that Mickey had created oral trusts in 1959. DeGiacomo further testified that in 1972 he did not know whether Mickey\u2019s view that he had created oral trusts in 1959 was genuine or merely a litigation position, but DeGiacomo believed that \u201cif we went to court and litigated [the question, Mickey] would have lost.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> Whether the parties had the authority to agree to such a compromise \u2014 or whether Mickey created oral trusts in 1959 that could be neither revoked nor modified \u2014 is the question underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that Ruth Ann and Michael were wrongfully deprived of shares to which they were entitled. See generally <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>347 Mass. 29, 34-35 (1964) (discussing creation and proof of oral trusts for personal property); Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 63(1), (2) comments c, c(l) (2003) (where settlor fails expressly to reserve right to revoke or amend trust, rebuttable presumption that settlor lacks power to do so unless he retains interest in trust).

The record does not show that irrevocable declarations of trust were set \u00fap for Brent and Shari. In any event, none of those shares was redeemed in 1972 or 1984.

But in his 2007 deposition, he explained that, by referring to Sumner as his \u201cclient\u201d in the 2004 deposition, he meant only that Sumner had been the one who designated DeGiacomo as independent counsel for the trust beneficiaries \u2014 not that Sumner was a client of his in the attorney-client sense.

As for the fairness of Rosen\u2019s valuation, Daume testified that he could not recall giving any opinion on the matter, but did not deny that he or any other Citibank representative had done so.

Sumner\u2019s children have not, however, challenged in this action (or any other of which we are aware) Sumner\u2019s ownership of those sixty-six and two-thirds shares. See note 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\"> Although DeGiacomo informed Ruth Ann in 1972 that there had been a \u201cdispute over ownership of the shares,\u201d and that some of the shares had been placed in trusts for her and Michael, the record is silent regarding whether Ruth Ann knew of the possibility that she or Michael might have been entitled to additional shares under the theory that oral trusts had been created for their benefit in 1959. In 1972, Ruth Ann and Michael were minors (Ruth Ann was eighteen years old; Michael was fifteen years old), see G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 4, St. 1904, c. 163, and neither had a guardian ad litem or independent counsel who could have consented to the 1972 settlement and redemption on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Although a guardian ad litem need not be appointed in every matter involving minors, see G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 34, here Edward\u2019s interests conflicted with those of his children. And while Mickey and Sumner may have \u201caggressively\u201d promoted the interests of Sumner\u2019s and Edward\u2019s children (as the defendants claim) insofar as they sought to keep as many shares of NAI in trust for the children as possible, it appears that their motivation may have been to maintain control of NAI in the family, rather than to protect any purported interests of Ruth Ann and Michael. In any event, in order to resolve their dispute with Edward, Mickey and Sumner agreed that Edward owned sixty-six and two-thirds shares (fifty plus the sixteen and two-thirds now disputed by the plaintiffs) presumably because this was in their own interests (and the interests of NAI) and not necessarily because it was in the interests of Ruth Ann and Michael.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\"> The defendants make no argument that the statute of limitations began to run based on Rosen\u2019s position as successor cotrustee of the Ruth Ann and Michael Trusts. In any event, Rosen was not deposed in this action (he died in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>2006), and the record is devoid of any basis on which to determine whether the limitations period began to run because of his role as successor cotrustee.

For reasons we have explained, we reject the notion that, in the circumstances presented in this case, actual knowledge of the beneficiaries is necessary to begin the running of the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the need for a guardian ad litem fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> The record contradicts the defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiffs waived their claim regarding the fairness of the price paid for the shares redeemed from the Grandchildren\u2019s Trust.
