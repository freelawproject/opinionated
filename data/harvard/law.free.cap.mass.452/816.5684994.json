Nicoll on a complaint for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. No additional jurors were empanelled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the trial began, one juror realized that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>recognized the first witness, a police officer, and informed the trial judge that he might not be able to be impartial. After examining the juror under oath in the presence of both parties, the judge excused the juror from further service on the jury over the defendant\u2019s objection. Left with five jurors, the judge and attorneys briefly discussed how to proceed. Defense counsel expressed his frustration over the empanelment of only six jurors and then stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can go forward with five jurors, can we?\u201d The judge responded, \u201cNot in a criminal case. Could in a civil case with the consent of all parties but I don\u2019t believe we can do so in a criminal case. Okay, I\u2019m going to declare a mistrial.\u201d Defense counsel ended the exchange, saying, \u201cAnyway, for the record, my objection. I think he would be a fine juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The case was then scheduled for retrial, and Nicoll moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that a second trial would violate his right to be free from double jeopardy. The same judge who had declared the mistrial allowed Nicoll\u2019s motion. As the basis for his ruling, the judge found that contrary to his initial understanding, Massachusetts procedural rules would have allowed the trial to continue with five jurors (albeit with Nicoll\u2019s consent), citing Mass. R. Crim. P. 19 (b), 378 Mass. 888 (1979),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that although he had given counsel \u201ca full opportunity to be heard,\u201d he had failed to \u201cgive careful consideration to the alternative of proceeding with the trial before less than a full jury.\u201d Consequently, the judge concluded that there had been no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial and double jeopardy barred a second trial. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>To resolve this case, we must decide whether a defendant may constitutionally waive his right to a verdict rendered by no fewer than six jurors and, if so, whether the judge\u2019s failure to consider that possibility proscribes a retrial of Nicoll. We answer both questions in the affirmative, and affirm the dismissal of the case against Nicoll.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The protection against double jeopardy has a long history rooted in both the United States Constitution and Massachusetts common law. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787 (1969). <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 356, 366, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1065 (1980). The rule protects defendants from double trials, not merely from double punishments. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 78 (1985), citing <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 528 (1975). Consequently, once jeopardy has attached, a judge may declare a mistrial over a defendant\u2019s objection and commence a new trial only in light of a \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Due to the importance of the double jeopardy protection, the Commonwealth bears the \u201cheavy\u201d burden of proving that a mistrial rested on manifest necessity. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978). There is no \u201ccrisp formula for determining when \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 arises\u201d; however, \u201c[t]wo principles emerge for guidance: (1) counsel must be given full opportunity to be heard and (2) the trial judge must give careful consideration to alternatives to a mistrial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, supra </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Nicoll concedes that the trial judge in this case satisfied the first requirement by asking the attorneys for their opinions and openly listening to their views and advice. We therefore proceed to the second requirement that consists of two parts: whether there was an alternative and, if so, whether the judge gave it careful consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The Commonwealth argues that juries must be comprised of at least six jurors in all circumstances; for that reason, it contends there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial when the number of jurors available to render a verdict was reduced to five. Nicoll, on the other hand, argues that he could have waived the six-person jury requirement if the judge had considered that option.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The United States Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the interplay between jury size and the Constitution has spanned several decades. In 1970, the Supreme Court first held that a jury of six persons (rather than twelve) satisfied a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution in nonpetty criminal offenses. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 103 (1970). The Court expressly reserved ruling on whether a number smaller than six would pass constitutional scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 91 n.28. A few years later, the Court was confronted with a challenge to a Georgia statute that required misdemeanor criminal cases be tried before a jury of five persons. <em>Ballew </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 226 (1978) <em>(Ballew). </em>After examining several statistical studies, demonstrating that smaller juries deliberate less effectively; convict a greater number of innocent people; reach fewer \u201chung juries\u201d \u201cto the detriment of one side, the defense\u201d; and contain fewer minority jurors, <em>id. </em>at 232-237, the Court held that Georgia\u2019s practice violated the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 245. It reasoned that \u201cthe purpose and functioning of the jury in a criminal trial is seriously impaired, and to a constitutional degree, by a reduction in size to below six members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. However, it also noted that it could not \u201cpretend to discern a clear line between six members and five.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The findings of the studies cited in <em>Ballew </em>pointed to a single conclusion: that States placed a thumb on the scale in favor of the government when they required defendants to submit to juries of five persons. The Supreme Court reiterated that point when it struck down a statute providing for conviction on the vote of five persons on a six-person jury in <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>441 U.S. 130, 139 (1979) <em>(Burch). </em>The Court focused primarily on the jury\u2019s purpose of \u201c preventing] government oppression by providing a \u2018safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, quoting <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 156 (1968). The Court wrote that the <em>Ballew </em>statute \u201cdeprive[d] an accused of his right to trial by jury,\u201d <em>Burch, supra </em>at 136, and that the statute in <em>Burch </em>posed \u201ca similar threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The conclusion that jury size requirements exist primarily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>protect the rights of defendants was reached by the Supreme Court decades earlier in <em>Patton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>281 U.S. 276, 297 (1930). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a defendant could waive a twelve-person jury (then constitutionally required) and proceed to verdict if a juror became ill midtrial. <em>Id. </em>In its decision, the Court cited approvingly the words of William Blackstone and Judge Joseph Story, both of whom deemed trials by jury a \u201cprivilege\u201d preserved primarily to erect \u201cbarriers on every side against the approaches of arbitrary power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on those views and English history, the Court concluded that the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by a jury of twelve persons \u201cwas meant to confer a right upon the accused which he may forego at his election. To deny his power to do so, is to convert a privilege into an imperative requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The Commonwealth, however, argues that a five-person jury trial is an unwaivable \u201cnullity.\u201d While it does not cite a specific source for its proposition, the Commonwealth appears to rely on <em>Ballew </em>and <em>Burch,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>both of which addressed jury rights guaranteed by the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments in the context of State laws either requiring a jury of fewer than six persons or permitting a verdict by fewer than six persons without the defendant\u2019s consent. See. <em>Burch, supra </em>at 131; <em>Ballew, supra </em>at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The Sixth Amendment provides a person charged with a criminal offense a series of important rights related to the prosecution of that offense. Specifically, it provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; . . . and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d As important as these rights may be, the accused is entitled to waive each of them. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beliard, </em>443 Mass. 79, 89 (2004) (defendant may waive right to confront witnesses); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 720-721 (1997) (defendant may waive right to assistance of counsel); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. 503, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>504 (1992) (defendant may waive right to speedy trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 874, 876 (1980) (defendant may waive right to public trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>257 Mass. 172, 174 (1926) (defendant may waive right to be tried by jury). We are not persuaded that the right to a jury trial by a jury of at least six persons stands on a different footing. To accept the Commonwealth\u2019s argument otherwise would \u201cimprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 280 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Having resolved the constitutional question, we turn to rule 19 (b), which provides that after jeopardy attaches and there is then \u201cless than a full jury remaining, a defendant may waive his right to be tried by a full jury and request trial by the remaining jurors by signing a written waiver.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that Nicoll\u2019s reliance on this rule is of no avail. It first argues that rule 19 (b) was adopted for the sole purpose of allowing waiver of the twelve-person and not the six-person jury requirement. We disagree. Rule 19 (b) became effective on July 1, 1979, seven years after Massachusetts established the six-person jury in some District Courts, see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, inserted by St. 1972 c. 620, \u00a7 1; and six months after Massachusetts expanded the six-person jury to all divisions of the District Court Department, see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 189. Additionally, when the Legislature expanded the availability of six-person juries in 1978, it explicitly allowed defendants the right to waive those juries. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 188. We fail to see why a defendant would be allowed to waive six jurors, but not one, see <em>Blair </em>v. <em>State, </em>698 So. 2d 1210, 1217 (Fla. 1997) (\u201cit would be anomalous indeed to hold that a defendant could waive an entire jury, but not waive the presence of one juror\u201d), and decline to limit the rule\u2019s applicability to juries of twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The Commonwealth next argues that even if rule 19 (b) applies, a waiver would have been valid only if executed by Nicoll in writing. Because he did not execute such a waiver, the Commonwealth contends that Nicoll \u201cwaived the opportunity to waive his right to a full jury.\u201d We disagree with this contention as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Here, the question is not whether Nicoll executed a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>waiver, but whether there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for declaring a mistrial. Such a necessity would have presented itself if Nicoll had declined to execute a waiver, but the record is clear that neither the judge nor counsel was aware of or even considered the option. Rather, the judge quickly concluded, without taking time to check the law, or offering counsel the opportunity to research the issue and report back, that there were no alternatives to a mistrial. As the judge recognized in allowing Nicoll\u2019s motion to dismiss, such a rush to judgment does not comport with the requirement that the \u201ctrial judge must give careful consideration to alternatives to a mistrial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 79 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In these circumstances, the Commonwealth is unable to satisfy its heavy burden of proving that there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for declaring a mistrial. The Commonwealth is therefore barred by the principles of double jeopardy from retrying Nicoll. The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-16\"> General Laws c. 234A, \u00a7 68, provides in relevant part: \u201cIn every six-person jury case, the court shall impanel at least one additional juror.\u201d It also provides that \u201c[u]pan a finding of cause, the trial judge may impanel a lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>number of jurors than specified under this section.\u201d The record is silent on whether the judge found \u201ccause\u201d for empanelling fewer than seven jurors in this case. General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 26B, which concerns the seating of alternate jurors only after certification that a trial would be \u201cprotracted,\u201d is inapplicable to the extent that it conflicts with G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 68. See G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 1 (in participating counties, provisions of law inconsistent with G. L. c. 234A will cease to be effective).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\"> Rule 19 (b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 888 (1979), provides: \u201cIf after jeopardy attaches there is at any time during the progress of a trial less than a full jury remaining, a defendant may waive his right to be tried by a full jury and request trial by the remaining jurors by signing a written waiver which shall be filed with the court. If there is more than one defendant, all must sign and file a waiver unless the court in its discretion severs the cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> The Commonwealth also cites language from <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>447 U.S. 323 (1980), which gave retroactive effect to the decision in <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>441 U.S. 130 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
