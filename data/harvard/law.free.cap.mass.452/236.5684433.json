Hurry up and help me.\u201d When the police dispatcher asked Brault what the problem was, she responded: \u201c(Inaudible) just came into my house and tried to kill me.\u201d When asked to repeat who had come into her home, Brault stated, \u201cRalph Nesbitt.\u201d In response to further questions, she told the operator that Nesbitt was gone and pleaded for help to \u201churry up. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Paramedics responded to the scene and transported Brault to Sturdy Memorial Hospital where she died ten minutes later of multiple stab wounds to her arms and torso.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">On January 22, 2004, a Bristol County grand jury returned indictments against Nesbitt in connection with Brault\u2019s murder. Following a five-day trial, a jury found Nesbitt guilty of murder in the first degree on theories of premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty. Nesbitt was also found guilty of armed burglary, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">On appeal, Nesbitt claims that the admission of Brault\u2019s out-of-court statements to the 911 operator and to a neighbor who found her lying on the floor of her front hallway, covered in blood, violated his right of confrontation, as protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He also contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of inconclusive deoxyri-bonucleic acid (DNA) evidence taken from a bicycle near the scene of the murder created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm the convictions and decline to grant relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found, reserving other facts for discussion in conjunction with specific issues raised. Brault and Nancy Robinson were coworkers and friends. They confided in each other as they weathered turmoil in their personal lives. In the autumn of 2003, Brault was in the process of separating from her husband, Michael Brault (Michael). Robinson recently had broken off a seventeen-year relationship with Nesbitt, who was the father of Robinson\u2019s five children. In connection with their breakup, Robinson had obtained a protective order against Nesbitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Nesbitt blamed Brault for \u201cruining [his] relationship\u201d with Robinson, and told Robinson that \u201cone day [Brault will] get hers.\u201d Approximately four months before the murder, Nesbitt and a friend, William Ambers, visited Brault\u2019s home. Ambers drove Nesbitt to the home and parked in the driveway, while Nesbitt went around the house, peeking into its windows. Brault\u2019s husband came to the door, and they engaged in a brief conversation regarding the whereabouts of Brault and Robinson. As Ambers drove away, Nesbitt stated his intention to \u201cdo something to fix that girl,\u201d referring to Brault.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In September, 2003, Nesbitt was living in Brockton, but on the evening of October 1, he traveled to Attleboro. At approximately 8 p.m. that evening, he was dropped off at 15 Mechanic Street, the location of Robinson\u2019s apartment, to visit his children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robinson left the apartment when Nesbitt arrived, and set out in her automobile to visit Brault.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On her way, Robinson stopped at a coffee shop a short distance from 15 Mechanic Street to visit David Jorgensen, who worked as a baker there. Jorgensen was dating Brault at the time and was a friend of Robinson. As Robinson was speaking with Jorgensen, Nesbitt walked past the shop with one of their children. Nesbitt waited for Robinson to leave the shop and then confronted her, asking, \u201cWhat are you doing with that guy?\u201d Robinson informed Nesbitt that Jorgensen was just \u201ca friend.\u201d She then left for Brault\u2019s home but told Nesbitt that she was going to pick up her mother from a bingo game.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">She arrived at Brault\u2019s home at 9 p.m., and remained there until approximately 11 p.m. During that time, Robinson received a telephone call from Nesbitt, who noted that her mother was at' home (across the street from 15 Mechanic Street) and asked why Robinson had lied to him. Robinson responded by asking Nesbitt what she was supposed to say, and then refused to tell him \u201cthat [she] loved him.\u201d At that point in the conversation, Brault laughed audibly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Robinson then left Brault\u2019s home in her automobile, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>headed back toward 15 Mechanic Street. She arrived at her apartment at \u201cten past, quarter past [eleven p.m.],\u201d and immediately called Brault. They spoke for approximately thirty minutes. Ten or fifteen minutes after that conversation \u2014 between 11:50 p.m. and midnight, according to Robinson\u2019s testimony \u2014 she received a call from Nesbitt. He asked her to come outside and speak with him and Robinson responded, \u201cIt\u2019s twelve o\u2019clock, and I\u2019m not going outside. It\u2019s too dark.\u201d According to Robinson\u2019s testimony, Nesbitt then stated, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t want to come outside and talk to me? You\u2019ll just never see your friend again.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Meanwhile, across town (at 147 Wilmarth Street), Brault had just dialed 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Just before Brault dialed 911, her cousin and neighbor, Dennis Marcure, was standing in his bathroom and heard something unusual coming from the Brault home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Brault was calling for her son Eric, but she was \u201ccrying out\u201d in a way that \u201csounded strange . . . [un]like her normal voice.\u201d Marcure immediately \u201cgot dressed . . . and went out to her house.\u201d On his arrival, he noticed that the front screen door was covered in a \u201cmassive amount of blood,\u201d and he quickly found Brault lying \u201con the floor just covered in blood,\u201d with her feet up against the screen door and her body leaning against the storm door in her front hallway. Marcure asked her what had happened and Brault told him, \u201cRalph did this to me, and don\u2019t let me die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Marcure located Brault\u2019s cellular telephone, which was lying underneath her, and also dialed 911. Approximately one minute later, a fire engine drove down the street. The first responders were two emergency medical technicians with the Attleboro fire department, Steven Cutler and his partner, Frank Aussant. Cutler testified that, as he approached the house, he noticed blood \u201cstreaking down the door\u201d and that, on further inspection, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>noticed Brault lying against the door, covered in blood. Cutler took her pulse and tried to determine if she was breathing; when he rolled her over during this process, he noticed that there were a significant number of cuts to her body, which were too numerous to count. Another emergency medical technician who responded to the scene testified that Brault was breathing what is called \u201cagonal breathing, which is just grasping for air,\u201d and \u201clooked like she was close to taking her last breath[].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The medical examiner who performed the autopsy testified that Brault sustained \u201cseveral different clusters\u201d of stab wounds: four on her left chest, eight on her left shoulder, three on her left breast, and five on her abdomen and the side of her body. She also had one stab wound to her right breast, one on her back, and one on her left arm. Brault suffered twenty-three stab wounds in total, and died as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Subsequent investigation of the crime scene revealed damage to the front doorway consistent with forced entry. The doorjamb was shattered, and part of it was found in the living room, ten to twelve feet away from the front door.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Five hours after the murder, at approximately 5 a.m. on the morning of October 2, 2003, Nesbitt was arrested on Riverbank Road in Attleboro. He was wearing work boots and carrying a hard hat and a hammer. He told the arresting officer that he had been sleeping in the fields by a school, located approximately one and one-half blocks from Robinson\u2019s apartment at 15 Mechanic Street, and that he was en route to a construction job.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nesbitt was wearing a gray sweatshirt, and the officer noticed a \u201cbrownish reddish spot on the hood of the sweatshirt.\u201d Subsequent DNA testing revealed that the DNA profile of the blood on the sweatshirt matched Brault\u2019s DNA profile.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>At trial, the defense highlighted two potential weaknesses of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. First, Brault\u2019s murder occurred only hours after her husband, Michael, finished moving out of their home at approximately 9:30 p.m. In anticipation of this defense, the Commonwealth called Michael as a witness. He testified that he left some time after 9:30 p.m., and headed to his new apartment. When he arrived there, he quickly fixed himself a sandwich, and then went straight to a local bar, arriving at approximately 10:30 p.m. He spent the evening there in the company of an acquaintance. The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of two bar patrons and the bartender who confirmed that Michael was at the bar between 11 p.m. on October 1 and 1:30 a.m. on October 2, placing him there at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The second weakness was the potentially conflicting evidence of Nesbitt\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the murder. Brault\u2019s home at 147 Wilmarth Street was several miles from Robinson\u2019s apartment at 15 Mechanic Street. The evidence established Nesbitt\u2019s presence at Robinson\u2019s apartment until at least 9:15 p.m., and that he lacked an automobile. Nesbitt also called Robinson at approximately midnight, and asked her to \u201ccome outside\u201d to speak with him, suggesting that he may have been at 15 Mechanic Street, miles away from the scene of the murder, only moments before or after it occurred. With respect to the latter issue, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that Robinson had a protective order against Nesbitt, and given their \u201cvery violent\u201d relationship, Nesbitt had no reason to expect that Robinson would come out of her apartment to see him at midnight, thus suggesting that Nesbitt was lying about his location in his call to Robinson to create a false alibi. The Commonwealth addressed the former issue by introducing in evidence an abandoned bicycle that had been discarded one-quarter mile from the crime scene sometime during the night of October 1 or the early morning hours of October 2, suggesting that Nesbitt rode the bicycle from 15 Mechanic Street to the crime scene and then, after committing the murder, fled, at least initially, on the bicycle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Both the left and right handlebars of the bicycle tested positive for the presence of blood. A sample taken from the right handlebar had \u201cinsufficient DNA\u201d to conduct an \u201canalysis.\u201d A DNA test of the blood sample from the left handlebar yielded \u201cno results,\u201d meaning that \u201cvery little DNA [was] present\u201d or that it was \u201cvery degraded,\u201d or both. The Commonwealth\u2019s DNA analyst testified that she \u201cwas not able to exclude Dawne Brault or Ralph Nesbitt as being potential contributors to this very low level mixture.\u201d On cross-examination, the DNA analyst testified that the \u201cprobability of a randomly selected unrelated individual having contributed DNA to this mixture is approximately one in one of the Caucasian population, one in one of the African-American population, and one in one of the Hispanic population.\u201d The expert then admitted that, like Nes-bitt or Brault (or anyone, for that matter), she also could not be excluded as a potential match.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">2. <em>Confrontation clause. </em>Nesbitt claims that Brault\u2019s statements to the emergency responder during her 911 call, and her statements to Marcure shortly thereafter, identifying him (Nes-bitt) as the person who stabbed her, were testimonial in nature, and that their admission (over his objection) contravened his right of confrontation as protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004) <em>(Crawford), </em>and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813 (2006) <em>(Davis), </em>we have held that the admissibility of an out-of-court statement is to be determined by a two-part inquiry. First, the statement must \u201cbe evaluated for admissibility under normal evidence rules, i.e., whether it qualifies as a hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>450 Mass. 422, 431 n.6 (2008). Second, \u201cthe statement must be appraised under the criteria of <em>Crawford-Davis </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 3 (2005)[, cert. denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006)] <em>[Gonsalves], </em>to determine if it satisfies the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 14 (\u201cWhether some out-of-court statements are admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule does not change whether admitting them would violate the confrontation clause as newly articulated by <em>Crawford\").</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The <em>Crawford-Davis-Gonsalves </em>inquiry is itself a \u201ctwo-step procedure for distinguishing testimonial from nontestimonial statements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra </em>at 429.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The first step is to determine whether the statements are testimonial per se. \u201c[Statements made in response to questioning by law enforcement agents are per se testimonial, except where the questioning is meant to secure a volatile scene or to establish the need for or provide medical care.\u201d <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"AEh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201c \u2018[0]ut-of-court statements made in response to questions from people who are <em>not </em>law enforcement agents\u2019 and \u2018statements offered . . . without prompting, regardless of who heard them,\u2019 are not testimonial per se\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra </em>at 429, quoting <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 11. Statements that are not testimonial per se must \u201cbe examined to determine if they are nonetheless testimonial in fact by evaluating whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime.\u201d <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 3. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 741 (2006) (\u201cBoth <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>counsel that the determination whether a statement is testimonial or nontestimonial for confrontation clause purposes is highly dependent on the context in which the statement was made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Out-of-court statements deemed testimonial per se or testimonial in fact are inadmissible unless the declarant was \u201cunavailable to testify [at trial], and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination,\u201d <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 54. See <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 3. Nontestimonial statements, on the other hand, do not give rise to a right of confrontation and may be admitted if the admission is consistent with Massachusetts evidence law. See <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 68-69; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 745. We consider the statements in turn and conclude that both were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">a. <em>The 911 call. </em>We set but in the margin the content of Brault\u2019s 911 call that was admitted at trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Before trial, Nes-bitt filed a motion to exclude the call. After a hearing, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ruled that some words were inadmissible (when the dispatcher orders a rescue, opining that \u201cit sounds like it might be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>domestic\u201d), but concluded that the remainder of the call was admissible \u201cas a spontaneous exclamation and as a dying declaration. Under both theories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We agree that Brault\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were properly considered to be spontaneous (or excited) utterances. A statement will be considered a spontaneous utterance \u201cif (1) there is an occurrence or event \u2018sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer,\u2019 and (2) if the declarant\u2019s statement was \u2018a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623 (2002), quoting 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 204 (5th ed. 1999). There is no question that Brault made the call \u201cin circumstances that reasonably negated premeditation,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 625, where she sustained twenty-three stab wounds only moments before the call and reacted to that extraordinarily startling event by dialing 911 to plead for help. Her statements, therefore, readily fall within the spontaneous utterances exception to the hearsay rule, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 221-222 (1973), and Nesbitt does not suggest otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Our next inquiry, as required by <em>Crawford, </em>is whether Brault\u2019s statements were testimonial. In <em>Davis, supra </em>at 822 n.2, the United States Supreme Court considered 911 operators to be \u201cagents of law enforcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers\u201d and, for the purposes of that opinion, \u201cconsider[ed] their acts to be acts of the police.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 742 n.11, 744-745 (applying same reasoning). Consequently, we consider Brault\u2019s statements to have been made \u201cmade in response to questioning by law enforcement agents.\u201d <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 3. As such, they should be considered testimonial per se <em>unless </em>the \u201cquestioning [was] meant to secure a volatile scene or to establish the need for or provide medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Davis, supra </em>at 822 (\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u201d). The <em>Davis </em>Court provided \u201cvarious inidicia [to] help determine whether the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of a statement obtained during [this type of police questioning] may be seen as testimonial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra </em>at 428. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 743-744. These in-dicia include \u201c(1) whether the declarant was speaking about \u2018events <em>as they were actually happening </em>rather than describing] past events\u2019; (2) whether a reasonable interrogator would recognize that the declarant was facing an \u2018ongoing emergency\u2019; (3) whether the question[s] and answer[s] were, viewed objectively, \u2018necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn . . . what had happened in the past,\u2019 including whether it was necessary for the interrogator to know the identity of the alleged perpetrator; and (4) the \u2018level of formality\u2019 of the interview\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra </em>at 428, quoting <em>Davis, supra </em>at 827. Statements that \u201care the products of interrogations . . . tend to generate testimonial responses,\u201d but \u201cit is in the final analysis the declarant\u2019s statements, not the interrogator\u2019s questions, that the [confrontation [c]louse requires us to evaluate.\u201d <em>Davis, supra </em>at 822 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Turning to the record before us, and considering the indicia set forth in <em>Davis, </em>we conclude that Brault\u2019s statements are not testimonial per se. As the content of the call indicates, an assault had taken place only moments earlier. Brault was clearly in the midst of an ongoing medical emergency, requesting a rescue \u201cnow,\u201d stating that she could not spell or talk, and pleading, \u201cHurry up. I don\u2019t want to die.\" These circumstances are akin to the 911 call in <em>Davis, supra </em>at 827, where Brault\u2019s \u201cfrantic\u201d call was \u201cplainly a call for help against a bona fide physical threat,\u201d and to a similar call in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 745, where the victim\u2019s comments described a situation that \u201cany reasonable listener would conclude constituted an ongoing emergency.\" Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra </em>at 431 (statements to police testimonial where scene not dangerous, and victim provided extended answers to officer\u2019s inquiries). Here the 911 dispatcher\u2019s questions were properly tailored \u201cto determine what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>was necessary to resolve the present emergency.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Brault\u2019s first two statements, \u201cHurry up and help me\u201d and \u201c[Someone] just came in my house and tried to kill me,\u201d also raised the possibility that a violent (and perhaps armed) individual might still have been at the scene. It was therefore necessary for the dispatcher to determine the identity of the perpetrator and to ascertain whether the first responders would be encountering a dangerous situation. His questions (\u201cWho came in?\u201d and \u201cIs he still there?\u201d), viewed objectively, were aimed at resolving the present emergency and not at conducting an investigation of past events. Finally, the dispatcher\u2019s questions were responsive to Brault\u2019s pleas for help and did not reflect a high level of formality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 745 (\u201cquestions occurred in the highly informal setting of a telephone call to a 911 dispatcher\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Consequently, we conclude that Brault\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were not testimonial. They were primarily aimed at enabling \u201cpolice assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u201d and Brault was \u201cnot acting as a <em>witness', </em>[nor was she] <em>testifying\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). <em>Davis, supra </em>at 828. \u201cNo \u2018witness\u2019 goes into court to proclaim an emergency and seek help.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, supra </em>at 744 &amp; n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">b. <em>Statement to Marcure. </em>Brault\u2019s statement to Mafcure (her neighbor) that \u201cRalph did this to me . . . don\u2019t let me die,\u201d would be admissible under Massachusetts evidence law as a spontaneous utterance for the same reasons that her 911 call, placed moments earlier, was a spontaneous utterance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See part 2.a, <em>supra. </em>The circumstances of this statement, made when Brault was mortally wounded and pleading for help, fully support the conclusion that it was the product of a \u201cstartling\u201d event and not the result of \u201cconscious reflection.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 626 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The statement, while not made to a law enforcement agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>must still be evaluated to determine whether it was \u201ctestimonial in fact.\u201d <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 11, 12. Cf. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 822 n.l (\u201c[We do not] imply . . . that statements made in the absence of any interrogation are necessarily nontestimonial\u201d). \u201cThe proper inquiry is whether a reasonable person in [Brault\u2019s] position would anticipate the statement\u2019s being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime.\u201d <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 12-13. The gravity of Brault\u2019s physical injuries, and the immediate threat posed by those injuries, would likely preclude a reasonable person in her position from anticipating any nonim-mediate future event, including a police investigation or a prosecution of the perpetrator. As the 911 call revealed, Brault could barely talk at the time and was incapable of spelling her name or describing her injuries. She, like any person in that position, would have been consumed by the immediacy of the situation and was struggling to communicate. \u201cIt is almost inconceivable that, moments after such an event, [someone in Brault\u2019s] condition \u2014 described as essentially frantic \u2014 could have spoken in contemplation of a future legal proceeding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tang, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 60-61 (2006). In these circumstances, her statement was plainly not testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">However, even if Brault\u2019s statement to Marcure were considered to be testimonial in fact, its admission as a \u201cdying declaration\u201d would not, in our view, be contrary to Nesbitt\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. The <em>Crawford </em>Court, while expressly leaving the issue undecided, noted that, \u201c[although many dying declarations may not be testimonial, there is authority for admitting even those that clearly are.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56 n.6. The confrontation clause \u201cis most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those [hearsay] exceptions established at the time of the founding.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 54, citing <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 243 (1895). \u201cThe existence of [the dying declaration] as a general rule of criminal hearsay law\u201d when the Sixth Amendment was adopted \u201ccannot be disputed.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 56 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">This court reached the same conclusion eighty-five years ago in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 413-414 (1923). \u201cThe right of one charged with a crime to be confronted by his accusers was not created and introduced as something new in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>criminal procedure by this constitutional provision, but an existing part of the law of the land was thereby secured against future change except by the people themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. The principle of confrontation was \u201cadopted as a constitutional guaranty, but <em>with </em>the well-recognized exceptions which were a part of the principle and essential to its practical vitality\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Most prominent of those exceptions was \u201cthe admission in evidence of dying declarations . . . [in] prosecutions for homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. Indeed such evidence was readily admitted without objection at the Boston Massacre Trial <em>(Rex </em>v. Wemms) in 1770, and noted in the court\u2019s instruction to the jury. See 3 Legal Papers of John Adams 212-214, 307-308 (L. Wroth &amp; H. Zobel eds. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>supra, is consistent with <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 56 n.6. Other State courts that have addressed the issue of dying declarations, <em>post-Crawford, </em>agree. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Monterroso, </em>34 Cal. 4th 743, 764 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 834 (2005); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>356 Ill. App. 3d 1023, 1033 (2005); <em>Harkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>143 P.3d 706, 711 (Nev. 2006). See generally 30B M.H. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 7033, 58-59, 107-108 (interim ed. Supp. 2008). The Supreme Court of California discussed the issue in depth in the wake of <em>Crawford, </em>concluding that \u201cif, as <em>Crawford </em>teaches, the confrontation clause \u2018is most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law ... \u2018it follows that the common law pedigree of the exception for dying declarations poses no conflict with the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Monterroso, supra </em>at 765, quoting <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 54. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Monterrosa, supra </em>at 764, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>26 Mo. 431, 438 (1858) (\u201cdying declarations, made under certain circumstances, were admissible at common law, and that common law was not repudiated by our constitution in the clause referred to, but adopted and cherished\u201d). See also <em>Harkins </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>(\u201cbecause dying declarations were recognized at common law as an exception to the right of confrontation, they should continue to be recognized as an exception\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Nesbitt argues to the contrary, citing an unpublished memorandum opinion and order of the United States District Court for the proposition that \u201cthere is no rationale in <em>Crawford </em>or otherwise under which dying declarations should be treated differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ently than any other testimonial statement. This is so especially since the historical underpinnings of the exception fail to justify it.\u201d United States vs. Jordan, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 04-CR-229-B (D. Colo. Mar. 3, 2005). However, that decision focused on whether dying declarations <em>ought </em>to be excluded from confrontation clause scrutiny as a matter of policy, rather than addressing whether such statements <em>are </em>excluded as a matter of preratification common law. In weighing the merits of <em>People </em>v. <em>Monter-roso, supra, </em>against those of United States <em>vs. </em>Jordan, <em>supra, </em>the Appellate Court of Illinois reached the same conclusion: \u201cWe believe that the reasoning of. <em>Monterroso </em>represents the sensible approach and choose to follow it instead of Jordan. <em>Crawford </em>provided an in-depth discussion of the right of confrontation as it existed at the time [of ratification] and offered a strong statement regarding the admissibility of dying declarations. Considering the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance on the issue, we are reluctant to expand that right beyond the historical parameters indicated in Crawford.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">As the <em>Crawford </em>Court stated, if \u201cthe Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations ... on historical grounds, it is sui generis.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 56 n.6. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 56 (\u201cMost of the hearsay exceptions [at common law] covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial \u2014 for example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy\u201d). Thus, in the unique instance of dying declarations, we ask <em>only </em>whether the statement is admissible as a common-law dying declaration, and not whether the statement is testimonial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In a prosecution for homicide at common law, a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>made by a declarant-victim under the belief of imminent death and who died shortly after making the statement, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be her own impending death, was admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polian, </em>288 Mass. 494, 497 (1934); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vona, </em>250 Mass. 509, 511 (1925).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, Brault\u2019s statement satisfies the requisite elements. She was the victim of the homicide; clearly expressed her fear of impending death to Marcure, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u201d and \u201c[D]on\u2019t let me die\u201d; and had just been stabbed twenty-three times. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>381 Mass. 19, 25 (1980), citing <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 U.S. 140, 151 (1892) (\u201cdeclarant\u2019s sense of impending death may be inferred from the character of [her] injury\u201d). She described the cause and circumstances of her impending death, and did so fifteen minutes before she died. Brault\u2019s statement, therefore, may properly be considered a common-law dying declaration, and was properly admitted regardless of whether it was testimonial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">3. <em>DNA evidence. </em>Nesbitt also contends that inconclusive DNA evidence from the handlebars of the bicycle was improperly introduced at trial. Because he did not object to its admission, we review the evidence to determine whether it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>450 Mass. 858, 872 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s DNA analyst testified that the blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>found on the bicycle\u2019s left handlebar yielded \u201cno results,\u201d meaning that \u201cvery little DNA [was] present\u201d or that it was \u201cvery degraded,\u201d or both. The expert was able to determine that the blood included DNA from a mixture of \u201cat least three people\u201d but nothing more than that \u201climited information.\u201d She then described her findings by stating: \u201cI was not able to exclude Dawne Brault or Ralph Nesbitt as being potential contributors to this very low level mixture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, supra </em>at 871-872, we stated that the admissibility of DNA results, even when those results are inconclusive, should be determined on a case-by-case basis. There, the centerpiece of the defense strategy was a challenge to the \u201cintegrity of the police investigation,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> including the adequacy of the testing of a large number of blood samples. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485 (1980). We concluded that \u201c[w]hen faced with such a suggestion, the prosecutor is entitled to introduce testimony to demonstrate that [DNA] tests were performed and results (even if inconclusive) were obtained.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, supra </em>at 872. Although in the <em>Mathews </em>case, \u201c[t]he question whether inconclusive DNA testing results would have been admissible (over objection) had the defendant not questioned the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation\u201d was not before us, <em>id. </em>at 872 n.15, we nonetheless set forth a guidepost for future cases: \u201cThe issue is primarily one of relevance. \u2018Generally a trial judge is accorded \u201csubstantial discretion in deciding whether evidence is relevant,\u201d and whether relevant evidence should be excluded if it is less probative than prejudicial.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>444 Mass. 586, 589 n.2 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, 392 </em>Mass. 604, 613 (1984). . . . Atrial judge\u2019s determination of the relevance of DNA test results is no different from other evidentiary decisions, and we will afford that decision substantial deference.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The present case is an imperfect vehicle for addressing the issue left unaddressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, supra. </em>Because defense counsel did not object, the relevance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>DNA evidence went largely unexplored.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We nevertheless stress here, as we did there, <em>id. </em>at 872 n.15, that for inconclusive DNA evidence to be admissible, it must be probative of an issue of consequence in the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schu-chardt, </em>408 Mass. 347, 350 (1990). The testimony regarding inconclusive DNA evidence, when phrased as it was here, was, at a minimum, prejudicial. It suggested to the jury that Nesbitt and Brault were linked to the blood (after all, they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be excluded\u201d as potential matches), and that this link would be more firmly established if only more blood were available for testing. The reality is quite different: no one \u2014 not Nesbitt, not Brault, not even the DNA analyst herself \u25a0\u2014 could be \u201cexcluded\u201d as a potential match, because the DNA could have come from anyone. As the DNA expert testified, \u201c[t]he probability of a randomly selected unrelated individual having contributed DNA to this mixture is approximately one in one of the Caucasian population, one in one of the African American population, and one in one of the Hispanic population.\u201d Unless that information is probative of some issue of consequence, its value is substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice and its misleading nature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>445 Mass. 821, 831 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Even if it were error to permit the introduction of testimony concerning the inconclusive DNA evidence, its admission did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, supra </em>at 872. The weight of the DNA evidence was thoroughly and effectively challenged on cross-examination by defense counsel, and even the prosecutor in his closing argument stated that the DNA was from \u201csuch a contaminated sample, it could be you, me, anybody associated with this case, or anybody else.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtV\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have examined the record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there is any basis to set aside or reduce the murder verdict, regardless of whether such grounds were raised on appeal. We conclude that the evidence supported Nesbitt\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree, by reason of premeditation or of extreme atrocity or cruelty, and that there is no basis on which to reduce that verdict or order a new trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> The Commonwealth nol pressed a third indictment charging armed assault in a dwelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> Nesbitt was not permitted to have personal contact with Nancy Robinson \u2014 she characterized their relationship as very violent \u2014 and while she had obtained a protective order against him, he was allowed to visit his children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> The evidence is unclear whether Nesbitt heard Brault\u2019s laugh, as he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>not comment on it.

The judge concluded that Marcure\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were inadmissible because they did not constitute a spontaneous utterance, and (implicitly) because they were testimonial in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> \u201cUnder traditional Massachusetts procedure, the judge and then the jury are to determine whether the requirements for a dying declaration have been established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>381 Mass. 19, 22 (1980), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polian, </em>288 Mass. 494, 498-499 (1934). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 781-782 (1995) (judge must determine by preponderance of evidence that elements of dying declaration are satisfied, and if statement is admitted, judge must then instruct jury that they must also find by preponderance of evidence that same elements are satisfied before they may consider substance of statement). Here the judge initially found that the statement was a dying declaration, and before deliberations the jury were instructed that they must not consider Brault\u2019s statement substantively unless they found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the statement was a spontaneous utterance or a dying declaration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> The dying declaration exception has been expanded beyond the common-law rule as stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polian, </em>288 Mass. 494, 497 (1934), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vona, </em>250 Mass. 509, 511 (1925). See M.S. Brodin &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.19, at 560-561 (8th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>381 Mass. 19, 26 (1980), this court departed from the common-law rule that \u201cadmitted dying declarations only where the declarant\u2019s own death is the subject of the homicide indictment,\u201d and held that \u201c[w]here multiple homicides result from one felonious act, the dying declaration of one victim should be admitted to prove the homicides of the other common victims.\u201d The rule has also been expanded by statute, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 64 (addressing admissibility of dying declaration of woman whose death results from unlawful abortion).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Because Brault\u2019s statement here qualifies under the narrower concept of a dying declaration, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polian, supra, </em>we need not address whether the dying declaration exception implicit in the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 extends to the boundaries of our current, expanded concept of dying declarations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 177 (1992) (holding \u201cfailure of the police to conduct certain tests is a permissible ground on which to build a defense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> The record reveals that defense counsel exhibited an inclination to challenge the adequacy of the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation. At the charge conference, defense counsel requested an instruction pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485 (1980), noting, inter alla, that although the investigation of the minder revealed blood on the floor of another location in Brault\u2019s backyard, that blood was not \u201csent out for DNA analysis.\u201d Although the instruction was denied, defense counsel specifically mentioned the failure to test the blood taken from the shed in his closing argument. Whether defense counsel would have raised the same issue with regard to the blood found on the bicycle cannot be gleaned from the transcript. Thus, there is no telling whether the fact that DNA analysis was performed, even though the results were inconclusive, was probative of an issue in the case. See <em>Harris-Lewis </em>v. <em>Mudge, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 485 (2004), citing P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.1.1, at 108 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cThe concept of relevance has two components: [1] the evidence must have some tendency to prove a particular fact; and [2] that particular fact must be material to an issue in the case\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> Defense counsel similarly addressed the inconclusive DNA evidence in his closing, noting that given the expert testimony, neither he nor the prosecutor could be excluded as a potential match.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> We likewise conclude that Nesbitt\u2019s conviction of armed burglary, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14, was supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
