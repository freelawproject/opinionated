L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A), of the workers\u2019 compensation law, which defines the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d requires a greater \u201cwork-relatedness\u201d nexus for emotional and mental injury compensation than is required for physical injury compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. Generally, a worker may recover for all personal injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201carising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. However, compensable personal injuries are defined to include mental or emotional disabilities \u201conly where the predominant contributing cause of such disability is an event or series of events occurring within any employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In upholding an administrative judge\u2019s award of partial disability payments to an employee of the Department of Correction (department) for a mental or emotional injury, the reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) held that the phrase \u201coccurring within any employment\u201d is not more narrow than \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d The department appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We gather the following information from the administrative judge\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Cosmo Bisazza was employed as a correction officer by the department. He worked in the special housing unit (SHU) at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord. The SHU provides separate housing for gang members, pedophiles, murderers, and sex offenders serving State prison sentences. Its purpose is to protect them from attacks by the general prison population. Bisazza began working there in 1995, and did not suffer job-related stress or anxiety prior to 2003. He did not have a history of psychiatric or emotional difficulties, either before or during his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In 2002, convicted child molester and former priest John Geoghan was assigned to the SHU. On March 23, 2002, Bisazza discovered feces in Geoghan\u2019s cell, and Geoghan accused Bis-azza of placing them there. An investigation by the department found that Bisazza was not responsible. Geoghan then made several more accusations against Bisazza; these claims were also not substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Geoghan was transferred to a maximum security facility in April, 2003. Bisazza continued to work at the SHU. Geoghan was murdered by another prisoner on August 23, and several newspaper articles describing the incident were published over the next few days. The articles stated that prior to Geoghan\u2019s murder, unnamed correction officers had \u201ctortured\u201d him and had thrown feces at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>After the first articles were published, SHU inmates changed their behavior toward Bisazza as part of a campaign to intimidate him. The inmates, including convicted murderer Lewis S. Lent, Jr., taunted Bisazza and threatened to \u201cget\u201d him. The inmates threatened to tell a newspaper that Bisazza was the one who had tortured and harassed Geoghan, and said that the newspaper would publish their claims (even though false) and his name. They also told him that there was nothing he could do about it. Bisazza began to feel anxiety and stress; on August 30, he left work early because of his anxiety. Beginning September 4, 2003, the Boston Herald newspaper published a series of articles repeating inmates\u2019 claims that Bisazza had harassed and beaten Geoghan, and that he had placed feces in Geoghan\u2019s cell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The department transferred Bisazza to a new position on September 5, 2003, but his anxiety continued. Bisazza suffered from stomach cramps and pain, and was unable to eat or sleep. As a result, he stopped working as a correction officer on September 16, 2003, and commenced treatment with a psychiatrist, who prescribed medications to reduce his anxiety and help him sleep. Bisazza subsequently filed a claim with the DIA for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In connection with his claim, Dr. Ronald Abramson, a psychiatrist, examined Bisazza in 2005. After an evidentiary hearing, the administrative judge adopted Dr. Abramson\u2019s report, including his analysis and diagnosis of Bisazza\u2019s symptoms. Dr. Abramson reported that, in his opinion, Bisazza suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder; that Bisazza was unable to continue working at the department; that the disability was \u201cthe direct result of trauma the employee suffered at work\u201d; and that the trauma at work \u201ccaused the psychiatric diagnosis.\u201d The administrative judge also adopted Dr. Abramson\u2019s opinion that Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Lent\u2019s allegations to the press \u201ccomposed part of the work trauma,\u201d and that there was a direct, causal connection between the inmates\u2019 harassment of Bisazza at the SHU and his symptoms. Finally, the judge adopted Dr. Abramson\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe public press problem is more important than the inmate allegations with respect to the stress disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In awarding Bisazza partial disability benefits,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge concluded that while the predominant cause of his mental or emotional injury was the negative publicity rather than the inmate harassment, the \u201cinmates\u2019 taunts that the employee would be named in the newspaper [were] part of the continuous process culminating in the articles naming the employee.\u201d Consequently, Bisazza suffered a mental or emotional injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment. The board affirmed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In workers\u2019 compensation cases, \u201c[i]t is the exclusive function of the board to consider and weigh the evidence and to ascertain and settle the facts.\u201d <em>McEwen\u2019s Case, </em>369 Mass. 851, 853 (1976), quoting <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707 (1947). The board\u2019s decision \u201cis not to be reversed unless it is lacking in evidentiary support or a different conclusion is required as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass. 357, 359 (1980), citing <em>D\u2019Angeli\u2019s Case, </em>369 Mass. 812, 815 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">a. <em>The work-relatedness standard. </em>The gist of the department\u2019s argument is that the board erred in deciding that there is no higher \u201cwork-relatedness\u201d requirement for emotional and mental injuries than for physical injuries. Specifically, the department argues that the phrase \u201cwithin any employment\u201d creates a \u201cwork-relatedness\u201d requirement greater than the requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>an injury \u201carise out of and in the course of employment.\u201d The department further contends that the negative publicity, which the judge concluded was the predominant cause of the injury, did not occur \u201cwithin\u201d Bisazza\u2019s employment. It rests its argument on a comparison of the language in two sections of the workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The general rule is that an employee must be compensated if the employee \u201creceives a personal injury <em>arising out of and in the course of his </em>employment\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. However, the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1, includes an emotional or mental injury only if \u201cthe predominant contributing cause of such disability is an event or series of events <em>occurring within any </em>employment\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A). The department essentially contends that the phrase \u201coccurring within\u201d employment is a limitation to the general \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d standard. Relying on a dictionary definition of \u201cwithin,\u201d it posits that the statute allows compensation only if the emotional or mental injury occurred \u201cin the scope of employment,\u201d which it contends is the same standard required in cases of vicarious liability. The administrative judge and the board disagreed, and held that the \u00a7 1 (7A) \u201cwork-relatedness\u201d standard is no different from the \u00a7 26 \u201carising out of\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\u201cWe give substantial deference to a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration [and] enforcement . . . .\u201d <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). In this case, the bare statutory language does not compel a different interpretation than the one given by the board. The phrase \u201coccurring within\u201d employment is not fundamentally different from \u201carising out of and in the course of\u201d employment. Even assuming, ar-guendo, that the phrases hold different meanings, it is not clear that the phrase \u201coccurring within\u201d employment would establish a stricter work-relatedness standard. While the department reaches this conclusion after citing the American Heritage Dictionary and comparing that definition to a vicarious liability standard, it seems equally plausible that \u201coccurring within\u201d employment would be the weaker standard, because the department concedes that \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>not one, but two factors: a causal element and a \u201ctime, place, and circumstances\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In any event, the department\u2019s logical leaps do not cast sufficient doubt to require overruling the board\u2019s interpretation. That interpretation is shared by the leading treatise on the subject, which opines: \u201cIt is not likely that the legislature, in using the phrase \u2018occurring within the employment,\u2019 intended either to enlarge or narrow the requirement that the event or series of events arise out of and in the course of employment.\u201d L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 9.9, at 246 (3d ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The board\u2019s interpretation is also consistent with the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 1 (7A): creating a stricter event-related causation standard, not a stricter work-relatedness standard. Historically, the court has long held that the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d included emotional or mental disabilities that arose from physical traumas. See, e.g., <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 351, 355-356 (1915) (neurotic condition resulting from eye injury constituted personal injury). However, beginning in 1978, the court expanded the term to include emotional or mental disabilities arising from mentally traumatic events. See, e.g., <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 18 (1979) (series of stressful arguments caused compensable personal injury); <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 637-638 (1978) (psychological condition resulting from death of fellow correction officer constituted personal injury). While these decisions were confined to cases where the employee\u2019s injury arose from a specific, identifiable event, it remained uncertain whether compensation would be required for general \u201cwear-and-tear\u201d mental and emotional injuries that did not arise from such an event. See <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 116 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The Legislature responded to this uncertainty by adding the third sentence of \u00a7 1 (7A), requiring that \u201ca contributing cause\u201d of the mental or emotional disability be \u201can event or series of events within any employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A), as amended by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 11. Read in the context of our jurisprudence at the time, it is apparent that the Legislature intended to limit compensation to those emotional and mental injuries that arose from specific traumatic events. See L.Y. Nason, C.W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9.9, at 245-246. In later amendments, the Legislature raised the causation standard to \u201ca significant contributing cause,\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A), as amended through St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 6, and then \u201cthe predominant contributing cause,\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A), as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 14. All of these amendments are consistent with the goal of denying compensation for nonspecific emotional and mental disabilities. There is no evidence that the Legislature meant to somehow limit the \u201cwork-relatedness\u201d standard by inserting the \u201coccurring within\u201d employment language. Rather, \u201cit is more reasonable to consider that the [Ljegislature was using the phrase merely as \u2018shorthand\u2019 for \u2018arising out of and in the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9.9, at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, interpreting \u00a7 1 (7A) to have created a new, slightly narrower, work-relatedness standard would introduce unnecessary confusion in an effort to achieve an unclear benefit. The department suggests that the court adopt the rule found in vicarious liability law and allow compensation only if the mental or emotional injury occurs within \u201cthe scope of employment.\u201d However, the department does not explain how vicarious liability standards would be intertwined with workers\u2019 compensation law; it argues only that the work-relatedness standard would become \u201ccertainly narrower.\u201d We see no need to create an additional, unnecessary work-relatedness standard in apparent contravention of the Legislature\u2019s intent and the board\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">b. <em>Connection to employment. </em>The board also properly concluded that the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d of Bisazza\u2019s injury was adequately connected to his employment under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A). The department relies on <em>Collier\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 374 (1954), in arguing that the causal connection was insufficient. In that case, the court affirmed a ruling of the board that an after-hours attack by a male customer on a waitress was not continuous with an earlier argument that occurred between the two on the employment premises over her refusal to serve him liquor. Consequently, the injuries were not \u201creceived in the course of her employment\u201d and were not compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 376-377. Similarly, the department argued that the newspaper articles in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>this case were not sufficiently connected to the inmates\u2019 taunts to award compensation. The board disagreed, distinguishing <em>Collier\u2019s Case, supra, </em>and concluding that there was a sufficient, continuous connection to justify compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s conclusion. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Veterinary Med., </em>399 Mass. 901, 905-906 (1987). The psychiatrist who evaluated Bisazza found that there was \u201ca direct causal connection between the harassment and the humiliation that the employee suffered by the inmates in the SHU and the development of symptoms.\u201d The administrative judge held, and the board affirmed, that \u201cthe employee\u2019s emotional injury clearly originated with the inmates\u2019 taunts and threats at work.\u201d Although the newspaper articles were the predominant cause of the injury, the board, quoting <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102, 107 (1949), held that \u201cthe whole affair had its origin in the nature and conditions of the employment, so that the employment bore to it the relation of cause to effect.\u201d Because the inmates\u2019 threats included the promise to provide false, damaging stories to the press, the board was justified in deciding that there was a continuous connection between the newspaper articles and Bisazza\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1 (7A) rests on adequate evi-dentiary support and is not contrary to law. Therefore, we affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> On September 4, 2003, the Boston Herald published an article entitled \u201cCons: Guard Dogged Priest,\u201d which repeated many of the inmates\u2019 allegations. Citing unnamed sources, the article described claims that Bisazza had \u201cmade life \u2018horrific\u2019 \u201d for Geoghan. Later articles included Bisazza\u2019s photograph and repeated claims that Bisazza verbally and psychologically abused inmates, and that he was responsible for placing feces in Geoghan\u2019s cell. The newspaper even published excerpts of a letter from Lent, in which he wrote, \u201c[Bisazza] wanted me and [Geoghan] to live there in fear for our lives every minute</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> At the time Bisazza filed his workers\u2019 compensation claim, he also earned income as the owner of a martial arts studio. Because he was able to continue managing that business after the SHU incident, he sought only partial incapacity benefits, essentially the difference between his earnings at the department and the martial arts studio. This was the relief he was awarded under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35. Bisazza subsequently opened a second martial arts studio in August, 2004. By the time the department\u2019s appeal was heard by the board, the income Bisazza was earning from those studios was greater than the salary he had received as a correction officer; therefore, he was no longer receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The department seeks to recover all of the payments previously made to Bisazza.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> AIthough we need not decide the point, it is questionable whether the court would rule as it did in <em>Collier\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 374 (1954), if those same facts were before it today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
