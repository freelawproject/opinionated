We conclude that the benefits should be based on the employee\u2019s total average weekly wage, whether received from an insured or uninsured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On September 1, 2001, Michael Sellers was assisting with the trimming of trees when a heavy tree limb fell on him, fracturing two of his vertebrae, lacerating his spinal cord, and leaving him a quadriplegic. Sellers, who was thirty-three years old at the time of his injury, is now permanently and totally incapacitated from working.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Sellers was injured while working for John Havlin Tree Service (Havlin), which, in violation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), G. L. c. 152, did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was concurrently employed by, and earned most of his income from, the Steve Miller Company (Miller), which was properly insured under the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Sellers\u2019s injury occurred while he was working for an uninsured employer, the trust fund, to which all Massachusetts employers subject to the act must contribute, is required to pay his workers\u2019 compensation benefits. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65 (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Letteney\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number><em>Case, </em>429 Mass. 280, 285 &amp; n.3 (1999). Additionally, because Sellers\u2019s work-related injury left him totally and permanently disabled, he is entitled to \u201ca weekly compensation of two-thirds of his average weekly wage before the injury.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Following his injury, Sellers filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Department of Industrial Accidents. An administrative judge held a conference between the parties pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and subsequently issued a conference order awarding Sellers temporary total incapacity benefits from the date of his injury calculated by considering only his average weekly wage from Havlin, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>uninsured employer. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Both Sellers and the trust fund appealed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A (3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At a de nova hearing before the same judge, <em>id., </em>the parties stipulated that, for purposes of receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Sellers\u2019s injuries had left him permanently and totally disabled, and agreed that the sole issue remaining for consideration was the determination of Sellers\u2019s average weekly wage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge then reached a different conclusion, ruling that the trust fund must pay Sellers permanent total incapacity benefits calculated by considering his average weekly wage from both employers, Havlin and Miller. She also awarded Sellers his attorney\u2019s fees. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The trust fund took an appeal to the reviewing board (board). Citing, among other things, the lack of a \u201cpolicy or rationale to justify an interpretation\u201d that \u201cwould deprive the employee the benefit of his concurrent earnings,\u201d the board affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. The trust fund appealed. The Appeals Court reversed, stating that, because of the definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d contained in the act, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u201cconstrained to conclude\u201d that Sellers was \u201cnot entitled to have his average weekly wages calculated by combining his concurrent wages earned from both the uninsured employer and the insured employer.\u201d <em>Sellers\u2019s Case, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 75, 76 (2008). We granted Sellers\u2019s application for further appellate review. We now affirm the decision of the board.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Because \u201cthe primary goal of the act is wage replacement,\u201d <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, </em>448 Mass. 79, 83 (2006), an employee permanently and totally disabled in the course of employment is eligible for weekly compensation benefits based on the employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d before the injury. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A. \u201cAverage weekly wages,\u201d in turn, are defined in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), which states, in part, that \u201c[i]n case the injured employee is employed in the concurrent service of more than one <em>insured </em>employer or self-insurer, his total earnings from the several insured employers and self-insurers shall be considered in determining his average weekly wages\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The trust fund argues that the plain meaning of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d precludes Sellers from receiving workers\u2019 compensation payments based on his concurrent earnings from both Miller and Havlin. Sellers responds that where, as here, the statutory language does not address the precise issue presented, the definitional section must be interpreted in the context of the purposes of the act and the workers\u2019 compensation insurance scheme as a whole. We agree. Precluding an injured employee such as Sellers from receiving wage replacement benefits calculated on the basis of his concurrent employment because one of his employers failed to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance would be contrary to the purposes of the act, is not compelled by the statutory language, and would be inconsistent with the mandate of the definitional section of the act to consider the issue presented in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The concurrent employment provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), on which the trust fund relies, was added to the definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d in 1935. St. 1935, c. 332, \u00a7 1. Prior to 1935, an injured employee who had more than one concurrent employer was usually awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits based solely on wages paid by the employer in whose employ the employee was working when injured. See <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 401, 402-403 (1956) (citing cases prior to 1935 in which rate of compensation was based only on wages where employee was injured). But see <em>Gillen\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 96 (1913) (awarding compensation based on wages from all employers where longshoreman worked for many employers during course of day or week). Then in 1935, the Governor, in an address to the Legislature, proposed that the existing workers\u2019 compensation scheme be \u201cliberalized and strengthened.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>1935 Senate Doc. No. 1, at 14. He requested, among other things, that the Legislature define the term \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d \u201cmore equitably\u201d for the \u201cprotection of workers suffering serious injury in the discharge of their duties,\u201d noting that injured workers too frequently received a \u201cpaltry sum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Within months, the Legislature had amended the definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d to include a provision for the calculation of wages in cases of concurrent employment, the provision at issue here. St. 1935, c. 332, \u00a7 1. Our task is to determine whether that amendment limits the calculation of average weekly wage benefits to only those employees who are employed concurrently by two or more <em>insured </em>employers, excluding all employees engaged in the concurrent service of one or more uninsured employers. We do so employing familiar canons of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Where, as here, a statute is \u201csimply silent\u201d on a particular issue, we interpret the provision \u201cin the context of the over-all objective the Legislature sought to accomplish.\u201d <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>LeFrancois Constr. Corp., </em>430 Mass. 663, 667 (2000). See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>438 Mass. 282, 288 (2002) (changes to statutory scheme \u201cmust be interpreted in context\u201d). That context is not in doubt. As this court has long recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">\u201cThe Act was enacted as a \u2018humanitarian measure\u2019 in response to strong public sentiment that the remedies afforded by actions of tort at common law did not provide adequate protection to workers. . . . It is a remedial statute and should be given a broad interpretation, viewed in light of its purpose and to \u2018promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-7\"><em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995), quoting <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). See <em>CNA Ins. Cos. </em>v. <em>Sliski, </em>433 Mass. 491, 493 (2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">As noted earlier, the \u201cbeneficent design\u201d that the workers\u2019 compensation scheme seeks to accomplish is \u201cwage replacement\u201d for injured employees, <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 83, which is to be calculated on the basis of the injured employee\u2019s earning capacity. See <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, </em>423 Mass. 642, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>644 (1996), quoting 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 60.11(f), at 10-647 to 10-648 (1996) (\u201cThe entire objective of wage calculation is to arrive at a fair approximation of claimant\u2019s probable future earning capacity\u201d); <em>Gillen\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 99 (\u201cThe loss of [the employee\u2019s] capacity to earn, as demonstrated by his conduct in such regular employment, is the basis upon which his compensation should be based\u201d). We consider the application of the 1935 revisions to the definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d to Sellers\u2019 case against that background, recognizing that the 1935 amendment to the act, as all other such changes, \u201cshould be broadly construed to enlarge the rights of employees and liberalize its interpretation.\u201d L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 2. 12, at 48 (3d ed. 2003) (Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The purpose of the 1935 amendment to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 403. As this court noted, after 1935, an injured employee\u2019s compensation \u201cwas to be no longer computed only upon the rate of wages that he was receiving from the particular contract of employment in which he was actually engaged at the time of his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Concerning the Legislature\u2019s reference to \u201cinsured\u201d concurrent employers, it is obvious why the Legislature selected that term when it amended the statute in 1935. At the time, the workers\u2019 compensation scheme differed in two significant and relevant respects from the workers\u2019 compensation system now in place. First, in 1935 employer participation in the workers\u2019 compensation system was voluntary. See Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.3, at 20. Participation remained elective until 1943, when it became mandatory. <em>Id. </em>Second, in 1935 there had not yet been established a fund or other source of money to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits for employees injured while working for employers who elected not to purchase insurance. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 7.4, at 133. It was not until 1985 that the Legislature established a fund to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits for employees injured while in the employ of uninsured employers. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Thus in 1935, when the act was amended to provide for concurrent wages as the basis for calculating an injured employee\u2019s average weekly wages, the only employers within the \u201ccommon system\u201d of Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation, <em>Letteney\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>Case, </em>429 Mass. 280, 286 (1999), were those who voluntarily were \u201cinsured.\u201d St. 1935, c. 332, \u00a7 1. Employers who were not insured did not participate in and were not part of the system. There was, therefore, no need for the Legislature to advert to the calculation of average weekly wages by uninsured employers. See <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 284 (\u201cThe Legislature need not, and indeed cannot, anticipate every circumstance that may arise under a general principle it enacts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Since 1935, the Legislature has amended the act to mandate that nearly all employers carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance or qualify as self-insurers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See, e.g., St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 1; St. 1971, c. 811. It also has established the trust fund to pay for, inter alla, benefits for an employee injured while working for an employer who is not insured in contravention of the act. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Thus, unlike in 1935, today all Massachusetts employers subject to the act participate in the \u201ccommon system\u201d of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 286. The trust fund notes correctly that while the act has been amended in these respects, the Legislature has not amended the concurrent employment provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1). This, the trust fund concludes, reflects the \u201cmanifest intention\u201d of the Legislature to limit the scope of the definition of concurrent wages to insured employers only. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">One of the purposes of establishing the trust fund \u201cwas to give employees of uninsured employers the <em>same </em>rights, benefits, and duties under the workers\u2019 compensation act as employees of insuring employers\u201d (emphasis added). Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 7.4, at 133. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.04 (1997) (\u201cAn employee of any uninsured employer shall be entitled, without election and through the [trust fund], to the weekly compensation and other medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits provided under [G. L.] c. 152\u201d). Those \u201crights\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d include providing an injured employee with a monetary award that reflects the earning capacity of which the work-related injury deprived him. See <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, </em>423 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Mass. 642, 644-645 (1996), and cases and authorities cited; 5 A. Larson &amp; L.K. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 93.03[2] (2008) (purpose of act \u201cis to estimate accurately the claimant\u2019s earning capacity and provide compensation bearing a proper relation to it\u201d). The trust fund\u2019s reasoning relies on \u201cthe maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which is at most only a fallible aid to decision,\u201d would \u201clead to an awkward and even intolerable result, and is therefore abandoned for a more liberal or more encompassing approach.\u201d <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 348 &amp; n.6 (1978), citing Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 405 (1950). That maxim \u201cis not to be followed where to do so would frustrate the general beneficial purposes of the legislation.\u201d <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Auth., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975) (discussing G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32). Cf. <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 376 (2005) (Sosman, J., concurring) (\u201cone searches in vain for any reason why the Legislature would have so distorted the workers\u2019 compensation system merely because the injured worker was injured on a public construction project as opposed to some other type of job\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">When faced with an analogous situation, this court has reached a result similar to the one we reach today. In <em>Van Bibber\u2019s Case, </em>343 Mass. 443 (1962), the court interpreted a provision in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, which limited the liability of workers\u2019 compensation insurers to injuries taking place in or about the contractor\u2019s \u201cpremises\u201d when the insured employer had subcontracted its work.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 1938, c. 102, provided, \u201cThe word \u2018premises,\u2019 as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>this section, shall include the public highways if the contract requires or necessitates the use of the public highways.\u201d <em>Van Bibber\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 449-450. The employee, who was employed to haul fill from a gravel pit, was injured on a road that provided the only access to the pit, and the evidence did not establish that the road was a \u201cpublic highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. This court, holding that the 1938 amendment \u201cshould be construed to effectuate its purpose which plainly was to enlarge rather than to restrict the meaning of the word \u2018premises,\u2019 and thus broaden the protection afforded to workmen under the act,\u201d concluded that benefits should not be conditioned on whether the road was a \u201cpublic highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450-451. The 1935 amendment at issue in this case was similarly plainly enacted to enlarge rather than to restrict the meaning of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d and should not be used to restrict benefits to employees who are grievously injured while in the employ of employers who are illegally uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Our conclusion is also consistent with the definitional instructions of the act. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), states, at the outset, that \u201c[t]he following words as used in this chapter shall, <em>unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context </em>or specifically prescribed, have the following meanings\u201d (emphasis added). The context of the establishment of the trust fund and the mandating of workers\u2019 compensation insurance for nearly all employers after 1935 requires the trust fund to pay Sellers workers\u2019 compensation benefits calculated on his average weekly wages from both of his employers, uninsured and insured.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-16\"> The Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (trust fund) was established in 1985, St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 55, to provide, among other things, a source of payment for an employee who suffers a work-related injury while working for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>employer who does not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance in violation of the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme.

Where, by reason of the shortness of the time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or the nature or terms of the employment, it is impracticable to compute the average weekly wages, as above defined, regard may be had to the average weekly amount which, during the twelve months previous to the injury, was being earned by a person in the same grade employed at the same work by the same employer, or, if there is no person so employed, by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment and in the same district. In case the injured employee is employed in the concurrent service of more than one insured employer or self-insurer, his total earnings from the several insured employers and self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>insurers shall be considered in determining his average weekly wages. Weeks in which the employee received less than five dollars in wages shall be considered time lost and shall be excluded in determining the average weekly wages; provided, however, that this exclusion shall not apply to employees whose normal working hours in the service of the employer are less than fifteen hours each week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">\u201cExcept as provided by [G.
