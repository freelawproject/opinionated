The four charges were contained in two separate informations and were consolidated for trial to a jury. On appeal, the defendant raises two claims. First, he asserts that the trial court was incorrect in denying his motion to sever the two informations and in failing to instruct the jury that it was to deliberate on the evidence presented in each case separately. Second, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on the burden of proof. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts. On October 17, the victims, who resided in Milford, were out of town. A neighbor was watching their house and feeding the family cat. When the neighbor let the cat out on the morning of October 17, everything in the house was in order. On returning later that afternoon, the neighbor discovered that the house had been burglarized. The police were called and determined that the burglar had entered the house by prying open the rear door. After being summoned by their neighbor, the victims returned to their home, took an inventory of their property and determined that approximately $17,000 worth of items had been stolen. The stolen items included a forty-six inch television, a video cassette recorder, a twenty-five inch television, silverware, children\u2019s video tapes, several jeweled rings, some costume jewelry, and numerous articles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of clothing. Among the stolen items of clothing was a blue denim jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The next day, October 18, at approximately 3 a.m., Milford Police Officer Robert Nash arrived at the same house to investigate a report of a burglary in progress. Nash determined that someone had gained access to the premises by breaking a window. The officer saw a light flicker on and off in the kitchen, and then observed the defendant attempting to slide a mattress out through the door to the deck. When Nash identified himself, the defendant ran from the scene. The defendant was arrested a short time later in the backyard of a nearby house. When arrested, the defendant was wearing a jacket later identified by one of the victims as the one stolen on October 17. Inside the pocket of the jacket was a slip of paper bearing the name, address and phone number of one of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Motion to Sever</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The defendant moved to sever the two cases, asserting that a joint trial would likely result in substantial injustice and prejudice to him. After a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to sever. The court ruled that the evidence in both cases would overlap and that two trials would result in unnecessary duplication.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-57<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 829<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorize a trial court to try a defendant jointly on two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>or more informations or indictments. The trial court\u2019s decision to allow a joint trial will not be disturbed unless the record evinces a manifest abuse of discretion. The discretion of the court to order separate trials should be exercised only when the defendant\u2019s rights will be substantially prejudiced by a joint trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 67-68, 530 A.2d 155 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>139 Conn. 234, 240, 93 A.2d 154 (1952). It is well settled that when a defendant challenges the court\u2019s decision to join separate charges for trial, he must show that the court\u2019s refusal to sever resulted in substantial injustice and that the resulting prejudice to the defendant was beyond the court\u2019s curative jury instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 94-95, 544 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 721, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>187 Conn. 292, 302, 445 A.2d 901 (1982). It is not enough to show that the joint trial was less than advantageous to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The state\u2019s case relating to the defendant\u2019s activity on October 18 was the stronger of the two cases. The defendant claims that because the state\u2019s case was stronger on the defendant\u2019s complicity in the burglary and larceny crimes perpetrated on October 18 than its case concerning those perpetrated on October 17, joinder of the two cases permitted the jury to consider highly prejudicial evidence of his culpability for the crimes that occurred on October 18 while deliberating his involvement in the burglary and larceny of October 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In general, evidence of a defendant\u2019s commission of one crime may not be used to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt of another crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra. In a joint trial, there is an omnipresent risk that although the quantum of evidence on any one of the charges may, when considered alone, be insufficient to persuade the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>jury of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the sum of the evidence admitted on all charges will be sufficient for a conviction on all. Id., 721-22. \u201cThis risk is greatly enhanced when the offenses joined are factually similar, but legally unrelated.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">When the trial court\u2019s decision to consolidate cases is challenged, the defendant bears the burden of showing that the joinder of his cases resulted in substantial injustice and that any resulting prejudice could not be avoided by the court\u2019s curative instructions to the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra. The factors that the reviewing court should weigh in determining whether the consolidation resulted in prejudice to the defendant include (1) whether the offenses are factually similar but legally unrelated, (2) whether the charges involve discrete, easily distinguishable, factual scenarios, (3) whether the crimes were of a violent nature or involved brutal or shocking conduct by the defendant, and (4) the duration and complexity of the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 95; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 722-23. If we find that any of these factors caused prejudice to the defendant, we must then decide whether the trial court\u2019s instructions cured any prejudice that might have resulted from their existence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>215 Conn. 538, 547, 577 A.2d 694 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 722-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In applying these standards to the case before us, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision not to sever was correct. The offenses are factually similar and legally related. The fact that two burglaries and two larcenies were committed at the same house, within a twenty-four hour period, may be indicative that the perpetrator is the same for each. In order for the state to prove that the defendant was responsible for the offenses of October 17 it had to prove that the defendant was in the house on that date. This was established by the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>timony of one of the victims that the jacket was stolen on October 17 and that the defendant was wearing it on October 18 when he was arrested. If there was a separate trial for the burglary and larceny of October 17, testimony that the defendant was wearing the jacket stolen on that day during the burglary on the next day would have been admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In addition, the case was not complicated. The case was tried and a verdict was returned in two days. The jury heard testimony from only seven state\u2019s witnesses. As was his right, the defendant offered no evidence in the case, putting the state to its burden of proof. The state\u2019s first and second witnesses, a neighbor of the victims and a police officer, testified about the October 17 offense. Sergeant Henry Povinelli testified that he first met the defendant after he was arrested for the October 18 burglary wearing the jacket that was reported stolen on the previous day. One victim testified about her inventory of the premises after the October 17 burglary. She testified that she saw the defendant at 3 a.m. on October 18 wearing the jacket stolen the previous day. After the victim testified, two police officers testified about their response to the burglary of October 18 and the fact that the defendant was apprehended wearing the blue denim jacket reported as stolen on October 17. The evidence was presented in a clear, orderly manner and was readily distinguishable in its application to each offense. The evidence did not indicate brutal or shocking conduct by the defendant. In addition, the trial court, pursuant to a request from the defendant, gave a supplemental charge to the jury with respect to the two separate informations. The trial court instructed the jury that the defendant was being tried for \u201cfour separate crimes and that it could convict him on all of them, acquit him on all of them or acquit him on some while convicting him on others . . . .\u201d This supplemental charge was given after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>defendant took an exception to the initial charge. The defendant did not except to this supplemental charge and did not seek further explanation on the separation of charges. The record discloses no manifest abuse of discretion. The trial court\u2019s decision to join the offenses was proper and caused no substantial injustice or prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The Reasonable Doubt Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The defendant raises two objections to the trial court\u2019s supplemental instructions on reasonable doubt. First, the defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that \u201creasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned.\u201d The defendant correctly states in his brief that our Supreme Court has rejected similar claims of error in <em>State </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>198 Conn. 328, 345-46, 502 A.2d 921, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S. Ct. 2279, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1986), and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 538, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986). The defendant attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Findlay </em>and <em>Leecan </em>by his assertion that this charge was given in a supplemental charge and not in the original charge. We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim. Similar language was specifically approved in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 342-43 n.2, 514 A.2d 337 (1986), and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>19 Conn. App. 594, 607-608, 563 A.2d 1372 (1989), aff\u2019d, 216 Conn. 172, 579 A.2d 484 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Second, the defendant claims that the court\u2019s definition of reasonable doubt as \u201cthe kind of doubt that in the serious affairs that concern you in your everyday life, you would pay heed and attention to.\u201d The defendant asserts that this definition is similar to a definition cited with disapproval in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 147-48, 554 A.2d 713 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>In <em>Smith, </em>the court upheld the charge but cited with disapproval the following language. \u201cOne which you as reasonable and prudent men and women would be willing to <em>act upon </em>in the more weighty and important matters relating to your own affairs.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 177-80, 571 A.2d 79 (1990), disapproved of the language \u201cwilling to act upon\u201d and stated its preference for the language \u201ccausing one to hesitate.\u201d The Supreme Court in both cases found that the difference in phraseology does not constitute reversible error in an otherwise adequate charge upon reasonable doubt. In this case, the language is similar to the language approved in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 607-608 n.6. Considering the charge on reasonable doubt as a whole, we find that it adequately defines the standard of proof in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-57 provides: \u201cjoinder of offenses of the same character. Whenever two or more cases are pending at the same time against the same party in the same court for offenses of the same character, counts for such offenses may be joined in one information unless the court orders otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 829 provides: \u201ctrial together of indictments or informations</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">\u201cThe judicial authority may, upon his own motion or the motion of any party, order that two or more indictments or informations or both, whether against the same defendant or different defendants, be tried together.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
