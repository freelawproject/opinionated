We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">This case arose out of a barroom argument that led to a fight in the parking lot outside the bar. The victim died of a stab wound to the heart and the defendant was charged with murder. At trial, the defendant claimed that he had acted in self-defense and the jury convicted him of the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The defendant had filed a written request to charge on self-defense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court instructed the jury that self-defense was a valid defense to the original charge of murder and to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (intentional manslaughter in the first degree). The court also specifically instructed the jury that the defense of self-defense was not applicable to the lesser included offenses of reckless manslaughter in the first degree, manslaughter in the second degree in violation of Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 53a-56<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and criminally negligent homicide in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s instruction deprived him of his fundamental right to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974). \u201cThis fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the [crime] was not justified.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The state raises a threshold question of reviewability. It argues that the defendant\u2019s claim was not properly preserved at trial and does not qualify for plain error review under Practice Book \u00a7 4185<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or review under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The general rule in Connecticut is that \u201c[t]he appellate court shall not be bound to consider error as to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or an exception has been taken immediately after the charge is delivered by the party appealing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 259, 476 A.2d 550 (1984); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>also Practice Book \u00a7 852. Section 852 provides these two options for preserving a claim, and either method alone is sufficient for this court to grant review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In the present case, the defendant properly submitted a written request pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852 to charge the jury on the defense of self-defense. He also submitted written requests to charge on murder and the lesser included offenses pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 854. The state argues that appellate review is barred by the defendant\u2019s failure to take an exception at trial when the court refused to instruct the jury that self-defense was a proper defense to the lesser included unintentional homicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Nowhere within the four corners of the written request for a self-defense instruction did the defendant limit his claim of self-defense to murder and intentional manslaughter in the first degree. We therefore conclude that the written request to charge on the defense of self-defense applied to the crime charged as well as to all lesser included offenses. The defendant was not required to take any further action to preserve his appellate rights, and accordingly we will review the merits of his claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of our conclusion that the defendant properly preserved this issue for appeal, we do not reach the state\u2019s other nonreviewability arguments that are based on an incorrect assumption that this claim was unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The defendant argues that the court should not have restricted the jury\u2019s consideration of self-defense to the intentional homicides but instead should have allowed the jury to consider it as a defense to the lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>unintentional offenses. Whether self-defense is a valid defense to a crime based on reckless conduct was recently addressed by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 569 A.2d 534 (1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In <em>Hall, </em>the Supreme Court concurred with the Appellate Court that the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree. Id., 586. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court determined that the trial court\u2019s failure to give this instruction was harmless because the defendant was acquitted of murder and convicted of the lesser included offense of intentional manslaughter in the first degree. The trial court had instructed the jury that the defense of self-defense was applicable only to murder and intentional manslaughter in the first degree. The Supreme Court reasoned that because the jury was fully instructed on the law of self-defense with respect to murder and intentional manslaughter in the first degree, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict of manslaughter in the first degree was necessarily a rejection of the defense of self-defense. Id., 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The present case can be distinguished from <em>Hall </em>in one significant aspect. Here, the court\u2019s failure to instruct on self-defense cannot be construed as harmless because, although the defendant was acquitted of murder like the defendant in <em>Hall, </em>this defendant was convicted of the unintentional offense of reckless manslaughter in the first degree. This jury returned a guilty verdict against the defendant for a crime in which it was not allowed to consider the defense of self-defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Unlike the court in <em>Hall, </em>this court cannot conclude that the conviction in this case was necessarily a rejection of the defense of self-defense by the jury because the jury acquitted the defendant of the two crimes in which it was allowed to consider the defense of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The state argues that <em>Hall </em>is distinguishable because the mental state required in reckless manslaughter in the first degree is different from that required in reckless manslaughter in the second degree. It claims that the trial court need not instruct on the defense of self-defense with respect to reckless manslaughter in the first degree because that crime requires the defendant to act under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, whereas, the crime of reckless manslaughter in the second degree does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The different statutory language of reckless manslaughter in the first degree and second degree does not require this court to carve out an exception prohibiting juries from considering the defense of self-defense for reckless manslaughter in the first degree when it is applicable to all other homicides. Moreover, since the defense of self-defense is available for murder, which is the extreme indifference to human life, it would be anomalous to conclude that the defense was not applicable to the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...
