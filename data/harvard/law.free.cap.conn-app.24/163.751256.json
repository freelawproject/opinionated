Wilkinson and Carol P. Wilkinson. The dispositive issue on appeal is whether a court or an administrative agency should be the first to decide whether that agency has jurisdiction over a particular subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiffs own five and one-half acres of land on Route 148 in Killingworth. The plaintiffs\u2019 property includes both a pond and wetlands. In the fall of 1988, the plaintiffs applied to the Killingworth planning and zoning commission for a permit to construct a horse barn and indoor riding arena on their property. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiffs filed a copy of the application with the IWWC with an application for wetlands review and a copy of the plot plan. The plaintiffs also requested that the IWWC issue a declaratory ruling<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that their proposed activities con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>stituted \u201cfarming\u201d and were therefore permitted as of right under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (l)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7 3.1.1 of the IWWC regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">At its meeting on January 11, 1989, the IWWC decided to require the plaintiffs to submit an application for a permit. The necessary forms were given to the plaintiffs. On January 25,1989, the plaintiffs again argued to the IWWC that no permit was needed because their proposed use was allowed as of right. The IWWC agreed to reconsider its decision and asked the plaintiffs to produce additional information, in particular a site plan sealed by a licensed engineer or surveyor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the IWWC\u2019s February 22,1989 meeting, the plaintiffs presented the definition of farming found in General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (q).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They failed, however, to submit a sealed site plan as requested by the IWWC. The IWWC determined, therefore, that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>had not proven that their proposed activities were farming and once again voted to require the plaintiffs to file an application for a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The plaintiffs appealed the IWWC\u2019s February 22 ruling to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In their appeal, the plaintiffs challenged the IWWC\u2019s authority to make such an order in light of the exemption for farming operations. The trial court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed activities were farming and, as such, were exempt from \u201cany of the [IWWC\u2019s] regulations.\u201d From that determination, the IWWC appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Our decision in this case is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990). The plaintiffs in <em>Cannata </em>informed the department of environmental protection (DEP) that they intended to cut down trees in an area regulated by that agency in order to expand their agricultural crop land. The commissioner of the DEP issued an ex parte cease and desist order, directing the plaintiffs to stop cutting trees because they had failed to apply for a permit as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-342. A hearing officer upheld the commissioner\u2019s order pending the plaintiffs\u2019 permit application and the DEP\u2019s final action on it. The plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Superior Court, claiming that the DEP could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>force them to apply for a permit because their proposed agricultural use was exempt from regulation under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-349. The trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal, holding that the exhaustion requirement mandated that the administrative agency be the first to determine its jurisdiction. The court noted the general rule that, when a mechanism for adequate judicial review exists, an administrative agency must determine whether it has jurisdiction in a particular situation. In addition, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[wjhen a particular statute authorizes an administrative agency to act in a particular situation it necessarily confers upon such agency authority to determine whether the situation is such as to authorize the agency to act\u2014that is, to determine the coverage of the statute\u2014and this question need not, and in fact cannot, be initially decided by a court.\u201d. . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The <em>Cannata </em>court also found that requiring the plaintiffs to submit to the permit process was not a futile or inadequate remedy. \u201cIssuance of a permit would provide the plaintiffs with the relief they seek. If the commissioner denies the plaintiffs a permit, they can then pursue an appeal to the Superior Court . . . challenging the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction and her decision denying them a permit. Therefore, the permit process ... is an adequate remedy available for the requested relief and is within the agency\u2019s authority to grant.\u201d Id., 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In the present case, the IWWC, like the DEP, must be given the first opportunity to determine its jurisdiction. Requiring the plaintiffs to apply for a permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is neither futile nor inadequate. If the IWWC finds that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed use is exempt from regulation under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (1), the plaintiffs will be allowed to conduct their activities without a permit. If the commission determines that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed use is not exempt, it must then decide whether to issue a permit. Like the plaintiffs in <em>Cannata, </em>the plaintiffs in the present case can appeal from an adverse ruling, challenging both the IWWC\u2019s jurisdiction and its decision denying them a permit. If, conversely, a permit is granted, the plaintiffs will have received the underlying relief sought, i.e., permission to build horseback riding facilities on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that the IWWC has in fact already determined that it has jurisdiction by virtue of its declaratory ruling. Our review of the record reveals, however, that the IWWC reserved its decision on whether the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed use was farming because the plaintiffs had failed to present, as required, a sealed site plan. Postponing the resolution of this issue until the plaintiffs have applied for a permit because the plaintiffs themselves refused to cooperate with the IWWC was well within the IWWC\u2019s discretion. See <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental </em>Protection, supra, 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> The individual members of the IWWC and the commissioner of the department of environmental protection were also named as defendants in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c provides: \u201cspecial permits, exceptions and EXEMPTIONS.
