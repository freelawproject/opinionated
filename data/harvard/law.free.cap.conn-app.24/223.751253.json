By their complaint, the plaintiffs sought reimbursement for the cost of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>swimming pool cover, and for additional amounts required to complete or repair work either not performed by the defendant, or done in a deficient manner. The defendant, by its counterclaim, sought an unpaid balance due, including claimed additional options, in the amount of $6095.51. The defendant alleges that the court improperly (1) held that General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) (6) is a special defense to its counterclaim, and (2) failed to consider adequately the defendant\u2019s objections to the factual findings. We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">This action was referred to an attorney factfinder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A hearing was conducted by the factfinder, and findings of fact were Issued on December 13, 1989. The factfinder found that on October 6,1986, the plaintiffs, Katherine A. Shaw and Marian B. Keegan, entered into a contract with the defendant, L.A. Socci, Inc. This contract provided that the defendant would remodel the plaintiffs\u2019 swimming pool according to certain specifications for the sum of $14,950. It was further found that the plaintiffs had paid the full contract price, which included handwritten extras for a total of $20,000, and had also expended $2409.27 to complete work unfinished by the defendant and to repair work of deficient quality that the defendant had performed. The plaintiffs paid $3500 for additional options and also spent $1662 for a new pool cover that was to have been furnished by the defendant. The factfinder recommended that judgment be rendered for the plaintiffs in the amount of $4071.57. He also recommended that the court deny the defendant\u2019s counterclaim because the plaintiffs had asserted a valid special defense under the Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) (6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court accepted these recommendations and rendered judgment accordingly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The defendant claims, the plaintiffs concede, and we agree that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the statutory special defense recommended by the factfinder and accepted by the trial court. General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) (6) was enacted in 1988 as part of Public Acts 1988, No. 88-269, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was not part of the Home Improvement Act as it existed in 1986 when this contract was formed. Therefore, it cannot be a valid special defense to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The plaintiffs argue, however, that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in their favor on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim because, although the grounds relied on by the trial court were improper, the court\u2019s decision was supported by other proper grounds. The plaintiffs argue that General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> barred the counterclaim even as it existed in October, 1986. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The provision, now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) (3), requires a home improvement contract to contain the entirety of the parties\u2019 agreement. The plaintiffs argue that because the written contract did not reduce the parties\u2019 entire agreement to writing, the contract cannot be enforced by the defendant through his counterclaim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">It is not clear whether the written contract of October 6,1986, which indisputedly amounted to $20,000, is the entire agreement of the parties. Also, it is not clear what is meant by \u201cadditional options\u201d and \u201cadditional work\u201d under the \u201cterms of the written contract\u201d as is claimed by the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The record is, therefore, inadequate to allow us to determine whether there is the requisite factual basis to determine the ultimate question necessary for the alternate ground, namely, whether the parties\u2019 entire agreement was reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We would affirm the judgment even if based on erroneous grounds \u201cif the same result is required by law.\u201d <em>A&amp;H Corporation v. Bridgeport, </em>180 Conn. 435, 443, 430 A.2d 25 (1980); see also <em>East Hartford </em>v. <em>East Hartford Municipal Employees Union, Inc., </em>206 Conn. 643, 646-47, 539 A.2d 125 (1988); <em>Golab </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>205 Conn. 17, 27, 529 A.2d 1297 (1987); <em>Herrmann </em>v. <em>Summer Plaza Corporation, </em>201 Conn. 263, 274, 513 A.2d 1211 (1986). We cannot, however, affirm the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>sion based on the statute cited by the plaintiff. The record shows that this statute was never considered by the factfinder, and both the factfinder\u2019s report and the court\u2019s memorandum of decision are devoid of factual support for the plaintiffs\u2019 position.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, we cannot determine whether the trial court would have been forced to conclude that the parties\u2019 entire agreement was not reduced to writing. Although \u201cthis court is authorized to rely upon alternative grounds supported by the record to sustain a judgment\u201d; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 461, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987); in this case, the record is insufficient to permit us to employ the alternative ground and does not supply justification to affirm. The judgment for the plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim must, therefore, be set aside, and a new hearing held regarding it on remand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The defendant next claims that the court did not properly \u201cattend to its objections\u201d to the factual findings. The defendants filed objections to two of the factual findings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 546H.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the finding that a new pool cover was included in the contract price, and the finding that a new contractor was hired to remedy defective work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The bases of these objections was the defendant\u2019s contention that the findings were conclusory and not supported by the evidence, and that the trial court had not adequately reviewed the findings of the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The trial court addressed the defendant\u2019s objections in the memorandum of decision: \u201cThe defendant has filed objections to the acceptance of the factfinder\u2019s recommendation. Two of the objections in essence ask that the court substitute its own findings of fact for those of the factfinder. This request must be denied in the light of the very recent decision in <em>Wilcox Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mansour Builders, Inc., </em>20 Conn. App. 420, 423, 567 A.2d 1250 (1989), cert. denied, 214 Conn. 804, 573 A.2d 318 (1990).\u201d The court relied on the language from <em>Wilcox </em>that \u201c[i]n a contract action findings of fact should be overturned only when they are clearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">It is not our function to review the findings of the factfinder initially to determine whether those findings were properly reached on the basis of subordinate facts found. That initial review is the duty of the trial court. Nothing in the record indicates that the trial court did not fulfill its duty. In <em>Wilcox, </em>the factfinder filed his findings and memorandum, and the plaintiff filed an objection stating that the setoff, claimed by the defendant and recommended by the factfinder, was not supported by the evidence. After the court reviewed those portions of the transcript supporting the findings on the setoff, it sustained the objections to the factfinder\u2019s report, upholding the defendant\u2019s setoff and rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount. It was clear, therefore, that the court reviewed the record and determined that the factfinder\u2019s recommendations were not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">While the record here does not, directly or implicitly, demonstrate that the court reviewed the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>determine whether the findings of fact to which the defendant objected were supported by the evidence, the defendant cannot show that such a review was not made. We must allow every reasonable presumption to be made in favor of the correctness of the actions of the trial court. <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Cookson, </em>201 Conn. 229, 244, 514 A.2d 323 (1986); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>17 Conn. App. 121, 124, 550 A.2d 645 (1988). The defendant asks that we presume that the court did not act to review; we presume that the court acted and did so correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The judgment on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on the counterclaim; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-5\"> Factfinders are limited to hearing contract actions \u201cbased upon an express or implied promise\u201d in which only \u201cmoney damages . . . less than fifteen thousand dollars\u201d are claimed.
