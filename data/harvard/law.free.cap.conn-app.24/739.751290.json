The plaintiff has cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>In its appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to credit its claim that the knowing but passive acceptance of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by the plaintiff precluded her from maintaining a civil action for her injury, (2) denied its motion to set aside the verdict, and (3) granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine that precluded the defendant from offering evidence of the receipt by the plaintiff of workers\u2019 compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In her cross appeal, the plaintiff challenges the actions of the trial court in (1) refusing to submit a CUTPA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> count to the jury, (2) refusing to admit the plaintiff\u2019s exhibit I for identification into evidence as a full exhibit, (3) submitting interrogatories to the jury, and (4) ordering the plaintiff to reimburse to the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer all payments made by it for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We affirm that portion of the judgment from which the defendant appeals and reverse the judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal with regard to the order of reimbursement only.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On January 30,1987, the plaintiff was employed as a cocktail waitress at a restaurant known as BT II, which was owned and operated by the defendant. She arrived at the restaurant sixty to ninety minutes before the commencement of her work day in order to eat a meal prior to beginning her shift. All employees of the defendant received discounts on food. The maximum discount was available only on days that the employee was scheduled to work. On the day in question, the plaintiff sat at a special table that was reserved for employees, ordered, and consumed a meal. Subsequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>she changed her clothes on the premises and prepared to begin work. Within seventy-two hours, the plaintiff was afflicted with salmonella poisoning. She notified the defendant that she would be unable to work because of the illness. As a consequence of her illness, the plaintiff was under the care of a physician, and was admitted to the New Britain General Hospital for four days. By February 27, 1987, the plaintiff was feeling well, although she was not permitted to resume work in a food handling facility until she had tested negative for salmonella on three successive occasions. The plaintiffs hospital, medical and prescription bills approximated $2342.38, and her lost wage claim was approximately $1600.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The Defendant\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AKcq\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The defendant first asserts that the plaintiffs knowing acceptance of workers\u2019 compensation benefits constitutes a waiver of her right to prosecute this civil action, and that a contrary result would frustrate the legislative intent of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Several additional facts are necessary to a resolution of this claim. After she fell ill, the plaintiff notified her supervisor of her illness and advised her that she would be unable to work her shifts. The supervisor notified the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. On its own, the carrier began sending checks to the plaintiff for lost wages, and paid medical, hospital and prescription bills on behalf of the plaintiff. The carrier\u2019s total expenditure was $3901. The carrier was not a party to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The defendant argues that the passive acceptance by the plaintiff of these payments precludes her from maintaining her civil action. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Our scheme of workers\u2019 compensation creates an exclusive remedy for job related injuries. <em>Sgueglia </em>v. <em>Milne Construction Co., </em>212 Conn. 427, 433, 562 A.2d 505 (1989). Our statute is mandatory in its terms and specifically provides that an employer \u201cshall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The defendant did not pursue either an estoppel theory or a claim of election of remedies before the trial court. Its theory, simply stated, is that voluntary payments that are made by an employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier to an employee who falls ill, preclude that employee from maintaining a civil action against the employer even where the plaintiff asserts that her illness did not arise out of or in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Our Supreme Court has expressly stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of the [workers\u2019] compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer.\u201d <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">We are not prepared to provide an employer with an election of remedies when the employee, for whose benefit the statute was enacted, is statutorily denied this privilege. See <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968). Our examination of the statutes relating to workers\u2019 compensation does not admit to such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>When a plaintiff has filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against a defendant employer seeking compensation for injuries, and the employee has been paid such benefits, the employee is thereafter precluded from seeking damages from the employer in a common law tort action. <em>Homey </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>167 Conn. 621, 622-23, 356 A.2d 879 (1975). We cannot, however, say that the defendant employer, by its voluntary actions, can create an exclusive remedy where none is created by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">It is a salutary rule of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 621, 441 A.2d 600 (1981). \u201cIn a word, these statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). \u201c \u2018 \u201cNo statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import. It is not to be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which it does not fairly express.\u201d . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>199 Conn. 537, 548, 508 A.2d 728 (1986); see also <em>Zotta </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>8 Conn. App. 169, 173, 511 A.2d 373 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">To apply the construction advocated by the defendant would, in effect, require us to amend the Workers Compensation Act by judicial fiat. This we are neither authorized nor prepared to do. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 268-69, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court was required to set aside the judgment because there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The legislative intent of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to compensate injured employees for those injuries arising out of and in the course of employment as a form of strict liability on the employer. <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In a situation where it is undisputed that the plaintiff was engaged in the course of his employment at the time of his injury, whether he is barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act from maintaining a civil action is a question of law for the court. <em>Velardi </em>v. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 371, 375, 423 A.2d 77 (1979). Conversely, where, as here, a factual dispute exists as to whether the injury complained of arose out of and in the course of employment, it is an issue for resolution by the trier of fact. <em>F.A.S. International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>179 Conn. 507, 513, 427 A.2d 392 (1980); see also <em>Parlato </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit, </em>181 Conn. 66, 434 A.2d 322 (1980). Further, in this case the defendant assumed the burden of proof on the issue of whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment by pleading the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as a special defense. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil Co., </em>202 Conn. 237, 520 A.2d 1008 (1987); see Practice Book \u00a7 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defendant argues that the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979), mandates a conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s injury arose out of or in the course of her employment. We do not agree. <em>McNamara </em>is an appeal from a decision of a compensation commissioner that held that an injury suffered by an employee during a Ping-Pong game on his employer\u2019s premises was not a compensable injury. The court in <em>McNamara </em>established tests for determining if an injury is compensable: \u201cIn order to be compensable, an injury must (1) arise out of employment; and (2) occur in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>course of the employment. To occur in the course of the employment, the injury must take place (a) within the period of the employment, (b) at a place where the employee may reasonably be, and (c) while the employee is reasonably fulfilling the duties of the employment or doing something incidental to it.\u201d Id., 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In addition, the rule for determining whether the activity is incidental to the employment turns on whether the activity is regularly engaged in on the employer\u2019s premises, within the period of employment, and with the employer\u2019s approval or acquiescence. Id. Nothing in <em>McNamara </em>transforms these issues into anything other than fact bound issues to be resolved by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">At the defendant\u2019s request, interrogatories were submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These interrogatories were prepared by the defendant and were submitted to the jury over the objection of the plaintiff. The trial court instructed the jury that in order for the defendant to prevail on its special defense, all five interrogatories must be answered in the affirmative. Additionally, the trial court charged the jury fully and fairly with respect to the special defense of exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>The defendant took no exceptions to this charge, and specifically did not except to the instruction that all five interrogatories had to be answered affirmatively for the defendant to prevail on its special defense. Further, the defendant does not argue on appeal that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that all five interrogatories had to be answered in the affirmative. It simply asserts that the jury\u2019s negative answer to the third interrogatory was not reasonably supported by the evidence. It is not our function to rewrite or amend the issues as presented, nor is it our right to decide issues that are not properly raised by the parties; see <em>Carley </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>10 Conn. App. 135, 140, 521 A.2d 1053 (1987); as is suggested in part I of the dissent, where it attempts to set forth a claim that all five interrogatories did not require affirmative answers for the defendant to prevail, a position not espoused by the defendant. See <em>L. F. Pace &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>9 Conn. App. 30, 35 n.4, 514 A.2d 766, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 811, 516 A.2d 886 (1986). The jury concluded that the injury did not occur while the plaintiff was reasonably fulfilling her duties of employment. On the evidence presented, the jury could fairly reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In determining whether a verdict should be set aside, the court is obligated first to review the evidence giving it a construction most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Kalleher v. Orr, </em>183 Conn. 125, 126-27, 438 A.2d 843 (1981). In addition, the trial court\u2019s refusal to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict is entitled to great weight, and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness. <em>Waldron </em>v. <em>Raccio, </em>166 Conn. 608, 618, 353 A.2d 770 (1974); <em>Shenefield </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>10 Conn. App. 239, 247, 522 A.2d 829 (1987). In reviewing this issue, our sole responsibility is to decide-whether, on the evidence presented, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>jury could fairly reach the conclusion they did. <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>204 Conn. 435, 440, 528 A.2d 364 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that the trial court was correct in denying the motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court acted improperly when it granted a motion in limine, the effect of which was to preclude the introduction of the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation payments into evidence. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Trial courts are vested with a wide and liberal discretion with respect to the relevancy of evidence. <em>Delott </em>v. <em>Roraback, </em>179 Conn. 406, 414, 426 A.2d 791 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Peruta, </em>24 Conn. App. 598, 591 A.2d 140 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The defendant now claims that it desired to offer evidence of compensation payments to impeach the credibility of the plaintiff. The record does not support this claim. The record reflects that the defendant intended to offer such evidence in order to claim that by accepting the voluntarily offered checks of the carrier, the plaintiff thereby admitted that the injury was compensable and that she is, therefore, barred from bringing an action in tort.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>In light of our discussions with respect to the workers\u2019 compensation issues, the trial court was correct in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The Plaintiff\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AATI\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The first claim made by the plaintiff in her cross appeal is that the trial court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on the third count of the complaint, which alleges a CUTPA claim in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. We disagree. Because the plaintiff failed to file a motion to set aside the verdict, however, we shall not provide a full review of this claim. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil Co., </em>supra, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Practice Book \u00a7 320 requires that motions to set aside the verdict must be filed within five days after the day the verdict is accepted. General Statutes \u00a7 52-228b provides in part that \u201c[n]o verdict in any civil action involving a claim for money damages may be set aside except on written motion by a party to the action, stating the reasons relied upon in its support, filed and heard after notice to the adverse party according to the rules of the court.\u201d The reason for requiring such a motion is to give the trial court an opportunity to pass upon claims that may become the subject of appeal. Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>250-51. The statute and the rule of practice apply with equal force to a directed verdict. Id. In the absence of compliance by the plaintiff with Practice Book \u00a7 320 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-228b, we are limited in our consideration of the attack upon the directed verdict to the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 310-11, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">As a basis for her claim of a CUTPA violation, the plaintiff alleged that her injuries were caused by the defendant\u2019s wilful, intentional or reckless disregard for safety and health standards and practices imposed on it by law and by common practice in the restaurant industry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the defendant so wilfully, wantonly, intentionally or recklessly violated such standards, that its conduct violated General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The only evidence offered in support of this count was exhibit H, a report of the state department of health services indicating that the defendant\u2019s restaurant was found at one inspection to have thirty-four violations of the health regulations. The totality of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was that on one occasion she was served food contaminated with bacteria and other organisms and impurities. The trial court concluded, and we agree, that a single inspection of the premises was not sufficient to establish wanton, intentional or reckless conduct as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201cA directed verdict is appropriate 'when the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached any other conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Lovallo, 2 </em>Conn. App. 579, 583, 481 A.2d 1286 (1984). A finding of liability cannot be predicated on conjecture, surmise or guess. <em>Berchtold </em>v. <em>Maggi, </em>191 Conn. 266, 273, 464 A.2d 1 (1983). Mere possibilities or suppositions will not sustain a legitimate inference of a fact, nor can such an inference be drawn by conjecture only. <em>Angelo Tomasso, Inc. </em>v. <em>Armor Construction &amp; Paving, Inc., </em>187 Conn. 544, 558 n.8, 447 A.2d 406 (1982). \u201cWhen an element necessary to a cause of action cannot be established without conjecture, the evidence presented cannot withstand a motion for a directed verdict.\u201d <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>201 Conn. 385, 389, 517 A.2d 624 (1986). By couching her complaint in the language that she did, the plaintiff assumed the burden of proving each and every allegation as a condition of having the issue submitted to the jury. An examination of exhibit H reveals that it does not support the claims of the complaint. Thus, the court correctly removed the issue from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The plaintiff also asserts that the trial court based its decision to direct a verdict on an incorrect interpretation of the CUTPA statute. An examination of the record does not support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The court correctly directed a verdict for the defendant on the CUTPA count of the complaint, and did not commit plain error in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court should have permitted her to enter the defendant\u2019s employee manual, that was marked as exhibit I for identification, into evidence as a full exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>The plaintiffs only claim of admissibility is that this exhibit could have impeached a witness on the question of employee benefits. Because this assertion goes only to the applicability of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to this cause of action, this claim is moot in light of our resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The plaintiff next attacks the trial court\u2019s submission of interrogatories to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The submission of interrogatories to the jury ordinarily rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Ubysz </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>185 Conn. 47, 61, 440 A.2d 830 (1981). The proper function of interrogatories is to provide a means by which the jury may record the findings of fact that form the basis for their verdict. <em>Gaulton </em>v. <em>Reno Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co., </em>177 Conn. 121, 127, 412 A.2d 311 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The record before us clearly supports the conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in submitting the interrogatories to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">As her final claim on her cross appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court acted improperly when it ordered that a part of the judgment recovered by the plaintiff be paid over to the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, a nonparty to this action. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Subsequent to the verdict in this case, the trial court held a hearing concerning the right of setoff claimed by the defendant in its third special defense. After hearing evidence and argument, the trial court found that the nonparty compensation carrier had paid either to the plaintiff, or for her benefit, the sum of $3902.61. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The trial court then ordered that that sum, or a negotiated lesser settlement, be reimbursed to the compensation carrier from the verdict proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The record is clear that the workers\u2019 compensation carrier did not seek to intervene; General Statutes \u00a7 31-293; nor was it impleaded by either party. As to this action, the carrier was not before the court and was a total stranger to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\u201c \u2018It is the settled rule of this jurisdiction, if indeed it may not be safely called an established principle of general jurisprudence, that no court will proceed to the adjudication of a matter involving conflicting rights and interests, until all persons directly concerned in the event have been actually or constructively notified of the pendency of the proceeding, and given reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winick </em>v. <em>Winick, </em>153 Conn. 294, 298, 216 A.2d 185 (1965). In the present case, no evidence exists that the carrier was either actually or constructively notified of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Additionally, the defendant\u2019s pleadings raise only the issue of a right of setoff as against the plaintiff. They do not allege a right of reimbursement that may or may not be due to a nonparty. \u201cPleadings have their place in our system of jurisprudence. While they are not held to the strict and artificial standard that once prevailed, we still cling to the belief, even in these iconoclastic days, that no orderly administration of justice is possible without them.\u201d <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Before the court has the power to hear and determine a cause, three elements must exist: (1) the court must have cognizance of the class of cases to which the one to be adjudged belongs; (2) the proper parties must be present; and (3) the point that is to be decided must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>be one that is properly raised by the pleadings. <em>Lobsenz </em>v. <em>Davidoff, </em>182 Conn. 111, 116, 438 A.2d 21 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In this case, the compensation carrier, who was a necessary party was not before the court, and the issue that was decided was not raised by the pleadings. The trial court improperly ordered that the plaintiff pay over any part of her recovery to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On the defendant\u2019s appeal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">On the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal, that part of the judgment that requires payment by the plaintiff to the workers\u2019 compensation carrier is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">In this opinion Foti, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-15\"> BT II, Limited Partnership, James H. Dumond and Wallace E. Ronald were named as defendants in the plaintiffs complaint. The action was withdrawn as to Dumond and Ronald before trial.

I may have used the word\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">\u201cThe Court: Use the language of estoppel, you\u2019ve used the language of estoppel in that second defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">\u201cMr. Pierce: I realize that. All I\u2019m saying is having held herself to be employee, by accepting the benefits, she should not now be holding herself out as a patron of the restaurant in accepting the benefits. She\u2019s accepted benefits is what I\u2019m saying, Your Honor, specifically that is evidence that she is employee on a workers\u2019 comp., that\u2019s what I\u2019m holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">\u201cThe Court: Wouldn\u2019t you be positing that as an evidentiary matter rather than as a special defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\u201cMr. Pierce: Well, Your Honor, I think it goes to a specific instance as I stated earlier. I was contemplating the <em>Homey </em>decision at the time, although I disagree with opposing counsel\u2019s reading of that decision, and I was contemplating the fact having held one out by accepting benefits as an employee, that it would necessarily follow that if the injury for which the benefits are being offered is work related, that you should not now be asking for jurisdictional, or civil litigation. You\u2019ve already stated in fact this is a work related injury and that you were an employee, and arose out of the course of your employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"> Paragraph 9 of the third count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint reads as follows: \u201c9. Plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the proximate result of defendants\u2019 <em>wilful, intentional or reckless disregard for safety and health standards </em>and practices imposed on them by law and by common practice in the restaurant industry.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\"> Paragraph 10 of the third count of plaintiff\u2019s complaint reads as follows: \u201c10. By so willfully, wantonly, intentionally or recklessly violating such safety and health standards and practices, the defendants\u2019 conduct constituted an unfair or accepted act or practice in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), C.G.S. section 42-110a <em>et seq.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b780-10\">O\u2019Connell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtaG\">dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision for three reasons. First, in my opinion, the plaintiff was an employee within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; second, the decision misinterprets the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation remedy in Connecticut; and third, the decision applies incorrect rules of statutory construction. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the plaintiff is barred from bringing this tort action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s injury falls outside the scope of workers\u2019 compensation is unavailing in light <em>of McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979), a seminal case in this area. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>I focus on the <em>McNamara </em>requirement that the injury must occur when the employee is reasonably fulfilling the duties of the employment <em>or </em>doing something incidental to it. Id., 551. This requirement is phrased in the alternative. Therefore, the plaintiffs injury is compensable even if the jury finds that it did not occur while she was fulfilling the duties of her employment if the jury finds that the injury was incidental to her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Although I agree with the majority that this was a fact bound issue, it is my opinion that the jury found facts that brought the injury within the scope of <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra. Interrogatory five asked the jury \u201c[W]as the plaintiffs injury incidental to her employment?\u201d and the jury replied \u201cyes.\u201d The trial court, however, erroneously instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation special defense was conditioned on all five interrogatories being answered in the affirmative. In my opinion, the defendant sustained its burden of proof on the special defense despite a negative answer to either question three or question five. (See majority footnote 3, supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the tort rights of employees and the liability of employers. The majority appears to eliminate an employee\u2019s right to sue the employer only if the employee files a workers\u2019 compensation claim and the employer pays benefits. Although some jurisdictions provide the worker with such an election of remedies, Connecticut does not. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cOur Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>consistently held that where a worker\u2019s personal injury is covered by workers\u2019 compensation, statutory compensation is the sole remedy and recovery in common law tort against the employer is barred.\u201d <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Metals Selling Corporation, </em>3 Conn. App. 40, 45, 484 A.2d 478 (1984). Neither the employee nor the employer may, by their actions, place an injury within or outside the scope of workers\u2019 compensation law. Thus, the defendant\u2019s voluntary payment of benefits to the plaintiff is irrelevant. \u201cWe have consistently held that the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act operate as a total bar to actions brought by employees against their employers for job related injuries. . . . This bar operates whether or not the employee actually collects compensation . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Sgueglia </em>v. <em>Milne Construction Co., </em>212 Conn. 427, 433, 562 A.2d 505 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">I also disagree with the application of the general rule of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed. Workers\u2019 compensation statutes do not fall under this rule but rather are to be broadly and liberally interpreted so as to effectuate the remedial purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation laws. See <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The jury, through its interrogatories, found that the plaintiff as the defendant\u2019s employee, suffered injuries arising out of and in the course of her employment. Consequently, her sole remedy against the defendant was a claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">I would reverse the judgment and remand the case with instruction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) unequivocally states that \u201c[a]n employer <em>shall not be liable </em>to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained . . .
