The defendant was arrested on December 11, 1988, and charged with carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 and unlawful discharge of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-203. On September 11, 1989, the defendant entered a plea of guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine to the charge of carrying a pistol without a permit. The state entered a nolle to the other charge and, as a part of the plea agreement, there was to be a sentence recommendation of two years, execution suspended after one year, with the defendant retaining the right to argue for a lesser sentence than the mandatory one year sentence for a violation of \u00a7 29-35 provided by General Statutes \u00a7 29-37 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>When the defendant\u2019s plea was entered, the state\u2019s attorney explained the factual basis for the plea to the court as follows: The defendant and another man were in the bathroom at the Post Office Cafe in Bridgeport when a loud bang was heard from therein. The bartender entered the bathroom and found a slug in one of the walls. Descriptions of the two men were given to the police, and the defendant and his companion were apprehended at the Brass Guitar in Bridgeport. When he was approached by the police, the defendant stated, \u201cI have a gun.\u201d The police then patted him down and found a nine millimeter handgun containing seven bullets in a holster clipped to the defendant\u2019s waistband. The defendant was later discovered to possess neither a Bridgeport nor a state of Connecticut permit to carry a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">From these facts, the trial court found that an adequate factual basis existed for the plea. The court canvassed the defendant and found that he had entered his plea knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. The court then accepted the plea and continued the matter for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On December 14, 1989, the defendant appeared before the court for sentencing and, through counsel, argued that the mandatory one year sentence should not be imposed because certain mitigating factors were present. The trial court then indicated that it had found a problem with the case. After reviewing the information contained in the police report, the court vacated the defendant\u2019s plea and dismissed the charge \u201con the grounds that the arrest and the charge in this case came as a result of an illegal search and seizure in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America as well as the applicable section . . . of the Constitution of the State of Connecticut.\u201d The court based its conclusion on the fact that the police report indicated that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>after the disturbance at the Post Office Cafe, the defendant\u2019s companion stated that he was responsible for the gunshot, yet it was the defendant who was subsequently patted down at the Brass Guitar.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The state immediately excepted to the court\u2019s ruling and requested a continuance to show probable cause for the arrest. The court did not accept the state\u2019s argument that the court should not have based its ruling solely on the police information report and concluded that it needed no more information on probable cause because \u201c[m]y finding is based upon a lack of an adequate factual basis upon which to accept the plea of guilty and impose a sentence.\u201d The court also stated that there was no need for a probable cause hearing because a plea had already been entered. The court then granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>23 Conn. App. 559, 583 A.2d 139 (1990). Thereafter, in response to the state\u2019s motion for articulation, the court stated that its dismissal was based on the illegality of the defendant\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On appeal, the state argues that the trial court had no authority to enter a sua sponte dismissal of the information both without a hearing and after the defendant had waived his right not to be arrested without probable cause. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">A trial court can dismiss a prosecution on its own motion only under certain prescribed circumstances. \u201cIn the absence of statutory authority, the court has no power of its own motion to dismiss a criminal prosecution unless there is a fundamental legal defect in the information or indictment (such as want of jurisdiction or form of the information), or a constitutional defect such as denial of the right to a speedy trial <em>or illegal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>ity </em>of arrest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 608, 610-11, 376 A.2d 74 (1977). The trial court in the present case dismissed the prosecution on its finding that the police lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant and that the arrest was therefore illegal. We are not persuaded, however, that the trial court was empowered to act in that manner after the defendant had waived his rights under the state and federal constitutions not to be arrested without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, an <em>unconditional </em>plea of guilty or nolo contendere, intelligently and voluntarily made, operates as a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and bars the later assertion of constitutional challenges to pretrial proceedings. . . . Therefore, only those issues . . . which relate either to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court or to the voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea are ordinarily appealable after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 97-98, 503 A.2d 136 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Satti, </em>2 Conn. App. 219, 224, 477 A.2d 144 (1984). Such issues include the violation of the double jeopardy clause, the lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant is charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 98 n.6; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 374 n.4, 521 A.2d 547 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">An <em>Alford </em>plea operates as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a plea of nolo contendere. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). As such, <em>an Alford </em>plea has the same legal effect as a plea of guilty or nolo contendere on all further proceedings within the indictment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rish, </em>17 Conn. App. 447, 456, 553 A.2d 1145, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 802, 559 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 818, 110 S. Ct. 71, 107 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1989). Therefore, a defendant who has submitted an unconditional plea under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Alford </em>doctrine, like a defendant who has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere without condition, can challenge only the court\u2019s jurisdiction or the voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The defendant in the present case, by virtue of his unconditional plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of his arrest and subsequent search. \u201c[A]n illegal arrest imposes no jurisdictional barrier to a defendant\u2019s subsequent prosecution . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 262-63, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986). Nor does it impact upon the voluntary and intelligent nature of a defendant\u2019s plea. Thus, the trial court in the present case improperly raised an issue which the defendant himself had already waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Because we find that the defendant waived his right to contest his arrest and subsequent search, we need not reach the state\u2019s claim that it was entitled to an opportunity, as requested, to show probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the defendant\u2019s plea and to continue the matter for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> The court also held that its ruling did not encompass the unlawful discharge count which the state had nolled. That count is not a part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
