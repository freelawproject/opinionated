In this case, the trial court found that each of the parties should share equally in the payment of such fees. We can find no abuse of discretion in such a ruling. <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>11 Conn. App. 74, 77-78, 526 A.2d 4 (1987). The record, however, contains no evidence that any bills for such services were ever submitted or reviewed by the court to determine the reasonableness of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The judgment is affirmed as to the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties share equally in the payment of fees and the case is remanded for a hearing to determine the amount of such fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
