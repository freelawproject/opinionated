This it cannot do. See, e.g., <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>IAFF, Local 760, AFL-CIO, CLC, </em>24 Conn. App. 254, 258, 587 A.2d 435 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case remanded with direction to render judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
