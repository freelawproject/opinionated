The same issue has been presented by both plaintiffs and their appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner found that the defendant\u2019s absence control policy made no distinction between absences caused by work related injuries or illnesses and those absences that were not work related. The commissioner further found that the defendant\u2019s absence control policy was neutrally applied to any of the defendant\u2019s approximately 500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>employees who were absent from work for more than one year. Finally, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proving that they had been discharged because of discrimination or any retaliatory motive. The commissioner concluded that the sole reason for the plaintiffs\u2019 discharge was their absence from employment for more than twelve months in contravention of the defendant\u2019s absence control policy. Therefore, the commissioner held that their claims under General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a must fail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner has the power and the duty to determine the facts, and we will not review facts reasonably found by the commissioner. The commissioner\u2019s conclusions that are drawn from those facts must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 448, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989); <em>Aurora </em>v. <em>Miami Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>6 Conn. App. 45, 47, 502 A.2d 952 (1986). On the basis of the plaintiff Lee\u2019s stipulated facts, the commissioner\u2019s findings, and the record before us, we conclude that there is no basis to disturb the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs were discharged solely by the neutral application of the defendant\u2019s absence control policy. The plaintiffs do not contest this fact but argue that the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>is discriminatory per se when applied to workers\u2019 compensation claimants in contravention of General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (a). We disagree and affirm the commissioner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee <em>because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised his rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs assert that they were discharged by the defendant while \u201cexercising] the rights afforded to [them] pursuant to the provisions of this [workers\u2019 compensation] chapter,\u201d contrary to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (a). The plaintiffs argue that workers\u2019 compensation claimants may not be discharged if they are absent for a period longer than that allowed by their employer\u2019s absence control policy because (1) the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should be construed to provide such protection, (2) General Statutes \u00a7 31-313 provides an alternative time period for an absent workers\u2019 compensation claimant, conceivably longer than the defendant\u2019s twelve month absence control policy, and (3) the public policy underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act disfavors the discharge of claimants who are absent while recovering from work related injuries. All of these arguments are built on the premise that the employer\u2019s discharge need not be for an improper motive. The plaintiffs assert that an employer could discharge a workers\u2019 compensation claimant for a proper motive, such as a neutrally applied absence control policy, and still violate General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a was designed to protect plaintiffs who file for workers\u2019 compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and \u201cis in essence a statutorily created tort deriv[ed] from the action for wrongful discharge set forth in <em>Sheets </em>[v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 427 A.2d 385 (1980)].\u201d <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 52, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990); cf. <em>Baldracchi </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division, </em>814 F.2d 102, 103 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1054, 108 S. Ct. 2819, 100 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1988). In order to establish a prima facie case under General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a, the plaintiffs bear the initial burden of demonstrating discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 53. The plaintiffs must present some evidence from which a trier of fact could infer that the employer discharged or discriminated against the employees because they had exercised their rights under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Id., 53-54. Without some proof of an improper motive, the plaintiffs\u2019 case must fail. See id. Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a supports a cause of action absent some evidence of the defendant\u2019s improper motive is without legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a, like its counterpart in other workers\u2019 compensation schemes, does not require an employer to retain an employee unable to perform his or her work simply because that inability resulted from a work related injury or illness. See, e.g., <em>Hines </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>736 F. Sup. 675, 678 (D.S.C. 1990); <em>Fergerstrom </em>v. <em>Datapoint Corporation, </em>680 F. Sup. 1456 (D. Hawaii 1988); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Electrical System Division of Bristol Corporation, </em>557 N.E.2d 711 (Ind. App. 1990); <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Val Agri, Inc., </em>13 Kan. App. 2d 149, 766 P.2d 819 (1988); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>St. Louis County, </em>575 S.W.2d 813 (Mo. App. 1978); <em>Galante </em>v. <em>Sandoz, Inc., </em>192 N.J. Super. 403, 410, 470 A.2d 45 (1983), aff\u2019d, 196 N.J. Super. 568, 483 A.2d 829 (1984); <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>New York State Developmental Center, </em>63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>N.Y.2d 128, 470 N.E.2d 820 (1984). Businesses would suffer significant losses if they were prevented from filling employment vacancies after the lapse of a reasonable period of time. See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>New York State Developmental Center, </em>supra, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The great majority of jurisdictions have recognized, either by statute or judicial decision, the tort of retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. See annot., 32 A.L.R. 4th 1221. New courts, however, have expanded the definition of discriminatory discharge to include a discharge occasioned by the neutral application of an absence control policy to an employee who was injured and collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See <em>Galante </em>v. <em>Sandoz, Inc., </em>supra; see, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Electrical System Division of Bristol Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Val Agri, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Cactus Drilling Corporation, </em>419 Mich. 356, 353 N.W.2d 469 (1984); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Richmond Special Road District, </em>649 S.W.2d 252 (Mo. App. 1983); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>St. Louis County, </em>supra; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>New York State Developmental Center, </em>supra; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hospital, Inc., </em>759 S.W.2d 925, 928 (Tenn. App. 1988); but <em>see Lindsay </em>v. <em>Great Northern Paper Co., </em>532 A.2d 151 (Me. 1987) (the Maine Supreme Court is the only court to have held that a neutrally applied absence control policy may be found to discriminate against a plaintiff discharged due to employment absences caused by work related injuries); but cf. <em>Judson Steel Corporation </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, </em>22 Cal. 3d 658, 586 P.2d 564, 150 Cal. Rptr. 250 (1978). The employer\u2019s termination of a plaintiff\u2019s seniority rights in <em>Judson Steel </em>was within the scope of discrimination prohibited by California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, similar to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a. The court cautioned, however, that its \u201cholding in no way mandates that an employer retain all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>employees who sustain injuries on the job.\u201d <em>Judson Steel Corporation </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, </em>supra, 667; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Columbus Development Center, </em>47 Ohio App. 3d 100, 547 N.E.2d 417 (1989) (a workers\u2019 compensation claimant discharged because she failed to file a request for leave from her employer was a pretext for a retaliatory discharge for filing her claim); see generally annot., 32 A.L.R.4th 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that General Statutes \u00a7 31-313<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides an alternative time period for an absent workers\u2019 compensation claimant that may be of longer duration than an employer\u2019s twelve month absence control policy is unavailing. General Statutes \u00a7 31-313 does limit an employer\u2019s discretion to terminate the employment of a workers\u2019 compensation claimant. This statute imposes a limited duty on the employer to provide <em>suitable </em>work for an injured employee <em>if it is available.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If suitable work is not available or the employee is unable to work due to infirmity, there is no hindrance to an employer, apart from what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ever contract of employment or company policy exists, to discharge a workers\u2019 compensation claimant because of the neutral operation of an absence control policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In order to meet the initial burden of proof in a claim arising under General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a, the plaintiffs would have had to present some evidence of the defendant\u2019s discriminatory intent. Because the plaintiffs were discharged solely as a result of the neutral application of the defendant\u2019s reasonable absence control policy, we agree with the commissioner that there was not any contravention of General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The order of the commissioner dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\"> The defendant\u2019s absence control policy in effect since October 1,1983, in relevant part states: \u201cThe length of the medical leave of absence may not exceed one year from the date of commencement of absence due to illness. . . . When an employee is absent due to illness, that employee\u2019s job will be held open for (12) twelve months. After (12) twelve months that employee\u2019s job will be posted for bidding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) No employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> The commissioner\u2019s memorandum of decision and order were issued prior to the release of <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) provides two alternative procedures an employee may utilize to bring a complaint of wrongful dischage or discrimination. The employee may either bring an action in the Superior Court or file a complaint with the workers\u2019 compensation commission with the right to a direct appeal to this court. The plaintiffs both chose the second option and their appeals are before this court directly from the commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-313 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) (1) Where an employee has suffered a compensable injury which disables him from performing his customary or most recent work, his employer at the time of such injury shall transfer him to full-time work <em>suitable to his physical condition where such work is available, </em>during the time that the employee is subjected to medical treatment or rehabilitation or both and until such treatment is discontinued on the advice of the physician conducting the same or of the therapist in charge of the rehabilitation program or until the employee has reached the maximum level of rehabilitation for such worker in the judgment of the commissioner under all of the circumstances, whichever period is the longest. (2) The commissioner shall conduct a hearing upon the request of an employee who claims his employer has not transferred him to such available suitable work. Whenever the commissioner finds that the employee is so disabled, and that the employer has failed to transfer the employee to such available suitable work, he shall order the employer to transfer the employee to such work.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> The commissioner here found that the defendant did not have light duty work, even though it was provided for the plaintiff Chiaia for a brief time until he reinjured himself and was unable to continue working. The plaintiff Lee was not able to resume any work when discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
