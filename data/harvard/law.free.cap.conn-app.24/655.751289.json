This case causes us to reexamine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>yet again, General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175c (now \u00a7 38a-336), the uninsured motorist coverage statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The facts are undisputed. On December 3,1987, the plaintiff in the first action, Staci Forsberg, was involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision between her car and one driven by Karen Timko. Timko was intoxicated and her negligence was the sole cause of the accident. The plaintiff recovered $25,000 from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy issued by Nationwide Insurance Company (Nationwide). At the time of the accident, the plaintiff had a policy with New Hampshire Insurance Company (New Hampshire). That policy had an uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage limit of $20,000. As a member of her mother\u2019s household, the plaintiff was also covered by her parent\u2019s policy with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), which provided for uninsured-underinsured motorist limits of $300,000. All three policies provided for arbitration of disputes in connection with uninsured-under insured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Arbitration commenced on March 17, 1989. As a result, the arbitrator awarded the plaintiff a net recovery of $295,000 to be paid pro rata by both New Hampshire and State Farm. After apportioning a prorated credit to each company for the $25,000 paid to the plaintiff by Nationwide, the arbitrator found that the plaintiff was entitled to a recovery of $18,437.50 from New Hampshire and $276,562.50 from State Farm. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved to confirm the award, and New Hampshire moved to vacate the award. State Farm was allowed to intervene in the second action. On June 22, 1990, the trial court vacated the award against New Hampshire. The plaintiff brought this appeal from the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that her vehicle was an \u201cunder-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>insured motor vehicle\u201d under \u00a7 38-175c (b) (2). She argues that the court\u2019s finding was incorrect because (1) the term \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d as defined in \u00a7 38-175c (b) (2) applies only to vehicles that are causally connected to a claimed loss, and (2) the court failed to apply relevant Connecticut law regarding interpolicy \u201cstacking\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in determining the amount of underinsurance coverage available to the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Section \u00a7 38-175c (b) (2) defines an underinsured motor vehicle as \u201ca motor vehicle with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of liability under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy against which claim is made under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Implicit in this definition and throughout \u00a7 38-175c \u201cis the commonsensical requirement that the underinsured vehicle be <em>causally connected </em>to the loss for which the claimant seeks compensation. \u2018The purpose of underinsured coverage is to protect the named insured and other additional insureds from suffering an inadequately compensated injury <em>caused by an accident with an inadequately insured </em>automobile.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulla, </em>216 Conn. 390, 398, 579 A.2d 525 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Applying this principle to the facts of this case, we conclude that the plaintiffs vehicle was not an underinsured motor vehicle because it was not causally connected to the accident in question. Thus, the trial court improperly found that the plaintiff was barred from recovery under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) (B)(now \u00a7 38a-336 [a] [B]), under which an insurer is not required to provide coverage \u201cto any insured occupying an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or motorcycle that is owned by such insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">This does not, however, end our inquiry. The trial court also refused to allow the plaintiff to stack her underinsurance coverage under the New Hampshire and State Farm policies. Although the court did so in the context of improperly determining that the plaintiffs vehicle was underinsured, the issue of stacking is relevant to the question that the court should have examined\u2014whether the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Our Supreme Court recently explained the process for determining whether a motor vehicle is underinsured. \u201c \u2018[T]he aggregate of the limits of all such bonds and policies <em>on the tortfeasor\u2019s motor vehicle </em>is compared against the amount of uninsured motorist coverage of the insured.\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 194, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). \u2018If the aggregate is less than the limits of liability in the uninsured motorist portion of the insured\u2019s policy, then the underinsurance coverage is activated.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>213 Conn. 625, 630, 569 A.2d 1105 (1990). This mechanism allows the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy or policies to be exhausted before a claimant asserts a claim against his or her own policy or policies for underinsured motorist coverage. When we apply this analysis to the present case, the question of whether the limit of liability under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy ($25,000) is less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>than the amount of underinsured motorist coverage available to the plaintiff hinges on whether the plaintiff is allowed to stack the New Hampshire ($20,000) and State Farm ($300,000) policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Interpolicy stacking for situations involving underinsured motor vehicle claims is clearly sanctioned by the courts of Connecticut. \u201c[Our Supreme Court] has, on a number of occasions, considered the \u2018stacking\u2019 of uninsured and underinsured automobile insurance coverage for two passenger cars . . . [and has] noted that the issue of aggregation of coverage for multiple vehicles can arise with regard either to \u2018interpolicy stacking\u2019 under separate and distinct insurance policies, or to single policy, \u2018intra-policy stacking.\u2019 Regardless of this difference in form, we have repeatedly held that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c permits an injured claimant to \u2018stack\u2019 coverages.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>201 Conn. 478, 481-82, 518 A.2d 373 (1986). Such stacking is allowed because \u201c \u2018[w]here two premiums are paid for two vehicles, whether in one policy or two, total coverage for the named insured is doubled since a person can reasonably expect double coverage when he pays double premiums.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 396, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982); see also <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 630, 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 38-175c also supports stacking. In subsection (a) (1), that statute enunciates its purpose as \u201cfor the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of . . . underinsured motor vehicles . . . .\u201d Accordingly, our Supreme Court has recognized that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c is person rather than vehicle oriented; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulla, </em>supra, 399; and is to be construed \u201c \u2018to permit the injured party to recover the amount he would have received had the tortfeasor been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>insured to the same extent as the injured party.\u2019 <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>455 A.2d 932 (Me. 1983).\u201d <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">To accept the trial court\u2019s decision here, thus disallowing the stacking of the policies under which the plaintiff is entitled to underinsured motorist coverage, would be contrary to this legislative intent. General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c \u201c \u2018could not have been intended to place the insured who is injured by an underinsured motorist in a better position than one who is harmed by a motorist having the same insurance as the insured.\u2019 <em>Dewberry </em>v. <em>Auto-Owner Ins. Co., </em>363 So. 2d 1077, 1081 (Fla. 1978).\u201d <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra. Similarly, it could not have been the legislative intent to place the insured who is injured by an underinsured motorist in a worse position than one who is harmed by a motorist having no insurance whatsoever. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>supra, 396-97. Had the plaintiff been struck by an uninsured motorist, she clearly would have been allowed to recover from both the New Hampshire and State Farm policies. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vetre, </em>174 Conn. 329, 335, 387 A.2d 539 (1978). Therefore, to avoid an \u201canomalous\u201d situation, \u201c\u00a7 38-175c must be interpreted to allow the [plaintiff] to stack the uninsured motorist coverages when determining [her] underinsured motorist benefits.\u201d <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>supra, 397. Because the plaintiff can stack her coverage under the New Hampshire and State Farm policies, the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d under \u00a7 38-175c (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> \u201cStacking\u201d is the ability of the insured \u201cwhen covered by more than one insurance policy, to obtain benefits from a second policy on the same claim when recovery from the first policy above would be inadequate.\u201d <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 388-89 n.2, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1) (now \u00a7 38a-336 [b]) provides: \u201cAn insurance company shall be obligated to make payment to its insured up to the limits of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage after the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements, but in no event shall the total amount of recovery from all policies, including any amount recovered under the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, exceed the limits of the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
