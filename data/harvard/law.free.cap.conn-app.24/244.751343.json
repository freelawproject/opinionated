Under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127, the validity of a transfer order depends on a court\u2019s making \u201cwritten findings, after a hearing, that there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the act for which he is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The proceedings in this case arose out of the involvement of the respondent in the death of Edwin Perez in Bridgeport as a result of fatal gunshot wounds. After conducting a hearing, the trial court found that the respondent was fourteen years old at the time that the alleged murder occurred and that he intentionally caused the death of Perez by shooting him several times with a handgun after first firing a warning shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The respondent raises two issues in his challenge to the validity of the transfer order. First, he argues that the trial court\u2019s written findings were legally insufficient because there was no express finding regarding probable cause to believe that the respondent committed the crime of murder without a finding of specific intent to commit murder, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. Second, the respondent asserts there was an insufficient evidentiary basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed. We disagree and uphold the validity of the transfer order.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>We note at the outset that the rationale and conclusions in the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision, <em>In re Edwin N., </em>215 Conn. 277, 575 A.2d 1016 (1990), are controlling in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>In re Edwin N., </em>supra, the respondent challenged the validity of the trial court\u2019s transfer of a juvenile murder case to the adult criminal docket. As in the present case, the juvenile in <em>Edwin </em>argued that the trial court\u2019s findings were legally insufficient because there was no express finding as to his intent to commit murder, and challenged the evidentiary basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding his specific intent to kill the victim. The trial court\u2019s written findings were found deficient because they failed to make a finding concerning the juvenile\u2019s intent. The Supreme Court found, however, that the trial court\u2019s findings, \u201cthough undesirably sparse, [were] nonetheless . . . sufficient to warrant an inference about the factual underpinnings of the court\u2019s transfer order.\u201d Id., 283. These factual underpinnings supplied the circumstantial evidence capable of supporting a legal inference of intent to kill. Id., 284, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As in <em>Edwin, </em>the trial court in this case made sufficient, though sparse, findings of fact and law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tinction to <em>Edwin, </em>the trial court here did make an explicit finding that the respondent did intentionally kill the victim. Although the trial court\u2019s findings were conclusory in nature, on the basis of its factual findings and legal conclusions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court shall transfer to the regular criminal docket of the superior court from the docket for juvenile matters: (1) Any child referred for the commission of a murder under sections 53a-54a to 53a-54d, inclusive, provided any such murder was committed after such child attained the age of fourteen years .... No such transfer shall be valid unless, prior thereto, the court has made written findings, after a hearing, that there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the act for which he is charged. An order by the court under this section transferring a child from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the superior court shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\"> The trial court issued its findings and order on May 4, 1990, several weeks before <em>In re Edwin N., </em>215 Conn. 277, 575 A.2d 1016 (1990), was released.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> After a hearing on the Court Advocate\u2019s Motion for Transfer the trial court made the following findings and order in compliance with \u00a7 46b-127 of the Connecticut General Statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u201c(1) Edwin Perez died in Bridgeport on March 15,1990 as the result of gunshot wounds of the head and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u201c(2) A petition for delinquency charging Jullion C. with Murder in violation of Connecticut General Statutes, Section 53a-54a was served on the respondent and referred to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u201c(3) Jullion C., the respondent, was bom on January 10, 1976.
