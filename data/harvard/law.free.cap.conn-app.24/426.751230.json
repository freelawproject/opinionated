On July 1, 1983, the plaintiffs marriage to the defendant Anthony Busa, Jr., was dissolved. At that time, custody of the couple\u2019s two minor children was awarded to the plaintiff. On August 24,1984, and January 22,1985, the plaintiff, who wanted to attend college in Boston, Massachusetts, entered into a written agreement with her ex-husband\u2019s parents, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>defendants Anthony Busa, Sr., and Beverly Busa. The agreement gave them temporary custody of the children until the plaintiff moved the court for their return. The grandparents also agreed to surrender custody of the children if and when the plaintiff made such a motion. On February 25,1985, the court, <em>McKeever, J., </em>modified its custody order to reflect the terms of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The plaintiff, now remarried and living in South Carolina, moved for the return of the children to her custody on January 11,1989. In her motion, the plaintiff claimed that she had completed her education and was now able to care for her children. The defendant Anthony Busa, Jr., filed an objection to the plaintiffs motion and his parents subsequently entered the case as defendants. After a hearing, the court, <em>O\u2019Sul</em>livan, <em>J., </em>denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion in a memorandum of decision dated January 3, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe test of the best interests of the children requires that the children continue to live with the defendant\u2019s parents.\u201d The plaintiff now claims that this statement clearly shows that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard because it failed specifically to consider and either to accept or reject the presumption created by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (b) provides that \u201c[i]n making or modifying any order with respect to custody or visitation, the court shall be guided by the best interests of the child . . . .\u201d In 1985, the legislature enacted what is now General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b, which creates a presumption, in custody disputes between a parent and a nonparent, that it is in the best interest of the child to be in the custody of the parent. This presumption can be rebutted only by a showing that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>would be detrimental to the child to permit the parent to have custody. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Although \u00a7 46b-56b does not expressly require the trial court to make a specific finding either accepting or rejecting the presumption, Practice Book \u00a7 4059 mandates that the court include in its decision its conclusion as to each claim of law raised by the parties. The rebuttal of the statutory presumption is clearly an issue in this case, and the trial court\u2019s failure to address the presumption in its memorandum of decision constitutes noncompliance with this Practice Book section. When read with Practice Book \u00a7 4059, therefore, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b implicitly requires the trial court to articulate whether the presumption was properly rebutted before awarding custody to a nonparent. That statute was designed to protect both parents and children, yet it accomplishes nothing if it is construed to require only a mental exercise by the court with no obligation to disclose a factual basis for giving a non-parent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In addition, the trial court\u2019s refusal to articulate its ruling does not advance the children\u2019s best interests in this case. The \u201cbest interests\u201d standard remains the ultimate basis of a court\u2019s custody decision. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>212 Conn. 63, 561 A.2d 907 (1989). Despite this, the trial court effectively limited appellate review of its decision by refusing to accept or reject the statutory presumption and to state its reasons therefor in its memorandum of decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was clearly not in the best interests of the children. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision was clearly lacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in that it failed to state whether the presumption was properly rebutted before awarding custody to the paternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The case is remanded to the trial court with direction to articulate its ruling in accordance with this opinion. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-11\"> On appeal counsel for the children joined counsel for the plaintiff in challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> Any confusion as to the standard of law applied by the trial court could have been alleviated through the granting of a motion for articulation. Practice Book \u00a7 4051. In fact, such a motion was made by counsel for the minor children but was denied by the trial court, which refused to articulate its ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4061 empowers this court, when it \u201cdeems necessary to the proper disposition of the cause . . . [to] remand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s factual findings or decision.\u201d See also <em>Bird Electron Beam Corporation </em>v. <em>Gamage, </em>11 Conn.
