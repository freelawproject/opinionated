Defendant contended in the trial court and here contends that he was the innocent victim , of a dirty government plot to get him to sell marijuana. He asserts entrapment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">We affirm the judgment of conviction in this judge-tried case in which a jury was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">We do not find Quevedo the innocent victim of the government agent and informers that he would have one believe. Maybe Quevedo was not a wholesaler, but he had the \u201cdisposition to commit\u201d of a retailer. Testifying in his own behalf at the trial, he recalled one sale to a non-agent. There was testimony of others as to a number of prior sales to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">The imposition on Quevedo of the government agent and the informers was that they pretended to be his friends. This may not be a nice thing to do when one wants only to get another in jail. But it falls short of entrapment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">It might also be pointed out that the trial court may have come to some affirmative conclusions about \u201cpredisposition to commit\u201d from Quevedo\u2019s demean- or on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">We decline to hold that a false pretense of fine friendship as a matter of law is entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">This case does not even approach the facts of Sherman v. United States, 365 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848. Notaro v. United States, 363 F.2d 169, 9 Cir., and Hill v. United States, 261 F.2d 483, 9 Cir., are adequate authority for an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">Unless it be the law that a feigning of friendship amounts to entrapment, there is no basis for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-20\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
