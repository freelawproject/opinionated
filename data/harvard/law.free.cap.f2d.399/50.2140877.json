Stewart, and co-executrixes of his estate, appeal from a summary judgment in favor of defendant, the District Director of Internal Revenue Service, New Orleans District, sustaining the disallowance of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for refund of estate taxes paid, and denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-22\">Decedent was a Louisiana citizen and his estate consisted of both separate and community property as it is known in the Civil Law of Louisiana. By testamentary disposition, decedent bequeathed all property of which he died possessed to his four children in naked ownership,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> subject to a lifetime usufruct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in favor of his wife.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-23\">Plaintiffs filed a federal estate tax return which included in the computation of the gross estate decedent\u2019s separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>property and one half of his community property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In arriving at the taxable estate reported, taxpayers claimed a \u201cmarital deduction\u201d under Section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056, of the maximum amount allowable under the federal tax statute, which is fifty per cent of the adjusted gross estate. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(c) et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Taxpayers\u2019 reason for claiming the marital deduction is shown in the tax return to be, \u201cSurviving Spouse has the IMPERFECT USUFRUCT of said property which is, under the Law of Louisiana, the same as full ownership since she may sell, alienate and/or dispose of same.\u201d The Commissioner rejected the computation of the marital deduction, and determined that the estate was entitled to such a deduction for the value of the following items only: United States Savings Bonds paid for with community assets and one half of the face amount of an insurance policy of which the usufructuary is the beneficiary. The disallowance by the Commissioner was based on his determination that all property, except the savings bonds and life insurance, was subject to the terminable interest limitations of Section 2056(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Accordingly, the Commissioner assessed a deficiency against the estate, which taxpayers have paid. Subsequently, taxpayers filed a claim for refund with the District Director, and upon disallowance thereof, taxpayers filed the instant suit to recover the sum of $7,293.72. The District Court granted the motion of the Government for summary judgment and denied that of taxpayers. In a well-reasoned opinion, the District Court concluded that the property rights which the surviving spouse received with respect to property subject to an imperfect usu-fruct constitute a terminable interest within the meaning of Section 2056(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and that such property rights did not qualify for the exception under Section 2056(b) (5) to the terminable interest rule. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">This appeal involves the novel question of whether the interest of the surviving spouse in and to the movable property bequeathed by decedent to his children in naked ownership, subject to an imperfect lifetime usufruct in favor of the surviving spouse, qualifies for the marital deduction allowed in computing a federal estate tax return under Section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The marital deduction permitted is contained in Section 2056, subsection (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Subsection (b) (1) is an exception to subsection (a) and disallows the deduction where the interest passing to the surviving spouse is terminable. Subpara-graph (5) of said subsection (b) in turn provides an exception to the \u201cterminable interest\u201d rule of subsection (b) (1) under certain circumstances and permits the marital deduction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Taxpayers contend that the property rights in question qualify for the marital deduction because they are not subject to the teminable interest limitations contained in subsection (b) (1) of the statute; and further, that if such rights are considered to constitute a terminable interest, they nevertheless come within the exception provided in subsection (b) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Louisiana law is controlling in regard to the nature and extent of the property interests bequeathed to the usufructuary. Federal law, however, dictates whether such property interests qualify as a marital deduction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>The terminable interest rule:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In order to exclude from the marital deduction a property interest which would otherwise qualify, it is necessary under subsection (b) (1) of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056 that the property interest meet the requirements set out in that subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-17\">1. It must be an interest which will terminate or fail upon the lapse of time or some other contingency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-18\">2. An interest, other than the interest passing to the surviving spouse, must also pass from decedent to \u25a0some other person or persons. Such other person or persons or their heirs may, by reason of the passing of the interest, enjoy or possess any part of the property following the termination of the spouse\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-19\">The word \u201cusufruct\u201d is defined by the Louisiana Civil Code as \u201cthe right of enjoying a thing, the property of which is vested in another, and to draw from the same all the profit, utility and advantages which it may produce provided it be without altering the substance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>thing.\u201d LSA-C.C. art. 533.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Usufruct is of two kinds: Perfect, \u201cwhich is of things which the usufructuary can enjoy without changing their substance,\u201d and Imperfect, \u201cwhich is of things which would be useless to the uufructuary, if he did not consume or expend them.\u201d LSA-C.C. art. 534. Taxpayers have claimed the marital deduction only on property interests subject to an imperfect, or quasi, usufruct, as they agree that the usufructuary\u2019s interests in the immovable property are terminable and entitle her only to use and enjoyment of such property as that property at her death will revert to the naked owners, the children of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The first two requirements under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b) (1) \u2014 that the interest to the property (subject to the imperfect usufruct) will terminate and that an interest in the same property will pass to one other than the surviving spouse\u2014 are obviously met by the last will of decedent which provides that the usufruct will cease upon the death of the usufructuary and which bequeaths the naked ownership of the property to the children of decedent. The third requirement\u2014 enjoyment or possession of the property subject to the usufruct by persons other than the usufructuary (the children in this instance) at the termination of the usufruct \u2014 according to taxpayers\u2019 contentions, is not satisfied. The contention of taxpayers is that inasmuch as the surviving spouse has unrestricted power over the property subject to the imperfect usufruct and that such property may, under Louisiana law, be completely consumed by the beneficiary, it is possible that nothing may remain at the termination of the usufruct to be possessed or enjoyed by anyone. Taxpayers rely on various Louisiana cases <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which ascribe the quality of ownership to such \u201cimperfects\u201d and the distinction made in the Louisiana Civil Code between a perfect and an imperfect usufruct as contained in LSA-C.C. art. 534, supra, and as further provided in LSA-C.C. arts. 535 and 536:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">Art. 535. \u201cPerfect usufruct does not transfer to the usufructuary the ownership of the things subject to the usufruct; the usufructuary is bound to use them as a prudent administrator would do, to preserve them as much as possible, in order to restore them to the owner as soon as the usufruct terminates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">Art. 536. \u201cImperfect usufruct, on the contrary, transfers to the usufruct-uary the ownership of the things subject to the usufruct, so that he may consume, sell or dispose of them, as he thinks proper, subject to certain charges hereinafter prescribed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The use of the term \u201cownership\u201d along with the powers of the usufructuary delineated in article 536 indicates a type of ownership which is by the article itself subject to certain charges. These charges are contained principally in LSA-C.C. art. 549 which imposes upon the usufructuary certain obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">Art. 549: \u201cIf the usufruct includes things, which cannot be used without being expended or consumed, or without their substance being changed, the usufructuary has a right to dispose of them at his pleasure, <em>but under the obligation of returning the same quantity, quality and value to the owner, or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>their estimated price, </em>at the expiration of the usufruct.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The Louisiana courts have interpreted this article as requiring the usufructuary, despite her temporary role as \u201cowner,\u201d to account to the naked owners for the equivalent of the property subject to the usufruct or its estimated price at the termination of the usufruct. A quasi debtor-creditor relationship is thereby established between the usufructuary and the naked owners, In Succession of Dielmann, 119 La. 101, 117 (1907), 43 So. 972, 977, the Louisiana Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201cShe [the imperfect usufructuary] had the right to use those funds subject to the obligation of returning an equal amount later to the husband\u2019s heir. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-15\"> In Burdin v. Burdin, 171 La. 7, 18 (1930), 129 So. 651, 654, the Louisiana Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-17\">\u201cthe usufruct so held by the defendant of the money and other movable effects was an imperfect or quasi usu-fruct, carrying with it the ownership and the right to dispose of the same, subject to an accounting at the expiration of the usufruct. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfZ\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZe\">\u201cThe usufruct of the community property held by the defendant terminated on July 18, 1911, the date of his second marriage; and from that date defendant became a debtor of his children for the money and movable effects theretofore held by him as usufructuary.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">Thus the \u201cownership\u201d referred to in LSA-C.C. art. 536 is not in the nature of an unqualified ownership<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>would exclude the rights which other persons may possess or enjoy on the termination of the usufruct. Although, as a practical matter, a surviving spouse may completely deplete, by use, disposition, or otherwise, the property which she is allowed to use and enjoy, the reverse inference is true also \u2014 she may not so deplete the property. All that is necessary to meet the third requirement under the \u201cterminable interest\u201d rule of the federal tax statute is that other persons <em>\u201cmay </em>possess or enjoy any part of such property.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b) (1) (B). That the heirs, upon the termination of the usufruct, may eventually enjoy the property in question is clearly contemplated by decedent\u2019s bequest of the naked ownership to them and by the mandatory provisions of the Louisiana Civil Code and the case law requiring an accounting and restitution to the naked owners by the usufructuary. Consequently, all of the criteria of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b) (1) for determining a property interest to be terminable have been met, and unless these property interests can qualify as an exception to the terminable interest rule, they may not be included in the marital deduction claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\n<em>Exception to the terminable interest rule:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In order for an interest passing to the surviving spouse to qualify as an exception under Section 2056(b) (5) of the Internal Revenue Code, it is mandatory that certain requirements be met. One of these requirements is that the surviving spouse have the power to appoint the entire interest which she received from the decedent to herself or another.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This power of appointment is further explained in Section 20.2056(b)-5(g) (2), (3), (4) of the Treasury Regulations on Estate Tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">\u201c(2) The power of the surviving spouse must be a power to appoint the entire interest * * * as unqualified owner * * * or to appoint the entire interest * * * as a part of her estate * * * that is, in effect, to dispose of it to whomsoever she pleases * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">\u201c(3) A power is not considered to be a power exercisable by a surviving spouse alone and in all events * * * if the exercise of the power in the surviving spouse to appoint the entire interest * * * to herself or to her estate requires the joinder or consent of any other person. The power is not \u2018exercisable in all events\u2019, if it can be terminated during the life of the surviving spouse by any event other than her complete exercise or release of it. * * * Likewise, if there are any restrictions, either by the terms of the instrument or under applicable local law, on the exercise of a power to consume property * * * for the ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>efit of the spouse, the power is not exercisable in all events. * * * In order for the power of invasion to be exercisable in all events, the surviving spouse must have the unrestricted power exercisable at any time during her life to use all or any part of the property subject to the power, and to dispose of it in any manner, including the power to dispose of it by gift (whether or not she has power to dispose of it by will).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201c(4) The power in the surviving spouse is exercisable in all events only if it exists immediately following the decedent\u2019s death. For example, if the power given to the surviving spouse is exercisable during life, but' cannot be effectively exercised before distribution of the assets by the executor, the power is not exercisable in all events.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"> An interpretation of these limitations on the power of appointment supports the conclusion reached by the District Court \u2014 that the exception was designed to relate to those situations where the life tenant has the equivalent of absolute ownership.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The power given by the Louisiana Civil Code to the usufructuary to use and dispose of the property subject to the imperfect usu-fruct is not a power to appoint the property to herself or another to the exclusion of the naked owners. The naked ownership of the property passed to the children at the moment of their father\u2019s death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consequently, they inherit his interest in the property directly from him, not from their mother. It is obvious that she could in no way divest them of their inheritance, and as we have already noted, even if she were to consume or dispose of the entire interest, her estate at the time of her death would be required to account to the children as naked owners because of the debtor-creditor relationship. Taxpayers\u2019 contention that a deceased cannot account, and therefore there is no charge upon the property in usufruct, is without merit, inasmuch as her estate will be accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">The effect of Louisiana law which permits a bequest of a usufruct to a surviving spouse and naked ownership to heirs of the same property is to create dual but separate interests in the property<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 usufruct and naked ownership \u2014 which taken together comprise all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the attributes of ownership, but this ownership does not, by virtue of the interests passing from the decedent to the surviving spouse, vest in the spouse. To the contrary, the children at their mother\u2019s death will be vested with complete ownership of the property which they have inherited by their father\u2019s will. The \u201cownership\u201d of the surviving spouse is obviously inferior to that of the children. This concept is completely in accord with the Louisiana doctrine of forced heirship in favor of the children.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> No such protective device is afforded the surviving spouse, for the apparent- reason that Louisiana, being a community property state, provides for other advantages for the survivor. Automatically, at the death of one spouse in community the marital partner is endowed with full ownership of one half of the community theretofore existing between the spouses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Art\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>i\u00a1C !\u00a1! ^</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Turning now to the federal ta* law, we look to the reason behind the marital deduction provision. The District Court very ably summarized the congressional intention as an \u201cattempt to promote equality of estate tax treatment between married residents of community and non-community property states\u201d [citing S.Rep.No.1013, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 38 (1948-1 Cum.Bull. 285, 305); H.Rep.No.1274, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 27 (1948-1 Cum.Bull. 241, 261)].</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In United States v. Stapf, 375 U.S. 118, 128, 84 S.Ct. 248, 255, 11 L.Ed.2d 195 (1963), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cOur conclusion concerning the con-gressionally intended result under \u00a7 812(e) (1) [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954] accords with the general purpose of Congress in creating the marital deduction. The 1948 tax amendments were intended to equalize the effect of the estate taxes in community property and common-law jurisdictions. Under a- community property system, * * * the spouse receives outright ownership of one-half of the community property and only the other one-half is included in the decedent\u2019s estate. To equalize the incidence of progressively scaled estate taxes and to adhere to the patterns of state law, the marital deduction permits a deceased spouse, subject to certain requirements, to transfer free of taxes one-half of the non-community property to the surviving spouse. Although applicable to separately held property in a community property state, the primary thrust of this is to extend to taxpayers in common-law States the advantages of \u2018estate splitting\u2019 otherwise available only in community property States. The purpose, however, is only to permit a married couple\u2019s property to be taxed in two stages and not to allow a tax-exempt transfer of wealth into succeeding generations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\"><em>Thus the marital deduction is generally restricted to the transfer of property interests that will be includible in the surviving spouse\u2019s gross estate. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Supreme Court reiterated this interpretation of congressional intent in Northeastern Pa. Nat. B &amp; T. Co. v. United States, 387 U.S. 213, 221, 87 S.Ct. 1573, 1578, 18 L.Ed.2d 726 (1967), in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-16\">\u201cCongress\u2019 intent to afford a liberal \u2018estate-splitting\u2019 possibility to married couples, <em>where the deductible half of the decedent\u2019s estate would ultimately </em>\u2014if not <em>consumed </em>\u2014 be <em>taxable in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>estate of the survivor, </em>is unmistakable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">We are, therefore, of the view that the opinion of the District Court was in all respects correct, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-13\">.

Usufructs upon such things are replaced by a special right, called quasi-usufruct, which amounts to this: the usufructuary acquires the ownership of the things whicji are subject to his right. This permits him to make use of them in consuming them. But these things are vested in him solely upon condition that he return their equivalent, at the moment of restitution.\u201d Planiol, vol. 1, No. 2777.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201cIt is recognized that in such cases the usufructuary may consume these things, provided he gives back like things at the expiration of the usufruct. Such right is called quasi usufruct * * Planiol, vol. 1, No. 2749.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">\u201c[In] the different cases where he [the usufructuary] acquires the ownership of the things subject to his right of enjoyment * * * the nature of his obligation changes. Having become owner he may destroy, consume, alienate. He owes merely the equivalent of what he has received.\u201d Planiol, vol. 1, No. 2864. Cf. Aubry &amp; Rau, Civil Law Translations, vol. II, 7th Ed., \u00a7 235, pp. 510, 511, in which it is stated: \u201cSince the recovery of the right of enjoyment by the naked owner operates automatically, the usufructuary or his heirs are obligated to return without delay the objects of the usufruct * * *. These rules must apply even to sums of money contained in the usufruct; hence, if they are not immediately returned, an interest runs automatically in favor of the naked owner from the time the usufruct was extinguished.\u201d Footnote 2 annotated to this section indicates that something more than an ordinary debtor-creditor relationship is contemplated: \u201cthe relations between the usufructuary and the naked owner are not those of an ordinary debtor and creditor. What is involved here is not so much the <em>return </em>of a sum of money, as a restitution of the capital subject to usufruct, whose enjoyment cannot be extended beyond the duration of the usufruct * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b103-23\">.

The case is inapposite and distinguishable on several grounds, one material distinction being that the will which created the trust granted the widow the power to appoint the entire corpus, one of the requisites for qualifying for the marital deduction under the \u201cterminable interest\u201d exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b105-14\">.

See Warren and Surrey, Federal Estate and Gift Taxation (1961), pp. 759-760 (cited witli approval by tlie Supreme Court in United States v. Stapf, supra, in n. 13 of that opinion) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">\u201cAs indicated previously, one of the basic policies underlying the marital deduction provisions was that property qualifying for the deduction be <em>includible in the surviving spouse\u2019s gross estate. </em>No marital deduction was to be allowed where an interest in the property bequeathed to the spouse could pass to other persons, after the termination of her interest, <em>ivithout the inclusion of such interest in the wife\u2019s gross estate. </em>Such terminable interests have their own built-in estate tax avoidance, because the interests passing to third parties, stemming as they do from the decedent, automatically escape tax in the estate of the first legatee enjoying the property. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">\u201cIt was also intended to require property qualifying for the marital deduction to be substantially the same type of interest which would have passed to the surviving spouse under the community property system. Under that system, the surviving spouse receives outright ownership of half the community property and only half of the decedent\u2019s property is included in his gross estate. <em>If the wife then dies still owning half of the community property it will be included in her gross estate and all the family\u2019s community property will have been subject to estate tax at least once. Thus, only where the surviving spouse receives outright ownership of its practical equivalent should the property qualify for the marital deduction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-22\">\u201cThe terminable interest rule found in section 2056(b) attempts to incorporate the foregoing two policies in specific statutory language. By its operation, property which is not included in the decedent\u2019s estate because it qualifies for the marital deduction will if still in existence be subject to tax in his spouse\u2019s estate. Thus, all the family\u2019s property will have been subjected to the estate tax once, and a treatment equivalent to that accorded the community property spouse will have been achieved. * * * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-23\">Cf.
