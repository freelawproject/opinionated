Mitchell v. Follette, 358 F.2d 922, 927, \u201c * * * the court, and hence the state, is not a surety for the proper performance of counsel whether assigned or retained * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">The responsibility of the state through its courts in such a situation is to assign appellate counsel for the indigent appellant and to see that he has a free transcript of the record below. Here the assignment of appellate counsel was for the Appellate Division. Under the former New York Code of Criminal Procedure, the Clerk of the Bronx County Court, where appellant was tried and convicted, was required to prepare and forward the trial record to the Appellate Division. N.Y.Code Crim.Pro. \u00a7 485(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">The responsibility of the state through its prosecuting arm in moving to dismiss an appeal of an indigent defendant, includes informing the appellate court of the appellant\u2019s indigency and the necessity for the appointment of appellate counsel to represent him, as well as, of course, giving adequate notice of the application to the indigent appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-20\">None of these responsibilities seem to have been performed in connection with the dismissal of this petitioner\u2019s appeal from his conviction. Under these circumstances petitioner was unconstitutionally deprived of his right to appeal, as Judge Tyler properly held.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
