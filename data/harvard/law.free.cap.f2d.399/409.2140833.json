We enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Early in January, 1966, the intervenor Union was conducting an organizing campaign in a group of Ward\u2019s auto service centers in the Chicago metropolitan area. On January S the Union filed unfair labor practice charges against Ward: On January 11 the Union and Ward met and discussed the charges and a demand by the Union for recognition as bargaining agent. In the meeting the Union agreed that employees of each center should be a separate bargaining unit; and Ward agreed to make a card check and to recognize the Union as bargaining agent if the cards established a Union majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">On January 21, 1966, the Union withdrew the charges previously filed with the Board. On February 11, Ward sent the Union a Recognition Agreement in which it recognized the Union as bargaining agent for employees at the Old Orchard Service Center in Skokie, Illinois. On February 14, an employee at that center filed a decertification petition with the Regional Director. After a hearing on March 3, the Director allowed the petition and directed an election. The Union moved for reconsideration of that decision. The Director, in light of Keller Plastics Eastern, Inc., 157 NLRB 583, reconsidered and vacated his decision and transferred the \u201cissues\u201d to the Board. The Board followed <em>Keller </em>in dismissing the petition in an order dated June 16, on the ground that the Union had not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to prove itself as the employees\u2019 bargaining agent and that the Union, having been duly recognized, could not be decertified prior to being afforded such an opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">On May 26, 1966, the Union filed the charge, now before us, that Ward \u201con or about February J.4, 1966 and continuing thereafter\u201d refused to bargain with it as agent for the Old Orchard Center employees in violation of 8(a) (5) and (1). The General Counsel issued a complaint which alleged Ward\u2019s refusal to bargain \u201csince on or about February 14, 1966 * * * and * * particularly on or about June 22, 1966 * * * and * * * June 24, 1966.\u201d Ward\u2019s answer denied that a majority of the employees at Old Orchard had on or about February 10 selected the Union as bargaining agent, but admitted that Ward recognized the Union as exclusive bargaining agent on February 11. It denied that the Union requested bargaining prior to June 22, but admitted refusing to bargain, and relied in justification for its refusal upon the then pendency of the decertification petition signed by a \u201cmajority\u201d of the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The General Counsel\u2019s motion for summary judgment, based upon his contention that the Board\u2019s decision of June 16, 1966, had resolved all genuine issues of material fact concerning the Union\u2019s bargaining status, was granted. The Board found that the Union had requested bargaining on June 22, and that Ward had refused on or about June 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">The principal issue presented by this case is whether the Board erred in holding that Ward violated 8(a) (5) and (1) by refusing to bargain with a union which it had recognized on the basis of a card check, when Ward\u2019s refusal to bargain was because a majority of employees in the bargaining unit had signed a decertification petition which the Board dismissed in order to give the union a reasonable time to prove itself. If the Board\u2019s ruling refusing to hold a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>decertification election was proper, the Union was the bargaining representative of the employees, and the employer was under a duty to bargain with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Board relies upon Franks Bros. Co. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 702, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020, and Brooks v. NLRB, 348 U.S. 96, 75 S.Ct. 176, 99 L.Ed. 125, to sustain its position. There are significant factual distinctions between the case before us and both the <em>Franks </em>and <em>Brooks </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In <em>Franks </em>a union\u2019s majority was dissipated after an employer\u2019s unfair labor practice in refusing to bargain. The Supreme Court held that the Board could appropriately find that the unfair labor practice had undermined the prestige of the Union and require the employer to bargain with it for a reasonable period despite the loss of majority. In the ease before us there is no allegation that a prior unfair labor practice contributed to the Union\u2019s loss of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The holding in the <em>Brooks </em>case is that an employer may not refuse to bargain with a certified union during the one year period following certification, although he is presented with evidence which leads him to believe that the union has lost its majority status. This holding does not reach the question of whether the Board may refuse to order an election on a request by a majority of employees that the union be disqualified as bargaining agent for the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The union in <em>Brooks </em>had been certified by the Board within a year of the refusal to bargain, and accordingly the Board was precluded from holding a decerti-fication election, but the Court nevertheless stated that, \u201cIf the employees are dissatisfied with their chosen union, they may submit their own grievance to the Board.\u201d In the case before us there is no statutory bar to a decertification election and the employees have submitted a disavowal of the Union which the Board has rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The question here therefore is not whether an employer may refuse to bargain with a certified union during the year following certification, because he has evidence that the union has lost its majority status. The question is whether an employer may refuse to bargain, with a recognized but uncertified union, on the ground that the Board has rejected a petition signed, three days after recognition, by the majority of his employees, requesting that the Board disqualify the union as their bargaining agent. The question of the propriety of Ward\u2019s refusal to bargain can be answered only by determining the propriety of the Board\u2019s rejection of the employees\u2019 petition. This necessity of determining the validity of the Board\u2019s policy of refusing to hold a decertification election until a recognized union has acted as bargaining agent for a reasonable time distinguishes <em>Brooks. </em>And, unlike the <em>Brooks </em>case, this case involves a union which was recognized on the basis of a card check rather than on the basis of an election and Board certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Although neither <em>Franks </em>nor <em>Brooks </em>is binding precedent here, both are useful in resolving the issue before us. <em>Franks </em>is useful since it approved a Board order requiring an employer to bargain with a minority union, and therefore the Supreme Court had to meet the contention that the order violated the right of the employees to choose their own bargaining representative. The Supreme Court rejected this contention because it found that the order was a reasonable exercise of the Board\u2019s responsibility to \u201cdirect such action as will dissipate the unwholesome effects of violations of the Act,\u201d and because the order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">does not involve any injustice to employees who may wish to substitute * * * some other bargaining agent or arrangement * * * [since] a bargaining relationship once right<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>fully established must be permitted to exist and function for a reasonable period in which it can be given a fair chance to succeed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">This finding of no injustice in requiring employees to accept the <em>Franks </em>union as a bargaining agent for a reasonable time recognized the significance of industrial stability as a factor in limiting the employees\u2019 freedom of choice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Brooks </em>lists, with apparent approval, five reasons for imposing a requirement limiting the freedom of employees to disavow a bargaining agent they have chosen. Four of these reasons are pertinent to the question of whether a recognized but un-certified union should be afforded a reasonable time to succeed as bargaining agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">(1) The choice of a bargaining agent is like the choice of a political candidate and in both cases making the choice binding for a fixed time would promote a sense of responsibility of choice and a needed coherence in administration. <em>j</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">(2) A union should be given time to carry out its mandate so that it will not be forced to bargain in an atmosphere demanding immediate and highly successful results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">(3) An employer should not be allowed to feel that by stalling the negotiation process he may be able to undermine union strength.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">(4) Raiding and strife between competing unions should be minimized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">The present case presents an apparent conflict between two important goals of the National Labor Relations Act: preserving a free employee choice of bargaining representatives, and encouraging the collective bargaining process. We believe that in this situation the Board should be left free to utilize its administrative expertise in striking the proper balance. The Board here had ample reason for refusing to allow the employees\u2019 decertification petition and for requiring the employer to bargain. Under these circumstances we should not interfere with the Board\u2019s determination. The Sixth Circuit has recently reached the same result under similar circumstances. NLRB v. Universal Gear Service Corp., 6th Cir., May 16, 1968, 394 F.2d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">Ward argues that it should not be required to bargain with the Union because the Union was recognized on the basis of a card check rather than an election, and it is unfair to bind employees for a lengthy period on the basis of such an informal and uncertain method of selection. Sec. 9 authorizes both methods of selection, and we see no reason to set aside the Board\u2019s decision to ignore this distinction in this ease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both employers and employees have adequate methods of challenging the existence of majority support for a union at the time it was recognized by an employer on the basis of a card check. Even the good faith recognition of a minority union by an employer is considered il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>legal assistance in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 366 U.S. 731, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762, and it is settled that an employer may refuse to bargain with a union on the basis of a card check if he has a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c) (1) (B). This court, as well as others, requires that signatures on authorization cards be obtained only by proper methods so that they will truly represent a reasoned choice by employees. NLRB v. Dan Howard Mfg. Co., 7th Cir., Jan. 12, 1968, 390 F.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Ward urges upon us the \u201cimplication\u201d it sees in International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 366 U.S. 731, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762, that an employer \u201cneed not and indeed he must not, bargain with an uncerti-fied union * * * which loses its majority status as a result of repudiation by the employees.\u201d In that case the employer had recognized in good faith a union which at the time represented only a minority of employees \u2014 although it later gained a majority \u2014 and the Court held the recognition an 8(a) (1) unfair labor practice in violation of Sec. 7 organization rights, and an 8(a) (2) violation. If there is that implication, which we do not decide, it is of no aid here, since we have before us recognition by Ward of the Union, after Ward\u2019s card check established the Union\u2019s majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The decision in NLRB v. Clegg, 8 Cir., 304 F.2d 168, does not support Ward\u2019s contention. There the Court held that an employer had no duty to bargain with an uncertified union when, after representing the employees for six years, it lost its majority status. The union in <em>Clegg, </em>unlike the Union here, had been afforded a reasonable time to prove itself. Even if the Union in <em>Clegg </em>had been certified, the employer would have had no duty to bargain.

But freedom of choice does not postulate the indulgence of every caprice which an employee may entertain. \u25a0 Labor law must be adapted to the dynamic structure of industrial relationships. * * * The price of freedom to bargain collectively is responsibility in the exercise of the privilege of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\u201cMajority status may change from day to day in a particular company due to fluctuations in employment.
