The first contention is that he was charged and convicted under the wrong state statute. The state supreme court decided this question adversely to appellant. State v. Chavez, 77 N.M. 79, 419 P.2d 456 (1966)! The interpretation of a state law by the highest court of the state is generally binding on a federal court \u201cunless such interpretation is inconsistent with the fundamentals of liberty and justice.\u201d Newman v. Rodriguez, 375 F.2d 712 at 713 (10th Cir. 1967). Accord, Salazar v. Rodriguez, 371 F.2d 726 (10th Cir. 1967); Pearce v. Cox, 354 F.2d 884 (10th Cir. 1965); Silva v. Cox, 351 F.2d 61 (10th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>919, 86 S.Ct. 915, 15 L.Ed.2d 673. We find no such inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Appellant\u2019s second contention relates to a deletion in the indictment made by the trial judge. When \u201cthe attack upon the indictment is made collaterally, the judgment must stand if the indictment is sufficient to meet constitutional requirements.\u201d Flores v. United States, 338 F.2d 966, 967 (10th Cir. 1964). The indictment was constitutionally sufficient as it informed the appellant of the offense charged and alleged the essential elements of the offense. Cf. Flores v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">The final contention involves the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the jury appellant\u2019s tendered instruction on entrapment. Habeas corpus is not a substitute for an appeal and matters involving trial errors may not be reviewed collaterally. Kinnell v. Crouse, 384 F.2d 811 (10th Cir. 1967); Gaitan v. United States, 317 F.2d 494 (10th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\"> Although the appellee has not sought summary affirmance on the ground that the appellant has failed to exhaust available state remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2554, we note that Chavez has not presented his claims to the state courts in any collateral proceeding. As we held in Brown v. Crouse, 395 F.2d 755 (10th Cir., filed May 6, 1968), a state prisoner must utilize available postconviction procedures and present factual questions to the appropriate state court in order to \u201cprovide a complete factual background for the constitutional issues.\u201d 395 F.2d 756. Here, Chavez raises no factual questions and the legal issues have all been considered and rejected by the highest court in New Mexico in the direct appeal from his conviction. Under these circumstances it would not be in the interest of the effective administration of justice to require this appellant to re-present these patently unsubstantial issues to the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Appellee\u2019s motion to affirm is granted and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
