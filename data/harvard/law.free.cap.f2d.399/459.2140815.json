The contention is insubstantial, and the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">Immediately prior to the robbery of the bank, Wilson spent four days in jail on a charge of public drunkenness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During those four days, he seemed to his jailers \u201cqueer.\u201d A \u201cmodel prisoner,\u201d he was sometimes normally responsive conversationally, but at other times appeared not to understand what was being said to him. One of the jailers related the unresponsive interludes to periods of despondency, and each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>them sympathetically confirmed the fact of a seizure, which was assumed to be epileptic and for which he was given an-ticonvulsive medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On leaving the jail, without having had any alcohol for four days, Wilson went t\u00f3 a bank, passed a prepared note to a teller, received the money, threatened to kill the teller if an alarm was sounded before Wilson left the bank, turned midway toward the door and again at the door to repeat and emphasize the threat, and fled with the money. He took a taxi and asked the driver to take him to a department store where he might buy clothing. The driver attended him in that project and, after purchase of the clothing, drove Wilson to a whiskey store where, inferentially, Wilson purchased a bottle of whiskey. Wilson then asked to be taken to a hotel where he could get a hair cut and a place to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">He was arrested while in the barbershop.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">At the trial, it was sought to be shown from the seizure in the jail and from the defendant\u2019s unconfirmed report of a subsequent seizure while under observation at St. Elizabeth\u2019s that he was an epileptic and criminally irresponsible. The defense was exploded when the psychiatrist offered in its support testified that (1) he did not think the defendant\u2019s seizure was epileptic, (2) that confusion after an epileptic seizure \u2014 a <em>grand mal </em>\u2014 lasts for only fifteen or twenty minutes, and (S) with the anti-convulsive medication Wilson had received in jail, an epileptic would be unexposed to seizures and completely normal mentally and emotionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">On cross-examination and subsequent re-direct examination of the psychiatrist, it was brought out that Wilson\u2019s controls are impaired. While the psychiatrist testified that he thought that Wilson, while under observation at St. Elizabeth\u2019s, was a malingerer, exaggerating his epileptic symptoms, giving the wrong answers to all of the trick questions and being so uncooperative that they could not obtain a reliable I.Q. grade, the witness concluded that Wilson suffered from a sociopathic personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">With no reference to his history, except for the fact that his mother had died in a mental institution, there was very little violence in his history and that he was forty-six years old and divorced, the doctor expressed a number of conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">\u25a0 Wilson is a chronic alcoholic. There is some evidence of organicity, brain changes resulting from prolonged alcoholic excesses, but that was minor and could not explain any departure in his conduct from normalcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The psychiatrist described Wilson as irresponsible, self-centered, egocentric and infantile. He never attained emotional maturity nor had he acquired in any significant degree those moral inhibitions which govern the conduct of normal adults. Without such inhibitions and with his preoccupation with his own needs and wants untempered by any concern for the rights of others, Wilson would do anything he wished if he thought it would serve his purposes. Wilson, the psychiatrist thought, fully understood the difference between right and wrong, but his abstract understanding was not a great restraint because of the absence of normal moral inhibitions. Though the psychiatrist noted that there was little or no violence in Wilson\u2019s history,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the witness thought Wilson would do anything if he wished to strongly enough and thought he could get by with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Wilson has no psychosis of any kind, but without normally developed moral inhibitions, he has no effective inner controls over his conduct. To that extent, he has an impaired capacity to conform his conduct to standards generally observed by normal adults. The witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>harked back to an old term \u201cmoral insanity\u201d to describe Wilson\u2019s marked character defect exemplified by his primitive conscience. Wilson is so immature emotionally and morally, the witness said, as to be a .caricature of a responsible adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The doctor felt that Wilson\u2019s prognosis was extremely poor. No treatment with any hope of improvement was indicated, but the witness was of the opinion that, at large, Wilson would inevitably be in trouble with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We may pause here to note the basic factual sparsity of the record. After the peg of epilepsy, upon which the defense sought to hang its hat, was brushed aside, the expert witness was allowed and encouraged to state his conclusionary appraisal of the defendant. Conclusionary answers were given to questions which called for them and which, most frequently, were attempted to be cast in terms of ultimate inferences. \u201cDoes the defendant know the difference between right and wrong?\u201d \u201cHas he the capacity to refrain from doing what he wants to do if he wants very much to do it?\u201d These are summary paraphrases of a barrage of questions that ultimately elicited in considerable detail the psychiatrist\u2019s summary description of the defendant. No one, however, asked the witness about the bases of his judgment. The government may be under some restraint in probing those bases too deeply when they include a long record of prior convictions, but the defense is not. It may be strategic for the defense to avoid bringing out information about a criminal record which indicates a propensity to commit the kind of offense with which the defendant is charged, but looking at the presentence report, that was not the case here. The deficiencies of the record here seemingly result from an elementary preference for the unexamined con-elusions of the expert witness over their factual predicates. It was only by happenstance that the witness testified that there was very little violence in Wilson\u2019s history, and the paucity of other basic information is proclaimed by the fact that we know nothing else about him except that he was forty-six years old, white and divorced. The doctor testified that Wilson had been a failure in everything he ever attempted, but the jury and we know nothing of anything Wilson ever attempted except marriage, and that is entirely unelucidated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Had this trial occurred after our decision in <em>Chandler, </em>we would have been inclined to remand the case for a retrial on the issue of mental responsibility because of the failure to develop the factual bases of the psychiatrist\u2019s opinions. The trial was at an earlier date, however, and we do not think the District Judge can be faulted for not having injected himself into the case more extensively than he did. Nor can we find any absence of fundamental fairness in the trial. The psychiatrist\u2019s description was full, complete and extensive, though the factual bases for his description and his judgments are lacking. His emphatic statement of his conclusionary views may have been far more effective from the defendant\u2019s standpoint than they would have been if he had been called upon to justify them. At any rate, he undertook to describe the man and was in no sense limited to answers to the ultimate questions to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Under these circumstances, we think it unnecessary, on our own initiative, to remand the case for a partial retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">On this appeal, it is contended only that the defendant was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal by reason of insanity. The contention is without foundation. The jury was not bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>accept the conclusionary appraisal of the expert witness, but, even if it did, there is nothing in the law which requires a jury to acquit the kind of sociopath the doctor thought the defendant to be. As a standard for criminal responsibility, we have approved and adopted the American Law Institute\u2019s formulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its references to powers of control, as emphasized by the caveat, do not encompass those who do not wish to control and restrain their conduct as contrasted with those whose controls are not governed by their wishes. As long as an individual has a substantial capacity for choice, he does not escape the law\u2019s criminal sanctions because he chooses imprudently or so prefers his immediate self-interests that he is prepared to commit deliberate transgressions whenever he thinks they will advantage him and that he will not be caught.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">This is not to say that Wilson\u2019s claim of innocence by reason of insanity was not appropriate for consideration by the jury. There is enough doubt about -a sociopath such as he to call for an exercise of the jury\u2019s moral judgment, but the jury is not required to accept the most favorable implications of the most favorable answers of lay and expert witnesses without regard to qualifying and explanatory testimony. Nor are unqualified and unexplained conclusions of a witness binding upon a jury when their factual bases are not probed or explained. The psychiatrist here never expressed the opinion that Wilson had no substantial capacity to control his conduct in the context of a bank robbery, but, if he had, the opinion would not bind the jury in the absence of a proven factual predicate which would admit of no other conclusion. The question was clearly one for the jury, and the motion for a judgment of acquittal, which would have deprived the jury of its function, was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">This disposes of the defendant\u2019s contentions. He has raised no question about the court\u2019s instructions, though we notice them in light of our recent adoption of the American Law Institute\u2019s formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In charging the jury on the question of mental responsibility, the court used a liberalized version of the charge approved by the Supreme Court in the <em>Davis </em>cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury was told, in pertinent part, that even though Wilson knew the difference between right and wrong and knew that the act he was committing was wrong he should be acquitted if \u201chis will, that is to say, the governing power of his mind, has been so impaired that his actions are not subject to it but are beyond his control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-2\">The instruction is reminiscent of Had-field\u2019s Case, 27 State Trials 1281 (1800) which we discussed in <em>Chandler. </em>It differs from the American Law Institute formulation but slightly. There is no direct reference to substantiality of capacity to control his conduct, but it suggested to the jury that if the act was beyond Wilson\u2019s impaired capacity, they should acquit. The American Law Institute rule does no more. Importantly, the instruction does not imply that the jury must find a general destruction of the defendant\u2019s will, as <em>Davis </em>does; impairment is enough if the act is beyond the reach of the diminished capacity to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">If the instruction as given is not the equivalent of the American Law Institute rule, the difference is so slight that a retrial is not required. This is particularly so in light of the fact that defense counsel affirmatively approved the charge as given and has not questioned it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-12\">. From the pre-sentence report, read and discussed at the allocution, this was not a novel experience for him.

United States, D.C.Cir., 390 F.2d 444; United States v. Chandler, 4 Cir., 393 F.2d 920. We imply no criticism of defense counsel, however. It may not have seemed in the defendant\u2019s interest to bring out all that we find deficient in the record. That is one of the problems of our present procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\">. United States v.

Yet the entire trial below was not directed to the essential point, and the majority\u2019s disposition, I fear, compounds the difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Appellant\u2019s basic defense at trial was insanity. His psychiatric witness \u2014 the only expert witness \u2014 testified that appellant had a character or personality disorder which was so severe as to constitute a mental illness. Appellant was termed \u201ca caricature of an adult.\u201d According to the psychiatrist, Wilson has \u201can aborted kind of mind\u201d and he \u201cemotionally functions like a five year old.\u201d More, he is said to lack \u201ca mature capacity to adhere to the right,\u201d and his capacity for exercising mature judgment is labelled \u201cseriously impaired.\u201d Most importantly, as the majority observes, \u201che has no effective inner control over his conduct.\u201d Upon this unchallenged foundation, not shaken but actually developed on cross-examination, it is difficult to erect or sustain a finding of sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Although there was no contradictory expert testimony, the jury found appellant guilty. Like the majority, I can only speculate as to why the jury ignored the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony. Like the majority, I am inclined to the view that the primary reason was that the psychiatrist\u2019s conclusions, though clearly enunciated, were not buttressed by any substantial information about appellant. The psychiatrist testified only that appellant\u2019s \u201cwhole life is just one picture of irresponsibility, dependency, laxity, drinking, indulging himself in whatever he wants to do, rather than assuming any kind of responsibility. Whatever he\u2019s done, wherever he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been a failure.\u201d The defect in the proceedings is that the facts from which this picture of appellant was constructed were never presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">A psychiatrist has the obligation to present the jury with the underlying data upon which his opinion is predicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unsupported conclusions do not give the jury an enlightening view of the defendant\u2019s condition. The jury should be afforded a full opportunity to focus on the dynamics of defendant\u2019s mental and emotional processes and on his capacity to control his actions, rather than to be forced to wrestle with esoteric psychiatric terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">To a large extent, however, the character of a psychiatrist\u2019s testimony will depend on the nature and direction of the examination by counsel. Here the examination was extremely cursory and uncritical. Most of defense counsel\u2019s questions to the psychiatrist dealt with appellant\u2019s alleged epilepsy. But the psychiatrist, appellant\u2019s own witness, testified that he was uncertain whether appellant suffered from epilepsy and that in any event, epilepsy would not affect appellant\u2019s capacity for control except during the actual seizure. It was only on <em>cross-examination </em>by government counsel that appellant\u2019s infantile emotional processes were brought to the attention of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Quite apparently, defense counsel and his psychiatrist had not engaged in significant consultation prior to trial. Another possible explanation for the nature of the direct examination is that suggested by the majority, namely, that defense counsel may have deliberately wished to suppress certain facts about appellant\u2019s background. In some insanity cases the problem may arise that the same facts which tend to demonstrate defendant\u2019s mental illness are also likely to convince the jury that he committed the offense charged. Usually the defense of insanity is by way of confession and avoidance \u2014 confessing the act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>seeking to avoid punishment because of legal irresponsibility. But where there is an independent defense in addition to insanity, or the prosecution\u2019s proof of the commission of the act is weak, the defense counsel and the trial judge should consider a bifurcated trial, so that the questions of whether defendant did the act and, if so, whether he was criminally responsible can be tried separately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since at the outset, only defense counsel is likely to be aware of the relevant facts relating to the merits of the defense or the claim of insanity, he has primary responsibility for suggesting the desirability of bifurcation. But there may be cases when the trial judge himself should perceive the appropriateness of bifurcation and should on his own initiative suggest this procedure to counsel. In any event, in the instant case there seemed to be no doubt that appellant committed the robbery. Thus defense counsel should not have been reluctant to reveal significant facts in appellant\u2019s past, even without a bifurcated trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">When psychiatrist and counsel fail to provide sufficient underlying information to the jury, the judge, I maintain, has some responsibility to help elicit this vital information. Although ours is indeed an adversary system, a criminal trial is not a game. It is a solemn proceeding in which moral judgment is pronounced. As the governor of the trial, and not a mere moderator, the judge has an affirmative duty to do all that is feasible to assure that these judgments are based upon all the relevant evidence. The judge should not hesitate to prevent the distortion of the jury\u2019s perspective by counsel\u2019s deficient exploration of the underlying, determinative facts. In some cases, the court may feel obligated to suggest that additional witnesses be called. At the very least it should ensure that the psychiatrists who do testify describe the investigations, observations, reasoning and medical theory which led to the ultimate opinion, as voiced on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Professor McCormick has declared that the \u201ccore\u201d of the opinion evidence rule would be preserved by a rule \u201cprescribing that the trial judge in his discretion may require that a witness before giving testimony in terms of inference on general description shall first give the concrete details upon which the inference or description is founded, so far as feasible.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The need for judicial supervision is particularly urgent in insanity cases, where the adversary system may malfunction because of the inexperience of counsel, the complexity of the issue, or both. Most criminal defendants are represented by court-appointed lawyers with little experience in criminal law or even other areas of trial work. These lawyers must master new fields of law and new skills. When, in addition, it becomes their task to present a defense of insanity, which involves elusive medical, legal and moral problems, they are often understandably overwhelmed. In these circumstances, intervention from the bench may be absolutely essential for a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">In the instant case, the trial judge did play more than a passive role. On several occasions he commendably required the expert witness to clarify his opinions. But he never demanded that the psychiatrist present the factual basis for his opinions. Thus the jury never obtained a complete unfolding of defendant\u2019s emotional and mental processes. If they had, they might have acquitted by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">I recognize that for many years the insanity defense has been presented in this unsatisfactory manner. But it is no consolation to appellant to tell him that this is the way things have always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>been done, and the inertia of established practice should not prevail over the demands of justice. The fact remains that he did not have a sufficient hearing on the issue of insanity. I would remand to afford an opportunity for such a hearing. Retrial could be limited to the insanity issue, since there was no taint in the jury\u2019s finding that appellant committed the acts charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">After years of intense search by the profession for an improved standard of criminal responsibility, our circuit and others have achieved a virtual consensus. I ask, however, what has been gained for the judicial system by all this effort if, in the trial of cases involving the defense of insanity, the same old questions continue to be asked and the same con-clusional answers are accepted. Have we advanced materially if we tolerate the complete failure of either side to focus on the basic facts indispensable for any significant judgment under the new, carefully established standard? If as shallow and mechanical a performance as this record discloses is validated, then the years of earnest debate upon the legal formula will have advanced us not an iota. I do not overlook the fact that this case was tried before the decision in <em>Chandler, </em>and this may in part account for the inattention to the depth of the requisite inquiry.,</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We can, of course, say that the case has been insufficiently proved and therefore affirm, but it is preferable by far for us to remand for a genuine trial of the issue \u2014 especially as the defendant was represented by court-appointed counsel. Giving recognition to the objective of a trial when an insanity defense is interposed, it seems to me that, without visiting censure upon any of the participants in the instant case, this court should exercise its discretion to order a new trial and an appropriate investigation of the pertinent facts. By doing this we would give meaning and effect to the rule we recently adopted in <em>Chandler </em>and point the way to its effective implementation. Otherwise we sanction and encourage perfunctory performance and nullify the good doctrine of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">While I regret that the majority does not favor a remand in this instance, I note with satisfaction, and call to the attention of district judges in their future practice, the majority\u2019s statement that \u201chad the trial occurred after our decision in <em>Chandler, </em>we would have been inclined to remand the case for a retrial on the issue of mental responsibility because of the failure to develop the factual bases of the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Finally, I think that until we have a more adequate record it is inappropriate to discuss, as the majority does, whether appellant was the \u201ckind of sociopath\u201d covered by the American Law Institute\u2019s test for insanity. And it is equally inappropriate to determine that the American Law Institute\u2019s reference to powers of control \u201cdoes not encompass those who do not wish to control and restrain their conduct as contrasted with those whose controls are not governed by their wishes.\u201d It may be that a person\u2019s lack of desire to control1 his conduct is itself the result of an exonerating mental disease or defect. Before passing on this point it would be helpful to have factual detail in the place of abstract theorizing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. See United States v.
