The district court summarily denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-22\">Since no return was required of the respondent and no evidentiary hearing was held in the district court, appellant\u2019s allegations must be accepted as true for purposes of this appeal. Massey v. Moore, 1954, 348 U.S. 105, 108, 75 S.Ct. 145, 99 L.Ed. 135. The most substantive of appellant\u2019s allegations was that he was not sane at the time he committed the offense and at the time of trial. No pre-trial hearing was held or motion for examination made, although appellant apparently had a past record of commitment for mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-23\">This question was raised before the state court in appellant\u2019s post-conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>attack on his confinement. Appellant was not produced at that hearing nor was he represented by counsel. A .representative of the State was present. The state court held only that the defendant \u201cwas represented in this cause by able counsel\u201d (referring to the proceedings leading to the conviction), and the matter alleged, even if true, did not render his conviction illegal. State of Florida v. Harris, No. 59-543 (A-74) in the Court of Record of Escambia County, Florida. The district court cited this ruling as to competent counsel at the time of trial and further held \u201cthat the alleged constitutional deprivation simply does not exist\u201d, without any elaboration. It also agreed that it was not necessary for appellant to have been present at the state post-conviction hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We hold that the Court below erred in accepting these conclusions of the state court as correct due to the fact that Harris did not receive a full, fair and adequate hearing in the collateral state court proceeding on the issues of whether the evidence presented to the state trial judge was sufficient to raise a \u201cbona fide doubt\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial (so as to require a full sanity hearing pursuant to Section 917.01 of the Florida Statutes Annotated) and whether Harris was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at trial. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d) (5) and (6); Pate v. Robinson, 1966, 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815; Greer v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1967, 379 F.2d 923; cf. Tyler v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Appellant\u2019s allegations regarding his competency to stand trial in 1959 raised a federal question regarding the validity of his conviction. The District Court should re-examine the case to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense and at the time of trial. It it finds such an issue, it should hold a hearing to develop the facts so far as they may be established at this time, and thereafter proceed in accord with the decision in Lee v. State of Alabama, 386 F.2d 97 (5th Cir., 1967). If it finds no genuine issue was presented by appellant\u2019s allegations, then the case should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The case is remanded to the District Court for determinations consistent with this opinion. In view of the possibility that appellant was incompetent at the time of trial and may still be, the District Court might well exercise its discretion to appoint counsel for appellant before any further proceedings are held.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
