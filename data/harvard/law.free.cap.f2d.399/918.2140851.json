SWEIGERT, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b967-14\">SWEIGERT, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">This is an action for damages, brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 et seq., by appellant, a railroad brakeman-conductor, against his employer, Great Northern Railway Company, for on-duty injuries sustained by appellant. Plaintiff and appellant appeals from the judgment entered against plaintiff upon a jury verdict in favor of defendant \u00edailroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">The F.E.L.A. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEN\">\u201cEvery common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce * * * shall be <em>liable </em>in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce * * * for such injury * * * <em>resulting in whole or in part from the negligence </em>of any of the officers, agents, or employees of s\u00fcch carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.\u201d (emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-18\">The main question presented on this appeal is whether the District Court committed prejudicial error in giving to the jury the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-19\">\u201c * * * The term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 means that cause which in a direct, unbroken sequence produces the injury complained of and without which such injury would not have happened. * * *\u201d (Clerk\u2019s Tr. p. 107, lines 1-3)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-21\">Plaintiff-appellant, contending that the District Court committed prejudicial error in giving this instruction, mainly relies on Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., 335 U.S. 520, 69 S.Ct. 275, 93 L.Ed. 208 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>(1948); Rogers v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957) and Page v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., 312 F.2d 84, 98 A.L.R.2d 639 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Defendant-appellee, contending that the instructions on the subject of causation must be considered as a whole, argues that the particular instruction complained of is neither erroneous nor inconsistent with the accompanying other instructions which express the liberal r\u00fale of causation indicated by the Supreme Court in the <em>Rogers </em>case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The instruction in question was given by the trial court in context with other instructions on the subject of causation. The whole instruction on the subject was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-6\">\u201cA party is not entitled to recover solely because there has been an accident. Any party claiming negligence or contributory negligence has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the other party was negligent in some of the particulars claimed and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the injury and damage to plaintiff claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-7\"><em>\u201cThe term, \u2018proximate cause\u2019 means that cause which in a direct, unbroken sequence produces the injury and without which such injury would not have happened. </em>* * * (emphasis ours) \u201cThe Federal Employees Liability Act, \u00a7 51 provides in part, \u2018Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers. * * * \u2019 (Clerk\u2019s Tr. p. 109)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-8\">\u201cAn injury or damage is proximately cause (sic) by an act, or failure to act, whenever it appears from a preponderance of the evidence in the case, that the act or omission played any part, no matter how small, in bringing about, or actually causing, the injury or damage. So, if you should find, from the evidence in the case that any negligence of the defendant contributed in any way or manner, toward any injury or damage suffered by the plaintiff, you may find that such injury or damage was proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s act or omission. (Clerk\u2019s Tr. p. 110, lines 5-14). \u201cThe primary inquiry for you to decide in this case is whether you draw the conclusion that negligence of the railroad employer played any part in bringing about the injury to plaintiff. If you find that any carelessness or negligence on the part of the railroad, or of any employee of the railroad other than the plaintiff, in any way caused or contributed even in the slightest degree to the injury or injuries complained of, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff\u201d. (Clerk\u2019s Tr. p. 110, lines 15-23).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The particular instruction complained of, together with the matter preceding it, was requested by defendant-appellee. Defendant-appellee also requested the material cited supra to Clerk\u2019s Tr. p. 110, lines 5-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">The remainder of the instruction, cited supra to Clerk\u2019s Tr. p. 110, lines 15-23, was requested by the plaintiff-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Both parties requested the giving of F.E.L.A. \u00a7 51, which uses the language \u201cresulting in whole or in part from\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">Both parties also used the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d and \u201ccause\u201d in their various requested instructions, e. g., Plaintiff\u2019s Requested Instruction No. 11, using the term \u201cproximately caused\u201d, and Plaintiff\u2019s Requested Instruction No. 8, using the word \u201ccaused\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">Before instructing the jury the trial judge consulted with both counsel in chambers and informally reviewed their requested instructions. Counsel for plaintiff-appellant called to the court\u2019s attention as objectionable, Defendant's Requested Instruction No. 19 wherein the complained-of instruction appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">The record also shows that at the conclusion of the instructions and during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>jury recess, counsel for plaintiff-appellant, after twice assuring the court that he had no exceptions to the instructions as given, spoke up, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-4\">\u201cI think I had better retract that statement * * * Your Honor, at this time the plaintiff excepts to the court\u2019s submitting to the jury and instructing them on the subject of proximate cause, and in defining proximate cause, because under the Rogers rule, in the Page case, Page v. Southwestern Railroad, in the recent trend of cases, it is my understanding that proximate cause is no longer a part of the Federal Employees\u2019 Liability Act * * * Your Honor said: \u2018The term \u201cproximate\u201d cause means that cause which in a direct, unbroken sequence produces the injury complained of and without which such injury would not have happened\u2019. I submit, your Hon- or, that that was error. Later on, in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the court told them that the negligence of the plaintiff must proximately cause the injury, so I am taking exception to that. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Defendant-appellee concedes that this is a F.E.L.A. case where, on disputed facts, the jury could have found for plaintiff but did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Neither Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., nor Rogers v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., strongly relied on by plaintiff-appellant herein, involved instructions concerning the causation required to establish legal liability of a railroad under the F.E.L.A. Both cases dealt with evidentiary situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">In Coray v. Southern Pacific Company, 335 U.S. 520, 69 S.Ct. 275, 93 L.Ed. 208 (1949) a Utah trial court had directed a verdict for defendant in a Federal Safety Appliance Act case. The Utah State Supreme Court affirmed. The U. S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed upon the ground that decedent was entitled to recovery if a defective appliance was either the sole or a contributory cause of his death and that upon the evidence in the case the jury could have found that decedent\u2019s death resulted in whole or in part from the defective appliance and that it was error to direct a verdict for the railroad. The Supreme Court, referring to the State Court\u2019s discussion of distinctions between \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the legal sense and \u201ccause\u201d in the philosophical sense, simply noted that the language of the statute, i. e., \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d, was clear and direct and that consideration of its meaning by the introduction of dialectical subtleties can serve no useful interpretative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">In Rogers v. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957) the Supreme Court was again dealing with an evidentiary situation in which the Missouri Supreme Court had reversed a jury award to plaintiff in a F.E.L.A. case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the State Supreme Court upon the ground that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding for plaintiff, pointing out that under F.E.L.A. the test of a jury case is whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the employee\u2019s injury, citing Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., supra.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">In Bertrand v. Southern Pacific Co., 282 F.2d 569 (9th Cir. 1960), a F.E.L.A. case in which plaintiff appealed after an adverse jury verdict, one of the questions on appeal was whether the trial judge had erred in failing to give plaintiff\u2019s requested jury instruction to the effect that the language of <em>Rogers, </em>i. e., \u201cplayed any part, even in the slightest, in producing the injury\u201d constituted a \u201ctest of the liability of the railroad carrier\u201d. The court, affirming, very properly pointed out that <em>Rogers, </em>supra, was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>cerned, not with a \u201ctest of liability,\u201d but only with a \u201ctest of a jury case\u201d and held the proposed instruction faulty in that it bound the jury to find what it was entitled to find but was not required to find.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Neither <em>Coray </em>nor <em>Rogers, </em>supra, purports to define causality other than to point out that, according to the plain and direct language of the statute, the negligence of the railroad need not be either the sole or the whole cause of the employee\u2019s injury so long as it plays some part, however small, in producing the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">These authorities do not necessarily make it error for a trial judge to instruct, or at least attempt to instruct, a jury on the meaning of the statutory requirement that the injury must be one \u201cresulting in whole or in part from\u201d the negligence of the railroad. (See, <em>Rogers, </em>supra, 352 U.S. pp. 504-505, 77 S.Ct. 443).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Certainly, the statutory requirement that the injury must have <em>resulted from </em>negligence necessarily implies that the injury must have been <em>caused by </em>the negligence. The words \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cresult\u201d are correlative terms, each implying the other. The word result, used as a verb, means \u201cto happen or issue as a consequence or effect of some cause\u201d. The word \u201ccause\u201d means \u201cthat which produces an effect or result, that from which anything proceeds and without which it would not exist.\u201d (See, Webster Unabridged Dictionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">In the instruction here in question the trial court, attempting to further explain the causation required by the statute, told the jury in part that the cause must be a proximate cause, i. e., a \u201ccause which in a direct, unbroken sequence produces the injury and without which the injury would not have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">The first question is whether <em>Coray </em>and <em>Rogers </em>render this instruction erroneous in a F.E.L.A. case. We do not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Both <em>Coray </em>and <em>Rogers </em>recognize, as this instruction substantially states, that the negligence of the railroad must \u201ccontribute\u201d (Coray) at least in part, to the injury and that the negligence must \u201cplay a part\u201d (Rogers) even though the very slightest, in producing the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">The instruction in question merely adds that the cause of the injury must produce the injury in a \u201cdirect, unbroken sequence\u201d. We see nothing erroneous in this. Certainly, if the sequence of events between the negligence, on the one hand, and the injury on the other, is broken, then the claimed cause, i. e., the negligence, would not really be a cause at all\u2014nor the injury a \u201cresult\u201d of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">The instruction in question also adds that the cause must be one \u201cwithout which the injury would not have occurred\u201d. We see nothing erroneous in this. Certainly, if the claimed result, i. e., the injury, would have occurred in any event, even without the negligence of the railroad, then the injury would not really be the \u201cresult\u201d of the negligence, nor the negligence the cause of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">The only possible criticism of the questioned instruction is that, if given alone, it might be misleading to the jury in that it might suggest that the negligence of the railroad would have to be the sole and the whole causative factor producing the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">In the pending case, however, the questioned instruction was not given alone. It was coupled with other language (precisely the language of <em>Rogers) </em>clearly indicating that, if the negligent act or omission of the railroad \u201cplayed any part, no matter how small, in bringing about or actually causing the injury or damage\u201d or if it \u201ccontributed in any way or manner toward the injury\u201d, then it would be a proximate cause within the meaning of the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">The instructions here, considered as a whole, are not comparable to those quoted and condemned in Page v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., 312 F.2d 84 at p. 87, 98 A.L.R.2d 639 (5th Cir. 1963) in which a traditional proximate cause instruction was given <em>without </em>adding the language of <em>Coray </em>or <em>Rogers </em>and with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>out attempting in any other way to indicate to the jury that the negligence of the railroad need not be the sole or the whole cause of resulting injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Moreover, the court in <em>Page </em>made clear (p. 92) that it was not making \u201cany wholesale condemnation of the use of language of proximate causation in cases under this act\u201d, adding, \u201c[o]ur holding is confined to the instructions and the facts of this particular case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Although not cited in the briefs, we have also noted the very recent and carefully considered opinion in Parker v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 68 Cal.Rptr., 362, Court of Appeal, Second District (Hufstedler, J.) (May 10, 1968), reversing a F.E.L.A. judgment for the railroad (after jury verdict) upon the ground that the trial court prejudicially erred in giving the traditional proximate cause instruction <em>without </em>anything more <em>except </em>a statement of the substance of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The instructions in <em>Parker, </em>however, like the instructions in <em>Page, </em>are not comparable with the instructions given in our pending case. In both <em>Page </em>and <em>Parker </em>the trial judge gave the traditional proximate cause instruction. The <em>Parker </em>instructions differ from <em>Page </em>only in that the trial judge in <em>Parker </em>added a paraphrase of Title 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 in which the statutory words \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d appear. In neither case, however, did the trial judge add anything to adequately convey the meaning of causation as articulated by <em>Rogers </em>to the effect that the negligence of the railroad need not be the sole cause or the whole cause of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\"><em>Parker </em>recognizes that the giving of a traditional proximate cause instruction in a F.E.L.A. case is not necessarily reversible error. The point in <em>Parker </em>was that the plaintiff is entitled to an instruction on causation which connotes the controlling spirit of <em>Rogers. </em>The court regarded the traditional proximate cause instruction there given <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as falling substantially short of conveying the <em>Rogers </em>message. The court noted that the mere addition of a paraphrase of Section 51 did not adequately convey the meaning of <em>Rogers </em>because, as the court said, \u201cThe words \u2018or in part\u2019 are submerged in a barrage of detailed prose, and to assume that the jury would have grasped the significance of those three words and should have further recognized that the words were an explanation of proximate cause as expressed in BAJI No. 104 attributes unreasonable powers of perception to the jury\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Our pending case is quite different in that the trial judge, although giving a sparse version of the traditional proximate cause instruction as an abstract definition of causation, followed it with specific, formula instructions in which the language, message and spirit of <em>Rogers </em>were stated and reiterated in three separate phrasings \u2014 so clearly and emphatically that the jury could not have missed the message.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">The trial court took the added precaution of reminding the jurors that \u201cYou are not to single out one instruction alone as stating the law but must consider the instructions as a whole\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">We conclude that the instructions, as here framed for the jury, could not possibly have led the jurors to believe that the negligence of the railroad, in order to result in or cause the employee\u2019s injury, would have to be the sole cause or the whole cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">However, just as in <em>Page </em>and <em>Parker, </em>so we in this case neither make any wholesale condemnation of the use of a traditional proximate cause instruction in F.E.L.A. cases nor do we necessarily recommend instructions in the particular form here given. We confine our holding to the particular instructions of this case and hold that, considered as a whole, they were neither erroneous, self contradictory nor misleading and that, even if in part erroneous, they were as a whole not prejudicially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\">. See, Dissenting opinions of Frankfurter (352 U.S. 524, 77 S.Ct. 459) and Harlan (352 U.S. 559, 77 S.Ct. 478) which emphasize that Rogers, and similar cases, involved mere evidentiary review and state that (in the opinion of the dissenters) they should never have been taken up by the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-16\">.
