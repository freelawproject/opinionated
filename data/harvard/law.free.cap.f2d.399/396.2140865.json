Sterling Precision Corporation, 2 Cir., 393 F.2d 214, we are confronted with a close question of interpretation of \u00a7 17 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 815, setting limits on \u201cTransactions of Certain Affiliated Persons and Underwriters.\u201d On this occasion we believe the district judge construed the relevant clause, \u00a7 17(d), too narrowly, reverse his judgment dismissing the complaint, and direct further appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">Section 17(d), so far as here relevant, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-14\">(d) It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person of or principle underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a company of the character described in section 80a-12 (d) (3) (A) and (B) of this title), or any affiliated person of such a person or principal underwriter, acting as principal to effect any transaction in which such registered company, or a company controlled by such registered company, is a joint or a joint and several participant with such person, principal underwriter, or affiliated person, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by such registered or controlled company on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">Defendant Talley Industries, Inc. (hereafter Industries) is an \u201caffiliated person\u201d of defendant American Investors Fund, Inc.' (hereafter Fund), a registered investment company, by virtue of Fund\u2019s owning 9% of Industries\u2019 voting shares, see \u00a7 2(a) (3) (B). As a result of discussions between Franz G. Talley, president of Industries, a company having a net worth of some $10 million, and Michael Kimelman, a partner in the brokerage firm of M. Kimelman &amp; Co., in which Kimelman advanced General Time Corporation, a much larger corporation, as a candidate for acquisition by a merger with Industries, Talley gave Kimelman an order under which he bought 24,800 shares of General Time for Industries on December 26 and 27, 1967; the price was around $23 or $24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>per share. This was only some 1% of the outstanding stock of General Time, a long way from what Talley thought would be needed to afford a prospect of success if he should decide to go forward with an acquisition or merger proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">On December 29, 1967, Talley telephoned Fund\u2019s office, and ultimately spoke to George A. Chestnutt, Jr., president of Fund and of Chestnutt Corporation, its investment adviser. Talley told him that Industries had bought stock in a certain company which he viewed as a possible merger candidate and that he had in mind that Fund also might wish to buy some stock. Chestnutt broke off the conversation to consult his counsel. The latter advised that Fund could follow Talley\u2019s suggestion so long as it \u201cmaintained complete independence in our acquisition of stock and didn\u2019t make any promises or arrangements\u201d as to voting, disposition or otherwise. Chest-nutt relayed this to Talley, who accepted Fund\u2019s proceeding in this manner. Talley then named the company, saying he thought it a good investment that might become better under a more aggressive management. He indicated that Industries intended to buy more General Time stock in the market, with an eye toward a merger; Chestnutt got the impression that Talley was thinking of terms that would yield \u2022 around $45 in Industries securities for each share of General Time. Talley proposed that Kimelman get in touch with Chestnutt; the latter, after telling Talley that 10% of the General Time stock would be his legal limit, said he would study his own data on the company, would like to see Kimelman, and would think the whole thing over. Shortly thereafter Industries bought 42,000 shares of General Time.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Kimelman visited Chestnutt on January 3. Next day Chestnutt determined that Fund should take a position in General Time. He was motivated both by study of the company\u2019s earnings and by a belief that if Industries sought a merger, the stock would rise as a result of that offer or of others it might stimulate. On January 5 Fund placed an order with Kimelman for 205,000 shares, subsequently increased to 210,000, just under Fund\u2019s 10% limit, on a \u201cnot-held\u201d basis, i. e., with the time of execution at the broker\u2019s discretion. Chestnutt reported this to Talley.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Chestnutt maintained close supervision of Kimelman\u2019s purchases, insisting that on days when Kimmelman had \u201cnot held\u201d orders from other customers, shares should be allocated so as not to favor another customer over Fund. Industries was also making some purchases of General Time through Kimelman but at least on one occasion agreed to forego allocation and accept the most expensive shares. By February 15 Fund had acquired 210,000 shares at an average cost of $28.49 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">During the first week of January 1968, Talley discussed the situation, including his initial conversation with Chestnutt, with his counsel, who did not mention \u00a7 17(d). After some backing and filling unnecessary to recount, Industries resumed purchases of General Time toward the end of January. Talley talked to Chestnutt four or five times during January and reported how many shares he thought \u201cwere being acquired by the Kimelmans and himself and his friends and so on.\u201d He would give Chestnutt percentage figures of what \u201cwe have\u201d and these rather obviously included the holdings of Fund. On February 5 Industries sold 40,000 shares to Donald Harrington, a friend of Talley\u2019s, who later increased his holdings to 104,500 shares. Finding that the record date for General Time\u2019s annual meeting was March 1, somewhat earlier than he had believed, and that Industries\u2019 own holding were only some 52,000 shares, about 2y2% of the stock as against the 10% he considered necessary for a meaningful merger proposal, Talley made a special bid on the advice of his investment bankers, Smith, Barney &amp; Co., and against that of Chestnutt who thought this would drive the price up and would not get Industries the amount of stock it wanted. The bid, on February 19, 1968, was for 200,000 shares at 36y2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>General Time denounced this as \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d and said it had a higher offer, on a tax-free basis, from another company. Only 66,437 shares were acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On the afternoon of February 19, a meeting was held at Smith, Barney &amp;\u25a0 Co. at the instance of the management of General Time. Talley proposed a merger and said \u201cWe and our associates own about a third of the stock\u201d \u2014 a figure which included Fund\u2019s holdings. Later that evening the management sent word to Talley it had decided to fight. Industries, which then owned 118,537 shares, about 5%% of the total, went back into the market and quickly bought another 139,400 shares at prices ranging from 41% to 43%. This brought its holdings to 257,937 shares, about 12%%, at an average cost of $36.76 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">General Time\u2019s response was an action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging <em>inter alia </em>a violation of 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and seeking an injunction against the voting of the stock, the obtaining of more, or any merger. Judge Bryan dismissed the action for lack of standing; General Time appealed. Meanwhile Industries selected ten nominees of an \u201cIndependent Stockholders Committee\u201d for election as directors at the annual meeting of General Time on April 22, obtained a stockholders list only after litigation in Delaware, and sought to clear its proxy material with the SEC. On March 25 the SEC staff advised that the material would not be cleared unless Industries filed an application for approval of the acquisition of General Time stock by Fund and Industries under Rule 17d-l, which we reproduce in relevant part in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Industries filed such an application, with appropriate disclaimers of the need for doing so; a hearing was set for April 16; and the proxy material was cleared.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">General Time then started a new action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming the proxy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>material was false and misleading in violation of \u00a7 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Judge Tyler denied a preliminary injunction on April 11. On the next day Chestnutt was asked whether he would consider an offer for Fund\u2019s holdings in General Time from Del Coleman, president of Seeburg Corporation having its headquarters in Illinois. He countered by saying that he would be \u201cdown in front of the SEC testifying on the General Time situation next week, probably Tuesday\u201d and might have to reveal anything that was said. Coleman first drew back but then asked whether Chestnutt would entertain a cash offer of $40 a share. Chestnutt replied that he would have to compare this with what anyone else might offer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(a) No affiliated person of or principal underwriter for any registered investment company (other than a company of the character described in Section 12(d) (3) (A) and (B) of the Act) and no affiliated person of such a person or principal underwriter, acting as principal, shall participate in, or effect any transaction in connection \u25a0with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which any such registered company, or a company controlled by such registered company, is a participant, and which is entered into, adopted or modified subsequent to the effective date of this rule, unless an application regarding such joint enterprise, arrangement or profit-sharing plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted by an order entered prior to the submission of such plan or modification to security holders for approval, or prior to such adoption or modification if not so submitted, except that the provisions of this rule shall not preclude any affiliated person from acting as manager of any underwriting syndicate or other group in which such registered or controlled company is a participant and receiving compensation therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">(b) In passing upon such application, the Commission will consider whether the participation of such registered or controlled company in such joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">(c) \u201cJoint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan\u201d as used in this rule shall mean any written or oral plan, contract, authorization or arrangement, or any practice or understanding whereby a registered investment company or a controlled company thereof and any affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for such registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person or principal underwriter, have a joint or a joint and several participation or share in the profits of such enterprise or undertaking, but shall not include an investment advisory contract subject to Section 15 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>April 13 saw the announcement of a plan to merge General Time and Seeburg Corporation, \u201ccontingent upon the continuation of General Time\u2019s present management.\u201d The details appeared on April 15. Chestnutt found the terms \u201cshockingly unattractive\u201d; he thought <em>they </em>would <em>work out at not more than </em>$28 per share of General Time as against a current market of $35. This, according to Chestnutt, was what made him decide to vote Fund\u2019s shares for the Committee\u2019s nominees and against the management.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The SEC hearings were held April 16, 17, and 18, oral argument was had before the Commission on April 19, and the Commission issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order that afternoon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concluding that Industries and Fund had entered into and carried out a joint arrangement under \u00a7 17(d), that application for approval should have been made under Rule 17d-l, and that there was \u201cno warrant for granting retroactive approval of the transactions effected in such violation,\u201d the Commission denied the application. It made no direction beyond an assertion in a footnote of its \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction * * * over any future transfers by Industries of the GTC stock it has acquired. <em>* </em>* *\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-y\">On April 22, after a further unsuccessful attempt by General Time to secure an injunction from Judge Tyler, the stockholders met, the ballots were cast, and the meeting was adjourned to May 3 so that the inspectors could count the votes and certify the result. Preliminary reports indicate a victory for Industries\u2019 slate, although by a margin considerably less than the shares voted by Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">On May 1, the SEC began this action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Asserting violation of \u00a7 17(d) and Rule 17d \u2014 1 by Industries and Fund, the complaint <em>sought </em>temporary and permanent relief enjoining further acquisition of General Time stock, requiring Industries and Fund to withdraw any votes cast at the stockholders\u2019 meeting, enjoining the voting of such shares for nominees proposed by Industries or for any merger with Industries, and enjoining future violations by Industries and Fund. The parties agreed that the court should order the trial to be advanced and consolidated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction, see F.R.Civ.P. 65(a) (2). After trial Judge Wyatt delivered an opinion directing dismissal of the complaint, this appeal followed, and we have given it expedited treatment. Meanwhile the stockholders\u2019 meeting of General Time has been adjourned at first by stipulation and later by a stay issued by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The first issue is whether the SEC may lawfully conclude that when an affiliated person and a registered investment company engage in a plan to achieve together a substantial stock position in another company, they can have effected \u201cany transaction in which such registered company * * * is a joint or a joint and several participant\u201d with the affiliate even though there is no legally binding agreement between them; we postpone the related issue whether if that proposition be affirmed, the facts here sufficiently disclose such a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Little purpose would be achieved by tired-eye scrutiny of the word \u201ctransaction.\u201d This is not a technical term; \u201ctransact\u201d means \u201cTo prosecute negotiations; to carry on business; to have dealings * * Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed.) 2688. If any investment company and an affiliate agreed that each would buy 20% of the stock of a third company and would not sell without the other\u2019s consent, the case would evidently come within \u00a7 17(d), and it would be altogether immaterial whether \u201ctransaction\u201d was read to refer to each purchase or the entire course of dealing or both. The real issue concerns the phrase \u201cis a joint or a joint and several participant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> We begin by conceding that, on a quick reading, such black-letter words call up an image of situations where there is a considerable degree of common understanding. Industries argues, in a conspicuously able brief, that this conclusion is reinforced by \u00a7 12(a) (2) which forbids any registered investment company, in contravention of Commission rules, regulations or orders, \u201cto participate on a joint or a joint and several basis in any trading account in securities * * this rather obviously contemplating a situation where definite legal obligations are fixed. Against this, however, \u00a7 17(d) must have been intended to reach situations not already covered by \u00a7 12(a). Furthermore any idea that \u00a7 17(d) is limited to the typical joint venture in which each of the parties has a fractional share is negated, by the point that its very bite is to limit or prevent participation by the investment company \u201con a basis different from or less advantageous than that\u201d of the affiliated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">We find it hard to believe that a Congress which had declared \u201cthat the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected * * * when investment companies are organized, operated, managed, or their portfolio securities are selected, in the interest of directors, officers, investment advisers, depositors, or other affiliated persons thereof * * * rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies\u2019 security holders,\u201d \u00a7 1(b) (2), meant \u201ca joint or a joint and several participant\u201d to be read in light of common law concepts of jointness. The need for a liberal construction in order to effectuate the statutory purpose would be clearer if, for example, Industries had been an affiliate because of its holding of 5% or more of the voting securities of Fund, \u00a7 2(a) (3) (A), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>rather than the reverse. Yet if \u201cjoint\u201d embraces a loose kind of combination in cases of the former type where the case for a liberal construction is strong, as held by Judge Nordbye with respect to directors in SEC v. Midwest Technical Development Corp., CCH Fed.Sec.L. Reptr. ,jf 91,252 (D.Minn.1963), it must also do that here where the case is less so<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 and this even though the strict letter of the statutory command is limited to the affiliate. Moreover, Congress could have thought that downstream affiliation also involved some danger that the investment company\u2019s stockholders might be put upon for the benefit of other stockholders of the affiliate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cJoint\u201d can mean not only \u201cjoined\u201d or \u201cunited\u201d but \u201ccombined.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed.) 1339. The case is thus appropriate for application of the settled principle that when administration of a statute has been confided to a regulatory agency and a statutory term is reasonably capable of the interpretation the agency has given, a court will sustain this even though it might have reached a different conclusion if the issue had arisen otherwise. Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 411-413, 62 S.Ct. 326, 86 L.Ed. 301 <em>(1941); </em>NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 130-132, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944); CIR v. Pepsi-Cola Niagara Bottling Corp., 399 F.2d 390 (2 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Even on that view, however, some element of \u201ccombination\u201d is required. Industries forcefully contends this to be negated, particularly by Chestnutt\u2019s statement to Talley before Fund had even decided to make purchases of General Time. But here Industries encounters the Commission\u2019s decision to the contrary. Passing for the moment the question of the validity of the portion of Rule 17d-l authorizing the hearing conducted by the SEC, we cannot subscribe to Industries\u2019 argument that in any event the administrative proceeding was \u201cwithout legal significance,\u201d so that, as in SEC v. Frank, 388 F.2d 486, 491 (2 Cir. 1968), the Commission was cast in the district court in the same role as a private litigant as regards factual issues. To be sure the case is not here on a petition to review the SEC\u2019s order denying Industries' application for retrospective approval, and the provision of \u00a7 43 (a) making its findings conclusive if supported by substantial evidence thus is not applicable by its terms. But the principle underlying that rule \u2014 that a factual determination by an agency responsible for the execution of Congressional policy and vested with expertise shall not be disturbed by a court where there is substantial evidence to support it \u2014 applies none the less, and it would be little short of absurd for us to decline to follow the same standard by which a court reviewing the Commission\u2019s order would be bound. Cf. SEC v. CentralIllinois Securities Corp., 338 U.S. 96, 113-127, 69 S.Ct. 1377, 93 L.Ed. 1836 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Our summary of the facts shows there was substantial evidence here. While no one has cast doubt on the veracity of Chestnutt\u2019s testimony as to his initial conversation with Talley, this did not preclude the Commission\u2019s draw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ing a contrary inference of intention from what the parties actually did. Indeed developments may well have brought Industries and Fund into a \u201ccombination\u201d not clearly envisioned by either at the outset; war and the threat of war have always been powerful forgers of alliances. The Commission was justified in using its knowledge of the unspoken customs of the business world to conclude that, after Chestnutt had seen Industries spend over $8,300,000 in acquiring the 205,837 shares purchased in the special offer and on February 21 and 23, he was no longer a completely free agent as to the 210,000 shares Fund had purchased, on Talley\u2019s recommendation, for about 70% of that price. Experienced business men must have known at the outset that such a situation might arise. \u201cAn administrative agency with power after hearings to determine on the evidence in adversary proceedings whether violations of statutory commands have occurred may infer within the limits of the inquiry from the proven facts such conclusions as reasonably may be based upon the facts proven. One of the purposes which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statute made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the complexities of the subject which is entrusted to their administration.\u201d Republic Aviation v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 800, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The other serious issue of construction is whether, in seeking to implement \u00a7 17(d) by a general requirement of advance application and approval, Rule 17d-l exceeds the authority granted by Congress. Industries contends that the power conferred by \u00a7 17(d) was to prescribe <em>substantive </em>rules and regulations \u201cfor the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by such registered or controlled company on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participant\u201d; that the Commission has prescribed none but rather has unlawfully insisted on advance application and approval in every case; that the transaction thus must be deemed lawful since no valid rule or regulation prohibited it; or, at the very least, that it should be upheld because Industries did not acquire General Time stock \u201con a basis different from or less advantageous than that of\u201d Fund. The issue must be considered in light of the general power conferred on the SEC by \u00a7 38(a) \u201cto make, issue, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations and such orders as are necessary or appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Commission elsewhere in this subchapter * * <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Here again, while initial reaction may favor Industries\u2019 contention, reflection sustains the Commission\u2019s view. The varieties in which participation by an investment company may be \u201cdifferent from or less advantageous than that\u201d of an affiliate are infinite. The Commission could well have concluded that an attempt to specify these might fail to accomplish the Congressional purpose in some instances and in others accomplish more than Congress desired, and that the only effective method of regulation was to require advance disclosure and individual decision, at least until a pattern emerged, cf. note 7. Furthermore, as the Commission points out in brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the public notice and opportunity for interested persons to come forward provided by the application procedure may lead to the development of significant facts that would not otherwise have been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Industries mounts a counter-argument based on legislative history. It tells us that the Senate version of what became the Investment Company Act, S. 3580, 76th Cong.3d Sess. (1940), included as \u00a7 17(a) (4) a flat prohibition against affiliated persons' effecting transactions in which an investment company was a joint or a joint and several participant; relief would have been obtainable, as is now the case with respect to \u00a7 17(a) (1), (2) and (3), by application for an exemption under \u00a7 17(b). The change to the final version in which such transactions are condemned only insofar as they violate a particular standard, to be further specified in rules issued by the SEC, thus contra-indicates an intention that the Commission may require advance application and approval in all instances. While this is a possible inference, it is equally likely that Congress meant only that such transactions should be governed only by the standard limned in \u00a7 17(d) rather than the much more general ones of \u00a7 17(b). We thus do not find the legislative history so compelling as to warrant a conclusion that Congress meant to deny the SEC power to utilize a method of regulation it had successfully used in other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Our reversal of the judgment dismissing the complaint does not imply any belief on our part that the SEC is entitled to the drastic relief sought. Cf. SEC v. Midwest Technical Development Corp., supra, at p. 94, 154. This action is not one for enforcement of an order making such directions, where weight must be given to the agency\u2019s selection of remedy. It is a suit in equity, whose essence lies in \u201cthe power of the Chancellor to do equity and mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case.\u201d Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 592, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The objective of \u00a7 17(d) of the Investment Company Act is to prevent affiliated persons from injuring the interests of stockholders of registered investment companies by causing the company to participate \u201con a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participant.\u201d On the face of things that has not happened here up to this time, and the objective for a court of equity must be to insure that it does not happen in the future. While we do not undertake to particularize the form of a decree, a prohibition against sale of its shares by Industries without according Fund a fair opportunity to participate would be one obvious device to that end. On the other hand, as at present advised, we fail to perceive how the interest of Fund\u2019s stockholders would be advanced by such provisions as requiring Industries and Fund to withdraw votes cast at the April 22 stockholders\u2019 meeting of General Time and enjoining further voting by them. Requirements of that sort would have a strong tendency to induce forced liquidation at least on the part of Industries, which surely did not make its large investment in order to be a voteless minority stockholder in General Time, and this might well be detrimental rather than advantageous to the stockholders of Fund. Whether or not General Time had sufficient standing to direct judicial attention to the violation of \u00a7 17(d), an issue on which we have no occasion to pass, protection of the interests of its management in retention in office is not an objective of that section. While an order going beyond what would otherwise be the necessities of the case may sometimes be justified as against a deliberate flouter of regulatory statutes, Industries and Fund cannot be so regarded. Section 17(d) had been rarely construed, the only reported cases cited to us in addition to SEC v. Midwest Technical Development Corp., supra, being one portion of a decision of the Commission under the Securities Exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Act, Imperial Financial Services, Inc., Securities Act Release No. 7684 at 8-10 (1965), and a portion of a very recent case dealing primarily with \u00a7 17(a), Fifth Ave. Coach Lines, Inc. Investment Company Act Release No. 5214, December 27, 1967. No decided case had ever applied \u00a7 17(d) to a situation like that here, and conscientious counsel could well have believed the reservations Chestnutt stated were sufficient to make it inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The judgment dismissing the complaint is reversed, with directions to the District Court to proceed promptly to formulate an injunction consistent with this opinion. The stay of the reconvening of the annual meeting of General Time will remain in effect until such injunction is issued.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">. Rule 174-1.

Chestnutt also testified that a representative of Seeburg said, \u201cYou just name a price between 35 and 50 and we will talk business.\u201d Chestnutt named no price because he didn\u2019t feel \u201cin a position to make such an offer without talking to counsel.\u201d Counsel advised that a sale at a premium might present a problem under Perlman v. Feldmann, 219 F.2d 173, 50 A.L.R.2d 1134 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 952, 75 S.Ct. 880, 99 L.Ed. 1277 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">. The opinion of the district judge states the facts as to an April 3 letter written to the Commission by the junior Senator from Illinois on stationery of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency of which he is a member, avowedly at the instance of General Time, \u201can important factor in the economy of Illinois and other States, as well as a producer of essential military and other items.\u201d While we do not suppose this letter had the slightest effect, it was unnecessary, to say the least. Senators and Representatives who are importuned by constituents to engage in such epistolary efforts might do well to keep at hand Senator George Norris\u2019 classic letter of declination, quoted in Landis, The Administrative Process, 101-04 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-15\">.

We thus find it unnecessary to discuss the issue, much debated by the parties, whether the SEC went beyond the statute when it added the words in Rule 17d-1(a), \u201cin connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan. * * * \u201d In defining these terms subdivision (c) requires that the affiliate and the investment company \u201chave a joint or a joint and several participation\u201d or \u2014 not here contended\u2014 \u201cshare in the profits of such enterprise or undertaking.\u201d Hence, as to this ease the critical question under the Rule is the same as under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b451-5\">. SEO v. Sterling Precision Corporation, supra, 2 Cir., 393 F.2d 214, does not support the view that the same language can be read one way in the case of upstream and another way in the case of downstream affiliation. We there declined to expand the word \u201cpurchase\u201d in \u00a7 17(a) (2) to include a redemption by a downstream affiliate of its securities held by the investment company when a \u201csale\u201d to the investment company of securities of the investment company held by an affiliate, whether downstream or upstream, admitted by the SEC to include a redemption, bad been expressly excluded by Congress in \u00a7 17(a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">.

Industries makes a point of the Commission\u2019s current effort to have Congress amend \u00a7 38(a) to conform its language to that, e. g., in \u00a7 20(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which empowers the SEC \u201cto make, issue, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations and such orders as it may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter * * See Report of the SEO on the Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth, 89th Cong.2d Sess., H.R.Rep. 2337, p. 343 (1966). We find it difficult to discern any truly significant difference; the Commission\u2019s purpose seems to have been to still arguments spawned by slight variations in the language of the acts it administers rather than to achieve power theretofore denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
