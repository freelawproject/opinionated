The juice is maintained in a state of continuous agitation, while subject to freezing temperatures, to convert it into a pumpable slurry with ice crystals \u201cless than about Vs2 inch in the greatest dimension\u201d from which the first concentrate is separated. A second concentrate is then formed by washing the ice crystals \u201cat a temperature below the freezing point\u201d with sufficient \u201caqueous liquid at a temperature above the freezing point\u201d, with such concentrate having \u201ca Brix value closely approaching the Brix value of the first concentrate.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s expert (Dr. Redd) testified that several prior and one co-pending patent disclosed basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>parts of the process described in Claims 4-8 of the Cole patent and that the process which it described would have been obvious to a man skilled in the field of juice concentration on or before the date when the application for the Cole patent was filed. Dr. Redd gave specific reasons, with references to prior patents, why he disagreed with appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Tressler, on this point. In the District Court\u2019s findings, it adopted at least some of the views of Dr. Redd. Also, it explicitly rejected the views of appellant\u2019s expert. After a review of the record, we are unable to conclude that the District Court committed clear error in its findings as grounded in its reliance upon appellee\u2019s qualified expert<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and other evidence in the record. See Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U.S. 271, 274, 275, 69 S.Ct. 535, 537, 93 L.Ed. 672 (1949), rehearing 339 U.S. 605, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950), a patent case, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cRule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part: \u2018Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 To no type of case is this last clause more appropriately applicable than to the one before us, where the evidence is largely the testimony of experts as to which a trial court may be enlightened by scientific demonstrations. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cThe rule requires that an appellate court make allowances for the advantages possessed by the trial court in appraising the significance of conflicting testimony and reverse only \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 findings.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">The District Court\u2019s opinion shows that it followed this language used in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 693, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background, the obviousness or non-obviousness of the subject matter is determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">See, also, Gould-National Batteries, Inc. v. Gulton Industries, Inc., 361 F.2d 912, 915 (3rd Cir. 1966), where this court held that a \u201cclaim * * * comprised of an aggregation of elements which the court below found were old and well known in the art * * * is invalid for its failure to meet the test of \u00a7 103\u201d; cf. Allen-Bradley Company v. Air Reduction Company, 391 F.2d 282 (3rd Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The order of the District Court dated October 5,1967, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">. 35 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 103 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">\u201cA patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-13\">. In a pre-trial stipulation, it was agreed that rulings on Claims 4-8 of this patent would be dispositive of the issues of validity and infringement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b656-14\">. The quoted words are those which appellant claims are not in the prior art (p. 15 of brief and chart at argument). Brix value is a practical indication of the sugar present in the juice, and maximizing the Brix value or sugar through reclaiming it from the ice was one of the goals of the processes covered by the Cole and prior art patents. The District Court opinion gives a more complete description of this patent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-17\">\u201cThe Cole invention, as described in Claim 4, contemplates the initial freezing of the beverage liquid to form a pumpable slurry in the manner disclosed in the co-pending Walker application. From this slurry two concentrates are formed in the following manner: The slurry is continuously fed to a centrifuge where the slurry is centrifuged to separate the ice crystals from the liquid constituent of the slurry and thus produce a spun off or first concentrate. The remaining ice crystals, while still under centrifugal conditions are then subjected to a single washing with an aqueous liquid. The aqueous liquid has a substantially lower Brix value than the first concentrate. The ice crystals are washed at a temperature below freezing and the aqueous liquid with which they are washed is at a temperature above freezing. The quantity of aqueous liquid used is so proportioned as to provide the second concentrate with a Brix value closely approximating the Brix value of the first concentrate, and the ice residue which remains after the washing has substantially no Brix value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-18\">\u201cClaim 5 of Cole limits the process described in Claim 4 to orange juice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-12\">. In R. M. Palmer Company v. Luden\u2019s, Inc., 236 F.2d 496, 498 (3rd Cir. 1956), Judge Kalodner\u2019s able opinion emphasized that appellants had not shown the District Court\u2019s findings were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in applying 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 to design patents (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 171). The District Court opinion makes clear that it was fully aware of the \u201csecondary considerations\u201d relevant to the application of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. After quoting the Supreme Court\u2019s language concerning such considerations, Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1963), the District Court found appellants\u2019 \u201cSperti\u201d patent (of 1952, not involved in this appeal) valid on grounds that included \u201cfailure of others\u201d and \u201clong felt need\u201d. In addition, that part of the decision showed how such considerations prevented appellee from meeting its \u201cheavy burden\u201d as to the obviousness' of the Sperti patent which formed part of the prior art when the Cole patent application was filed in August 1957.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b657-15\">. It is noted that in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 25, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966), the court recently relied heavily on expert testimony in a case applying 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b657-10\">KALODNER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Acqa\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">I would reverse the Judgment of the District Court insofar as it holds the</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">399 F.2d \u2014 39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Cole Patent (U. S. Patent No. 2,967,778) invalid \u201cfor obviousness\u201d under Section 103 (35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103) and dismisses the Complaint with respect to said Patent on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In my opinion the District Court erred (1) in holding the Cole process \u201cobvious\u201d in light of the prior art; (2) in failing in the instant case, to take cognizance of the \u201csecondary considerations\u201d of \u201ccommercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc.,\u201d which \u201cmay have relevancy\u201d as \u201cindicia of obviousness or nonobviousness\u201d under the doctrine of Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); and (3) in holding that the defendant \u201cmet the heavy burden of persuasion required of it to establish that the Cole patent is invalid for obviousness under Section 103\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In the instant case, the District Court failed to apply the teaching of our recent opinions in Frank W. Egan Co. v. Modern Plastic Machinery Corp., 387 F.2d 319 (3 Cir. 1968), cert. den. 391 U.S. 966, 88 S.Ct. 2036, 20 L.Ed.2d 879 (June 3, 1968), and Jones Knitting Corporation v. Morgan, 361 F.2d 451 (3 Cir. 1966) with respect to giving effect to the \u201csecondary considerations\u201d, spelled out above, and to the quality and quantum of proof necessary to rebut the presumption of validity of a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The majority here mistakenly applied the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule with respect to the District Court\u2019s factfinding as to the \u201cobviousness\u201d of the Cole Patent. The District Court\u2019s opinion clearly indicates that its finding of \u201cobviousness\u201d is premised on several patents and publications and not on oral testimony. That being so, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule is inapplicable here. Borden Company v. Clearfield Cheese Co., 369 F.2d 96, 101 (3 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The weight of the evidence establishes that Cole invented and taught a process of producing a citrus juice concentrate which was not obvious in the light of the prior art; that the Cole Patent is novel and has utility and represents a significant advance in the field, as demonstrated by the secondary considerations of its \u201ccommercial success\u201d; solution of \u201clong felt but unsolved needs\u201d, and \u201cfailure of others\u201d to achieve its results.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
