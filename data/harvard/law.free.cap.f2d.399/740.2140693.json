A jury verdict resulted in Bennett\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b); he was acquitted of all counts in which he was alleged to have acted with his eodefendant, Don C. Silver-thorne. Five errors are asserted by Bennett in this appeal, four of which we do not discuss. We shall devote our attention to the proposition that \u00a7 2113(b) makes unlawful only a trespassory taking of the bank\u2019s property, not a taking by some other means, and whether the evidence shows a taking within the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-20\">Jurisdiction in the district court rested on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and rests here on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-21\">That portion of \u00a7 2113(b) with which we deal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-22\">\u201cWhoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin, any property or money or any other thing of value exceeding $100 belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management or possession of any bank * * * shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>In LeMasters v. United States, 378 F.2d 262 (9 Cir. 1967) (decided by this court after the instant case was tried in the district court), we entertained the issue now before us. There, the appellant had impersonated a bank depositor by producing stolen identification papers. He persuaded bank officials that his deposit book had been lost and a new book, in the name of the impersonated depositor, was issued LeMas-ters. He withdrew funds from the account for which he had been issued the deposit book and was thereafter indicted for the theft of those funds under \u00a7 2113(b). This court held that the language of the statute, \u201ctakes and carries away, with the intent to steal or purloin,\u201d was descriptive of common law larceny and was not descriptive of obtaining money by false pretenses. We therein discussed English law and congressional history, including the fact that in 1934 Congress passed a law making bank robberies a federal crime (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)), but refused to pass a law against the obtaining of money by false pretenses. In 1937, Congress passed \u00a7 2113(b) containing the ambiguous words \u201csteal or purloin,\u201d for the purpose of including larceny. We held that \u00a7 2113 (b) encompassed only the offense of larceny. The question before us in the instant case then, is whether the evidence shows common law larceny, within the statute, or an offense without the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Bennett\u2019s codefendant, Silverthorne, organized and opened the San Francisco National Bank in June, 1962, As president of the bank, Silverthorne embarked on a course of extensive money lending, for which service he personally assessed substantial fees, or \u201cpoints.\u201d Bennett first met Silverthorne when he came to the bank as a borrower. After considerable business dealings with Silverthorne, Bennett undertook to solicit borrowers for Silverthorne\u2019s bank. On many occasions the bank loaned money to individuals procured by Bennett. As remuneration for bringing business to the bank, Bennett received a portion of the \u201cpoints\u201d Silverthorne and/or Bennett charged for the loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The incident with which we are concerned took place after Silverthorne and Bennett had begun to work together. Atkinson, a rancher and land developer, went to Bennett in January, 1964, seeking a loan of $50,000. After meeting with Bennett on several occasions, Atkinson and his wife filled out application papers which Bennett submitted to Silverthorne for the purpose of obtaining a loan from the San Francisco National Bank. The Atkinsons discussed with Bennett the payment of \u201cpoints\u201d for the loan in the amount of 10 per cent of the principal thereof, but no firm figure was agreed upon prior to the confirmation of the loan. On January 22, 1964, Bennett informed Atkinson that he had obtained a loan from the San Francisco National Bank in the amount of $58,000, the $8,000 figure representing the \u201cpoints\u201d which were being charged. At this time Bennett told Atkinson that the \u201cpoint\u201d charge was higher than the 10 per cent figure they had previously discussed because \u201c[t]he bank was new and Mr. Silverthorne wanted the bank to show a profit, to look good in the eyes of the shareholders.\u201d Bennett told Atkinson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>further that he, Silverthorne, and one other individual controlled the bank. He instructed Atkinson to write a check for the points in the amount of $8,000 payable to the San Francisco National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The following day, Bennett took the check to the San Francisco National Bank and instructed a teller to issue a cashier\u2019s check payable to him in the amount of $8,000 in exchange for the Atkinson check. As it was not the bank\u2019s usual practice to issue a cashier\u2019s check in exchange for a third party check to other than the named payee, the teller, a Mrs. Wu, took the check to the head cashier, a Mrs. Richards, for her authorization of the transaction. Mrs. Richards gave her assent and a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $8,000 was typed, payable to \u201cW. S. Bennett,\u201d and delivered to Bennett. (Ex. 2(b).) The register copy of the cashier\u2019s check, kept by the bank, reflected that the original thereof was purchased by Bennett with a check drawn on the San Francisco National Bank. The purchasing check was not identified further. On January 28,1964, Bennett deposited the cashier\u2019s check into one of his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> Because of the peculiar facts of this transaction, the indictment was careful to avoid allegations that the money was in the \u201ccare\u201d, \u201ccustody\u201d, \u201ccontrol\u201d, \u201cmanagement\u201d, or \u201cpossession\u201d of the bank. It alleged rather, in the language of the statute, that the money \u201cbelonged to\u201d the bank. This allegation is, however, but descriptive of the bank\u2019s relation to the money. It is the statutory language, \u201csteal and purloin,\u201d which describes larceny as the offense allegedly committed. LeMasters v. United States, supra. To consummate the offense of larceny there must occur a taking of property which is trespassory in nature, \u201cwithout the consent of the owner.\u201d People v. Johnson, 136 Cal.App.2d 665, 673, 289 P.2d 90, 94 (1955); People v. Earle, 222 Cal.App.2d 476, 35 Cal.Rptr. 265 (1963); Callan v. Superior Court, 204 Cal.App.2d 652, 22 Cal.Rptr. 508 (1962); People v. Torres, 201 Cal.App.2d 290, 20 Cal.Rptr. 315 (1962); LeMasters v. United States, supra. Regardless of the criminal intent indulged in by Bennett, if any, there was not a taking of the $8,000 without the bank\u2019s consent. Assuming that the title to the $8,000 passed from Atkinson to the bank when the check was written and delivered to Bennett as an \u201cintermediary\u201d the money at that time \u201cbelonged to the bank.\u201d Bennett was given possession of the check, and the bank held title thereto. At this time it was not possible for Bennett to commit larceny against the bank for he had possession of the check which he had lawfully come by, that is, as agent of the bank for delivering possession of the check to the bank. An appropriation of the check by Bennett to his own use at this time would have constituted embezzlement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. But once Bennett delivered possession of the check to the bank, the bank had both title and possession of the $8,000. The only manner by which Bennett could have violated \u00a7 2113(b) at this juncture was to have obtained possession of (but not title to) the $8,000 <em>without </em>the bank\u2019s consent. But that consent was unequivocally given by Mrs. Richards. Both possession and title to the money were passed to Bennett by means of the cashier\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Had the $8,000 fee been due and owing the bank from the inception of the loan agreement between Atkinson and the bank, we would have, under these facts, a theft by false pretense, for then Bennett would have obtained both title and possession of the money from the bank by not representing to the cashiers the true nature of the $8,000 check from Atkinson. But the points charged by Silverthorne and Bennett for loans extended by the bank were not charges for the bank\u2019s services; the bank received its compensation through interest on the loans. The points were personal remuneration to Bennett and/or Silverthorne for having caused the bank to extend the loans. Neither in this court nor in the court below has the government asserted that this practice is illegal. The true nature of the $8,000 in points paid by Atkinson was a fee to Bennett and/or Silver-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>thorne, albeit the money belonged to the bank once the check was written. If misrepresentations were made by Bennett at any time, they were made to Atkinson to conceal the true recipient of the fee which Atkinson was paying for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We conclude that the $8,000 was actually in the defendant Bennett\u2019s control and possession for at least five days; that this control and possession was obtained unlawfully; either through the cooperation of employees of the bank, or by acts of Bennett constituting the taking of property by false pretenses, but not \u201cby taking and carrying away with intent to steal or purloin,\u201d i. e., not by common law larceny, \u201ca trespassory taking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We come to this conclusion reluctantly, but feel we are required to so do (a) by the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), as carefully researched in <em>LeMasters, </em>supra; (b) by the specific holding in <em>LeMasters, </em>supra; (c) by the rules enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States specifically related to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. In <em>LeMasters, </em>supra, Judge Madden quoted Mr. Justice Douglas in Jerome v. United States, 318 U.S. 101 at 104, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\u201c \u2018Since there is no common law offense against the United States * * *, the administration of criminal justice under our federal system has rested with the states, except as criminal offenses have been explieity prescribed by Congress. We should be mindful of that tradition in determining the scope of federal statutes defining offenses which duplicate or build upon state law * * * That consideration [that the bar of double jeopardy is not applicable] gives additional weight to the view that where Congress is creating offenses which duplicate or build upon state law, courts should be reluctant to expand the defined offenses beyond the clear requirements of the terms of the statute.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Judge Madden in <em>LeMasters, </em>supra, said at page 268:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">\u201c[W]e see no reason, urgent or otherwise, why Congress in 1937 should have wanted to enter the field of obtaining by false pretenses, duplicating state law which was adequate and effectively enforced, and the duplication of which would bring innumerable cases, most of them small, within the jurisdiction of federal prosecutors and courts. Gongress was as aware in 1937 as it was in 1934, when it rejected the unambiguous provision making obtaining by false pretense from a bank of [sic] federal crime, that such an extension of federal law would serve no purpose except to confuse and dilute state responsibility for local crimes which were being adequately dealt with by state law. None of the reasons which persuaded the circuits and finally the Supreme Court to interpret broadly the word stolen in the motor vehicle act were present in 1937, when Congress wrote \u00a7 2113, or are present today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Our finding that no violation of federal law occurred under the foregoing facts requires that the judgment of conviction be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-11\">. Count II of said indictment reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\">&lt;&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-13\">\u201c1. The Grand Jury realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs one and two of Count One of this Indictment as though fully set out herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-14\">\u201c2. On or about January 22, 1964 in the City and County of San Francisco, State and Northern District of California, the defendant WILLIAM S. BENNETT, did take and carry away with intent to steal and purloin from the San Francisco National Bank, certain money aggregating $8,000 belonging to the bank, accomplished as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-24\">\u201cOn or about January 23, 1964, one William R. Atkinson applied to the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>for a loan in the amount of $50,000 and the defendant BENNETT acted as an intermediary between the said Atkinson and the said SILVERTHORNE. In such capacity, the defendant BENNETT advised the said Atkinson that there would be a loan fee or point charge of $8000. In payment of said charge the said Atkinson executed and delivered to defendant BENNETT a check payable to the San Francisco National Bank in the amount of $8000 dated January 22, 1964. The defendant BENNETT thereafter unlawfully cashed the above cheek in exchange for a cashier\u2019s check on January 23, 1964 in the amount of $8000. The said defendant BENNETT thereafter on January 27, 1964 deposited the proceeds of said cashier\u2019s check into his personal account under the name of Suisun Properties from which he later withdrew the said sum and converted it to his own use and the bank lost custody and control thereof.\u2019\u2019 (C.T. 8.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
