Again appellants overlook that really the only issue on appeal is the compliance vel non with the District Court\u2019s order of September 14, 1966, and, having found a failure of compliance on the part of appellants, the District Court\u2019s judgment of dismissal was affirmed with directions that the order be entered without prejudice as set out in our Per Curiam of June 28, 1968. This Court will not modify its previous ruling despite any Florida law claimed by appellants which may or may not bar a subsequent cause of action in any future suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-20\">It is therefore ordered that appellants Petition for Rehearing and alternative Motion for Modification and Clarification of our June 28, 1968 Per Curiam are denied, and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing En Bane, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
