A jury trial resulted in a verdict for the defendant, Humble Oil and Refining Company, and plaintiff, Mrs. Smith, contends that the court erred in refusing to charge the jury with respect to certain South Carolina statutes which she contends are relevant in determining the question of negligence. Upon consideration of the record, including a street plat and photographs of the intersection filed as exhibits, and the statutes in question, we conclude that the court\u2019s refusal to charge with respect to these statutes was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Bull Street runs north and south and is intersected from the west by Elm-wood. Elmwood terminates at Bull Street and does not continue through the intersection. However, across Bull Street from Elmwood are the entrance and exit driveways to and from the South Carolina State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Por some distance west of the intersection Elmwood Avenue is seven lanes wide. Separating eastbound from westbound traffic lanes is a dividing strip of concrete construction extending above the street surface. This strip does not run continuously in the center of Elmwood the full length of the block, but at a point some little distance from Bull Street it is positioned to the left in such a fashion as to create an additional traffic lane for the use of eastbound motorists desiring to make a left turn to the north into Bull Street. Thus, Elm-wood at its terminus at Bull Street has four lanes for eastbound and three lanes for westbound traffic. Bull Street, also with a raised center concrete strip, is a two-way street with two lanes for traffic in each direction at the area of its intersection with Elmwood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Traffic at the intersection, including that entering and leaving the hospital grounds, is controlled by electric signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">The accident occurred in or near the center of the Bull-Elmwood intersection. During the afternoon rush hour Mrs. Smith, the plaintiff, was proceeding east on Elmwood and, as she wished to turn left onto Bull, had entered the off-set lane farthest to her left and closest to the Elmwood concrete strip as she approached the intersection. However, obeying the traffic signal, she brought her car to a stop at the stop line on Elmwood. While she was waiting for the light to change, defendant\u2019s vehicle, a large tractor-trailer tank truck operated by a company driver, stopped beside her in the lane immediately to her right, i. e., the second lane from the concrete strip. The truck driver, McPheeters, like Mrs. Smith, intended to make a left turn into Bull Street, and, when the sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>nal light changed, both vehicles began their left turns into the intersection, proceeding approximately abreast of one another.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As they were doing so, according to the testimony of Humble\u2019s driver, a third vehicle came out of the hospital drive and made such a wide turn to the left to head south on Bull Street that it entered the path of the approaching tanker. McPheeters further testified that, in an effort to avoid a collision with the third vehicle, he turned his truck more sharply to the left and in so doing collided with plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Since a basis for Mrs. Smith\u2019s claim was the alleged negligence of defendant\u2019s driver in not approaching the intersection in the proper lane for a left turn, and as Humble interposed the defense of sudden emergency, the plaintiff requested the court to charge the jury concerning certain South Carolina statutes prescribing the proper position of vehicles and method of making left turns at intersections. These statutes are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court declined to include all the requested statutory provisions. However, it did include an abbreviated version of \u00a7 46-405, instructing the jury that, \u201cSection 46-405, of the code of this state, provides in connection with turning movements of automobiles: \u2018No person shall turn a vehicle at an intersection unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable safety.\u2019 Any violation of that would be negligence per se.\u201d Following the adverse jury verdict plaintiff unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on several grounds, but the only point here urged as ground for reversal is the court\u2019s refusal to include in its charge all the code sections as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Mrs. Smith\u2019s contention that these sections are applicable to turns at this intersection and hence relevant to the issue of negligence appears to be based on two assumptions: (1) that her lane, and not McPheeters\u2019, is the lane designated for left turns by \u00a7 46-402(2), and (2) that a turn in some manner different from that prescribed in \u00a7 46-402(2) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>neither permitted nor required by any marker or other device pursuant to \u00a7 46-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The trial transcript discloses that there was an extended discussion between court and counsel concerning the relevancy of the statutes in these circumstances. The court apparently recognized that the junction of Bull and Elmwood constitutes an intersection within the meaning of the South Carolina statutory definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the court concluded that, of the statutes in question, only a portion of \u00a7 46-405 was pertinent since both Elmwood and Bull were public streets and the fact that Elmwood\u2019s four lanes for eastbound traffic came to a \u201cdead-end\u201d at Bull created a situation where left turns must be permitted from both Mrs. Smith\u2019s lane and the lane next to it on the right. There was testimony to show that it was the common practice among motorists to make a left turn from either of the two lanes. Humble urges that an interpretation of \u00a7 46-402(2) which would require that left turns be made exclusively from Mrs. Smith\u2019s lane would, in effect, render useless the middle two of Elmwood\u2019s four eastbound traffic lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The lane as described above being used by the plaintiff was obviously provided by local authorities as an <em>additional </em>lane for the use of motorists desiring to turn left from Elmwood at the intersection. But we find nothing in the cited statutory provisions or the evidence requiring that left turns be made from that lane <em>only. </em>There is no evidence of anything in the nature of markers, buttons or signs which would prohibit a left turn from the defendant\u2019s lane. If the court had charged the jury with respect to \u00a7 46-402(2) it would have been under a duty to tell the jury that the defendant\u2019s truck, in approaching the intersection for a left turn, was actually in that portion of the <em>right half </em>of Elmwood nearest the <em>center line </em>thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We conclude that the portion of \u00a7 46-405 which the, court included in its charge was not misleading and that the court did not err in refusing to charge with respect to the other statutory provisions as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-14\">. At either side of the Elmwood intersection Bull Street also has an off-set lane for traffic making left turns into Elmwood or into the hospital driveway. These off-sets are not involved here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-5\">. According to the truck driver\u2019s testimony he had deliberately chosen the second lane since, in his view, the radius of a left turn made from the leftmost lane was such that the rear end of a vehicle the length of his truck would cut across the end of the raised concrete strip; also, that by using the second lane he permitted faster traffic in Mrs. Smith\u2019s lane to pass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">.
