His defense was that he did not know that the notes were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Appellant complains that he was not granted a continuance so that certain witnesses might be located and subpoenaed. The court\u2019s denial of the motion for continuance was without prejudice to its renewal. Indeed, the court indicated to counsel its willingness/ to grant a renewal of the motion the following morning if counsel indicated that his efforts to locate the witnesses were unsuccessful. There was .Ao renewal of the motion and counsel made not attempt to subpoena these witnesses. Counsel quite apparently decided against attempting to call the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Appellant asserts that failure to renew the motion deprived him of adequate representation by counsel. Upon this record no sufficient showing is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
