The government concedes that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct of the cross examination of appellant, who was the sole witness for the defense, was improper but argues that the error was not prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-20\">On direct examination appellant testified that he was unarmed and only seeking a job when he entered the construction site office trailer with Moran who thereupon drew a gun and took a $2000 payroll from the supervisor. He denied that he had any knowledge that Moran was armed and intended to rob, or that he assisted Moran in any way. Appellant said that his failure to stop Moran and his flight after the robbery was attributable to panic and fear of Moran. On cross examination he testified about the robbery and the interval before his arrest. The prosecutor then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-21\">Q. And how long were you away from the construction shack before you were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-22\">A. I don\u2019t know. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-23\">Q. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes. And during that period of time you were out of the presence of Mr. Moran, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-24\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Q. There was nothing to prevent you from going back to the construction shack and saying to Mr. Sutton or the police or anyone there, to tell them, \u201cLook, I had nothing to do with this robbery,\u201d was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">A. Well, when I ran, I ran down in the basement. I didn\u2019t know exactly where Moran was. And I stayed down in the basement, and I didn\u2019t come back. I didn\u2019t want to run into him again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Appellant denied that he had flushed money down a toilet in an empty bathroom where he was apprehended 10 or 15 minutes after he fled the robbery. Then the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Q. Now, if you had nothing to do with it, when you were turned over to Officers McCann and Stroman, when they apprehended you, why didn\u2019t you tell them, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">A. They wouldn\u2019t listen. When they approached me, he wouldn\u2019t listen. He just jumped right on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">Q. Didn\u2019t you try to tell them ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">Q. As a matter of fact, you wouldn\u2019t make any statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">Q. As a matter of fact, you didn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">Q. You didn\u2019t want to make any statement when you were asked by the police ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">A. <em>I didn\u2019t want to make any statement without the presence of the attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-16\">Q. <em>And that\u2019s the action of an innocent man who went looking for a fob.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-17\">MR. RAPOPORT: I object, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-18\">THE COURT: Wait just a moment. Don\u2019t argue with the witness, Mr. [Prosecutor].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-22\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Hon- or. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">Gillison went on to say that he met Moran for the first time in a bus station on the morning of the robbery and rode to the construction site trailer in Moran\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"AyZy\">At the conclusion of the cross examination, the defense rested and moved for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s remark was prejudicial error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the court stated outside the presence of the jury that defense objections to the remark had been sustained, it refused to instruct the jury to disregard the remark. Appellant was found guilty of one count of robbery and on June 30,1967, sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-25\">In Griffin v. State of California <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids prosecutor and court from commenting on an accused\u2019s failure to testify on his own behalf. The distance between that issue and the prosecutor\u2019s comments here about the accused\u2019s failure to make an exculpatory statement upon arrest is infinitesimal. Indeed, in Miranda v. State of Arizona, the Supreme Court recognized the applicability of <em>Griffin </em>to this situation, when, at footnote 37, the Court noted that \u201cin accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. <em>The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation. </em>Cf. Griffin v. State of California * * *; Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653] (1964) * * * [Emphasis added].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even where there is no interrogation and the accused merely remains silent, no weight whatever can be given to the accused's silence. We agree with the Second Circuit in United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>v. Mullings that \u201cit is well settled that an inference of guilt may not be drawn from a failure to speak or to explain when a person has been arrested.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The government concedes that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s remark was improper since it related to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the appellant, rather than to the credibility of the appellant\u2019s specific testimony. See e. g. Gr\u00fcnewald v. United States<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> * * *, Rafel [Raffel] v. United States<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> * * But we are told that under Chapman v. [State of] California<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cthe beneficiary of a constitutional error [must] prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d The government contends that it can carry this burden, because the prosecutor\u2019s questioning on cross examination concerning the reasons for appellant\u2019s silence was an isolated line of inquiry which terminated immediately after the court\u2019s admonition. The tainted inquiry, however, marked the entire cross examination which was directed primarily at appellant\u2019s activities <em>after </em>the robbery. Moreover, it is by no means clear that the jury was even aware that defense counsel\u2019s objection was sustained by the court. The trial judge merely admonished: \u201cWait just a moment. Don\u2019t argue with the witness, Mr. [Prosecutor].\u201d The court\u2019s subsequent remarks concerning this error were made outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Since we have no \u201cbelief that [the line of questioning] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellant must be afforded a new trial \u201cfree from the pressure of unconstitutional inferences.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-19\">.
