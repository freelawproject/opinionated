The counts are not identical since each count involved a different food.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United States v. Justin M. Schneider, Criminal No. 10170, E.D.Ky., December 31, 1959; United States v. Direct Sales Company, 252 F. 882 (W.D.N.Y.1918). See also United States v. Wiesenfeld Warehouse Co., 376 U.S. 86, 84 S.Ct. 559, 11 L.Ed.2d 536 (1964). Though duplicity was not at issue, the Supreme Court in Wiesenfeld reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of an information similar to the one here.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Also, the fact that the evidence supporting the alleged adulteration of the food named in each count was different for each food further precludes a holding that the four counts were actually the same. Bins v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 390; Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Appellant also maintains that the evidence was the product of an illegal entry and search. As to the entry, there is ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s agent had sufficient authority to permit it. See Golden Grain Macaroni Company, Inc. v. United States, 9 Cir. 1953, 209 F.2d 166, for a similar determination. Likewise, it is undisputed that the agent\u2019s consent to the search was given freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-25\">. Count one concerned whole wheat flour; Count two, white flour; Count three, wheat germ meal; Count four, soya flour.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
