J.</author>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">The juvenile court declared Marie R.\u2019s three children dependents of the court following a contested jurisdiction hearing, ordered the children removed from her custody and directed the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (Department) to provide reunification services including monitored visitation. Marie R. challenges the juvenile court\u2019s ruling permitting two of her children to testify in chambers outside her presence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>contends the court\u2019s jurisdictional findings are not supported by substantial evidence.  Marie R. also argues the court\u2019s visitation order, which specifies \u201cif the children refuse a visit, then they shall not be forced to have a visit,\u201d impermissibly delegates to her children the authority to determine whether any visits will occur. In the published portion of this opinion we reverse the visitation order, holding that, when the court orders visitation, it must also ensure that at least some visitation, at a minimum level determined by the court itself, will in fact occur. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we affirm the juvenile court\u2019s evidentiary ruling and its orders declaring the children dependents of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On April 24, 2002 the Department filed a petition in the juvenile court pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code, section 300<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on behalf of Marie R. \u2019s three children, S.H. (a 15-year-old girl) and S.H.\u2019s brothers A.L. (10 years old) and J.L. (8 years old). The petition alleged that Marie R.\u2019s husband and the children\u2019s stepfather, Michael R., physically abused all three children and sexually abused S.H. and that Marie R. knew of the danger and failed to protect the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition also alleged Marie R. failed to provide S.H. with necessary prescription eyeglasses. A first amended petition was filed May 21, 2002 to include additional allegations of physical abuse and sexual abuse by Michael R.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">a. <em>Evidence of Abuse and Failure to Protect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">At the jurisdiction hearing the court admitted as evidence, without objection, the detention and adjudication/disposition reports prepared by the Department. According to information in the reports, S.H. told a school nurse, a police officer and a social worker that Michael R. had punched her in eye and stabbed her in the hip with a pocketknife. S.H. explained Michael R. hit her almost daily and that Marie R. knew of Michael R.\u2019s physical abuse and told S. H. she deserved to be hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">According to S.H., Michael R. started sexually abusing her when she was 10 or 12 years old and the family was living in New Jersey. S.H. reported Michael R.\u2019s sexual abuse and testified against him at his criminal trial in New Jersey. According to S.H., Michael R. was convicted of sexual abuse and served two years in state prison for the offense. While in New Jersey, S.H. was removed from Marie R.\u2019s home and placed in foster care before returning to Marie R.\u2019s custody. When Michael R. was released from prison, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>he again lived with the family despite a court order prohibiting him from having any contact with S.H. Michael R.\u2019s sexual abuse of S.H. resumed. He touched S.H.\u2019s breasts, compelled her to get undressed by putting a knife against her throat and forced her to have sexual intercourse. The abuse continued after the family moved to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">S.H. stated Michael R. hit her with his fist while the family was at Venice Beach, forced her head under the water and told her, \u201cIf you want to die, die here.\u201d Marie R. never intervened when Michael R. physically abused S.H. or her brothers. Initially, A.L. and J.L. denied that Michael R. hit them. Later, J.L. explained that Michael R. did hit him with his fist and that Michael R. had threatened to hurt him if he told anyone. All three children reported that Michael R. tied them up with a rope as punishment and that Marie R. was present and did nothing. S.H. also stated that she wore prescription eyeglasses, that she lost the eyeglasses the previous year and Marie R. had not replaced them. The adjudication/disposition report notes that S.H. received an eye examination in April 22, 2002 for which the results were \u201cunremarkable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">b. <em>Motion to Permit S. H. and A. L. to Testify in Chambers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The Department did not present any live witnesses as part of its case-in-chief. When Marie R. sought to cross-examine the children regarding their statements in the Department\u2019s reports, counsel for S.H. and A.L. moved, over Marie R.\u2019 s objection, to allow them to testify in chambers, outside Marie R.\u2019s presence. In response to questioning from Marie R.\u2019s counsel and the court, both children stated they feared testifying in Marie R.\u2019s presence although they were not afraid of the courtroom. Both also testified Marie R.\u2019s presence would likely affect their ability to answer questions. The court permitted S.H. and A.L. to testify in chambers, subject to cross-examination from Marie R.\u2019s counsel, while Marie R. remained in the courtroom and contemporaneously listened to and observed the proceedings via closed-circuit television.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">c. <em>Cross-Examination of the Children</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">During cross-examination S.H. repeated her allegations of physical and sexual abuse by Michael R. S.H. explained the first time Michael R. molested her she was 10 years old and Marie R. was not home. Michael R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>touched her breasts and her vagina and refused to stop even though she tried to push him away. When she finally broke free of his grasp, S.H. ran downstairs and told her cousin of the incident. According to S.H., the police were called; and Michael R. was sent to prison for two years. Marie R. did not believe S.H. when she accused Michael R. of molesting her. After he was released from prison, Marie R. allowed Michael R. to visit them and ultimately to move in with them. Michael R. forced S.H. to have sexual intercourse at least four times. S.H. did not tell Marie R. about any of these incidents because she knew Marie R. would not believe her. She did tell her cousin. She also testified that Marie R. had grinded up against her in a sexual way on one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">S.H. admitted that, contrary to her statement in the detention report, she did not testify at Michael R.\u2019s trial in New Jersey and that her cousin testified \u201cfor her.\u201d S.H. conceded she wrote a letter to Michael R. when he was in jail in New Jersey telling him that a cousin had told her to make accusations against him that were not true. S.H. explained that her accusations of sexual abuse against Michael R. were true but the accusation that Michael R. had threatened to kill her was something her cousin told her to say and was not true. S.H. testified she wrote the letter to Michael R. because she felt responsible for him being in jail and she did not want him to \u201cdie in jail.\u201d J.L. testified Michael R. hit him and S.H. with a belt and would tie him and his siblings together with a rope as punishment. J.L. denied Michael R. hit him or S.H. with his fist but acknowledged that he had seen Michael R. hit Marie R. A.L. testified Michael R. hit him with his fist and sometimes tied him up with a rope as punishment, although he was not tied to his brother or sister. Marie R. was present during these incidents and did nothing. A.L. remembered seeing Michael R. stab his sister with a barbeque fork, although he had earlier told the Department that S.H. had told him about the incident and he only saw the marks on her skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">d. <em>Marie R. \u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Marie R. testified and denied all allegations of abuse and neglect. Marie R. denied Michael R. had ever hit or abused the children and similarly denied that he had hit her. Marie R. admitted that S.H. had accused Michael R. of sexual abuse in New Jersey and that S.H. was removed from her custody and placed in foster care while Marie R. received counseling. Marie R. testified she did not believe Michael R. had sexually abused S.H. at any time because there had never been any \u201csigns.\u201d Marie R. stated Michael R. had been acquitted of the charge of sexual abuse, but had been convicted of witness tampering in connection with the abuse allegations, a crime for which he went to jail for two years. Marie R. denied Michael R. had been prohibited under a court order from contacting S.H. Marie R. testified she and Michael R. were still residing together and were homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>e. <em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Findings and Orders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The juvenile court sustained the allegations in the petition, expressly finding the children \u201ccredible\u201d and Marie R. \u201cnot credible.\u201d Finding a substantial danger to the children and no reasonable means to protect them other than removal from Marie R.\u2019s custody, the court declared the children dependent persons under section 300, subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (i) and (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The court ordered reunification services for Marie R. with monitored visitation in the social worker\u2019s office. The court did not specify either the frequency or the length of visitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Noting the children were fearful of their mother and that the boys had refused visits with her during their detention, the court added, \u201cThe social worker shall describe to the children the safeguards in place for monitoring for both mother and fathers, and if the children refuse a visit, then they shall not be forced to have a visit.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court ordered individual therapy for the children and Marie R. and ordered Marie R. to complete parenting classes addressing issues of severe child abuse, sex abuse, child neglect and failure to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Marie R. contends (1) the juvenile court erred in permitting S.H. and A.L. to testify outside her presence; (2) the court\u2019s findings of physical abuse, sexual abuse and medical neglect are not supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the visitation order impermissibly delegates the court\u2019s authority over visitation to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ANp\">1., 2<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>3. <em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Visitation Order Constitutes an Invalid Delegation of Judicial Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Visitation is a necessary and integral component of any reunification plan. (\u00a7 362.1, subd. (a)(1)(A);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1456(f)(4); <em>In re Luke L. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 670, 679 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 53].) \u201cAn obvious prerequisite to family reunification is regular visits between the noncustodial parent or parents and the dependent children \u2018as frequently] as possible, consistent with the well-being of the minor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Julie M. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 41, 49-50 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 354] <em>(Julie </em>M.).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">It is the juvenile court\u2019s responsibility to ensure regular parent-child visitation occurs while at the same time providing for flexibility in response to the changing needs of the child and to dynamic family circumstances. <em>(In re Moriah T. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1374, 1376 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 705] [\u201cVisitation arrangements demand flexibility to maintain and improve the ties between a parent or guardian and child while, at the same time, protect the child\u2019s well-being.\u201d]; <em>In re Danielle W. </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1227, 1234\u20141235 [255 Cal.Rptr. 344].) To sustain this balance the child\u2019s social worker may be given responsibility to manage the actual details of the visits, including the power to determine the time, place and manner in which visits should occur. (E.g., <em>In re Jennifer G. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 752, 757 [270 Cal.Rptr. 326].) In addition, the parents\u2019 interest in the care, custody and companionship of their children is not to be maintained at the child\u2019s expense; the child\u2019s input and refusal and the possible adverse consequences if a visit is forced against the child\u2019s will are factors to be considered in administering visitation. <em>(Julie M., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 50-51 [child\u2019s aversion to visiting an abusive parent is proper factor for consideration in administering visitation so long as it is not the \u201cthe <em>sole </em>factor\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Nonetheless, the power to decide whether <em>any </em>visitation occurs belongs to the court alone. <em>(In re Christopher H. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1008-1009 [\u201cThe juvenile court has the sole power to determine whether visitation will occur and may not delegate its power to grant or deny visitation to the DSS [(Department of Social Services)].\u201d]; <em>In re Jennifer G., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 757.) When the court abdicates its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>that regard and permits a third party, whether social worker, therapist<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or the child, to determine whether any visitation will occur, the court violates the separation of powers doctrine. <em>(Julie M., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 51 [order giving child the option to either consent or refuse visits with mother unconstitutionally abdicated court\u2019s discretion to determine whether visitation would occur to child who essentially held veto power to ensure there would be no visits].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The discretion to determine whether any visitation occurs at all \u201cmust remain with the court, not social workers and therapists, and certainly not with the children.\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>In re Christopher H., </em>at p. 1009; <em>In re Jennifer G., </em>at p. 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Marie R. argues there is little difference between the unconstitutional order in <em>Julie M. </em>(permitting visitation only with the child\u2019s consent) and the order in this case, which states, \u201cif the children refuse a visit, then they shall not be forced to have a visit.\u201d In each case, Marie R. argues, the order grants the child de facto veto power to ensure no visitation will occur absent the child\u2019s consent (see <em>Julie M., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 46, 49-51) . We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The order in this case does differ from that in <em>Julie M. </em>in that it affirmatively determines there is a right to visitation rather than making visitation entirely contingent on the child\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the court issued several noteworthy companion orders in an affirmative effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>encourage visitation, requiring counseling for both the children and Marie R. and directing the Department to describe the safeguards in place to the children to reduce their fears of visiting with their mother. Yet by failing to mandate any minimum number of monitored visits per month or even to order that <em>some </em>visitation <em>must </em>occur each month, the court\u2019s abstract recognition of Marie R.\u2019s right to visitation is illusory, transforming the children\u2019s ability to refuse \u201ca visit\u201d into the practical ability to forestall any visits at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We are not suggesting either that the juvenile court must always specify the frequency or length of visits (compare <em>In re Jennifer G., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 757 [court should \u201cdetermine whether there should be any right to visitation and, if so, the frequency and length of visitation\u201d] with <em>In re Christopher H., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1009 [rejecting such a requirement] and <em>In re Moriah T., supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1376 [same]) or that the court may not direct that the child\u2019s wishes with respect to the timing, length or location of visits be considered (see <em>In re Nicholas B. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1138-1139 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 465]; <em>In re Danielle W., supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1237). Indeed, the Department and mental health professionals working with it and with the dependent child may determine when visitation should first occur. (See <em>In re Chantal S. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 196, 203-204 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 866, 913 P.2d 1075].) However, in fashioning an appropriate visitation order the juvenile court must recognize that any factor that may be considered, even to a \u201climited\u201d extent, can become decisive (the \u201ctipping factor\u201d) in some instances in determining whether visitation will occur, otherwise it is not truly a factor at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Accordingly, while the juvenile court may allow the child to refuse to attend a particular visit, to prevent the child from exercising a de facto veto power, there must be some assurance that, should that occur, another visit will be scheduled and actually take place. The simplest\u2014but, by no means, the only\u2014way to accomplish this would be for the juvenile court to order a minimum number of visits per month and to impose any essential conditions (for example, whether the visits are to be monitored or occur in a neutral setting), while allowing the Department to organize other details of the visitation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In no event, however, may the child\u2019s wishes be the <em>sole </em>factor in determining whether any visitation takes place, either as a formal matter or, as occurred in the case now before us, by effectively giving the children the power to veto all visits. <em>(Julie M., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 50 [child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>aversion to visiting an abusive parent is proper factor for consideration in administering visitation so long as it is not only factor determining whether any visitation occurs at all]; <em>In re Danielle W., supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The portion of the July 18, 2002 order regarding Marie R.\u2019s visitation with the children is reversed. In all other respects the order of July 18, 2002 sustaining the allegations of the petition and declaring the children to be dependents of the juvenile court is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the juvenile court to conduct a new hearing on the issue of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Johnson, J., and Munoz (Aurelio), J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-12\">All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-13\">A.L. and J.L. are S.H.\u2019s half brothers.
