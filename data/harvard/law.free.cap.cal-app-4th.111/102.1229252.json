Respondent is the People of the State of California (plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\"><em>The Ordinance: </em>The City of San Jose (the City) has enacted and administers a mobilehome rent control ordinance (the Ordinance). (San Jose Municipal Code, tit. 17, ch. 17.22.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ordinance seeks to protect mobilehome park residents from unreasonable rent increases. (\u00a7 17.22.020.) Residents may forgo those protections by voluntarily entering long-term leases, which are exempt from rent control. (\u00a7 17.22.370, subd. A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\"><em>Summary of Proceedings Below: </em>Plaintiff\u2019s complaint for unfair business practices alleged that defendants violated the Ordinance by unlawfully forcing mobilehome park tenants to accept long-term leases in order to avoid rent control. Following a lengthy bench trial, the court concluded that defendants had violated the Ordinance and that those violations constituted unfair business practices. The court entered judgment against defendants, which requires them to pay $525,000 in restitution and $525,000 in civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\"><em>The Appeal: </em>On appeal, defendants dispute the trial court\u2019s determination that they violated the Ordinance. Defendants challenge both the restitution order and the award of civil penalties on other grounds as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>As we explain below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">For context, we begin with a brief overview of mobilehome tenancies. Against that backdrop, we set forth the factual and procedural history relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">I. <em>Mobilehome Tenancies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In California, mobilehome tenancies are governed by the Mobilehome Residency Law. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798 et seq.) The law \u201cextensively regulates the landlord-tenant relationship between mobilehome park owners and residents.\u201d <em>(Greening v. Johnson </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1226 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 214].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The protections afforded by the Mobilehome Residency Law reflect legislative recognition of the unique nature of mobilehome tenancies. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.55, subd. (a).) Ordinarily, mobilehome park tenants own their homes but rent the spaces they occupy. (See, e.g., \u00a7 17.22.010, subd. C.) Once a mobilehome is in place in a park, it is difficult to relocate. (\u00a7 17.22.010, subd. D; <em>Yee v. Escondido </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 519, 523 [118 L.Ed.2d 153, 112 S.Ct. 1522]; <em>Greening v. Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1226; <em>Rancho Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1147 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 464].) Its owner thus \u201cis more likely to be a long-term resident.\u201d <em>(Rancho Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Evans, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1147.) In many cases, mobilehome park tenants have limited and undesirable options if they find \u201cliving in the park no longer desirable, practical, or possible ....\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Given the singular nature of mobilehome tenancies, mobilehome park tenants are particularly vulnerable both to eviction and to rent increases. For that reason, California\u2019s Mobilehome Residency Law protects mobilehome owners against arbitrary evictions. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.55; <em>Yee </em>v. <em>Escondido, supra, </em>503 U.S. at p. 524.) The state law affords these protections even to mobilehome park residents in month-to-month tenancies. Locally, the Ordinance offers such residents protection from unreasonable rent increases. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 17.22.450-17.22.590.) Residents may forgo the Ordinance\u2019s rent safeguards by voluntarily entering rental agreements with terms longer than one year, which are exempt from rent control under the local act. (\u00a7 17.22.370, subd. A; see also, Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">It. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Starting in 1987, defendants entered into a number of long-term leases for lots in their respective mobilehome parks. Some of the leases included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>renewal provisions that resulted in effective terms as long as 25 years. Defendants\u2019 long-term leases fell into two categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">One category of long-term leases consists of those that defendants made directly with residents of their parks (direct leases).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In the second category are long-term leases that defendants made with mobilehome dealers (dealer leases). Two dealers were parties to the dealer leases at issue here: New Horizon Mobile Homes and United Mobile Homes. Consistent with common practice, the dealers placed new mobilehomes for sale in spaces in defendants\u2019 parks. The dealers signed long-term leases for those spaces. Upon sale of the mobilehome sited there, the purchaser (the prospective resident of the park) was required to assume the dealer lease or to sign a new long-term lease with similar terms. As long-term lessees, the dealers\u2019 customers were not protected by the rent control provisions of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">m. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Acting through the Santa Clara County District Attorney, plaintiff filed this civil action for unfair business practices in December 1995. In addition to defendants, the complaint named a mobilehome dealership, New Horizon Mobile Homes, and its owner, Faramarz (John) Naimi.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In August 1998, plaintiff filed an amended and supplemental complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In May 1999, defendants demurred to the amended complaint and also moved to strike part of its prayer. In July 1999, the court overruled defendants\u2019 demurrer, denied their motion to strike, and ordered them to answer the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In July 1999, defendants cross-complained against the City, asserting that the Ordinance effected an unconstitutional taking. The trial court bifurcated proceedings on the cross-complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">In December 1999, plaintiff moved for leave to further amend its complaint by adjusting the dates in the third and fourth causes of action and by revising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the prayer. The court later granted the motion, when plaintiff renewed it during trial. As amended, the complaint asserted nine causes of action, all alleging unfair business practices in violation of state statutes. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The matter proceeded to court trial. Opening statements were heard on January 4, 2000. In the ensuing weeks, dozens of witnesses testified, and more than 100 exhibits were received in evidence. Closing arguments were made on February 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The court issued its notice of intended decision shortly thereafter. The court announced its intent to render judgment for plaintiff and against defendants on the third and fourth causes of action of the amended complaint, concluding: \u201cNone of the other claims set forth in the complaint were proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Both parties requested a statement of decision. In May 2000, the court issued two statements of decision, one in response to each side\u2019s request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As relevant here, the court concluded that \u201cthe dealer leases were not exempt from the Ordinance. Defendants nonetheless required prospective tenants purchasing new mobile homes from United Mobilehomes and New Horizon to assume dealer leases or sign new long-term leases with the identical terms.\u201d By thus enforcing the dealer leases against consumers, the court explained, defendants violated Ordinance provisions that \u201cprohibit park owners from requiring prospective tenants to sign long-term leases as a condition of tenancy.\u201d The court further determined: \u201cThose violations of the Ordinance constituted separate and independent violations\u201d of the unfair practices law. The court also found that defendants conspired with the dealers to violate the Ordinance and the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The court determined that violations occurring as early as January 1, 1987, were actionable. It first explained: \u201cThose long-term leases were never exempt. Defendants committed an unlawful business practice each time they collected above-Ordinance rents on those leases.\u201d It further explained: \u201cThe statute of limitations does not begin to run on wrongful acts committed pursuant to a civil conspiracy until the completion of the last overt act of that conspiracy. [Citation.] ... Therefore, the statute of limitations has not begun to mn on defendants\u2019 violations of [Business and Professions Code section] 17200 because defendants are still enforcing their unlawful long-term leases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In June 2000, the court entered judgment, which it modified later that month. The judgment includes a permanent injunction that prohibits defendants from charging rents in excess of permissible amounts under the rent control provisions of the Ordinance. The judgment also requires defendants to pay $525,000 in restitution, divided among more than 150 affected tenants in specified amounts. In addition, the judgment imposes civil penalties totaling $525,000: $420,000 against defendant Beaumont Investments and $105,000 against defendant San Jose Investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In August 2000, the court denied defendants\u2019 motions to vacate the judgment and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In September 2000, defendants filed their notice of appeal from the modified judgment and from the denial of their posttrial motions. In October 2000, this court denied defendants\u2019 petition for a writ of supersedeas, by which they sought a stay of the injunctive provisions of the judgment pending resolution of this appeal. Shortly thereafter, we dismissed the appeal for failure to file the required California Rules of Court, rule 19.5 statement; we later reinstated it on defendants\u2019 motion. The appeal now stands fully briefed, argued and ready for our resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Defendants make the following contentions in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">I. The trial court erred in finding that the dealer leases violated the Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">n. The trial court erred in imposing the civil penalties. The court was without jurisdiction to determine and punish Ordinance violations in the first instance, absent prior administrative notice of violation and an opportunity to cure. Alternatively, even if the court had jurisdiction to impose civil penalties, it abused its discretion by setting penalties that were excessive under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">DI. The trial court erred in ordering restitution. The court erred as a matter of law in partially rescinding the leases. As a result, the court employed an erroneous restitution formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">IV. The trial court erred in resolving the limitations issue, because it applied the wrong legal standard in finding a civil conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">We address defendants\u2019 contentions in turn, starting in each instance with a discussion of the general legal principles that inform our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>I. <em>Violation of Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The judgment rests in the first instance on the trial court\u2019s determination that defendants violated the Ordinance by using unlawful long-term dealer leases to avoid rent control. Defendants assign this determination as error. To analyze defendants\u2019 claim of error, we must construe the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Interpretation of the municipal rent control ordinance presents a question of law for our independent review. \u201cWe interpret ordinances by the same rules applicable to statutes. [Citation.] Statutory interpretation is ultimately a judicial function.\u201d <em>(Carson Harbor Village, Ltd. v. City of Carson Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 281, 290 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">B. <em>Rules of Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We begin our analysis with familiar rules of statutory construction. \u201cPursuant to established principles, our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) In determining legislative intent, we first look to the statutory language itself. <em>(Ibid; </em>see also, <em>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1047 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539].) \u201cThe words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">C. <em>The Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The question before us is whether the long-term dealer leases violate the Ordinance. Answering that question requires resort to the applicable portions of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">We first consider section 17.22.370 (hereafter section 370) of the Ordinance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both parties agree that section 370 is relevant to the analysis here.  That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>section exempts from rent control those mobilehome tenancies governed by voluntary rental agreements that meet certain enumerated criteria. (\u00a7 17.22.370, subd. A [hereafter section 370A].)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In this case, the provision\u2019s critical requirement is that the space must be \u201cused for the personal and actual residence of the mobilehome owner.\u201d (\u00a7 370A, \u00b6 3.) Defendants do not dispute the plain meaning of that requirement. Nor do they claim that the requirement was met; to the contrary, defendants apparently concede that the dealers who signed the leases did not personally and actually reside in the mobilehomes they placed for sale in defendants\u2019 parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Defendants\u2019 assertion that the dealer leases were exempt from rent control instead rests on another provision of the Ordinance, section 17.22.2000 (hereafter section 2000).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to defendants, section 17.22.2000, subd. D (hereafter section 2000D) \u201cexpands the universe of exempt lessees.\u201d Defendants bolster that claim with arguments based on Ordinance language, on policy, and on evidence suggesting that the City agrees with defendants\u2019 interpretation, that evidence being an August 1992 memorandum by an assistant city attorney. Not surprisingly, plaintiff disagrees. In support of its view, plaintiff analyzes the Ordinance\u2019s language and structure, refers us to its stated purpose, and questions defendants\u2019 reliance on the 1992 city attorney memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>As we explain below, we reject defendants\u2019 interpretation of the Ordinance, based on our analysis of the Ordinance\u2019s language, structure, and purpose. Defendants\u2019 evidence does not convince us otherwise. Additionally, we find further support for our determination in state statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">1. <em>Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In support of their claim that section 2000D \u201cexpands the universe of exempt lessees,\u201d defendants first rely on linguistic differences between that section and section 370A. Defendants point out that section 370A refers only to \u201cmobilehome owners\u201d in describing renters who may enter exempt agreements. (\u00a7 370A.) By contrast, defendants observe, section 2000D recognizes the right of \u201ca mobilehome owner, mobilehome tenant, prospective mobile-home owner or prospective mobilehome tenant\u201d to enter into an exempt lease \u201cdescribed\u201d in section 370A. (\u00a7 2000D.) Given the inclusion of additional parties, defendants conclude, section 2000D \u201cdifferentiates a \u2018mobilehome owner\u2019 from a \u2018mobilehome tenant.\u2019 If this differentiation is to be given meaning, as it must, then clearly the Ordinance is distinguishing between a tenant residing in the mobilehome and a non-resident owner of the mobile-home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We find that argument unpersuasive. First, in our view, the provision\u2019s inclusion of mobilehome tenants as well as mobilehome owners is explained by resort to the Ordinance\u2019s definitions of those terms.  A mobilehome tenant is defined as one \u201cwho rents or leases a <em>mobilehome </em>from a mobile-home owner.\u201d (\u00a7 17.22.210, italics added.) A mobilehome owner is one with the right to use a mobilehome <em>lot. </em>(\u00a7 17.22.180, italics added.) A mobilehome owner who rents his mobilehome to another becomes a \u201clandlord\u201d within the meaning of the Ordinance. (\u00a7 17.22.150 [defining \u201clandlord\u201d to include \u201ca mobilehome park owner, mobilehome owner, lessor or sublessor who receives or is entitled to receive rent for the use or occupancy\u201d of a mobile-home or a mobilehome lot].) Second, it appears to us that the inclusion of \u201cprospective\u201d owners or tenants in section 2000D simply reflects the understanding that a rental agreement may precede occupancy by the mobilehome\u2019s ultimate \u201cresident.\u201d (See \u00a7 17.22.200 [defining \u201cmobilehome resident\u201d as \u201ca person, including a mobilehome owner or mobilehome tenant, who occupies a mobilehome\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The enumeration of the wider variety of potential rentpayers listed in section 2000D is simply unnecessary in section 370.  Within the context of section 370, a \u201cmobilehome owner\u201d can only mean a mobilehome park tenant. The two are one and the same, because section 370 governs the lease of a mobilehome <em>lot </em>to one who personally and actually <em>resides </em>in his mobilehome on that lot. Thus, for purposes of section 370, the lessor will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>always be the park owner (the owner of the lot) and the lessee will always be the mobilehome owner who personally resides there. (Cf., Friedman et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant (The Rutter Group 2002) \u00b6 11:25, p. 11-6 [for purposes of Mobilehome Residency Law, \u201cdistinction between park \u2018homeowners\u2019 and \u2018residents\u2019 is significant\u201d]; <em>id, </em>\u00b6 11:28, p. 11-7 [Mobilehome Residency Law provisions governing rental agreements do not apply to residents who lease from park owners both a park-owned mobile-home and its lot].)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">With the foregoing understanding of the provisions\u2019 distinct contexts, it becomes clear that the linguistic differences between the two sections do not compel or even suggest the conclusion that the latter expands the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Defendants further argue: \u201cThe very language of [section] 2000D shows that it expands on [section] 370. [Section] 2000D refers to the leases \u2018described\u2019 in [section] 370. The term \u2018described\u2019 refers only to the type of rental or lease agreement, not the identity of the parties to the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">That argument likewise is without merit. The leases \u201cdescribed\u201d in section 370 are those that meet the criteria enumerated in that section. One of those criteria is the requirement of \u201cpersonal and actual residence\u201d by the person renting the lot. (\u00a7 370A, \u00b6 3.) Regardless of whether the party obliged to pay the landlord is denominated a mobilehome owner or tenant, current or prospective, the rentpayer must use the space for his actual and personal residence. (\u00a7 370A, \u00b6 3.) Nothing in section 2000D alters that residency requirement, either expressly or by implication. To the contrary, by referring to the leases \u201cdescribed\u201d in section 370, section 2000D necessarily incorporates the prior section\u2019s residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Another aspect of section 2000D\u2019s language bolsters our conclusion that it was not intended to expand the universe of available exemptions. The subdivision expressly limits its operation to the section in which it is contained, with this introduction: \u201cNothing in this <em>section </em>shall preclude [section 370 leases].\u201d (\u00a7 2000D, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In short, from the language of section 2000D, we conclude that the provision does not expand the universe of exempt leases under the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">2. <em>Structure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Our interpretation of section 2000D in relation to section 370 is further buttressed by an examination of the structure of the Ordinance and of the place that each section occupies within it. (Cf., e.g., <em>Gomes v. County of Mendocino </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 977, 986, 987 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 93] [statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>read together and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole].) As codified, the Ordinance consists of 11 parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Part 3 of the Ordinance is entitled \u201cExemptions.\u201d It describes three specific exemptions from the Ordinance\u2019s rent control provisions. One of those three exemptions is for long-term leases, as described in section 370. Part 3 also includes a provision that places the burden of proving an exemption on the landlord. (\u00a7 17.22.390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Part 11 of the Ordinance is entitled \u201cEnforcement.\u201d It includes section 2000, captioned \u201cWaiver of Rights.\u201d That section begins with the pronouncement that any waiver of renters\u2019 rights is void except as provided in section 370. (\u00a7 2000, subd. A.) Other sections of Part 11 outlaw and punish certain landlord behavior. (\u00a7\u00a7 17.22.2010, 17.22.2020, 17.22.2030.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Given this structure and the distinct character of Part 3 (Exemptions) and Part 11 (Enforcement), we are further persuaded that the City did not intend section 2000D to expand the Ordinance\u2019s limited universe of exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">3. <em>Policy and Purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Our interpretation of the Ordinance derives from its plain language in the context of its structure. Defendants nevertheless resist that interpretation on policy grounds, asserting that \u201cfrom a policy perspective,\u201d it is \u201cnonsensical to allow a mobilehome park tenant, who may not be very sophisticated\u201d to enter exempt leases, while prohibiting relatively more savvy mobilehome dealers from doing so. For its part, plaintiff points out that one of the Ordinance\u2019s express purposes is reasonable rent for mobilehome park residents. (See \u00a7 17.22.020.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Initially, we question the implicit premise that policy arguments may overcome the plain language of a statute. (See, e.g., <em>Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 176, fn. 9 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706] [reliance on statutory purpose while ignoring statutory language is improper], Cf., e.g., <em>People ex rel. Lockyer </em>v. <em>Fremont General Corp. </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1266 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 127] [rejecting policy arguments that \u201cignore the Legislature\u2019s plain expression of public policy\u201d].) In any event, in our view, plaintiff has the better of the policy arguments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Ordinance\u2019s explicit purpose of protection for mobilehome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>park <em>residents </em>thus further supports our conclusion that the residency requirement of section 370 retains its vitality, unaffected by section 2000D.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">4. <em>Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In pressing their contrary interpretation of the Ordinance, defendants rely heavily on a 1992 memorandum by an assistant city attorney, which was placed in evidence at trial. According to defendants, the memorandum is evidence both of the City\u2019s actual practice and of its interpretation of its own ordinance, to wit, that the dealer leases are exempt from rent control under the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on the memorandum is misplaced. We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis of this issue, as set forth in its statement of decision. First, as the trial court concluded, the dealer leases at the heart of this action are not the same as the dealer \u201cpullouts\u201d analyzed in the memorandum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, even if the two types of dealer transactions were equivalent, the memorandum is entitled to persuasive value at most. \u201c \u2018As the matter is a question of law, we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court\u2019s interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Village Trailer Park, Inc. v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1140 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 857], quoting <em>Burden v. Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672].) Finally, whatever persuasive value the 1992 memorandum may have was eroded by a 1995 memorandum from the same assistant city attorney. That later memorandum\u2014written in response to defendants\u2019 request for an opinion on the precise issue presented here\u2014 concluded that the dealer leases are not exempt under the Ordinance. The trial court took judicial notice of the 1995 memorandum, finding it \u201ca persuasive expression of the views of the City of San Jose that the dealer leases were not exempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">5. State <em>Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Though neither party argues it, we find further support for our interpretation of the Ordinance in the Mobilehome Residency Law. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798 et seq.) One provision of that law \u201cdelineates the limited circumstances under which a mobilehome rental agreement is exempt from local rent control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>measures. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.17.)\u201d <em>(Village Trailer Park, Inc. v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1140-1141.) One condition for exemption under that provision is that the homeowner must use the rental as a personal residence. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.17, subd. (a); see also, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 798.21.) Presumably, any local attempt to expand the limited universe of state law exemptions would be vulnerable to challenge on preemption grounds. (Cf., <em>Mobilepark West Homeowners Assn. v. Escondido Mobilepark West </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 32, 46 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 393] [local ordinance impermissibly contradicts state law by adding additional requirements for exemption]; <em>Village Trailer Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1141 [local ordinance does not conflict with state law regarding exemption from rent control].) Our construction of the Ordinance comports with its validity, consistent with statutory construction rules. (See, e.g., <em>Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 129 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 999 P.2d 718] [where possible, court must construe statute to preserve its validity]; <em>Montclair Parkowners Assn. v. City of Montclair </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 784, 791 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 598] [same; construction of ordinance].)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The express language of section 370 establishes actual and personal residency of a mobilehome as a prerequisite to a long-term lease exempt from rent control under the Ordinance. The residency requirement of section 370 is not altered by section 2000D. The Ordinance\u2019s structure, its stated purpose, and state law all further bolster the conclusion that personal residency is a necessary prerequisite for exemption from rent control.  Because the dealer leases failed to meet the residency requirement, they were not exempt. The trial court thus correctly determined that the dealer leases violate the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">II. <em>Civil Penalties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">By violating the Ordinance, the trial court concluded, defendants engaged in unfair business practices. As a consequence, the court imposed statutory civil penalties. Defendants challenge that award here.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">A. <em>Statutory Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Defendants argue initially that the court lacked statutory authority to adjudicate violations and to award civil penalties. Plaintiff disputes that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The parties\u2019 dispute over the trial court\u2019s statutory authority presents a question of law, which we review de novo. (See, e.g., <em>Richman v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1464, fn. 3 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 690] [applicability of the Petris Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">2. <em>Unfair Competition Law (Bus. &amp; Prof Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The trial court determined that defendants violated California\u2019s statutory prohibitions against unfair business practices, a scheme commonly called the \u201cunfair competition law\u201d or \u201cUCL.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.; see 11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (2003 supp.) Equity, \u00a7 93, p. 467.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   A UCL action may be predicated on violations of the false advertising law. <em>(Quelimane Co. v.

Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 P.2d 730], citing Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200; see also, e.g., <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527]; <em>Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1143 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937].) Proscribed conduct \u201cincludes \u2018 \u201canything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 383.) Violations of other laws, \u201cwhen committed pursuant to business activity,\u201d become \u201cindependently actionable\u201d under the UCL and subject to its remedies. (Ibid.; see also, e.g., <em>Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1143 [\u201cSection 17200 \u2018borrows\u2019 violations from other laws by making them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>independently actionable as unfair competitive practices.\u201d].) Those remedies are cumulative. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17205; <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 179.) The statutory remedies include civil penalties. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17206 [$2,500 civil penalty may be assessed for each violation of \u00a7 17200], 17536 [$2,500 civil penalty may be assessed for each violation of \u00a7 17500].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">3. <em>Petris Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1947.7)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In challenging the trial court\u2019s authority to adjudicate statutory violations of the Unfair Business Practices Act, defendants rely on Civil Code section 1947.7.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That section is part of a statute that is sometimes referred to as the Petris Act. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1947.7-1947.8; see <em>Sego v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 250, 256 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 68].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of the [Petris] Act is to exempt landlords who attempt good faith compliance with a rent control law from fines and penalties.\u201d <em>(Richman v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at p.1465.) The statute explicitly sets forth \u201cthe intent of the Legislature to limit the imposition of penalties and sanctions against an owner of residential rental units where that person has attempted in good faith to fully comply with the regulatory processes.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1947.7, subd. (a).) The cited \u201cregulatory processes\u201d appear to be those related to the registration of rents and to the establishment of rent levels. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1947.7, subd. (b) [describing the affected rent control ordinances as those requiring \u201cthe registration of rents\u201d], subd. (c) [permitting the restoration of rent increases for landlord\u2019s \u201cgood faith attempt to comply with the registration requirements\u201d], subd. (e) [referring to compliance with \u201capplicable local rental registration requirements\u201d], subd. (g) [describing the affected rent control ordinances as those requiring \u201cthe periodic registration of rents\u201d]; see also, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1947.8, subd. (a) [describing the affected rent control ordinances as those requiring \u201cthe registration of rents\u201d and requiring such ordinances to \u201cprovide for the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels for the registered rental units\u201d]; see generally 1 Moskovitz et al., Cal. Landlord-Tenant Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2002) \u00a7 7.45, pp. 600-601 [\u201cin a jurisdiction that requires registration of rent,\u201d Civil Code \u00a7 1947.7, subd. (b), prohibits the assessment of penalties against a landlord in substantial compliance with the local ordinance].) The act thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>protects landlords who inadvertently make registration mistakes or who innocently establish rents at improper levels. (See, e.g., <em>Sego v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 257 [discussing the two purposes of the legislation, as described by its author, (1) to avoid \u201c \u2018excessive fines\u2019 \u201d for landlords who \u201c \u2018 \u201cdid not register correctly or did not fill in all the blanks,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201c \u2018to address a complaint by landlords that proper rent levels are often difficult to establish and that any mistake may subject the owner to severe penalties\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The act provides that a residential landlord \u201cwho is in substantial compliance\u201d with a local rent control ordinance as described in the statute \u201cshall not be assessed a penalty or any other sanction for noncompliance with the ordinance....\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1947.7, subd. (b).) The statutory definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d includes a residential landlord who \u201chas made a good faith attempt to comply with the ordinance ... but is not in full compliance, and has, after receiving notice of a deficiency from the local agency, cured the defect in a timely manner, as reasonably determined by the local agency.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The term \u201c \u2018local agency\u2019 ... means the public entity responsible for the implementation of the ordinance ....\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">According to defendants, the trial court lacks authority to award civil penalties for rent control violations until the administrative procedure envisioned by the Petris Act takes place. That procedure requires notice of deficiency by the designated local agency, determination of compliance by that agency, and an opportunity to cure. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1947.7, subd. (b).) Because plaintiff failed to exhaust this administrative remedy, defendants contend, \u201cthe trial court was without jurisdiction to award sanctions or penalties\u201d against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Plaintiff disagrees. First, plaintiff argues, the act does not create an administrative procedure. Furthermore, according to plaintiff, defendants were never in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the Ordinance, as required under the Petris Act. Lastly, plaintiff asserts, even assuming defendants were entitled to an administrative process by the act, the trial court nevertheless had jurisdiction to award civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We first question whether the Petris Act even applies to the Ordinance at issue here. For one thing, as noted above, language in the act itself strongly suggests its limitation only to those jurisdictions where registration of rents is required. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1947.7, subds. (b), (c), (e), (g), 1947.8, subd. (a).) That suggestion is borne out by legislative history materials concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Petris Act, as furnished by the Legislative Intent Service.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the Ordinance requires the payment of annual \u201crent-dispute\u201d fees, it contains no registration requirement of the type apparently contemplated by the Petris Act. For another thing, apart from the registration issue, we wonder whether the act was intended to apply to mobilehome parks rent schemes at all. The act\u2019s legislative history suggests that it was not meant to govern mobilehome rent control ordinances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In any event, even assuming the Petris Act applies to disputes arising under the Ordinance, nothing in the act either creates an administrative procedure or mandates its exhaustion as a precondition to judicial intervention. As defendants themselves acknowledge, the statute \u201cdoes not require a regulating agency to adopt such a procedure, nor does [Civil Code section] 1947.7 create such a procedure.\u201d Rather, defendants argue, the statute \u201cdoes <em>prohibit </em>the award of sanctions or penalties if such a procedure is not adopted <em>and </em>followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">4. <em>Exhaustion and Primary Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">To assess defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiff\u2019s resort to judicial action impermissibly bypassed \u201cprocedural and jurisdictional protections,\u201d we must consider and apply two related doctrines of administrative law: exhaustion and primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u201c\u2018 \u201cExhaustion\u201d applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone: judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course. \u201cPrimary jurisdiction,\u201d on the other hand, applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v. Western Pac. R. Co. </em>(1956) 352 U.S. 59, 63-64 [1 L.Ed.2d 126, 77 S.Ct. 161, 135 Ct.Cl. 997], quoted in <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 390.) The primary jurisdiction doctrine is sometimes called the \u201cprior resort\u201d or the \u201cpreliminary jurisdiction\u201d doctrine. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">As our state\u2019s high court has observed, \u201ccourts have often confused the two closely related concepts ....\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 390.) \u201c \u2018Both are essentially doctrines of comity between courts and agencies. They are two sides of the timing coin: Each determines whether an action may be brought in a court or whether an agency proceeding, or further agency proceeding, is necessary.\u2019 [\u00b6] ... \u2018Exhaustion applies where an agency alone has exclusive jurisdiction over a case; primary jurisdiction where both a court and an agency have the legal capacity to deal with the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 390-391, quoting Schwartz, Administrative Law (1984) \u00a7 8.23, pp. 485, 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u201cThe policy reasons behind the two doctrines are similar and overlapping. The exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary). [Citations.] ... [T]he primary jurisdiction doctrine advances two related policies: it enhances court decisionmaking and efficiency by allowing courts to take advantage of administrative expertise, and it helps assure uniform application of regulatory laws. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">5. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In this case, the governing principle is primary jurisdiction, not exhaustion. (See <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">This is not a case where plaintiff bypassed an available administrative procedure. No such procedure existed.  In the absence of an available administrative remedy, the exhaustion doctrine does not apply. (Cf., <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 391 [as to count 1 of the People\u2019s complaint, exhaustion doctrine would have applied, since the statute provided for an administrative proceeding; by contrast, as to count 2 of the complaint, there was no exhaustion issue, because no administrative procedure was available as to that count].)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. Nor do we agree with defendants that the Petris Act requires the local agency to adopt and use such a procedure as a precondition to the imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of statutory civil penalties for unfair business practices. \u201cBecause it sweeps so broadly, the Unfair Practices Act applies to many situations in which no administrative process is available to address the challenged practice.\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In this case, plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendants violated the unfair practices law \u201cis \u2018originally cognizable in the courts,\u2019 and thus it triggers application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 391.)  In applying the doctrine, a threshold question is whether the trial court has discretion to stay the judicial action pending an administrative determination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 394.) If the particular legislative scheme <em>forecloses </em>judicial discretion under the doctrine, the court <em>must </em>adjudicate the action before it. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Otherwise, the court has discretion either to hear the action or to stay it until \u201cavailable administrative processes\u201d are first \u201cinvoked and completed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Here, the trial properly exercised its discretion to adjudicate the action before it. \u201cNo rigid formula exists for applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine [citation].\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 391, citing <em>United States v. Western Pac. R. Co., supra, </em>352 U.S. at p. 64.) \u201cInstead, resolution generally hinges on a court\u2019s determination of the extent to which the policies noted above are implicated in a given case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Those policies\u2014efficiency and uniformity\u2014would not have been served in this case by staying the judicial action in favor of administrative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The critical issue here was whether the dealer leases were exempt. To resolve that issue, the trial judge was required to construe the Ordinance, an inherently judicial function. \u201c[C]ourts are the ultimate arbiters of the construction of a statute. [Citation.] An administrative agency cannot alter or enlarge the legislation, and an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.

This case turns on \u201ca question of statutory interpretation, a matter with which courts have considerable experience and which does not necessitate deferral to another agency. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 529.) In this case, neither efficiency nor uniformity would be enhanced by \u201cadministrative expertise.\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange v.

Toomey </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1, 22 [203 Cal.Rptr. 642].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In this case, the trial court counted 14,124 statutory violations arising from two different patterns of conduct on defendants\u2019 part. The court first considered defendants\u2019 actions in obtaining the unlawful long-term leases. The court concluded that each time defendants forced a tenant to accept the conditions of a long-term dealer lease, they violated the unfair practices law. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) The court found 154 violations on that basis. The court next addressed the defendants\u2019 monthly collections of rent. The court determined that each time defendants collected \u201cabove-Ordinance\u201d rent under the long-term leases, they violated both the unfair practices law and the false advertising law. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17500.) By the court\u2019s calculation, defendants had unlawfully collected excess monthly rent approximately 6,985 times since January 1987. The court thus found 7,139 violations of Business and Professions Code section 17200 (6,985 unlawful rent collections plus 154 unlawful leases) and 6,985 violations of Business and Professions Code section 17500 (all unlawful rent collections), for a total of 14,124 separate statutory violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Defendants assign that calculation as error. They argue that appellate courts \u201chave uniformly ruled that the number of violations is determined by the number of <em>people </em>affected, not the number of misrepresentations or (as in this case) number of monthly rent checks paid.\u201d Defendants thus urge that \u201cthe starting point should be the number of tenants/lessees.\u201d They observe that only \u201capproximately 80 spaces in the mobilehome parks were governed by the dealer leases found in violation of the Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In contending for a \u201cper person\u201d rather than a \u201cper act\u201d calculation, defendants rely on our high court\u2019s decision in <em>Jayhill. (Jayhill, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 289.) In <em>Jayhill, </em>the defendants (door-to-door encyclopedia sellers) made at least 25 separate misrepresentations to each prospective purchaser. The Attorney General argued that each misrepresentation constituted a separate violation. The California Supreme Court disagreed, saying \u201cwe believe the Legislature intended that the number of violations is to be determined by the number of persons to whom the misrepresentations were made, and not the number of separately identifiable misrepresentations involved.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As we explain, defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Jayhill </em>is misplaced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Certainly, in many cases, it will be proper to calculate violations \u201con a \u2018per victim\u2019 basis.\u201d <em>(People ex rel.

Instead, determining what qualifies as a single violation \u201cdepends on the type of violation involved, the number of victims and the repetition of the conduct constituting the violation\u2014in brief, the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Witzerman </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 169, 180 [105 Cal.Rptr. 284]; see also, e.g., <em>People v.

To the contrary, in a proper case, \u201ca <em>single </em>act in violation of regulations may constitute an unlawful business practice\u2014a <em>\u2018violation\u2019 </em>for which a penalty of up to $2,500 may be imposed.

National Association of Realtors, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 585 [each act may be subject to separate punishment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Given the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in calculating the number of statutory violations based on defendants\u2019 actions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>well as the number of affected tenants. First, each unlawful act was a separate, discrete event. Each long-term dealer lease violated the Ordinance. (\u00a7 370.) Each collection of unauthorized rent violated the Ordinance. (\u00a7\u00a7 17.22.2020, 17.22.2030.) Furthermore, each unlawful act\u2014including the collection of excess rent each month\u2014was designed to enrich defendants at the expense of the affected tenants. The trial court\u2019s method of calculating violations thus is \u201creasonably related to the gain or the opportunity for gain achieved by\u201d defendants\u2019 unlawful scheme. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Olson), supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at p. 198; accord, <em>People v. National Association of Realtors, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 586.) Finally, the trial court\u2019s method of counting each individual unlawful act as a separate violation properly takes into account the nature and extent of the public injury that defendants inflicted in this case. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Olson), supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at p. 198; <em>People v. National Association of Realtors, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 586.) For these reasons, the trial court was fully justified in counting each of defendants\u2019 discrete unlawful acts as a separate statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">3. <em>Amount of Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Having determined that defendants were guilty of more than 14,000 statutory violations, the court proceeded to assess civil penalties totaling $525,000. In setting the amount, the court expressly considered the relevant statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The statutes direct: \u201cIn assessing the amount of the civil penalty, the court shall consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the following: the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant\u2019s misconduct, and the defendant\u2019s assets, liabilities, and net worth.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17206, subd. (b) [unfair practices law]; see also, \u00a7 17536, subd. (b) [false advertising law; identical language].)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Applying those factors, the trial court observed that defendants violated the Ordinance for 13 years, that they knew or should have known that they were violating the Ordinance, that they collected an estimated $75 million in rents over that time, and that an undetermined but substantial number of tenants had been forced from their homes as a result of defendants\u2019 unlawful practices. However, the court\u2019s assessment was \u201ctempered\u201d by its finding that defendants\u2019 conduct was not unfair or fraudulent but merely unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The court set the penalty at $525,000, which it identified as the approximate amount of excess rent defendants had collected over the relevant time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>period. In doing so, the court noted that the maximum penalty authorized by the statutes would exceed $35 million (14,124 violations at $2,500 per violation). However, the court recognized, \u201csuch a penalty would be so disproportionate to the illicit gains obtained by defendants as to constitute an excessive fine.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 399 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512].) The court then discussed a \u201cmore reasonable range of penalties\u201d as \u201csuggested by the Ordinance and relevant case law\u201d under the statutes. The court noted that the Ordinance permits treble damages to private litigants, but it chose to assess a lower penalty in light of its determination that defendants\u2019 conduct was only unlawful, not unfair or fraudulent. The court explicitly set the penalty without assigning a specific dollar amount for each violation. It divided the penalty between the two defendants based on the number of affected tenants who rented space in each park.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Defendants attack the penalty as excessive. They argue that the reported decisions illustrate why the penalty in this case \u201cshould be minimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We find no merit in that argument. In our view, the penalty imposed in this case is minimal considering the number of violations, the continuing nature of defendants\u2019 conduct, and the resulting injury to tenants. The penalty assessed here averages approximately $37 per violation ($525,000 divided by 14,124 violations). That amount is \u201creasonable, if not lenient\u201d \u201cgiven the great number of victims, the economic benefit to appellant from the marketing scheme, and the continuing nature of the unlawful business practices.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toomey, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 23 [upholding penalty of $150,000]; see also, <em>Hewlett v. Squaw Valley Ski Corp., supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 537 [upholding penalty of $223,000, which the court deemed \u201cmodest in light of [defendant\u2019s] egregious behavior\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dollar Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc., supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d at p. 132 [under the circumstances, \u201c$100,000 civil penalty was abundantly justified\u201d].) Higher per-violation penalties have been affirmed in many cases. (See, e.g., <em>People ex rel. Van de Kamp v. Cappuccio, Inc. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 750, 765 [251 Cal.Rptr. 657] [592 violations based on underweight squid; $124.20 per violation]; <em>People ex rel. Smith v. Parkmerced Co., supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 692 [4,259 tenants charged illegal fees; $50 per violation]; <em>People v. Bestline Products, Inc., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d at p. 923 [3,000 prospective distributors misled; approximately $330 per violation]; <em>People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc., supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 535 [$167,500 in penalties for 67 violations \u201cmore than fair and reasonable\u201d].)  If anything, the published decisions teach that the trial court\u2019s discretion in setting civil penalties generally will be upheld. In fact, we are aware of only two reported appellate decisions faulting the trial court\u2019s civil penalty decision. In one, the matter was remanded because the trial court set the number of violations too low. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Olson), supra, </em>96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Cal.App.3d at p. 198 [the trial court erred in concluding that \u201cdissemination of a false or deceptive advertisement through a single edition of a newspaper can constitute but one violation of each statute as a matter of law\u201d].) In the other, the appellate court reversed because the trial court imposed no penalty despite finding of a violation. <em>(People v. National Association of Realtors, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 585 [\u201cthe duty to impose a penalty for each violation [] is mandatory .... Therefore, the court abused its discretion in not imposing any penalty\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In assessing a civil penalty for unfair business practices, \u201cthe trial court must manifestly act reasonably in light of all pertinent factors....\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Olson), supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at p. 198.) The court certainly did so in this case. Its approach was thorough, considered, and measured. The resulting penalty was reasonable and the trial court acted well within its discretion in imposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">HI. <em>Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In addition to the civil penalties it imposed, the court ordered defendants to pay restitution to tenants affected by defendants\u2019 violations of the Ordinance. The court ordered restitution of all \u201cabove-Ordinance\u201d rents charged to tenants in unlawful long-term leases, plus prejudgment interest on those amounts. The court also ordered defendants to pay restitution to certain tenants for the diminution in value of their leasehold interests resulting from defendants\u2019 unlawful business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Defendants challenge the restitution order on two related grounds. First, defendants claim, the court erred as a matter of law in \u201cpartially rescinding\u201d the unlawful long-term leases. They argue that the court was required to rescind the leases in their entirety. Furthermore, according to defendants, the court employed an erroneous restitution formula, which failed to restore the parties to the status quo ante and which was premised on an unconstitutional rent control scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">A. <em>Rescission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The first prong of defendants\u2019 attack on the trial court\u2019s remedy is based on their rescission claim. According to defendants: \u201cBecause the leases were found to be illegal, the leases must be wholly rescinded and the parties placed back in their original bargaining positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Defendants\u2019 argument is without merit. It both misapprehends the trial court\u2019s order in this case and confuses the remedies available for different civil wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The trial court did not rescind the leases\u2014either wholly or partially. As the court correctly observed, \u201cthere is no reason to rescind the leases, even solely for purposes of calculating restitution. Plaintiff\u2019s suit is based on violations of the Ordinance and, by extension, [section] 17200. It is based on statute, not on contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The trial court thus properly distinguished rescission from restitution.  The two remedies are distinct. <em>(Gardiner Solder Co. v. SupAlloy Corp., Inc. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1537, 1544 [284 Cal.Rptr. 206].)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Simply put, rescission stands as a contract remedy. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1691 [procedure for rescinding contract], 1692 [relief available after contract rescission].) Rescission is generally understood to mean the \u201cunmaking of a contract.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 1308, col. 1 [defining \u201crescission\u201d].) \u201cThe remedy of rescission necessarily involves a repudiation of the contract.\u201d <em>(Lobdell v. Miller </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 328, 343 [250 P.2d 357]; see generally <em>Runyan v. Pacific Air Industries, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 304, 311-318 [85 Cal.Rptr. 138, 466 P.2d 682] [discussing the development of the law of rescission].) Within the confines of contract law, rescission is a broad remedy. \u201cIt is essential to recognize that rescission is a commodious remedy available to redress various wrongs each of which, genetically, is sharply distinguishable from the others. Rescission by agreement, for instance, is contractual in nature .... Rescission for illegality, finally, is a remedy which enables a party, in the circumstances specified, to procure restitutionary relief with respect to a contract which was never enforceable.\u201d (Recommendation: A Study Relating to Rescission of Contracts (Oct. 1960) 3 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1961) p. D-15, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In an appropriate contract action, rescission may be followed by restitution. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1692 [after rescission of a contract, the aggrieved party \u201cshall be awarded complete relief, including restitution of benefits\u201d]; <em>Runyan v. Pacific Air Industries, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d. at p. 311.) Here, for example, the affected tenants presumably could have sued to rescind the leases on the ground of illegality and to recover restitutionary damages. Instead, the People of the State of California brought this action to establish statutory violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In a statutory action such as this one, rescission is not a necessary predicate to granting restitution. (Cf., e.g., <em>Parkmerced Co., supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 692 [tenants entitled to restitution for UCL violation; no indication that leases were rescinded]; <em>Epstein v. Frank </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 111, 122-123 [177 Cal.Rptr. 831] [despite usurious interest rate, promissory note not rescinded]; <em>Elmers </em>v. <em>Shapiro </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 741, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>747, 750, 756 [205 P.2d 1052] [seller who violated price control statute was liable for restitution of overcharge even though buyer never offered to rescind].)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">To sum up, the rescission remedy typically applies only in contract actions. This is not a contract action. The trial court therefore acted properly in declining to rescind the illegal leases in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">B. <em>Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Defendants next challenge the restitution formula employed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">First, defendants contend, the restitution order is flawed because it fails to accomplish the fundamental object of restitution, which is \u201cto place the parties in the same position they would have been in before the challenged contract was entered into.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">As with their rescission argument, defendants\u2019 restitution argument fails to differentiate between contractual and statutory remedies.  As explained above, restitution may be awarded in contract actions. But it is also available as a remedy to redress statutory violations. \u201c \u2018 \u201cRestitution\u201d is an ambiguous term, sometimes referring to the disgorging of something which has been taken and at times referring to compensation for injury done.\u2019 \u201d (Calamari &amp; Perillo, The Law of Contracts (3d ed. 1987) \u00a7 9-23, p. 376, quoted in Black\u2019s Law Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 1315, col. 2 [defining \u201crestitution\u201d]; see generally Rest., Restitution, Introductory Note, pp. 595-596; Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 347, com. b., p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">In a suit for violation of the unfair competition law, \u201corders for restitution\u201d are those \u201ccompelling a UCL defendant to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken....\u201d <em>(Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 126-127.) Such restitutionary relief is explicitly authorized by statute. \u201cThe court may make such orders or judgments ... as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property ... acquired by means of such unfair competition.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Where restitution is ordered as a means of redressing a statutory violation, the courts are not concerned with restoring the violator to the status quo ante. The focus instead is on the victim. \u201cThe status quo ante to be achieved by the restitution order was to again place the <em>victim </em>in possession of that money.\u201d <em>(Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., supra, 23 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 177, italics added [UCL violation].) \u201cThe object of [statutory] restitution is to restore the status quo by returning to the <em>plaintiff </em>funds in which he or she has an ownership interest.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1149, italics added [UCL violation].) \u201cThe purpose of the civil remedy is to allow recovery of the excess paid and to prohibit the seller from receiving and keeping such excess.\u201d <em>(Elmers </em>v. <em>Shapiro, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.2d at p. 752 [price control violation].) Moreover, in contrast to contract restitution, statutory restitution is not solely \u201cintended to benefit the [victims] by the return of money, but instead is designed to penalize a defendant for past unlawful conduct and thereby deter future violations. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toomey, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at pp. 25-26 [UCL violations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In this case, the trial court required defendants to disgorge unauthorized rents and to restore that money to the affected tenants. As the court explained, it made that order \u201cto avoid unjustly enriching defendants and to compensate tenants who paid above-Ordinance rents.\u201d Quite properly, the court also recognized the deterrent value of the order. \u201cThe purpose of such orders is \u2018to deter future violations of the unfair trade practice statute and to foreclose retention by the violator of its ill-gotten gains.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1267 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545], quoting <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Security Pacific National Bank </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 442, 449 [153 Cal.Rptr. 28, 591 P.2d 51], and also citing <em>Jayhill, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 288-289 &amp; fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">As our high court recently confirmed, the trial court\u2019s discretion to award restitution under the UCL is very broad. <em>(Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 180.) There was no abuse of that discretion in this case. The trial court\u2019s carefully crafted restitution remedy is based on appropriate factors, and it accomplishes the statutory objective of restoring to the victims sums acquired through defendants\u2019 unfair practices. The trial court was not required to place defendants in the status quo ante. The order for restitution in this case is proper under the unfair competition law.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Defendants nevertheless argue that the restitution order should be set aside on another ground. As defendants put it: \u201cAn additional reason for employing a market rent as the initial rent, quite apart from restoring the status quo ante, is that vacancy control is unconstitutional. Courts sitting in equity should refrain from imposing unconstitutional measures in fashioning restitution.\u201d In support of their argument, defendants cite <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>City and County of Honolulu </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 124 F.3d 1150 <em>(Richardson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The trial court rejected that argument below on several grounds. Among other things, the trial judge recognized that California courts have declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>follow <em>Richardson. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Montclair Parkowners Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Montclair, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 795; see also, e.g., <em>Sandpiper Mobile Village v. City of Carpinteria </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 542, 550 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 623] [California courts have upheld vacancy control as legitimate economic regulation].) As a procedural matter, the court also observed that defendants failed to raise their <em>Richardson </em>claim in this proceeding, although it was raised in the bifurcated cross-complaint. In light of the court\u2019s procedural finding, we will defer addressing the merits of defendants\u2019 <em>Richardson </em>claim here. We will address that claim if and as necessary to our resolution of the appeal in the bifurcated proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In sum, neither of the grounds advanced by defendants in their challenge to the restitution order compels its reversal. The trial court did not err in fashioning its restitution remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">TV. <em>Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Defendants\u2019 final contention relates to the trial court\u2019s determination that the statute of limitations had not run with respect to early violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The statute of limitations on the statutory claims is four years. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17208.) Plaintiff brought this action in December 1995. The trial court nevertheless imposed liability on defendants for statutory violations committed as early as January 1987. The court did so based on its finding that defendants conspired with the dealers to violate the Ordinance and the statute. The court explained: \u201cThe statute of limitations does not begin to run on wrongful acts committed pursuant to a civil conspiracy until completion of the last overt act of that conspiracy. [Citation.] ... Therefore, the statute of limitations has not begun to run on defendants\u2019 violations of [Business and Professions Code section] 17200 because defendants are still enforcing their unlawful long-term leases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Defendants assert that the trial court erred in finding a civil conspiracy, because it ignored the requirement of knowledge of the wrongfulness of the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">A. <em>Conspiracy: General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">\u201cConspiracy is not a cause of action, but a legal doctrine that imposes liability on persons who, although not actually committing a tort themselves, share with the immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 510-511 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d 454].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Liability for civil conspiracy generally requires three elements: (1) formation of the conspiracy (an agreement to commit wrongful acts); (2) operation of the conspiracy (commission of the wrongful acts); and (3) damage resulting from operation of the conspiracy. <em>(Applied Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 511; <em>Kidron v. Movie Acquisition Corp. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1581 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 752].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In addition to those three elements, it has been said that participants in a conspiracy also must know that their conduct is wrongful. As our high court has stated, one harmed by a conspiracy \u201cis entitled to damages from those defendants who concurred in the tortious scheme with knowledge of its unlawful purpose.\u201d <em>(Wyatt </em>v. <em>Union Mortgage Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 773, 784 [157 Cal.Rptr. 392, 598 P.2d 45]; see also, e.g., <em>Kidron v. Movie Acquisition Corp., supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1582 [conspiring defendants must have actual knowledge of the wrongful nature of the scheme].) However, to the extent that knowledge of the scheme\u2019s unlawful purpose is required, it may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances, including the nature of the acts done, the relation of the parties, and the interests of the defendants. <em>(Wyatt </em>v. <em>Union Mortgage Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 785. Cf., <em>People v. Tierney </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 1, 5-6 [61 Cal.Rptr. 164] [in criminal indictment for conspiracy to violate false advertising and other laws, the evidence \u201cwarrants the inference that all respondents knew that what they were doing was wrong\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">B. <em>Effect on Limitations Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Proof of a civil conspiracy triggers the \u201clast overt act\u201d doctrine. <em>(Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 786.) Under that doctrine, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the final act in furtherance of the conspiracy has been committed. <em>(Ibid, </em>[statute did not begin to run until defendant\u2019s collection of the final loan payment shortly before trial].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">C. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">1. <em>Knowledge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Here, the trial court rejected defendants\u2019 contention that knowledge of wrongfulness was required to support the finding of a civil conspiracy. Noting that the statutory violation is a strict liability offense, the court concluded: \u201cThere is no need to prove that the parties knew that the act was illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Assuming (without deciding) that that conclusion was erroneous, the record nevertheless contains sufficient evidence from which such knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of the scheme\u2019s unlawfulness may be inferred. (See, e.g., <em>Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 785.) Thus, for example, there was testimony that defendants used the long-term dealer leases to avoid rent control. There was also testimony that the dealers and defendants\u2019 employees even signed such leases retroactively. The record also demonstrates that the economic interests of the defendants were served by the scheme. In short, under all the circumstances, defendants\u2019 knowledge of the unlawfulness of their actions may be inferred. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">2. <em>Accrual of the statute of limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The evidence provides adequate support for the trial court\u2019s finding of a civil conspiracy. Each month\u2019s collection of excess rent constitutes an overt act in furtherance of that conspiracy. (Cf., e.g., <em>Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 786 [collection of each loan payment].) Defendants were still collecting unlawful rent right up through the trial of this case. Thus, when the trial court issued its statement of decision, defendants had not yet committed the last overt act of their conspiracy and the statute of limitations had not yet accrued. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Under these circumstances, the trial court acted properly in imposing statutory liability for actions occurring as early as January 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">We find no merit in any of defendants\u2019 contentions. Our conclusions as to each may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">I. As properly construed, the Ordinance requires actual and personal residency in a mobilehome as a predicate to exemption from rent control. The dealer leases failed to meet the residency requirement. The court thus correctly determined that the dealer leases violate the Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">II. Notwithstanding the Petris Act, the trial court was authorized to adjudicate the statutory violations and to impose civil penalties in the first instance. The court did not err in calculating the number of statutory violations, nor was the resulting penalty excessive in amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">TIT. The trial court was not required to rescind the leases as a predicate to its statutory restitution remedy. Its restitution formula properly considered the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">IV. Given the evidence of a civil conspiracy, the trial court acted properly in rejecting defendants\u2019 statute of limitations defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any mobilehome lot which is the subject of a rental agreement voluntarily entered into between a landlord and mobilehome owner where the rental agreement meets all of the following criteria: [B 1. The rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 1986. [B 2. The term of the rental agreement is in excess of twelve months\u2019 duration. [B 3. The mobilehome lot which is the subject of the rental agreement is used for the personal and actual residence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the mobilehome owner. Q] 4. The first paragraph of the rental agreement contains a provision notifying the mobilehome owner that the mobilehome lot will be exempt from the provisions of this chapter, [f] B. This exclusion shall apply only for the duration of the term of the rental agreement and any uninterrupted, continuous extensions thereof. If the term of the rental agreement is not extended and no new rental agreement meeting the above-stated criteria is entered into, this chapter shall immediately become applicable to the mobilehome lot and the last rental rate charged for the lot under the immediately preceding rental agreement shall be the rent for purposes of determining the base rent under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b116-14\"> Section 2000 reads in full as follows: \u201cA. Any waiver of purported waiver by a mobilehome owner or mobilehome tenant of rights granted under this chapter prior to the time when such rights may be exercised shall be void as contrary to public policy, except as provided in Section 17.22.370. [|] B. It shall be unlawful for a landlord to require or attempt to require, as a condition of tenancy in a mobilehome park, a mobilehome owner, mobilehome tenant, prospective mobilehome owner, or prospective mobilehome tenant to waive in a lease or rental agreement the rights granted to a mobilehome owner or mobilehome tenant by this chapter. Q] C. It shall be unlawful for a landlord to deny or threaten to deny tenancy in a mobilehome park to any person on account of such person\u2019s refusal to enter into a lease or rental agreement or any other agreement under which such person would waive the rights granted to a mobilehome owner or mobilehome tenant by this chapter. [][] D. Nothing in this section shall preclude a mobilehome park landlord and a mobilehome owner, mobilehome tenant, prospective mobilehome owner or prospective mobilehome tenant from entering into a lease described in Section 17.22.370 provided that such lease or rental agreement is not procured by a requirement that it be entered into as a condition of tenancy in the mobilehome park and is not procured under threat of a denial of tenancy in the mobilehome park.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> To the extent that defendants\u2019 policy argument relies on their assessment of the lessees\u2019 sophistication, we observe that both local and state enactments provide certain protections to prospective long-term lessees.

(See \u00a7 17.22.135.) The 1992 memorandum concluded that after a dealer pullout, the affected lot is no longer subject to rent control. That conclusion rests in part on the determination that the dealers pay a storage fee\u2014not \u201crent\u201d\u2014as they do not receive \u201chousing services.\u201d (See, \u00a7\u00a7 17.22.240 [defining \u201crent\"], 17.22.140 [defining \u201chousing services\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\"> As Witkin observes: \u201c[Business and Professions Code section] 17200 et seq. do not bear a legislative title or name.
