J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2j\">Angela M. appeals from the juvenile court\u2019s February 28, 2002 order committing her to the California Youth Authority (CYA) following a finding that she had violated various terms and conditions of her probation. She contends the court abused its discretion when it ordered CYA commitment and that it erred in failing to make findings regarding her educational needs. We affirm the order of commitment but remand the matter to the juvenile court for a determination whether a special needs evaluation should be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">In May 1999 then 14-year-old Angela was reported to school authorities by a fellow student for possessing narcotics on campus. Angela later threatened the student. A delinquency petition was filed on July 13, 1999, alleging Angela had made criminal threats against the student. Angela admitted the allegation and was declared a ward of the juvenile court. The court ordered her home on probation. Angela admitted violating the terms of her probation on several occasions in 2000. She was ultimately removed from her home and placed in an appropriate facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">On July 28, 2000, Angela ran away from the court-ordered placement and an arrest warrant was issued. Following her detention by police, a new delinquency petition was filed alleging Angela had committed vehicle theft, receiving stolen property and driving without a license. Angela admitted she had received stolen property (a car) and the court sustained the petition as to that count. Angela was ordered to remain a ward of the court and placed in the community camp program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">In April 2001 Angela was released on furlough and placed on home supervision. She again repeatedly violated the terms of her probation. In June 2001 her furlough was revoked and she was returned to camp. Following her release, Angela continued to violate the terms of her probation. A supplemental petition filed September 20, 2001, alleged Angela had violated her probation by ignoring her curfew, missing school, and failing to meet with her probation officer. The petition requested the court consider placing Angela at the Dorothy Kirby Center (DKC), a secure facility, because she had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>in open facilities. Angela refused to appear in juvenile court and a no-bail warrant was issued for her arrest. She was taken into custody on November 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">At the probation revocation hearing the probation officer testified that, while on furlough, Angela had left home several times for protracted periods. Angela often associated with young men her mother characterized as gang members and violated her curfew. Her school attendance was poor. When Angela did attend, she was so disruptive she was ultimately expelled. She also missed scheduled appointments with her probation officer. Since filing the petition, the probation officer learned that Angela had tested positive for methamphetamine and was hospitalized at one point after overdosing on narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Angela testified on her own behalf and admitted the petition\u2019s allegations. Angela explained she had been using methamphetamines on a daily basis since she was 14 years old and also regularly sold methamphetamines supplied to her by friends who were gang members. Angela testified that, since her arrest, she was drug-free, attending school daily in juvenile hall and earning \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d grades.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">The probation officer recommended Angela be committed to the CYA based on her repeated failures at various placements and because \u201call resources at the county juvenile level were exhausted.\u201d DKC was no longer an option because its screening committee had rejected Angela as ineligible. The probation officer testified he had contacted officials at CYA Ventura School for Girls, who concluded Angela could be immediately placed in its mental health program, which offered intensive 12-month drug treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">Dr. Haig J. Kojian, a court-appointed psychologist who evaluated Angela and submitted a report to the court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expressed a contrary view, recommending Angela be placed in a psychiatric/treatment-based facility rather than CYA. As a provisional diagnosis he opined Angela\u2019s \u201cprincipal problem\u201d was \u201cextensive drag use,\u201d which may have been an \u201cattempt on her part to self-medicate\u201d chronic symptoms of bipolar disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He concluded Angela required \u201caggressive intervention, primarily in a drug-rehabilitation facility.\u201d Additionally, he indicated that she should \u201cbe assessed to determine if trials on mood stabilizing medication would help her control symptoms of hyperactivity, hypo-mania, fidgetiness, racing thoughts, and insomnia.\u201d Dr. Kojian also reported \u201cshe must undergo an IEP [Individualized Education Program]\u201d assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court determined Angela had violated her probation and sustained the petition. The court found Angela had failed on probation at the local level in open placements and had continued to reoffend. The court observed Angela is a \u201cdrug addict\u201d and her \u201caddiction is profound.\u201d Furthermore, her testimony and behavior demonstrated \u201cshe is entrenched in the gang lifestyle.\u201d The court concluded this combination of drug addiction and gang entrenchment was best addressed by the 12-month intensive program at the CYA, which also treats mental health problems. Accordingly, the court ordered Angela committed to the CYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">1. <em>Angela\u2019s Commitment to the CYA Was Not an Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">The appellate court reviews a commitment decision for abuse of discretion, indulging all reasonable inferences to support the juvenile court\u2019s decision. <em>(In re Robert H. </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1317, 1329-1330 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 899]; <em>In re Asean D. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 467, 473 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 572].) Nonetheless, there must be evidence in the record demonstrating both a probable benefit to the minor by a CYA commitment and the inappropriateness or ineffectiveness of less restrictive alternatives. <em>(In re Pedro M. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 550, 555 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 839]; <em>In re Teofilio A. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 571, 576-577 [258 Cal.Rptr. 540].) A CYA commitment may be considered, however, without previous resort to less restrictive placements. <em>(In re Asean D., </em>at p. 473; <em>In re Tyrone O. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 145, 151 [257 Cal.Rptr. 134].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">Angela contends the juvenile court abused its discretion by committing her to CYA because the court erroneously concluded she was not eligible for DKC placement. Angela asserts the screening committee report states she was found unsuitable for DKC \u201cprimarily\u201d because she lacked appropriate psychiatric \u201cAxis-V diagnosis.\u201d Angela notes Dr. Kojian made an \u201cAxis-V diagnosis\u201d and suggests the screening committee must not have seen it. She urges us to remand the case and order the juvenile court to have DKC reevaluate her placement in light of Dr. Kojian\u2019s diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">Contrary to Angela\u2019s claim, she was not rejected by DKC \u201cprimarily\u201d for lack of an appropriate psychiatric \u201cAxis-V diagnosis.\u201d The absence of the diagnosis was only one of six enumerated reasons for the screening committee\u2019s conclusion. The committee also determined Angela was not motivated for treatment, was too aggressive and impulse driven and needed a structured behavior modification approach prior to group therapy. The committee made the additional comment that Angela was \u201ctoo defiant, gang entrenched, and uncooperative for any chance of succeeding at DKC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>The juvenile court was well aware of DKC\u2019s program and Angela\u2019s lack of amenability to treatment at this facility. From the screening committee\u2019s comments, the probation officer\u2019s testimony and Angela\u2019s demeanor and testimony, the court reasonably concluded DKC could not accommodate her needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Moreover, the rest of the record before the juvenile court essentially compels CYA commitment. Angela was a very troubled 17 year old at the time of disposition. The court committed her to the CYA only after carefully considering her lengthy drug history, heavy gang involvement, criminal record, behavioral problems, numerous probation violations and repeated unauthorized absences from placements. DKC was unavailable to Angela, and placement was not a realistic option. Commitment to the CYA in this case was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">2. <em>Remand Is Necessary To Permit the Juvenile Court To Make Proper Findings Regarding Angela\u2019s Educational Needs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">Education Code section 56000 declares that \u201call individuals with exceptional needs have a right to participate in free appropriate public education ....\u201d \u201cIndividuals with exceptional needs\u201d includes any child who is \u201c[identified by an individualized education program [DEP] team as a child with a disability,\u201d as defined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whose impairment \u201crequires instruction, services, or both which cannot be provided with modification of the regular school program\u201d and who meets certain other prescribed eligibility criteria. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 56026, subds. (a), (b), (c) &amp; (d).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A child qualifies as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>individual with exceptional needs if the EBP team determines \u201cthe degree of the pupil\u2019s impairment ... requires special education in one or more of the program options authorized by Section 56361 of the Education Code.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7 3030.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">California Rules of Court, rule 1493(e)(5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> implements this legislative mandate to provide free special education services to all eligible children by directing that the juvenile court, when declaring a child a ward of the court, \u201cmust consider the educational needs of the child ...,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, prior to committing Angela to the CYA, the juvenile court had a duty to consider or determine whether Angela had special educational needs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">The juvenile court in this case was clearly on notice that Angela may have special educational needs. Dr. Kojian concluded she was suffering from bipolar disorder that \u201cmay have been affecting this young lady for some time, and preventing her from maintaining stable functioning in the community\u201d and believed she may also be experiencing symptoms associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>ADHD.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, Dr. Kojian specifically recommended that Angela \u201cundergo an IEP\u201d\u2014that is, that she be evaluated by education professionals to determine whether she had special educational needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">We cannot agree with the People that Angela\u2019s drug addiction and defiance are separable from her learning process and that the programs at the CYA will necessarily address her educational needs without an IEP. Although Angela\u2019s learning improved in juvenile hall, she testified the change resulted only because she was permitted to work alone, outside the classroom. Moreover, Dr. Kojian\u2019s report plainly indicates additional information is needed before a proper determination of Angela\u2019s educational needs can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">Although the record indicates special attention to Angela\u2019s education needs was appropriate, the juvenile court did not mention this issue when committing her to the CYA. Remand is necessary to permit the juvenile court to make proper findings, on a more fully developed record, regarding Angela\u2019s educational needs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">The matter is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to determine whether an evaluation of Angela\u2019s special educational needs should be conducted, with the court\u2019s findings to be forwarded to the Director of the California Youth Authority in an amended commitment order together with Angela\u2019s individualized education program if one is prepared. The order committing Angela to the California Youth Authority is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">Johnson, J., and Munoz (Aurelio), J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1161-9\"> At the disposition hearing the court indicated it had read and considered Dr. Kojian\u2019s report, as well as the probation officer\u2019s reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1163-8\"> The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, commonly known as IDEA, requires states that receive federal funding for special education programs in elementary and secondary schools to adopt and enforce a policy that assures all children with disabilities the right to a free, appropriate public education.
