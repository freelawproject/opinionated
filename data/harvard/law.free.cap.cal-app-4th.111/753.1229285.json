J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acr\">In this dependency proceeding, the alleged father of the minor (appellant) appeals from the juvenile court\u2019s order terminating his parental rights. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 366.26, 395; undesignated statutory references are to this code.) Appellant contends the juvenile court erred by failing to order paternity testing and by failing to appoint counsel to represent him.  We conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory provisions for giving an alleged father notice and an opportunity to elevate his paternal status mandates reversal in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">A dependency petition was filed in June 2002 concerning the newborn minor, after the minor and the mother tested positive for methamphetamines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>at the time of the minor\u2019s birth. According to the petition, the mother had failed to reunify with six other children, and had tested positive for methamphetamines when two of these children were bom.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Initially, the mother identified Joe L. as the minor\u2019s father. However, at the detention hearing, the mother advised the juvenile court through counsel that another individual was the minor\u2019s father. Efforts by the social services agency to contact this individual before the detention and jurisdictional hearings were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant appeared for the first time at the jurisdictional hearing in August 2002 and indicated he might be the minor\u2019s father. Prior to addressing appellant\u2019s claim of possible paternity, the juvenile court sustained the petition, denied reunification services and set a hearing to select and implement a permanent plan for the minor pursuant to section 366.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Next, in response to the juvenile court\u2019s inquiry, appellant acknowledged he had never attempted to marry the minor\u2019s mother, had never lived with her and was not present at the minor\u2019s birth. According to appellant, he \u201cfound out about everything\u201d when he spoke to the social worker the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Appellant was provided a \u201cpaternity program packet,\u201d which the juvenile court described as \u201cdocuments that may be able to assist you in establishing paternity, if you\u2019re interested in doing so.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court advised appellant that he \u201cneed[ed] to work immediately toward establishing [his] paternity,\u201d after which consideration would be given to offering him reunification services. The court instructed appellant: \u201cWork quickly, take care of that paperwork, ask the DA to test you and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d Also, according to the minutes from this proceeding, appellant was served with \u201c[w]rit [Notification in open [c]ourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">According to the report for the section 366.26 hearing, appellant subsequently contacted the social worker several times and asked her to make a paternity test appointment for him. After consulting with county counsel, the social worker \u201cadvised [appellant] to follow the directions in the paternity packet and contact the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d The social worker also sent appellant a letter instructing him \u201cto contact the ... District Attorney\u2019s Office and tell them that you believe you might be the father of Paul [H.], bom [minor\u2019s date of birth], ... [and] that you would like to be paternity tested.\u201d A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>letter from the social worker to appellant three weeks later stated she had received his message indicating he was unable to locate a telephone number for the district attorney\u2019s office in the paternity packet. In the letter, the social worker suggested that appellant obtain the number from the telephone directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The social worker reported that appellant contacted the \u201c[p]rogram [m]anager for [adoptions\u201d a few days later and said \u201cthat he did not know where the District Attorney\u2019s Office was located and that he wanted a paternity test arranged for him.\u201d He was told he would need to arrange for paternity testing on his own because the court had not ordered testing. Appellant was provided an address and telephone number and was told to immediately arrange for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Shortly thereafter, an attorney contacted the social worker on appellant\u2019s behalf to confirm there was no order for paternity testing. The attorney told the social worker that appellant would contact her once an appointment for testing had been arranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">According to the social worker, she received a letter from appellant approximately one month later requesting \u201csimultaneous testing of himself and the [minor] as he did not trust the Department to produce DNA from the [minor] ....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant requested he be contacted by certified mail regarding the arrangements for testing because his \u201cpast experience working with [the social worker] on this case have <em>[sic] </em>achieved no successful outcome.\u201d A subsequent letter to appellant notified him that his request was denied, and he was again provided the address and telephone number to contact to arrange for paternity testing. The letter also stated that appellant could not have contact with the minor until his paternity was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Meanwhile, the minor had been placed in a prospective adoptive home and the social worker deemed it \u201chighly likely\u201d he would be adopted if parental rights were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">At the section 366.26 hearing in December 2002, appellant reported he had taken \u201c[a]s many steps as\u201d he could to establish paternity, but he \u201cke[pt] going in circles\u201d in his efforts to complete the testing. Appellant said he wanted to find out whether he was the minor\u2019s father and that \u201c[f]rom the first day [he had] always wanted the kid as [his].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Appellant asked the juvenile court to accept an envelope containing documentation of his efforts to complete paternity testing. After finding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>minor adoptable and terminating parental rights, the juvenile court directed the court clerk to \u201c[tjake [appellant\u2019s] envelope,\u201d and noted for the record \u201cthat the court clerk has accepted the folder\u201d and would \u201cmake copies for counsel.\u201d The record does not reflect that the court reviewed any of the documents presented by appellant during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Appellant\u2019s documentation included a log of his efforts to set up paternity testing, which efforts included numerous calls to social workers, adoptions workers, the district attorney\u2019s office and the department of child support services (DCSS). According to the log, appellant called the number provided by the adoptions worker to set up paternity testing and was told he needed a case number to initiate testing. Appellant\u2019s wife spoke to someone at county adoptions who \u201cconfirmed\u201d that appellant was not named in their file as a possible father. Appellant then left a message with the director of the social services agency to determine \u201chow ... to go about setting up [an] appointment.\u201d He also made numerous calls to the district attorney\u2019s office and the court but was unable to obtain any further information.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Appellant corresponded with DCSS by e-mail, requesting \u201cspecific information to help [him] schedule a DNA test.\u201d The correspondence contained appellant\u2019s name, address and birth date, and the juvenile court case number, and stated that appellant had attempted to call their office \u201ca number of times ... with no success.\u201d DCSS responded by e-mail, stating they were unable to locate \u201cany such case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s wife attempted to call the number left in a message from DCSS, and was informed, presumably by a recorded message, that the \u201coffice call volume was too heavy, [the] message required a return call later, [and she] was not able to leave a voicemail message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Appellant confirmed he had consulted an attorney who advised him to contact the adoptions worker to schedule paternity testing. He also confirmed the adoptions worker would not set up a test without a court order. Appellant indicated that, eventually, he received a letter from the adoptions worker providing a telephone number to call to set up paternity testing, which was the same telephone number appellant\u2019s wife had called the previous month without results. Appellant\u2019s wife again tried calling the number and was told they \u201ccould not pull up information on [appellant] or [the minor].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Also included in appellant\u2019s documents was a letter from appellant to the juvenile court. In the letter, appellant explained he had met the minor\u2019s mother while he was working as a food vendor at a ballpark, and they \u201cgot together\u201d the same evening and \u201chad sex.\u201d According to the letter, the minor\u2019s mother called him a few weeks later and told him \u201cshe missed her period\u201d but, later, she informed him \u201cshe had gotten her period.\u201d Subsequently, she told appellant she was pregnant. Later, appellant found out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the mother had moved to Los Angeles. He had no contact with her until July 2002, at which time she informed him she believed he was the minor\u2019s father. When appellant tried to visit the minor at the mother\u2019s residence, he learned of the dependency proceedings, after which he called the social worker and attended the court hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In addition to his log and letter, the documents presented by appellant to the juvenile court included his e-mail correspondence to DCSS and the return e-mail correspondence from DCSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Appellant seeks reversal of the order terminating his parental rights, urging \u201cnumerous violations of his federal and state constitutional and statutory rights as an alleged father ....\u201d We directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the issue of whether the juvenile court failed to comply with the procedures outlined in section 316.2 and California Rules of Court, rule 1413(e)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for determining paternity, and the appropriate appellate relief in the event of noncompliance. We conclude that the juvenile court failed to comply with the provisions of section 316.2 and rule 1413 and that, under the circumstances presented here, such noncompliance requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Initially, we accept respondent\u2019s concession that appellant has standing in this appeal. \u201c[0]nly parties of record may appeal.\u201d <em>(In re Joseph G. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 712, 715 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 915].)  An alleged father in a dependency proceeding does not become a party \u201cuntil he appearfs] and assertfs] a position.\u201d <em>(In re Emily R. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1356 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 285]; see <em>In re Joseph G., supra, </em>at pp. 714, 716.) Here, appellant took immediate steps to become a party once he was notified of the dependency proceedings. He contacted the social worker, appeared at the next court hearing, communicated to the court that he might be the minor\u2019s father and attempted to complete paternity testing. Under such circumstances, appellant has standing on appeal to raise issues concerning his parental interest in the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Respondent argues the appeal should be dismissed insofar as it seeks paternity testing and reunification services because appellant failed to file a petition for an extraordinary writ pursuant to rule 39. IB after the dispositional hearing, at which a section 366.26 hearing was set. However, at that hearing, the juvenile court advised appellant it would consider reunification services if appellant established paternity. It was the juvenile court\u2019s failure to follow statutory procedures <em>after </em>this hearing\u2014at which appellant\u2019s existence as an alleged father first became known\u2014that gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>We turn to the merits of this appeal. Although appellant raises numerous claims regarding his due process rights, appellant\u2019s status as the minor\u2019s alleged father limited the rights to which he was entitled.  \u201cThe Family Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code differentiate between \u2018alleged,\u2019 \u2018natural,\u2019 and \u2018presumed\u2019 fathers. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re O. S. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1406 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 571].) The extent to which a <em>father </em>may participate in dependency proceedings and his rights in those proceedings are dependent on his paternal status. \u201cA man who may be the father of a child, but whose biological paternity has not been established, or, in the alternative, has not achieved presumed father status, is an \u2018alleged\u2019 father. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Zacharia D. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 435, 449, fn. 15 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 862 P.2d 751].) As it had not yet been determined whether appellant was the minor\u2019s biological father, and as appellant had not requested consideration as a presumed father or a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father, his status was that of an alleged father throughout these proceedings. <em>(In re O. S., supra, </em>at p. 1410; <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 838 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">As an alleged father, appellant had limited due process and statutory rights. \u201cAlleged fathers have less rights in dependency proceedings than biological and presumed fathers. [Citation.] An alleged father does not have a current interest in a child because his paternity has not yet been established. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re O. S., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1406.) As such, an alleged father is not entitled to appointed counsel or reunification services. (\u00a7\u00a7 317, 361.5, subd. (a); <em>In re Zacharia D., supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th 435, 448-449; <em>In re O. S., supra, </em>at p. 1406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Due process for an alleged father requires only that the alleged father be given notice and \u201can opportunity to appear and assert a position and attempt to change his paternity status. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re O. S., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1408.) The statutory procedure that protects these limited due process rights is set forth in section 316.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Section 316.2, subdivision (a), requires the juvenile court to conduct an inquiry as to the identity of all presumed or alleged fathers. Section 316.2, subdivision (b), describes the juvenile court\u2019s duties once an alleged father has been identified. It provides: \u201c[E]ach alleged father shall be provided notice at his last and usual place of abode by certified mail return receipt requested alleging that he is or could be the father of the child. The notice shall state that the child is the subject of proceedings under Section 300 and that the proceedings could result in the termination of parental rights and adoption of the child. Judicial Council form Paternity-Waiver of Rights (JV-505) shall be included with the notice....\u201d (See also rule 1413(g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Judicial Council form JV-505 is entitled \u201cStatement Regarding Paternity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The form has check boxes next to preprinted statements through which an alleged father can indicate his position with regard to paternity and representation by counsel. Concerning paternity, the form provides the alleged father with the following options: He can deny he is the father of the subject child; he can indicate he does not know if he is the father and can either consent to or request paternity testing; he can indicate he believes he is the child\u2019s father and request that the court enter a judgment of paternity; or, he can indicate that he has already established paternity by either a voluntary declaration or a judgment of paternity. The Judicial Council form also contains an advisement to alleged fathers regarding reunification, the right to a court trial to determine paternity and the right to be represented by counsel at such trial. Further, the form instructs the alleged father: \u201cIf you wish the court to determine paternity or if you wish to admit that you are the father of the child, complete this form according to your intentions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">If a man appears in a dependency matter and requests a finding of paternity through Judicial Council form JV-505, \u201cthe court shall determine whether or not he is the biological father of the child.\u201d (Rule 1413(h).) The court may make such determination either by ordering blood testing or based on testimony, declarations or statements by the mother and alleged father. (Rule 1413(e)(1) &amp; (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The procedures set forth in section 316.2, subdivision (b), and rule 1413 provide an alleged father with the notice to which he is entitled and the means by which to \u201cassert a position and attempt to change his paternity status.\u201d <em>(In re O. S., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1408.) Although appellant was not entitled to all of the constitutional and statutory rights of biological or presumed fathers, he was entitled to the opportunity to establish paternity that is afforded by these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">There is no evidence in the record that appellant was served with Judicial Council form JV-505, either by certified mail as required by section 316.2, subdivision (b), or otherwise. Thus, he was denied access to a procedure by which he could have compelled court-ordered paternity testing, as well as assistance from the social services agencies in arranging for such testing. Instead, appellant\u2019s extensive, if ineffective, efforts to obtain paternity testing on his own were met with repeated roadblocks and, ultimately, were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">There was minimal information before the juvenile court regarding appellant\u2019s circumstances and background. It appears the social worker never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>interviewed appellant and provided no information to the juvenile court concerning his viability as a custodian for the minor. We cannot assume, based on this dearth of information, that had appellant established his paternity and been appointed counsel, he would not have received reunification services. (See \u00a7 361.5, subd. (a); <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 816.) Consequently, we conclude appellant was prejudiced by the juvenile court\u2019s failure to follow the procedures contained in section 316.2, subdivision (b), and rule 1413.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The order terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to comply with the provisions set forth in section 316.2 and rule 1413.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Nicholson, J., and Kolkey, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\"> The \u201cpaternity program packet\u201d is not contained in the record on appeal, but the parties do not contend it included the required Judicial Council form discussed herein, <em>post. </em>Appellant\u2019s motion for production of additional evidence in support of his appeal, consisting of \u201ctrue and correct copies\u201d of \u201ccertain documents\u201d he received at the jurisdictional hearing, was denied by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> The letter was dated approximately one month earlier than it was reportedly received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-11\"> Further references to rules are to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\"> A copy of Judicial Council form JV-505 is attached as an appendix, <em>post, </em>pages 763-764.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> As we resolve this matter based on the juvenile court\u2019s failure to follow the procedures set forth in section 316.2, subdivision (b), and rule 1413, it is unnecessary further to address appellant\u2019s claims that the juvenile court should have ordered paternity testing sua sponte, that the court should have advised him of his \u201cright\u201d to counsel, that the court should have continued the section 366.26 hearing, and that appellant was prematurely denied reunification services before his paternity was established.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
