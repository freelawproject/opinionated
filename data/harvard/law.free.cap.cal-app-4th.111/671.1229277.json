(Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940 et seq.) After a court trial, she failed to recover on her complaint. On appeal, plaintiff contends that the court erroneously converted a burden of production into a burden of persuasion by misapplying <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792 [36 L.Ed.2d 668, 93 S.Ct. 1817]. She further challenges a protective order restricting her access to the personnel records of other nurses at Elmwood. We find no error in the court\u2019s application of the law and therefore affirm the judgment in the County\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The County has appealed from a postjudgment order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion to tax costs. We agree with the County that the discretion to award costs to a prevailing defendant is not limited to cases in which the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. We therefore reverse the order and remand for the court to exercise its discretion with regard to the claimed costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Plaintiff, who is one-half Filipina, was an experienced acute-care nurse before starting her employment at Elmwood in 1996. She was hired to work \u201chalf code\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the evening shift and was classified as a clinical nurse n. Jeannie Haskins, the nurse manager, had hired plaintiff at the recommendation of Marilyn Thornton, assistant nurse manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Haskins and Thornton, both Caucasian, initially supervised plaintiff. On April 7, 1997, Thornton gave plaintiff a positive performance evaluation and recommended that she be promoted to clinical nurse m within the next 12 months. On July 18, 1997, plaintiff requested such a promotion, but Thornton told her that she needed a few more months\u2019 experience as a charge nurse and time serving as a preceptor nurse before receiving a recommendation for promotion. Thornton stated that she would revisit the request in November, and indeed, she did make that recommendation on November 4, 1997. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff received the promotion, which took effect December 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>On April 6, 1998, plaintiff filed her first Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that the delay in her promotion constituted discrimination on the basis of race (Asian) and national origin (Filipina). She also alleged retaliation because of her union activities. In January 1998 plaintiff had been elected vice-president of the employees union, a position that allowed her to help other nurses who had complained of discrimination at Elmwood. Plaintiff further alleged that she had been falsely accused of a medication error as the result of a \u201cset-up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">At trial Thornton testified that the delay in the promotion was unrelated to plaintiff\u2019s being Filipina. She knew that plaintiff was a union vice-president and in that capacity worked with \u201cunhappy nurses\u201d but she was unaware of the assistance plaintiff might have been giving to anyone pursuing discrimination claims. Thus, she said, the promotion delay had nothing to do with plaintiff\u2019s opposition to discrimination against either her or other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">During the two years before this discrimination charge, plaintiff had received three oral \u201ccounselings\u201d\u2014private discussions about minor mistakes\u2014and one written counseling, a memorandum about a more serious error. She had also received a written \u201cEmployee Unfavorable Report\u201d from Haskins after she erroneously gave a patient a tetanus toxoid shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Over the next two years, plaintiff received an oral counseling from Thornton; an oral counseling from her new assistant nurse manager, Juno Vega (a Filipino); and a written counseling from Haskins. In December 1999 her application was rejected for a \u201cfour-fifths\u201d position,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was given to another Filipina nurse by Haskins\u2019s replacement, Remy Panlilio (also Filipina).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">On March 29, 2000, plaintiff filed a second Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC, again alleging racial discrimination and retaliation for her opposition to discriminatory practices and for her filing of a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. In October 2000 she filed a third Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC, alleging retaliatory harassment based on her race, her national origin, and her 1998 charge of discrimination. Since the last filing she had received three oral counselings from Vega.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">At trial plaintiff testified that between her first and second EEOC charges, she was closely monitored, denied requests for more hours, and subjected to undeserved discipline, daily hostility, and frequent harassment by Panlilio and Vega. Between the second and third charges, she said, she was harassed and harangued every day by Panlilio and Vega. Panlilio and Vega denied all of these accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>On November 22, 2000, plaintiff received an oral counseling from Vega. Both raised their voices during the 15-minute meeting. Plaintiff left the counseling session feeling ill, and she telephoned her husband for a ride home. While waiting for the ride, she had her blood pressure taken. It was elevated, and she felt dizzy, weak, and nauseated. She was later diagnosed as having suffered a hypertensive episode, and she went on disability leave from Elmwood. By the time of trial she had still not returned to work because she was afraid of another medical \u201cincident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint in December 2000, alleging employment discrimination, retaliation, and harassment in violation of the FEHA, Government Code section 12940, subdivisions (a), (f), (h), and (i). Following a nine-day trial, the court stated the following findings. First, plaintiff had established a prima facie case of intentional discrimination in the 1998 delay in promotion, but the County had established a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the delay, and plaintiff had failed to prove that this reason was pretextual. Plaintiff had also failed to establish a causal link between the delay and the \u201c(unsubstantiated) allegations of discrimination set forth in her first EEOC Charge of Discrimination.\u201d As to the denial of the four-fifths position, plaintiff likewise had shown a prima facie case of discrimination, but again the County had rebutted plaintiff\u2019s showing by clear and convincing evidence. The court also found that plaintiff had failed to show a causal link between the denial of her request and the charge of discrimination and retaliation set forth in the second EEOC Charge of Discrimination. Finally, the court found that plaintiff had established a prima facie case of retaliation and harassment, but the County had rebutted her showing by clear and convincing evidence, and there was no causal link between her complaints of discrimination and the \u201c(unsubstantiated) allegations of retaliation and harassment set forth in her three EEOC Charges of Discrimination.\u201d The court parenthetically noted that nurses of various races and nationalities had complained of preferential treatment at Elmwood, including some who believed that Filipino nurses were favored.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">1. <em>Standard of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In reaching its verdict the trial court applied the formula set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>411 U.S. 792 <em>(McDonnell Douglas). </em>Under that formula the plaintiff has the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. The plaintiff can meet this burden \u201cby showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>rejected; and (iv).that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of [plaintiff\u2019s] qualifications.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 802 [36 L.Ed.2d at p. 677].) If the plaintiff succeeds in establishing the prima facie case, a presumption of discrimination arises, and the burden shifts to the employer \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>(Ibid:, Texas Dept, of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 248, 253 [67 L.Ed.2d 207, 101 S.Ct. 1089]; <em>Guz </em>v. <em>Bechtel National, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 356 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089].) If the employer carries this burden, \u201cthe plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>(Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 253 [67 L.Ed.2d at p. 215].) That is, the plaintiff \u201cmust be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.\u201d <em>(McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>411 U.S. at p. 805 [36 L.Ed.2d at p. 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Plaintiff contends that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formula is strictly one of production, not of persuasion. In her view, once the County rebutted her prima facie case, she was required only to <em>produce </em>evidence that the proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination, not to negate completely the employer\u2019s explanation. Her only burden of proof, she argues, was to prove that \u201cbut for the discriminatory motive, the adverse employment actions would not have occurred.\u201d The trial court, however, \u201ctransform[ed]\u201d her burden of production into a burden of persuasion by compelling her to \u201caffirmatively prove that intentional discrimination and retaliation were the real reasons for the COUNTY\u2019S actions. This formulation sets the bar too high ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Plaintiff misunderstands her evidentiary obligation.  Once the employer succeeds in carrying its burden of production, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, <em>including </em>the discrimination presumption, <em>disappears. (Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 356.) The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to <em>prove </em>that the employer\u2019s proffered justification is mere pretext. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[Although the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>presumption shifts the burden of <em>production </em>to the defendant, \u2018[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>(St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 502, 507 [125 L.Ed.2d 407, 416, 113 S.Ct. 2742], quoting <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 253 [67 L.Ed.2d at p. 215].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Plaintiff thus retained the burden of convincing the court, as trier of fact, \u201cthat she has been the victim of intentional discrimination. She may succeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>(Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256 [67 L.Ed.2d 207, 217].) Although plaintiff initially presented sufficient evidence of discrimination to establish her prima facie case, that burden was \u201cnot onerous.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 253.) In determining that plaintiff had met this initial burden with respect to the delay in the promotion and denial of the four-fifths position, the court went no further than to find that plaintiff was a member of a protected class who was qualified for the positions sought, and that she had suffered adverse employment action. These findings were consistent with the guidance offered by our Supreme Court in <em>Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at page 355.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They were not sufficient to compel a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, but only shifted the burden to the County. It is only when the employer fails to rebut the presumption that \u201c \u2018the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff because no issue of fact remains in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Guz, </em>at p. 355.) That did not happen here. In each instance, the court found that plaintiff\u2019s showing had been rebutted by the County\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The trial court went even further in its factual conclusions. It found that the County not only <em>produced </em>evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, but established those reasons by clear and convincing evidence. At that point the initial presumption of discrimination fell away and plaintiff was held to her ultimate burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the delay in her promotion and the denial of the four-fifths position amounted to discrimination. She failed to meet that burden. She also failed to convince the court that she had suffered harassment and retaliation based on her active opposition to alleged discriminatory practices at Elm-wood. No evidentiary error appears on this record. In light of this finding, we need not reach plaintiff\u2019s assertion that because the court misapplied the law, it erroneously found insufficient the evidence of discrimination and retaliation by the managing nurses at Elmwood.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>2. <em>Protective Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The County moved before trial for an order prohibiting disclosure of the personnel records of 65 Elmwood nurses. Plaintiff wanted this information to prove disparate treatment in the disciplinary process at Elmwood. Citing article I, section 1 of the California Constitution and Government Code section 6254, the County maintained that disclosure of these records would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The County noted that the affected nurses had objected to disclosure of their records, and that the court had already expressed the view that interrogatories would accomplish plaintiff\u2019s objective. The court granted the motion without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s seeking specific documents on a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court \u201cshould have balanced the competing interests\u201d involved. She maintains that she had no less intrusive means than to discover the nurses\u2019 disciplinary information. In some cases, she points out, a nurse might have been unaware that she was being disciplined when she received an oral counseling, or that an unfavorable report had been placed in her file after an incident. Consequently, plaintiff believes she should have been allowed to see the personnel records themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">As plaintiff acknowledges, the court\u2019s order is reviewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard. Accordingly, we may not set aside the order unless the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason\u2014that is, no judge could have reasonably reached the challenged result. <em>(Department of Motor Vehicles v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 363, 369 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 504]; <em>Cadiz Land Co. v. Rail Cycle </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 117 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 378].) \u201cWe could therefore disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, but if the trial court\u2019s conclusion was a reasonable exercise of its discretion, we are not free to substitute our discretion for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>(Avant! Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 876, 881-882 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Plaintiff has not met her burden on appeal to demonstrate an abuse of discretion. The court impliedly found that the balance between the nurses\u2019 privacy interests and plaintiff\u2019s need for the information was appropriately struck by the County\u2019s provision of interrogatory answers listing the type and number of disciplinary acts regarding nurses identified by race but not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>name. Plaintiff does not show that this determination exceeded the bounds of reason under the circumstances before the court. Whether we would have made a different decision is not controlling, since no abuse of discretion is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">3. <em>The County\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">After entry of the court\u2019s statement of decision, the County filed a cost bill requesting $13,104.41 for deposition costs, witness fees, and other amounts expended in defending the lawsuit. It did not seek attorney fees. Plaintiff moved to tax costs. The court granted the motion, citing <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Benco Building Services </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1383 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 53] <em>(Cummings).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u201c \u2018The right to recover costs exists solely by virtue of statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 989 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 953 P.2d 858]; <em>Davis v. KGO-T.V., Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 436, 439 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 452, 950 P.2d 567].) The County relies on the general provision for costs in Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), which states: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.\u201d Plaintiff responds that a statutory exception to this general provision does exist: Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b) (hereafter section 12965(b)) allows a court to exercise its <em>discretion </em>to award or deny costs to a prevailing defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">We disagree that section 12965(b) states an exception to the general rule of Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), as it does not expressly <em>disallow </em>recovery of costs by prevailing defendants. (Cf. <em>Murillo </em>v. <em>Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 985, 991 [mere absence of costs provision for prevailing sellers in Civ. Code \u00a7 1794, subd. (d) does not constitute exception to Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1032, subd. (b)].) The point is of no moment, however, as it is clear that section 12965(b) governs the costs at issue here. Plaintiff recognizes that this statute accords a trial court discretion to award costs. The only question is whether the court must find the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless before it may exercise that discretion to award costs to a prevailing FEHA defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">In <em>Cummings, </em>the Second Appellate District, Division Seven, overturned an award of attorney fees and costs as an abuse of discretion because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s age discrimination claim could not be deemed \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable or groundless.\u201d <em>(Cummings, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1390; see also <em>Rosenman v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &amp; Shapiro </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 859 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 903] [under <em>Cummings, </em>attorney fee award to successful FEHA defendant was abuse of discretion]; <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Pulsar Video Productions </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 918, 921-922 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 917] [attorney fee award proper where discrimination claim was frivolous, without foundation and brought in bad faith]; <em>Jersey v. John Muir Medical Center </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 814, 830-831 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 807] [award of fees based solely on lack of merit in plaintiff\u2019s case improper under <em>Cummings </em>standard].) The result in <em>Cummings </em>was derived from the holding in <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 412 [54 L.Ed.2d 648, 98 S.Ct. 694], where the United States Supreme Court fashioned a standard for awarding attorney fees to a prevailing defendant in an action under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court was considering section 706(k) of title VII, which allows a court in its discretion to grant \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d to the prevailing party. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the defendant is the prevailing party, the court held, the court may award attorney fees \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even [if] not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d <em>(Christiansburg Garment Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, supra, </em>434 U.S. at p. 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The <em>Cummings </em>court held that a trial court \u201cmust\u201d use the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard in exercising discretion to award \u201cfees and costs\u201d to a prevailing defendant. <em>(Cummings, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1387.) But the issue in <em>Christiansburg </em>was limited to the recovery of <em>attorney fees. </em>Costs outside of those fees were not at issue. In <em>Cummings, </em>the court did not segregate the two parts of the award in applying <em>Christiansburg, </em>but overturned them together.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the court even represented the <em>Christiansburg </em>holding as pertaining to both attorney fees and costs. <em>(Cummings supra, </em>at p. 1387 [\u201cThus, the ['Christiansburg] court found the standard for awarding prevailing defendants attorney fees and costs to be entirely different\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We find this blending of fees and costs to be unnecessary and inappropriate. Several federal courts themselves have refused to apply the <em>Christiansburg </em>test for recovery of defense attorney fees to ordinary litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>expenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Byers v. Dallas Morning News, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 2000) 209 F.3d 419, 430; <em>Cosgrove v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1999) 191 F.3d 98, 101-102; <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Colbert </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 692 F.2d 489, 490; <em>Nat. Organization for Women </em>v. <em>Bank of California </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 680 F.2d 1291, 1294.) \u201cThe rationale for this distinction is clear. Whereas the magnitude and unpredictability of attorney\u2019s fees would deter parties with meritorious claims from litigation, the costs of suit in the traditional sense are predictable, and, compared to the costs of attorneys\u2019 fees, small.\u201d <em>(Poe </em>v. <em>John Deere Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1982) 695 F.2d 1103, 1108.) \u201cIf the awarding of costs could be thwarted every time the unsuccessful party is a normal, average party and not a knave, Rule 54(d) would have little substance remaining.\u201d <em>(Popeil Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Schick Electric, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 516 F.2d 772, 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">By parity of reasoning, we believe that ordinary litigation costs are recoverable by a prevailing FEHA defendant even if the lawsuit was not frivolous, groundless, or unreasonable. Costs are recoverable under Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.) \u201cas a matter of course\u201d unless costs are expressly provided for by statute or rule, or the court in its discretion directs otherwise. Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) provides for costs \u201cas a matter of right\u201d absent express statutory provision, and section 12965(b) specifically allows \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u201d within the court\u2019s discretion.  That attorney fees are considered a component of costs when a statute refers to \u201ccosts and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)) does not compel the converse conclusion, that all costs must be treated like attorney fees. (Cf. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) [\u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee ... as part of the costs\u201d].) We therefore disagree with the <em>Cummings </em>court\u2019s extension of the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard for attorney fees to ordinary litigation expenses allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. A prevailing defendant should be able to recover these costs even if the plaintiff did not bring a frivolous, groundless, or unreasonable lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Although plaintiff maintains that the trial court \u201cappropriately exercised its statutorily conferred discretion ... in a close case,\u201d we draw a different conclusion from the court\u2019s statement of decision. In denying the County\u2019s request for costs, the court found the holding of <em>Cummings </em>to be \u201cdispositive\u201d and did not discuss any other factors in its reasoning. It thus appears that because plaintiff\u2019s action was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, the court believed it lacked authority to grant the County any costs.
