Finding no merit in either of these arguments, we affirm their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-18\">The acts that gave rise to the appellants\u2019 criminal convictions under 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1) took place on October 30, 1987. At that time, \u00a7 924(c)(1) provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-19\">Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-20\">Although it has since been amended, at the time of the offense, \u00a7 924(c)(2) (Supp. IV 1986) defined a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as \u201cany felony violation of Federal law involving the distribution, manufacture, or importation of any controlled substance....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants argue that because the statute only explicitly references \u201cdistribution, manufacture, or importation,\u201d a criminal offense of possession with intent to distribute is not sufficient to constitute a drug trafficking crime for purposes of obtaining a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1). Such an argument is contrary to this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1393 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>which we held that possession with intent to distribute constituted a drug trafficking crime under \u00a7 924(c)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Accord United States v. Henry, </em>878 F.2d 937, 943 (6th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Nash, </em>876 F.2d 1359, 1361-62 (7th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>857 F.2d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Matra, </em>841 F.2d 837, 843 (8th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. James, </em>834 F.2d 92, 93 (4th Cir.1987). <em>See also United States v. Torres, </em>862 F.2d 1025, 1030 (3rd Cir.1988) (applying common sense understanding of \u201cdistribution, manufacture, or importation\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(2) to hold that conspiracy to distribute cocaine is a drug trafficking offense for \u00a7 924(c)(1) purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\">Sud\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to convict him of \u00a7 924(c)(1) because as a police officer he was instructed to carry a firearm with him at all times is equally unavailing. The fact that he might have been a police officer at the time the offense was committed does not give him license to flaunt the clear dictates of the law. This court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Bower, </em>575 F.2d 499, 501 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 983, 99 S.Ct. 572, 58 L.Ed.2d 654 (1978), in which we acknowledged that the predecessor statute to \u00a7 924(c)(1) was designed \u201cto avoid imposing additional penalties on persons, such as policemen, who commit federal felonies while lawfully carrying firearms,\u201d provides no solace to Sud. The statute in <em>Bower </em>only made it illegal for an individual to <em>unlawfully </em>carry a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, when Congress amended this statute as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, it expanded the law\u2019s scope. <em>See United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d at 1394. The reason for this change can be found in the Act\u2019s legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-5\">The requirement in present section 924(c) that the gun be carried unlawfully, a fact usually proven by showing that the defendant was in violation of a State or local law, has been eliminated as unnecessary. The \u201cunlawfully\u201d provision was added originally to section 924(c) because of Congressional concern that without it policemen and persons licensed to carry firearms who committed Federal felonies would be subjected to additional penalties, even where the weapon played no part in the crime, whereas the section was directed at persons who chose to carry a firearm as an offensive weapon for a specific criminal act_ The Committee has concluded that persons who are licensed to carry firearms and abuse that privilege by committing a crime with the weapon, as in the extremely rare case of the armed police officer who commits a crime, are as deserving of punishment as a person whose possession of the gun violates a State or local ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-10\">S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 314 n. 10 (1983), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3182, 3492 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-11\">Consequently, the only issue is whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Sud intended or was ready to use the gun, if necessary, either during the commission of the offense or in making his escape. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cEvidence that the defendant had a gun in his pocket but did not display it, or refer to it, could nevertheless support a conviction for \u2018carrying\u2019 a firearm in relation to the crime if from the circumstances or otherwise it could be found that the defendant intended to use the gun if a contingency arose or to make his escape\u201d). In this case, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that the carrying of firearms was viewed by the defendants as a necessary element toward the completion of their crime. The defendants were attempting to commit ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>ther a drug or jewelry \u201cripoff\u201d \u2014 that is, they thought that they would be stealing either drugs or jewelry from the room of an individual believed to be involved in illegal drug or jewelry smuggling. Two days before the commission of the offense, the defendants discussed the need to have, weapons with them. Moreover, on the day of the offense, not only did each of the defendants confirm to his colleagues that he was carrying a weapon, but when Maldonado, the government\u2019s informant, admitted that he did not have a firearm, one was provided to him. From this evidence, a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendants were carrying firearms with the intent to use them if necessary during the offense. <em>See United States v. Machado, </em>804 F.2d 1537, 1547-48 (11th Cir.1986). <em>See also United States v. Brockington, </em>849 F.2d 872, 876 (4th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>779 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Finding the appellants\u2019 arguments to be without merit, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1126-15\">. Although the appellants raise other arguments as well, we reject those arguments as being clearly without merit; consequently, we address only the two contentions that are worthy of extended discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1126-21\">. Effective November 18, 1988, this statute was amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-690, \u00a7 6211, 102 Stat. 4181, 4360, to read that \"the term \u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.)....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">. Because the offense in <em>Poole </em>took place on May 23, 1988, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 amendments to \u00a7 924(c)(2), <em>see supra </em>n. 2, were not applicable to the court's decision; rather, the statute the court construed was the same statute before this court <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">. As this court explained in <em>United States v. Machado, </em>804 F.2d 1537, 1546 (11th Cir.1986), to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(l)\u2019s predecessor, the government was required to prove as an element of the offense that the defendant\u2019s \"act of carrying the firearm must, in and of itself, have violated Federal, state, or local law.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Rouco, </em>765 F.2d 983, 996 (11th Cir.1985), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1124, 106 S.Ct. 1646, 90 L.Ed.2d 190 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
