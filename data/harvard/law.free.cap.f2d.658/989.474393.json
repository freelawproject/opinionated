Woodard brought this suit seeking reinstatement of his officer\u2019s commission in the United States Army Reserve, recall to active duty, promotion credit, payment of back wages and benefits, and correction of the Army\u2019s records. The Army filed a pre-answer \u201cmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.\u201d Without explaining its reasons, the district court granted the Army\u2019s motion \u201cin all things,\u201d and it entered judgment for the Army. Woodard appeals. Finding a proper legal basis for the district court\u2019s judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">Having received an appointment as second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve, Woodard began a two-year term of obligated service on October 1, 1977, by attending the Military Officer Basic Course at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. After he failed a required examination three times, however, he was referred to a \u201cfaculty board,\u201d a panel of officers appointed to consider the cases of officers who fail to meet academic standards. The faculty board recommended that Woodard be discharged. This recommendation was approved by the \u201cappointing authority\u201d <em>(i. </em>e., the Fort Commander), and Woodard was honorably discharged from the Army on July 14, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">Woodard\u2019s subsequent application to the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records was unsuccessful. He has exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-16\">In this suit, Woodard bases his claim for relief on three legal grounds: (1) that in discharging him, the Army failed to follow its own regulations;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) that the hearing he received violated his right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment; and (3) that the Army\u2019s action deprived him of the equal protection of the laws, also guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">The Army set forth three grounds to support its Rule 12(b) motion: (1) that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction; (2) that, even if the court had jurisdiction, Woodard\u2019s claims were not reviewable; (3) that the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted; and (4) that the Army was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law and undisputed fact, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b), 56. While the district court granted the Army\u2019s motion \u201cin all things,\u201d there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>an obvious inconsistency in deciding that the court has no jurisdiction and in entering judgment, as the district court did, \u201con the merits.\u201d <em>See Hitt v. Pasadena, </em>561 F.2d 606, 608 (5th Cir. 1977) (per curiam). Thus, in assessing the Army\u2019s arguments, we start at the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">In <em>Mindes v. Seaman, </em>453 F.2d 197, 198 (5th Cir. 1971), this court stated broadly that the district courts have jurisdiction over suits alleging wrongful discharge from the armed services. The court did not identify the specific statutory grant under which the district court had jurisdiction in <em>Mindes. </em>Since it is the general rule, however, that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction absent a congressional grant, <em>see </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 3-5, we read <em>Mindes </em>as simply rejecting the theory that the courts never have jurisdiction to hear military discharge claims. We must still identify an applicable jurisdictional grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">The Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, gives the district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d In <em>Jones v. Alexander, </em>609 F.2d 778, 781 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 832, 101 S.Ct. 100, 66 L.Ed.2d 37 (1980), we held that this statute confers jurisdiction over a suit for injunctive and declaratory relief from a discharge allegedly made in violation of Army regulations. This holding is directly applicable to Woodard\u2019s claim that the Army failed to follow its own regulations, and it applies with equal force to his allegations of failure to perform duties imposed by the Constitution. Thus, the district court had jurisdiction over Woodard\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">The court also had jurisdiction over Woodard\u2019s monetary claims. The Tucker Act gives the district courts original jurisdiction of a \u201ccivil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department . . .. \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2). In his amended complaint, Woodard waived all claims for damages in excess of $9,999.99. Therefore, the district court had jurisdiction of his monetary claims. <em>VanderMolen v. Stetson, </em>571 F.2d 617, 619 n.2 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Since we find the Mandamus Act and the Tucker Act adequate bases for jurisdiction over this suit, we decline to pass on the other grounds of jurisdiction proffered by Woodard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">II. <em>Reviewability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">While we held in <em>Mindes v. Seaman </em>that the federal courts do not lack jurisdiction simply because an action challenges the personnel decisions of the military, <em>Mindes </em>makes it equally clear that a federal district court should not review every such decision, even if it has subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>453 F.2d at 199-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">It is now well established that, despite <em>Mindes\u2019 </em>doctrine of \u201cnonreviewability,\u201d claims that the Army failed to follow its own regulations or failed to afford procedural due process are reviewable. <em>See, e. g., White v. Callaway, </em>501 F.2d 672, 674 (5th Cir. 1974) (failure to follow own regulations); <em>Sims v. Fox, </em>505 F.2d 857 (5th Cir. 1974) (en banc) (by implication) (procedural due process), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975). However, Woodard has cited no case, and we have found no Fifth Circuit case, which expressly considers either a claim of denial of equal protection in an Army personnel decision or the applicability of <em>Mindes </em>to such a claim. Therefore, we must decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number><em>Mindes </em>doctrine of nonreviewability precludes Woodard\u2019s equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">In <em>Mindes, </em>we identified the policy considerations underlying the doctrine of nonreviewability: \u201can unwillingness to second-guess judgments requiring military expertise\u201d; \u201ca reluctance to substitute court orders for discretionary military decisions\u201d; and \u201cthe proper concern that such review might stultify the military in the performance of its vital mission.\u201d 453 F.2d at 199. In determining whether a court should decline review in light of these policy considerations, we said that there were four factors the court should consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-6\">1. The nature and strength of the plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the military determination .... An obviously tenuous claim of any sort must be weighted in favor of declining review....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-7\">2. The potential injury to the plaintiff if review is refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-8\">3. The type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-9\">4. The extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved. Courts should defer to the superior knowledge and experience of professionals in matters <em>such as promotions </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">453 F.2d at 201-02 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">We look first to the \u201cnature\u201d of Woodard\u2019s equal protection claim. Woodard alleges that, although there were three others who failed the same tests he did, two of these individuals were nevertheless retained as officers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Woodard\u2019s equal protection claim is that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between him and these other officers. <em>See City of New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2517, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976) (per curiam) (distinctions among those permitted to continue livelihood as vendor need only \u201cbe rationally related to a legitimate state interest\u201d); <em>Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Commissioners, </em>330 U.S. 552, 556, 67 S.Ct. 910, 912, 91 L.Ed. 1093 (1947) (upholding, under similar standard, an apprenticeship system which left incumbents with unfettered discretion to select relatives and friends).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-16\">As for the \u201cstrength\u201d of his claim, we note that Woodard does not dispute that his failure to pass the test was an adequate basis for his discharge. Nor does he contend that the Army was required to discharge all trainees who failed the test he failed. To the contrary, he cites and relies on the Army regulation giving the faculty board and the appointing authority several discretionary options when they decide to relieve a student for academic reasons: \u201creassignment, administrative hold, return to parent unit, recycle to another class within the same course of instruction, or relief from active duty or active duty training.\u201d USAICS Reg. No. 600-4, 1 l-3(a). Obviously, if test failure were the only criterion to consider, there would be no need for a faculty board hearing and no basis for the board to recommend one option over another. Instead, the regulations provide that the faculty board \u201cwill consider and include in its findings all circumstances surrounding the failure, and the attitude, application and leadership potentialities of the officer.\u201d Army Reg. No. 635-100, 13-22(a)(2). The purpose of the faculty board hearing is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>allow the student to bring favorable evidence before the faculty board in order to allow the board to make a reasoned recommendation concerning his future as an officer. <em>See, e. g., id.; </em>USAICS Reg. No. 600-4, H 3-6 (right to present character witnesses); <em>id. </em>13-7(a) (right to \u201cpresent any facts, evidence, or extenuating circumstances to the board\u201d). Thus, the academic relief decision is a highly discretionary one, requiring the application of \u201cmilitary expertise\u201d to a wide variety of individual and inherently subjective factors in each case. <em>See Mindes, </em>453 F.2d at 198. From such factors, the military decision-makers are required to assess such intangibles as \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201cmotivation,\u201d and \u201cattitude.\u201d Army Reg. No. 635-100, K3-22(a)(3); USAICS Reg. 600-4, If l-3(c)(2)(4). In this case, Woodard would have the court determine whether there was any rational basis for the distinctions made, on the basis of such factors, between himself and the two students who were retained. We think that this is precisely the role that <em>Mindes </em>cautions the courts from taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The answer to this analysis is, of course, that since the Army may take such various factors into consideration, it should not be difficult for the Army to prove some ration-, al basis for its decision. But the central question posed by <em>Mindes </em>is whether the Army <em>should </em>be required to satisfy a federal court on this score. This question is the concern behind the third factor in the <em>Mindes </em>test, \u201cthe type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function.\u201d 453 F.2d at 201. Woodard\u2019s claim would require the Army to submit to discovery concerning its many academic relief decisions and would require all the officers involved in Woodard\u2019s case to explain for the court their reasons for distinguishing between Woodard and the other two students. While we recognized in <em>Mindes </em>that \u201cthere will always be some interference when review is granted,\u201d and while we recognize now that the <em>degree </em>of interference in this case might not be significantly greater than in other cases where we have accepted review, it is the \u201ctype ... of anticipated interference\u201d which we believe may \u201cbe such as to seriously impede the military in the performance of its vital duties.\u201d 453 F.2d at 201. The possibility that a federal court may later require officers to explain the \u201crational basis\u201d for distinguishing one trainee from another may deter military officers from relying on inherently subjective, though proper, criteria in favor of solely \u201cobjective\u201d criteria that make it easier to demonstrate a \u201crational basis\u201d when they get to court. The result could be the loss of good officers who fail tests and the promotion of officers who can pass tests but lack the ability to exercise command.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">In <em>Johnson v. Reed, </em>609 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1980), this court upheld a district court\u2019s decision to review the pass over and discharge of an Air Force officer on the grounds that the Air Force acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d The arbitrary action alleged in <em>Johnson, </em>however, was not the discharge decision itself but the consideration of patently incorrect records in making the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 787. The court noted that Johnson\u2019s case was \u201cnot one in which an officer is asking a court to interfere with the discretionary rating given the officer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789. Woodard\u2019s case is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Our holding is a narrow one. We make no attempt to establish a general rule for equal protection claims questioning the rationality of military decisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Mindes, </em>\u201c[cjonstitutional claims, normally more important than those having only a statutory or regulatory base, are themselves unequal . . . . \u201d 453 F.2d at 201. Each claim must be considered in light of the <em>Mindes </em>factors. We hold that Woodard\u2019s equal protection claim, alleging merely that there was no rational distinction between his ease and those of other</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>officers, is not reviewable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, that claim was properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">III. <em>The </em>Merits<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">A. <em>Failure to Follow Army Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">Woodard alleges that the Army failed to follow its own regulations in three respects: (1) the faculty board and appointing officer considered irrelevant information in making their decisions; (2) the appointing officer, after disapproving four of the faculty board\u2019s sixteen findings, violated regulations by failing to send the case back to the board or to a new board for reconsideration; and (3) the decision to discharge Woodard was not based on substantial evidence. We consider these allegations in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">According to USAICS No. Reg. 600-4, 11 \u2014 3(c),</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">An academic relief occurs as a result of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX-\">(1) Failure to satisfy academic graduation criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-13\">(2) Leadership deficiencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-14\">(3) Course related misconduct (e. g. cheating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-15\">(4) Motivation/attitude \u2014 deliberate lack of interest and application on the part of the student.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">When an officer is referred to a faculty board for an academic relief, Army regulations direct the board to \u201cconsider and include in its findings all circumstances surrounding the failure, and the attitude, application and leadership potentialities of the officer.\u201d Army Reg. No. 635-100, K 3-22(a)(2). In deciding whether to approve or disapprove the faculty board\u2019s recommendation, the appointing authority \u201cmay consider <em>any </em>relevant information in making a decision.\u201d Army Reg. No. 15-6, f 2-3(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">Woodard argues that, under these regulations, six of the faculty board\u2019s sixteen findings were irrelevant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>the Army concedes that four of the six were irrelevant, but it points out that these four were rejected by the appointing authority as unsupported by substantial evidence, so that they played no part in the appointing authority\u2019s decision to approve the recommendation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Army argues that the other two findings were relevant, and that the twelve relevant findings were amply sufficient to support the appointing authority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">We agree with the Army\u2019s argument. The two findings at issue relate to Woodard\u2019s \u201cnonfactual\u201d statement, made when he was applying for his commission, that he had never previously been discharged from military service, and to his use of \u201cprofane and crude\u201d language before the faculty board itself. We think that both of the findings were relevant to the issue of \u201cleadership deficiencies,\u201d because, as the faculty board expressly stated with regard to the latter finding, the actions could \u201cindicate[ ] a lack of good judgment and common sense.\u201d Woodard does not dispute either finding, and both appear indisputable from the evidence in the record. Moreover, the other relevant findings before the appointing authority stated that Woodard had failed to meet academic requirements and that his superior officers did not believe he had \u201cthe ability or potential to be an officer in the US Army.\u201d Woodard raises no serious contention that the twelve relevant findings were insufficient to justify the appointing authority's action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">Woodard nevertheless contends that, had the faculty board not considered the four irrelevant findings, it might not have recommended discharge. The appointing authority, however, is not bound by the recommendation of the faculty board. Army Reg. No. 15-6, H 2-3(a); USAICS Reg. No. 600-4, K 3-10(a). Thus, it is of no consequence whether the faculty board would have given a different recommendation had it not made the four irrelevant findings. It is empty to assert that the appointing authority, who himself disapproved the four findings at issue, did not give due regard to the fact that the faculty board\u2019s recommendation was based in part on these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">Woodard replies in his second argument, however, that the regulations in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>case required the appointing authority to send his case back to the same or to another faculty board. Woodard rests this argument on the regulation concerning the appointing authority\u2019s disapproval of board findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-4\">c. <em>Effect of errors. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-5\">(1) <em>Harmless errors. </em>If the appointing authority notes a harmless defect in the proceeding he may take his final action notwithstanding the defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-6\">(2) <em>Minor errors requiring correction. </em>If the investigating officer or board has failed to make a finding or recommendation required by the letter of appointment or a specific directive, or if there has been a minor procedural error or omission which may be corrected without prejudice to a respondent, the appointing authority <em>may </em>return the case to the same investigating officer or board for corrective action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-7\">(3) <em>Substantial errors. </em>In case of a jurisdictional error (e. g., failure to meet essential requirements with regard to appointment or composition) or an error which has a material adverse effect on an individual\u2019s substantial rights, the appointing authority may not use the affected part of that investigation or board as the basis for adverse action against the person whose substantial rights were prejudiced.... If the error can be corrected without prejudice to a respondent, the appointing authority may do so, returning the case to the same investigating officer or board for corrective action, <em>if necessary. </em>In case of an error which cannot be corrected otherwise, the appointing authority <em>may </em>set aside the findings and recommendations and refer the case to a new investigating officer or board composed entirely of new voting members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Army Reg. No. 15-6, H 2-3(c) (emphasis added). Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the four findings were \u201csubstantial errors\u201d as that term is defined in the regulation, its provisions are permissive: they simply do not require the appointing authority to send a case back to a faculty board. The regulation requires only that the appointing authority \u201cnot use the affected part ... as the basis for adverse action.\u201d The Army argues that, when the appointing authority disapproves erroneous findings but concludes that the remaining findings support his decision, he may exercise his usual power to make whatever disposition of the case he deems appropriate, <em>see </em>Army Reg. No. 15-6, H2-3(a); USAICS Reg. No. 600-4, H 3-10(b), without sending the case back to a faculty board. We cannot say that the Army\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is arbitrary or capricious, <em>see Udall v. Tailman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Hodges v. Callaway, </em>499 F.2d 417, 422 (5th Cir. 1974); we think it more consistent with the language of the regulations than Woodard\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">Finally, we consider Woodard\u2019s allegation that the Army\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Army regulations permit the discharge of any officer who fails his officer basic course. Army Reg. No. 635 \u2014 100, H 3-20. It is undisputed that Woodard failed a required examination not once, but three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">Thus, we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning Woodard\u2019s claim that the Army failed to follow its own regulations. The district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">B. <em>The Procedural Due Process Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">Woodard claims that he was denied procedural due process because Army regulations do not require a verbatim transcript of faculty board proceedings. The regulations require only that a synopsis be prepared. USAICS Reg. 600-4, H 3-7(bX8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">In <em>Sims v. Fox, </em>505 F.2d 857 (5th Cir. 1974) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975), we held that the Air Force could honorably discharge a reserve officer without a due process hearing. Because 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162(a) provides that \u201creserve commissioned officers may be discharged at the pleasure of the President,\u201d we held that a reserve officer has no reasonable expectation of continued employment and thus no property interest protected by the due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 861-62. We also held that Sims had no liberty interest in his reputation because his discharge was honorable and Air Force regulations required that the reasons for his discharge be kept confidential. <em>Id. </em>at 862-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Inexplicably, Woodard has neither cited <em>Sims </em>in his brief nor responded to the Army\u2019s reliance on <em>Sims </em>in his reply brief. The reason must be that there is no response. Woodard\u2019s commission is also subject to the terms of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162(a); the Army is prohibited by statute from revealing the reasons for Woodard\u2019s discharge to outside persons. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(6).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, <em>Sims </em>controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">In light of <em>Sims, </em>it is apparent that the Army has been more than fair in affording procedural protections to Woodard. On a charge of academic deficiencies, the Army gave Woodard notice, an adversary-type hearing, appointed counsel, and the opportunity to question all witnesses, respond to any evidence against him, and present evidence, character witnesses, and extenuating circumstances. <em>Cf. Sims v. Fox, </em>492 F.2d 1088, 1094 (5th Cir.) (requiring only that officer discharged for <em>disciplinary </em>reasons be allowed to present his own case, and expressly declining to require right to counsel), <em>vacated en banc, </em>505 F.2d 857 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975). <em>See also Board of Curators v. Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. 78, 98 S.Ct. 948, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978) (when the state dismisses a student from medical school for <em>academic </em>reasons, it need not grant an adversary-type hearing). Woodard does not claim any specific prejudice from the failure to prepare a verbatim transcript; he does not claim that the synopsis prepared was in any way inaccurate or imbalanced. In sum, Woodard makes no serious contention that the procedures adopted by the Army were in any way unfair. <em>See generally Ka Fung Chan v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201cproof of a denial of due process in an administrative proceeding requires a showing of substantial prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">Thus, Woodard has failed to state a claim of denial of procedural due process. The district court correctly dismissed this claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">. Complaint Counts One, Two and Four.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-13\">In his Amended Complaint, Woodard added Count Six, in which he alleged that the decisions of the various Army tribunals were \u201carbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and erroneous in law.\u201d This language suggests that Woodard seeks review under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. It is unclear whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to set aside the Army\u2019s action purely on these grounds. The APA does not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Plaintiff has cited no statutory basis for the direct review he seeks, and we have found none. We see no need to resolve the question here, however, since, as Woodard alleges in Count Four, Army regulations themselves require faculty board decisions to be supported by substantial evidence and, by implication, to be reasonable. <em>See </em>USAICS Reg. No. 600-4, U 3-8(d). Thus, for purposes of jurisdiction, we view Count Six, like Counts One, Two and Four, as alleging that the Army failed to follow its own regulations.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1043-19\">. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment has generally been held to make Fourteenth Amendment equal protection law applicable to the federal government. <em>See Rostker v. </em>Goldberg,-U.S.--,-n.3, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 2650 n.3, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-22\">Woodard also attempts to rely on the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Since these are prohibitions on state action, Woodard\u2019s reliance is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">. Woodard also relies on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331(a), 1343(4) (1976). We note that when Woodard filed his Amended Complaint waiving all monetary claims over $9,999.99, \u00a7 1331 still required an amount in controversy exceeding $10,000. <em>Compare </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (1976) <em>with </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 (West Supp.1981). We also note that \u00a7 1343(4) required that the plaintiff be seeking relief under an \u201cAct of Congress.\u201d Woodard fails to identify the Act of Congress on which we may predicate relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">. The third, like Woodard, was discharged. It is not clear from Woodard\u2019s pleadings or from the record whether both of the retained officers failed <em>all </em>the tests he failed. His complaint ambiguously alleges that they \u201cfailed the same academic test(s).\u201d For purposes of decision, however, we will assume that they failed the same tests the same number of times Woodard failed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">Woodard\u2019s complaint also alleges that, since his discharge, passing standards have been lowered and students have been \u201cpassed\u201d without successfully completing the same course Woodard failed. We think it frivolous for Woodard to argue that this allegation states the basis for an equal protection claim. The equal protection clause does not prevent the military or any other branch of government from changing its rules or standards, and it does not require the government to retroactively reassess cases properly disposed of under the old set of rules. Woodard cites no authority for his proposition, and we reject it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">. We note that Woodard makes no claim that he was discriminated against because of his race, religion, sex, or any other such classification. Nor does he claim he was discharged for his exercise of a fundamental right. We of course express no view on the reviewability of such equal protection claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">. To the extent that Count Six of Woodard\u2019s Amended Complaint \u2014 alleging that the Army\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious\u201d and \u201cerroneous in law,\u201d see note 1 <em>supra </em>\u2014 may have also relied on the differing treatment given these officers, we hold that it is nonreviewable as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">. Woodard makes several complaints about the evidence before the district court on summary judgment. First, he contends that the exhibits submitted by the Army were not certified as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). The Army\u2019s motion, on the other hand, purports to be accompanied by certified copies of these exhibits, and the Army now makes the vague contention that certified copies were in fact \u201cavailable to the district court.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 2 n.4. We see no need to resolve these conflicting claims, however, because there was absolutely no prejudice to Woodard if the certification requirement was not met. The Army\u2019s submissions consisted of its published regulations and the administrative record in Woodard\u2019s case. The regulations are not in any sense \u201cfacts\u201d which are in dispute; they are the very law which Woodard relies on (and quotes extensively from) in alleging that the Army has failed to follow its own regulations. Woodard argues in effect that we must accept his interpretation of these regulations because the Army failed to certify its copies of them. These regulations are law, which this court can find for itself. As for the administrative record, Woodard does not in any way challenge its correctness or completeness. More importantly, the parts of the record on which we rely reflect facts that Woodard has conceded in his own complaint. While we do not take the requirements of Rule 56(e) lightly, neither do we interpret them to frustrate the \u201cjust, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Woodard had full notice that the Army was asking the district court to convert the Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment, and he has no basis to claim prejudice from the court\u2019s consideration of the uncertified administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-19\">Woodard also complains that the Army filed late responses to two sets of interrogatories and that, therefore, \u201cthe matters of which an admission [wa]s requested [must] be deemed admitted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 36. The trial court had ample discretion to relieve the Army of its apparent default. <em>See French v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>cf. Hartley &amp; Parker, Inc. v. Florida Beverage Corp., </em>348 F.2d 161, 163 (5th Cir. 1965) (late verification). The untimeliness here was a day in one instance, and a few days in the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1047-20\">. The six challenged findings read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-21\">7. That 2LT Woodard was inducted into the US Army in January 1971 and was subsequently released approximately four months later in May 1971 for medical reasons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-22\">8. That according to 2LT Woodard\u2019s testimony the medical problem was administratively reviewed in 1973 by the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>partment of the Army board. The review resulted in the decision that 2LT Woodard was medically fit for active duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-6\">9. That, in October 1973, 2LT Woodard enlisted in the US Army under a combat arms option. In March 1974, 2LT Woodard initiated action to be released from active duty due to nonfulfillment of his combat arms option contract by the US Army;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-7\">10. That a review of testimony and subsequent questioning of 2LT Woodard by members of the board revealed numerous inconsistencies, apparent contradictions and often vague responses. These characteristics displayed by 2LT Woodard causes [sic] doubt as to his ability to accurately report facts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-8\">11. That testimony and records submitted as evidence indicated that in 1976 2LT Woodard, a then 25 year old individual with previous military experience coupled with experience in criminal law, was not factual in completing required military medical forms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-9\">15. That 2LT Woodard\u2019s behavior before a board of field grade officers was characterized by several uses of profane and crude language. The use of such language indicates a lack of common sense and good judgment since 2LT Woodard\u2019s legal counsel based a large portion of his case on the use of profane language by the DOT Faculty in formal faculty/student situations!.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">. The Army\u2019s concession is ambiguous. It concedes only that findings 7-10, <em>see </em>note 8 <em>supra, </em>\u201cwere irrelevant to Woodard\u2019s academic deficiencies.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 40-41. It is unclear whether the Army would still contend that findings 7-10 were relevant to \u201cleadership deficiencies\u201d as a ground for academic relief. Moreover, elsewhere in its brief it contends that all the information considered and findings made by the faculty board were relevant. <em>See, e. g., id. </em>at 40 n.9. When the passage at pages 40 \u2014 41 of its brief is read in its entirety, the Army seems to be stating that findings 7-10 were disapproved because they were irrelevant. This is incorrect; the findings were disapproved for lack of substantial evidence. Thus, it may be that the Army\u2019s concession was inadvertent. For present purposes, however, we will assume that the findings were irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">. Woodard apparently concedes that the Army will not release the reasons for his discharge, but he nevertheless contends that he has a liberty interest in his reputation because he will be hard-pressed to explain to prospective employers why he served only eight months of a two-year commitment. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 8-9. While we appreciate Woodard\u2019s difficulty, we do not think that Woodard\u2019s need to give personal explanations of his academic discharge is a greater infringement on liberty that Sims\u2019 need to give explanations of his discharge for indecent exposure. <em>See Sims, </em>505 F.2d at 864 (no infringement of liberty unless <em>government </em>perpetuates untrue charges).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
