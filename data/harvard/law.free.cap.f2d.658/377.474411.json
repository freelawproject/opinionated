BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">In this Louisiana diversity action Central Progressive Bank (Bank) sued two insurers on bankers bonds, issued for different periods of time, for a loss sustained from a breach of fidelity by a former president of the Bank, Philip A. Roth, Jr. One defendant, Maryland Casualty Company (Maryland), was dismissed on motion for summary judgment. Trial to a jury on the claim against Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s) resulted in a special verdict for Fireman\u2019s and judgment was entered dismissing Bank\u2019s complaint. The Bank appealed after its motions for j. n. o. v. and for a new trial were denied. We find the Bank\u2019s contentions without merit and affirm both as to Maryland and Fireman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">This civil action arises from an asserted conspiracy to defraud the Bank by which Philip A. Roth, Jr., then President of the Bank, permitted R. L. Booty to collect the proceeds of certain life insurance policies supposedly pledged as collateral for two loans made by the Bank and partially guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Booty was indicted on February 15,1979, and later convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States Government under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The indictment named Roth in most of the overt acts charged which occurred from about April 28, 1975 through July 30, 1976.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Booty\u2019s conviction was affirmed in <em>United States v. Booty, </em>621 F.2d 1291, <em>modified, </em>627 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1980). The circumstances surrounding the fraudulent activities are well-detailed in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-23\">The Bank, on April 5, 1979, instituted this civil action against both Maryland and Fireman\u2019s to recover a $198,000 loss under simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>lar fidelity bonds issued by each company. Each bond, utilizing the standard form bankers blanket bond, provided coverage for losses <em>discovered </em>during the policy period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each bond also provided that coverage was deemed terminated as to any employee as soon as the Insured had knowledge that the employee had committed any fraudulent or dishonest act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The blanket bond<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> issued by Maryland covered the period from December 15, 1971 to December 15,1975. The Fireman\u2019s bond period was from December 15, 1975 to August 18, 1978.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Within the policy period ending August 18, 1977, the Bank first wrote to Fireman\u2019s on August 15,1977 advising the insurer of a likely claim and requesting an additional period of twelve months within which to discover the loss as provided in the policy. The extension was granted and on November 30, 1977, the Bank actually filed its claim. The District Court granted Maryland\u2019s motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> finding that no discovery took place prior to termination of Maryland\u2019s bond. The Bank\u2019s claim against Fireman\u2019s proceeded to trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">Fireman\u2019s offered several defenses based in part on specific contractual provisions. The case was submitted to the jury by a general charge with special interrogatories (F.R.Civ.P. 49(a)). The jury answered that the Bank had suffered a loss through the dishonest or fraudulent conduct of its employees, but the loss was not within the blanket bond coverage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Court entered judgment dismissing the Bank\u2019s action. From denial of post-trial motions for j. n. o. v. and new trial, the Bank appeals. It urges error by the District Court in (1) failing to grant its motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>judgment, directed verdict, and j. n. o. v., (2) giving an indefinite and confusing charge to the jury, and (3) permitting a supplemental answer by Fireman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\n<em>Bank\u2019s Claim Against Maryland</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The Bank\u2019s claim that Maryland is liable under the blanket bond is supported neither by the language of the bond nor the law of Louisiana. Maryland\u2019s bond expired December 15, 1975. Coverage under the policy is conditioned not upon the date of loss or commission of the act causing the loss, but rather upon the date of \u201cdiscovery of the loss\u201d. The District Court found that there was no report of any loss to Maryland or any discovery prior to termination of its policy. The law of Louisiana clearly approves and enforces the discovery provisions. <em>Livingston Parish School Board v. Fireman\u2019s Fund American Insurance Co., </em>282 So.2d 478 (La.1973);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Breaux v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., </em>326 So.2d 891 (La.Ct.App., 3rd Cir. 1976). The District Court therefore was correct in granting Maryland\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>Bank\u2019s Claim Against Fireman\u2019s</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The Bank asserts several grounds for its appeal from the adverse judgment dismissing its complaint. The standard of review for both motions for directed verdict and j. n. o. v. is clear in this Circuit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">On motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict the Court should consider all of the evidence \u2014 not just that evidence which supports the non-mover\u2019s case \u2014 but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should be denied and the case submitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\"><em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir. 1969). In this case, there was evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Fireman\u2019s primary defense in its supplemental answer at trial was based on the provision of the bond expressly excluding coverage for losses resulting from the dishonest acts of any employee which occurred after the employer had knowledge of the employee\u2019s dishonesty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At trial Fireman\u2019s presented evidence largely from Roth himself that the Bank, before Roth\u2019s actions with Booty, had knowledge or information of prior fraudulent or dishonest activities of Roth. This included evidence of Roth\u2019s making fictitious loans to allow use of bank funds for political contributions. The purpose of these political contributions was to gain business for the Bank. These political contributions occurred in early 1975. Although hotly contested, there was evidence from which the jury could infer that the Board of Directors of the Bank had knowledge of and approved these loans. Although the Bank presented testimony of some Directors that they had no knowledge of the political contributions, the jury apparently chose to believe Roth. Credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>choices of this type are for the jury. <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d at 375. <em>See Federal Deposit Insurance Co. v. Lott, </em>460 F.2d 82, 87 (5th Cir. 1972) (issue of knowledge of directors particularly well suited for jury determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Fireman\u2019s asserted several other defenses under a rider to the bond limiting the meaning of \u201cdishonest or fraudulent acts\u201d for purposes of fidelity coverage to acts committed by an employee <em>with the intent to cause the insured to sustain a loss. </em>Fireman\u2019s argued that Roth\u2019s conduct with respect to the collateral recovery was not intended to cause the Bank to sustain a loss but rather was designed <em>to protect </em>the Bank. Next it claimed that the policy was secured through misrepresentations by the Bank that it was subject to a complete annual audit by an independent CPA. It also asserted that most of the Bank\u2019s loss on the loans was reimbursed by the SBA. To the Bank\u2019s contention that it should be allowed to recover the SBA\u2019s loss, in addition to its own, Fireman\u2019s argued that the coverage of the bond did not extend to the SBA\u2019s loss but was limited to that sustained by the Bank, the named insured. The District Court severed the claims of the SBA and so instructed the jury. Because of our disposition of this case, we do not reach these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">This brings us to the only substantial claim of error, the Court\u2019s jury charge and the answers to interrogatories (see note 8, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The trouble with this is that the Bank made not a single objection raising any of these claims. Its sole objection to the charge was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">The Court: Does anybody have any objections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">Bank\u2019s Counsel: I have one; interrogatory one, on the question of proof of valid contract. I think the blanket bond policy has been admitted and I think that part is out of the picture. I think there is no doubt that there is a valid bond. The question of our claim would be covered by those other three.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">On appeal, the Bank urges that its right to trial by jury has been denied by refusal to give requested charges, submission of confusing interrogatories, insufficient instructions, and conflicting answers between (2) and (3). The basis for the Bank\u2019s attack appears to be its inability to comprehend how the jury could find a loss by dishonest acts without finding coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Rule 49(a) refutes the Bank\u2019s position. The focus of much praise,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 49(a) allows the trial judge wide latitude in submitting and framing written questions to the jury, <em>Dreiling v. General Electric Co., </em>511 F.2d 768, 774 (5th Cir. 1975), and appellate review is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Abernathy </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>426 F.2d 512 (5th Cir. 1970). In determining the adequacy of the form of special interrogatories, we consider \u201c(i) whether, when read as a whole and in conjunction with the general charge the interrogatories adequately presented the contested issues to the jury, .. . (ii) whether the submission of the issues to the jury was \u2018fair\u2019, ... and (iii) whether the \u2018ultimate questions of fact\u2019 were clearly submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Dreiling v. General Electric Co., </em>511 F.2d at 774 (citations omitted). To be valid, an objection to an interrogatory or the lack thereof must be made prior to the retiring of the jury, or the objection is waived. If a party fails to request submission of an issue, the court is deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment. F.R.Civ.P. 49(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">The Bank at trial objected specifically to Interrogatory (1) as unnecessary. Assuming this was error, since the jury answered this question in the Bank\u2019s favor, there was no injury and no reason to reverse. As to Interrogatory (3), the Bank made no specific objection to it until on motion for new trial and on appeal, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>waiving any objection. In fact, before the jury retired, the Bank indicated that it believed the other three questions covered its claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Had an adequate objection been made that, as framed, the interrogatory was submitting a question of law, our result likely would have been different. It would have been preferable for the Court to have propounded separate interrogatories inquiring (i) whether Roth committed prior dishonest acts and (ii) if so, did the Bank have knowledge of such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">But the only way we can reach that is on plain error. The application of the doctrine of plain error requires an inquiry into whether the action done or not done nominally constituting an error caused any real prejudicial harm. That in turn requires us to look at the whole charge, imperfect though it might be in form.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Here we have no doubts. The judge\u2019s general charge made clear to the jury the respective theories of the parties and specifically Fireman\u2019s defense that Roth had with knowledge of the Bank committed specific dishonest, fraudulent acts. The charge directed the jury\u2019s inquiry to whether the acts had been done, were dishonest, and were known to the Bank. From both the general charge and the structure of the interrogatories,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the jury was, in effect, advised that if they credited the Fireman\u2019s witnesses, the answer to Interrogatory (3) would be \u201cno\u201d; if the Bank\u2019s witnesses were credited, the answer would be \u201cyes\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The Bank also contends that the interrogatories are inconsistent because the jury found that the Bank suffered a loss through dishonest acts but such loss was not covered by the bond. This assertion is without merit since these are distinct issues. The jury, in effect, answered that although the Bank\u2019s loss was due to dishonest acts, for reasons given in the court\u2019s charge, there was no liability under the bond for such losses. Even if the answers were inconsistent on their face, the court must enter judgment if there is an acceptable view of the case which makes the answers consistent. The test of consistency, \u201cis whether the answers may fairly be said to represent a logical and probable decision on the relevant issues as submitted. . . . \u201d <em>Griffin v. Matherne, </em>471 F.2d 911 (5th Cir. 1973). <em>See Willard v. The John Hayward, </em>577 F.2d 1009 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Miller v. Royal Netherlands Steamship Co., </em>508 F.2d 1103 (5th Cir. 1975). That test of logic was clearly met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Fireman\u2019s primary defense that knowledge of prior fraudulent acts by Roth terminated the coverage as to Roth under the terms of the policy is a valid defense. The instructions to the jury made clear the meaning of Interrogatory (3) to which the Bank offered no valid objection at trial and since the jury found that the policy did not cover the loss, the judgment as to Fireman\u2019s was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Finally, as a weary tag-end, the Bank urges that the Court erred in allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Fireman\u2019s to file a supplemental pleading setting up additional affirmative defenses, including that of prior dishonest acts. The Motion to Supplement was filed on April 29, 1980, well before the May 15 amendment cutoff date set by the Magistrate in the preliminary pre-trial conference held on April 3, 1980. The Magistrate granted the motion on May 29, 1980. No appeal of this decision was taken to the District Court, and the Bank\u2019s objection is not properly before us.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 921, 101 S.Ct. 321, 66 L.Ed.2d 140 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-17\">.

Maryland and Fireman\u2019s provided both a primary bankers blanket bond and an Excess Dishonesty Bond, the latter covering virtually the same hazards but having a larger deductible.

The Fireman\u2019s bond was to terminate on August 18, 1977 but was extended for one year for discovery of any loss sustained by the insured prior to August 18, 1977. Fireman\u2019s and Maryland originally argued that the loss, not \u201cdiscovered\u201d until March 1979, a date long after both policies lapsed, was not covered. This position was based on the Bank\u2019s answers to interrogatories. The Bank subsequently supplemented its interrogatories to show that the loss was discovered in 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b435-18\">. All parties made motions for summary judgment. The Bank\u2019s motion urged that the issue of fraud and dishonesty had been established in the prior criminal trial of Booty; therefore collateral or judicial estoppel would operate to preclude relitigation of any issues. The Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment was denied. Fireman\u2019s motion asserted that its bond provided no coverage for the loss which was not discovered during the policy period. The Court denied Fireman\u2019s motion, finding there was a question of fact whether the insurance company had received notice of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b435-19\">.
