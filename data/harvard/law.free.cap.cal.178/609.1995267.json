The county sought to purchase and operate this plant under and by virtue of the provisions of section 4041, subdivision 9a, added to the Political Code in 1913, [Stats. 1913, p. 667], The invalidity of this section was determined by this court in <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>175 Cal. 777, [167 Pac. 390]. It was therein held that the attempt to authorize the county of Los Angeles to engage in the manufacture of cement as a private enterprise was violative of the constitution. It follows, therefore, that the contract between the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los Angeles, wherein the county agreed to furnish cement to the city, was <em>ultra vires </em>and void so far as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>county of Los Angeles is concerned, and it is unnecessary to inquire whether or not the various steps required by the charter of the city of Los Angeles in the purchase of supplies were followed. The contract being void, the demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the superior court, with directions to overrule the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Lorigan, J., and Melvin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
