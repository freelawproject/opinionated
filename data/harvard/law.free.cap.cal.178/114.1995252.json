This motion was denied. The other motion was one to amend and substitute a judgment and decree for the one entered. It also was denied. There is, therefore, no record to support the objections made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">There appears in the transcript, however, that which purports to be a copy of the will. It contains the following provisions, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my brother, Michael 0\u2019Hare (also spelled 0 \u2019Heher in Ireland), residing at Inchaboy, Postoffice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Gort, County Galaway, Ireland, the sum of five hundred dollars. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my said estate I give, devise and bequeath to my said nieces, Mary Reilly and Bridget O\u2019Hare, and my nephews, Martin O\u2019Hare, John O\u2019Hare and Michael O\u2019Hare, share and share alike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Specifically, the part of the decree to which appellant objects is as follows: \u20181 The court finds that the brother, Michael O\u2019Hare, is entitled, in addition to the five hundred dollars money legacy bequeathed to him, to one-fourth of the residue of said estate; and the court finds that John O\u2019Hare, Mary A. O\u2019Hare, Joseph O\u2019Hare, and Catherine O\u2019Hare, the four children of and all of the children of Martin O\u2019Hare, deceased nephew of decedent, are entitled to take of said estate the share to which their father, the said nephew, Martin 0 \u2019Hare, would have been entitled, if living, to wit, a general legacy of one thousand dollars and one-fourth of the residue of said estate, after the other general.legacies are paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">It is contended that Michael O\u2019Hare, named in the residuary clause, cannot be the brother of that name to whom a specific legacy was given; that Martin O\u2019Hare died before the will was made and executed, and that, therefore, his descendants could not rightfully take his portion under the will; that these children are not in any event entitled to their father\u2019s share \u201cas though they were adults\u201d (they being minors); and that the lower court erred in determining that the bequest to John O\u2019Hare, who died in infancy without lineal descendants, should be distributed to the other residuary legatees. Not one of these contentions is or could be supported by the record before us. We must assume that the proof before the court was ample to uphold its conclusions. For instance, we are bound to assume that there was a showing that no nephew named Michael O\u2019Hare ever existed, and that the surrounding circumstances proved the brother Michael to be the one intended. Upon his failure to get a bill of exceptions, counsel for appellant must have known that there was no chance of success, because no proof of the supposed facts supporting his contentions could be brought before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Wilbur, J., and Victor E. Shaw, J., <em>pro tern., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
