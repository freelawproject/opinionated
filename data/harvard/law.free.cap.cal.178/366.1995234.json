The facts of the case are fully set forth in the case of <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Bancroft, ante, </em>p. 352, [173 Pac. 582]. The matters upon which the appellant predicates her right to a reversal herein occurred prior to the inception of the action, and were, therefore, the subject of review upon an appeal from the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>locutory decree had such appeal been taken, and hence cannot be made the subject of review upon an appeal from the final decree. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 956; <em>Claudius </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>146 Cal. 257, [79 Pac. 897]; <em>Suttman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>174 Cal. 243, [162 Pac. 1032]; <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 343, [149 Pac. 998]; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>9 Cal. App. 748, [100 Pac. 897].) In addition to this, however, the points discussed upon this appeal have been decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention in the case of <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Bancroft ante, </em>p. 359, [173 Pac. 579], and upon the conclusions arrived at in that decision the portion of the judgment herein appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
