There is no merit in the contention that the conviction was not good in law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">\u201cBut the judgment based on the conviction and the order of suspension of judgment are open to serious objection. The crime was committed in August, 1917, subsequent to the going into effect of section 1168 of the Penal Code, [Stats. 1917, p. 665], known as the \u2018indeterminate sentence\u2019 law, the constitutionality of which has been recently upheld in the case of <em>In re Lee </em>(Cal.), 171 Pac. 958. That section provides that \u2018the court in imposing such sentence shall not fix the term of . . . imprisonment,\u2019 but that \u2018the period of such confinement shall not exceed the maximum or be less than the minimum term of imprisonment provided by law for the public offense of which such person was convicted.\u2019 Under this section the judgment of the court properly consists of a recital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of the offense of which the defendant stands convicted, a designation of the state prison to which he is committed, and nothing more. In the ease at bar the court was in error in fixing a minimum term of one year, because section 461 of the Penal Code, which prescribes the punishment for burglary, provides no minimum term for burglary in the second degree. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">There was no authority in law for the action of the court in suspending the execution of the sentence and remanding the petitioner to the custody of the sheriff to be confined in the county jail. Where the penalty of the law is imprisonment in the state prison, it is the duty of the sheriff to forthwith deliver the defendant to the warden of the state prison. (Pen. Code, sec. 1216.) If the court desires to suspend the execution of the sentence, the only way in which it can legally do so is by proceeding under section 1203 of the Penal Code, and that section expressly provides that in the event of such suspension \u2018the court shall place such person on probation and under the charge and supervision of the probation officer of said court, during such suspension. \u2019 The section clearly contemplates that the defendant, while on probation and conforming to the terms thereof, shall be at large and not in confinement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We are entirely satisfied with this portion of the opinion and adopt the same as part of the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">This cause was ordered transferred to this court for the reason that we were not satisfied that the judgment of the district court of appeal was a proper judgment in view of the conclusion of the court as expressed in this opinion. It is apparent from what has been said that the judgment of the superior court was erroneous. Under the circumstances there should be no new trial of this cause, but the superior court should be required to pronounce proper judgment upon the conviction legally obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The order denying a new trial is affirmed. The judgment is reversed, with directions to the lower court to arraign the defendant for judgment and to thereupon proceed with the matter of the judgment in the manner required by law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
