This contract provided, among other things, that \u201cthe contractor shall promptly pay all subcontractors, materialmen, laborers, and other employees as often as payments are made to him by the company, and shall deliver said work free from any claim or lien on account of such labor and materials and subcontractors; ...\u201d The form of the bond was identical with that set out in the opinion in the case of the <em>National Bank of Cleburne </em>v. <em>Gulf etc. Ry. Co., </em>95 Tex. 176, [66 S. W. 203].</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The plaintiff, French, by contract in writing, leased to the defendant, Farmer, the contractor, to be used in the performance of the latter\u2019s contract with the Railway Company, thirty-two head of mules, one saddle-horse, and sixteen sets of harness. He also agreed to furnish a \u201ccorral boss,\u201d to be paid by Farmer. Farmer having failed to pay therefor, this action was brought by French against Farmer and the Surety Company to recover four thousand two hundred dollars rental for the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>teams and saddle-horse; $10 for services of corral-man, and $5 for expenses of corral-man, and $75 for hay and barley sold. Judgment was rendered against defendant Farmer and the defendant Surety Company. The appeal is by the Surety Company only. It is claimed that there is not sufficient privity between the defendant Surety Company, as obligor of the bond, and the plaintiff to authorize suit by him upon the bond. That point, however, has been determined adversely to appellant\u2019s contention by this court in <em>Union Sheet Metal Works </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>129 Cal. 390, [62 Pac. 41], and later by the court in Bank in <em>People's Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Gillard, </em>136 Cal. 55, [68 Pac. 576]. The question then is, Does the contract or bond, or both, contain a sufficient promise to pay the obligation of the\" plaintiff to authorize him to sue to enforce this as a promise made for his benefit? With reference to the item of rental for the mules, a similar question was involved in <em>Wood, Curtis &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>El Dorado etc. Co., </em>153 Cal. 231, [126 Am. St. Rep. 80, 15 Ann. Cas. 382, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 585, 94 Pac. 877], wherein the following question was answered in the negative by this court: \u201cDid plaintiff by this letting of his horses at a stipulated price per month \u2018bestow labor\u2019 upon the work so as to entitle it to a lien under section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure?\u201d Upon the same reasoning, which need not be here repeated, it must be held that plaintiff was not a person \u201cto whom any part of such work is given,\u201d and that, therefore, the contract and bond make no express provision for the payment to the plaintiff of that indebtedness here sued upon. This view is strengthened by the fact that both the contract and bond make it the duty of the contractor to furnish teams, without fixing any obligation to pay therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">As to the items of $10, services of corral-man, and $5, traveling expenses of corral-man, under the contract between French and Farmer the corral-man was to have been paid by Farmer. Even if we assume that the corral-man was a laborer upon the work within the meaning of the contract and bond, it does not follow that the plaintiff, upon paying such laborer, was entitled to sue therefor upon the bond. The right of action, if any, was in the corral-man and not in his employer, who was not a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">As to the judgment for $75 for hay and barley sold, there was no express agreement contained in the contract for the payment for either \u201cprovisions or goods,\u201d although the bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>is expressly conditioned upon the payment of all jnst debts incurred therefor in carrying on such work. The question is, then, squarely presented, whether or not there can be a recovery upon the bond based upon the condition thereof by a third person not a party thereto, where the bond does not by its terms expressly inure to the benefit of such third person, and the right to sue thereon is based entirely upon the theory that the third person is entitled to sue upon a promise made for his benefit. The supreme court of Texas, upon a bond identical in form, held that the surety could not be sued thereon by a third party. <em>(National Bank of Cleburne </em>v. <em>Gulf etc. Ry. Co., </em>95 Tex. 176, [66 S. W. 203].) This was upon the theory that the bond was one of indemnity to the Railway Company, containing no express agreement to pay such third person, and therefore he could not sue thereon. If we adopt this view we violate the fundamental principle that every part of a contract should be given some effect, for the Railway Company could not, in any event, be liable for \u201cgoods\u201d and \u201cprovisions \u2019 \u2019 furnished the contractor in carrying out its contract, nor in this case could there be any lien therefor, as the property upon which the work was done was government property. If, under the circumstances, any effect whatever is to be given to this clause in the condition of the bond, it must be held that it was the intention of the parties to benefit such third persons rather than the Railway Company, to whom the bond ran. The case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>26 Or. 186, [37 Pac. 712], is in harmony with the supreme court of Texas. The courts of Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, and Michigan, however, seem to hold to the view that if it can be fairly said from either the contract or the bond, which are to be construed together, that the parties intended to and did agree to pay such third person, a suit could be brought on such bond by such third person to recover upon the promise so made for his benefit. <em>(Lyman </em>v. <em>City of Lincoln, </em>38 Neb. 794, [57 N. W. 531]; <em>Kaufmann </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>46 Neb. 644, [65 N. W. 796]; <em>School District </em>v. <em>Levers, </em>147 Mo. 580, [49 S. W. 507]; <em>Jordan </em>v. Kavanaugh, 63 Iowa, 152, [18 N. W. <em>851]; National Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Foster Lumber Co., </em>42 Ind. App. 671, [85 N. E. 489].) While the question has not been directly decided by this court, the cases of <em>Union Sheet Metal Works </em>v. <em>Dodge, supra, </em>and <em>People\u2019s Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Gillard, supra, </em>were based in part upon the authority of the Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and Nebraska cases, as was also the case of <em>W. P. Fuller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Alturas School District, </em>28 Cal. App. 609, [153 Pac. 743]. We therefore hold that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the item for goods and provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The lower court is directed to modify the judgment by striking out all items therefrom save and except the item of $75 for goods and provisions, and as so modified the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Melvin, J., and Victor E. Shaw., J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
