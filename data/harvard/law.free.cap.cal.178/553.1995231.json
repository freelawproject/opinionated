The appeal is by the alternative method. The typewritten transcript embraces 120 pages. The appellant relies solely upon the point that the evidence is insufficient to justify the findings and judgment of the court. His opening brief contains no supplement such as is required by the rule, nor does it disclose any attempt at compliance with the rule by quotation, reference, or otherwise, directing the court to the portions of the record upon which appellant relies to sustain his point. Although appellant\u2019s attention was expressly directed by respondent\u2019s brief to his utter disregard of the rule, no effort has been made to correct the deficiencies in his brief, either by way of a reply brief or by application for relief to the court. Instead appellant has filed a stipulation submitting the cause upon the briefs on file.
