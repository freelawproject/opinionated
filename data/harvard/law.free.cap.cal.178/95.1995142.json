This so-called statement, however, is not made the subject of stipulation nor is it authenticated in any manner whatsoever. Hence, there is no record upon which this court can say that error was committed as claimed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Wilbur, J., and Melvin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
