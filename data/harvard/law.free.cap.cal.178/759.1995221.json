He asks damages in the sum of $21,390.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On motion of the defendants the court below struck from the complaint all the allegations of special damages above detailed. As thus altered the complaint contained a statement of the ouster, the enforced removal of his property from the premises, and a general allegation that the plaintiff has suffered damages by reason thereof in the sum of $21,390.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The causes of demurrer specified were that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, because the land described in the complaint is situated in San Mateo County and the action was begun in the superior court of San Francisco; that several causes of action were improperly joined, and that the respective causes of action were not separately stated. The court erred in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The claim of lack of jurisdiction is based on the provisions of section 5, article VI, of the constitution, providing \u201cthat all actions for the recovery of the possession of, quieting the title to, or for the enforcement of liens upon real estate,\u201d must be begun in the county in which the real estate, or some part thereof, is situated. This complaint does not state a cause of action either to recover the possession of real estate or to quiet the title thereto. It does not allege that defendants claim any title to or interest in the land. It does not allege that the plaintiff was entitled to possession at the time the action was begun, and it does not ask for the recovery of possession. The allegation is that plaintiff was in lawful and peaceable possession on December 1, 1911, but no facts are stated upon which the plaintiff could found a claim of right to possession of the property after the' year 1912. The allegations of the complaint all imply that the period of occupation for which the plaintiff claims damage had expired before the action was begun. The complaint states a cause of action for damages to personal property and for damages from the loss of the use and occupation of lands for a specified period which had expired. Such an action may be commenced in any county in the state, and the right to have a trial in the county where the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>lies, if such right exists, can only be enforced by an application to change the venue. <em>(Miller &amp; Lux </em>v. <em>Kern County Land Co., </em>140 Cal. 132, [73 Pac. 836]; <em>Miller &amp; Lux </em>v. <em>Madera Canal etc. Co., </em>155 Cal. 73, [22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 39, 99 Pac. 502].)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The contention that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for damages is without any merit\" whatever. The allegations that the plaintiff was lawfully in possession of the premises, that he had his property thereon, and that he was without right ousted therefrom by the defendants and that damages to his property resulted from such ouster, constitutes a statement of a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">There was no misjoinder of causes of action. But one cause of action is stated in the complaint, that is to say, a cause of action for damages for a wrongful ouster of the plaintiff from land of which he was lawfully and peaceably in possession, a single trespass on lands. The fact that the trespass caused damages of several kinds, such as the loss of mesne profits, injury to personal property by reason of the removal, expenses of removal, and the like, does not make more than one cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">We think, also, that the court erred in sustaining the motion of the defendants to strike out the allegations of damages aforesaid. Damages which are the necessary consequence of the wrongful act can be recovered under the general allegation of the amount of damage inflicted. <em>(Treadwell </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>80 Cal. 579, [13 Am. St. Rep. 175, 5 L. R. A. 498, 22 Pac. 266].) But where there are different elements of damage flowing from the wrong and the amount of damages from each element is capable of exact statement, \u201cthe defendant has the right to be informed of the amount of the claim for each, so that he might be prepared with evidence at the trial to meet the claim.\u201d <em>(Mallory </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>98 Cal. 647, [33 Pac. 757] ; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Harbaugh, </em>105 Cal. 690, [39 Pac. 56].) And if damages ensue because of some particular circumstances existing at the time, though the natural consequences of the wrongful act in connection with the special circumstances, the facts must be specially alleged. <em>(Treadwell </em>v. <em>Whittier, supra.) </em>Under these rules it was proper for the plaintiff to state the fact of the exposure to the rainstorm and the particular damage arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>therefrom, and also the amount claimed for each element of the damage caused by the act. We are not prepared to say that plaintiff was entitled to recover all of the items of damage alleged. The defendants do not discuss the question and we, therefore, \u2022 deem it inadvisable to consider that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Wilbur, J., Sloss, 'J., Richards, J., <em>pro tem., </em>Lorigan, J., Melvin, J., and Angellotti, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
