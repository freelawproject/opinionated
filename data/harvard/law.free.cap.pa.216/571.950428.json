Subsequent to the execution of tbe bond and mortgage in question, the defendant sold a part of the property covered by the lien of the mortgage and the purchaser of that property executed a bond and mortgage to the Farmers <em>&amp; </em>Mechanics Building &amp; Loan Association, the use plaintiff in the judgment in dispute. Default was made on the mortgage to the Farmers and Mechanics association, foreclosure had, and the property bought in by the plaintiff. Prior to the sale of the property on the judgment recovered by the Farmers and Mechanics association, it purchased the judgment entered upon the bond accompanying the mortgage given to the Equitable Building <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association by the defendants in this case. The ground upon which defendants ask to have the judgment opened is, first, that in the purchase of a part of the property covered by the judgment at bar on a junior lien the Farmers and Mechanics association is compelled to satisfy the judgment entered upon the bond accompanying the mortgage given by the defendants to the Equitable Building &amp; Loan Association; and, second, that in the mortgage given to the Equitable Building &amp; Loan Association there was no bidding for the money at the time the money was loaned by the equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>table association to the defendants, and therefore the $1,200 premium charged is usury. The proposition that the purchase of only a part of the land covered by the mortgage to the Equitable association by the assignee of that mortgage at sheriff\u2019s sale had upon a junior incumbrance, satisfied the mortgage to the Equitable Building <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association, is not sustained by the authorities cited by the petitioner. If the identical land which is subject to a mortgage is bought at sheriff\u2019s sale on a junior incumbrance, by the mortgagee of the first mortgage, that purchase would satisfy the first mortgage because the purchaser at a sale upon the junior incumbrance takes the land subject to the first mortgage and the payment of the first mortgage is part of the consideration. But the courts of this state have never held, and we are of the opinion that they never will hold, that where a mortgage is given upon a tract of land and subsequently that land is divided and becomes the property of two different owners and the property of one is sold upon a judgment which is a junior to the lien of the mortgage covering the entire tract, if the owner of the mortgage covering the entire tract purchase the property at sheriff\u2019s sale, he not only satisfies the mortgage on his own property but satisfies that on his neighbor\u2019s. property. This is the contention here on the part of the defendant, and it is not sustained either by decisions or principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-3\">The question as to whether the amount charged as premium by the Equitable Building <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association in its loan to the defendants is usury, depends upon the question whether there was bidding done on behalf of the borrower when the loan was made by the association, and this is a disputed question of fact. George W. Flowers, Esq., a member of the bar, who was at the time attorney for the budding and loan association, testifies that he was authorized by the defendants to bid for them at the sale of the money of the association, and. that he did so bid, and the premium charged was the premium that he bid. The fact that he did bid and that he bid the amount of the premiums charged is not denied, but it is denied by Thomas and his wife that Flowers was authorized by them, or by others for them, to represent them and bid for the money. Subsequent to the making of the loan and the execution of the mortgage, Mrs. Thomas signed an order directed to the Equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>table Building <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association giving it directions how to pay out the proceeds of the loan, which the Equitable Building <em>&amp; </em>Loan Association had made to her. This instruction was in writing, signed by Mrs. Thomas, and witnessed by her husband, and directed to the building and loan association to appropriate of that loan the amount of $1,200 to premiums bid for the loan. If as a fact Flowers did bid for Mrs. Thomas without authority, then her subsequent conduct is ratification of his agenc3q and she may not now set up the fact that Flowers in assuming to represent her in bidding for this loan was not her authorized agent.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AZu\">January 7, 1907:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-4\">Bule to open judgment discharged.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-5\"><em>Wm.
