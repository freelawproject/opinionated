That for a period of two and one-half years and upwards, prior to January, 1900, the defendant, W. S. Trowbridge, was engaged in the city of Meadville in the manufacture of confectionery, consisting of thin oblong pieces of molasses candy coated with chocolate, and generally known as chocolate chips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-17\">2. That said defendant then claimed, and still claims, to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>been tbe originator of this particular kind of confectionery, and adopted the name \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s Chocolate Chips,\u201d by which the same was known in the trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">8.

Shortly after the organization of the said copartnership, and upon complaint of a rival manufacturer of confectionery, the said copartnership dropped from the name or trade-mark of said chocolate chips the word \u201c velvet \u201d and substituted for said name or trade-mark, \u201c Trowbridge\u2019s Chocolate Chips, the Original,\u201d under which name and trade-mark they continued to manufacture said chocolate chips until the dissolution of said partnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">. 6.

About the middle of September, 1902, the defendant, W. S. Trowbridge, began in the city of Meadville the manufacture of confectionery known as chocolate chips, and similar in form and appearance to the same kind of confectionery manufactured by plaintiff and numerous other persons or firms throughout the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">16. The chocolate chip manufactured by defendant is plain and has no printing or stamp impressed thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">17. The said defendant is advertising and offering for sale his said confectionery and has solicited and is soliciting trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>therefor generally, and has adopted and is using a stamp or mark on his labels, packages, bill and letter heads, hereinafter more fully described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">18. The said defendant puts up his said confectionery in common or stock candy pails of a capacity of about ten and twenty-five pounds, respectively, and in common paper or pasteboard boxes or packages in quantities of five, one, one-half and one-fourth pounds.

The design used by defendant in his bill and letter heads, and probably on some smaller labels, advertisements, etc., is the same in language, form and colors as the label above described, being merely reduced in size.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">22. The pound and half-pound boxes used by defendant have printed somewhat diagonally across the tops in not very heavy script type the words \u201c Twentieth Century,\u201d with a flourish extending from the capital \u201c C \u201d back beneath and parallel with the word \u201c Twentieth.\u201d Preceding said words, on a line with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the top of the small letters thereof, in small Gothic type is the word \u201c The.\u201d Beneath the word \u201c century,\u201d on a horizontal line is printed in inclined Gothic type about one-eighth inch high, the words \u201c Chocolate Chips,\u201d and immediately beneath and parallel thereto is printed in somewhat smaller type the name \u201c W.

The position is wholly untenable. \u201c Good will \u201d has been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>fined by Judge Cooley as the favor which the management of a business has won from the public, and the probability that old customers will continue their patronage: Chittenden v* Witbeck, 50 Mich. 401; and Lord Eldon in Cruttwell v. Lye, 17 Yes. Jr. 385, spoke of it as \u201c simply the probability that old customers will resort to the old place.\u201d There is a very ample discussion of this question by the supreme court of Michigan, and a full citation of the authorities bearing on the point in Williams v. Farrand, reported in 14 L. R. A. 161. It is there said, \u201c the doctrine that a retiring partner who has conveyed his interest in an established business, whether the good will be included or not, cannot personally solicit the old customers of the firm, has no support in principle. A retiring partner conveys in addition to bis interest in the tangible effects, simply the advantage that an established business possesses over a new enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In the present case the contract for the sale of defendant\u2019s interest in the business was in writing, and we do not find in it anything which can be construed into an agreement by the defendant to refrain from engaging in a similar business, under his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">An agreement to retire from business, and not to resume it again, is in restraint of trade, and cannot rest upon mere inference : Hall\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 458. So long as the defendant does not attempt to sell his goods as those of the old firm, or represent that his business is a continuation of the old firm, he is at liberty to engage under his own name, honestly and in good faith, in the same line of business and in the same locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We think the learned judge of the court below was entirely correct in his statement of the third conclusion of law, in which he says, \u201c The defendant is not deprived of the right to use his own name in connection with the conduct of his business simply from the fact that his surname is a portion of the trade-mark used by the copartnership of which he was formerly a member, and whose business has been continued by plaintiffs.\u201d And in the further comment made by him in overruling the exception to this finding, as follows: \u201c He has no right to use said name for the purpose of misleading the public or to induce persons to deal with him in the belief that they are dealing with or ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>quiring the product of the old firm, or its successors in business. He also has the same right to hold himself out as the person who invented or originated the kind of wares he offers for sale, subject to the same limitations.\u201d And in this connection it appears that the court below found as a fact, upon evidence which seems to us sufficient, that the defendant had not in this respect infringed upon or violated the rights of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">So too in deciding the remaining question in this case, as to whether the defendant has so imitated the trade-mark or labels of the plaintiffs as to interfere unfairly with their business, or deceive the public, the court below has applied a well-established rule, and has found that \u201c the trade-mark or labels used by defendant are not so similar to those of plaintiffs in appearance, or in the sound and connection of the words, as are likely to cause a person of ordinary intelligence, using ordinary caution, in making purchases to be misled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">This finding is really the gist of the whole case, for if the action of the defendant has deceived or is likely to deceive purchasers, so that they have purchased or will probably accept the goods of the defendant under the mistaken notion that they are those of the plaintiffs, then the defendant should be enjoined from any such use of the labels. But measured by this well-established rule, it does not appear from the evidence, that the defendant has in any sense offended. A comparison of the labels of the respective parties shows such marked and striking differences that no one who has eyes to see with, and uses them, can fail to notice the differences. We cannot see that the similarity is sufficient to convey a false impression, or to mislead the ordinary purchaser. The labels of defendant distinctly refer to his own manufacture, and show that the goods are those of W. S. Trowbridge, and not those of the plaintiffs, the Trow-bridge Chocolate Chip Company. While both sets of labels are descriptive of the same article of manufacture, yet the label of plaintiffs bears upon its face a prominent and distinctive emblem, a large bowl filled to the brim with chocolate chips, while the corresponding label of defendant is entirely devoid of any emblem, but has instead the distinctive and arbitrary descriptive words \u201ctwentieth century.\u201d The distinction between the labels intended for smaller packages is equally apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In fact, tbe real difficulty in this case is that the plaintiffs have reason to fear, not that the public will be deceived, but that if the fact becomes known that the defendant is engaged in the same business the public will purposely purchase the goods made by him for the reason that he was and is the originator of the confection known as chocolate chips. In other words, what the plaintiffs really desire is protection from the business competition of the defendant, carried on openly and frankly by him under his own name. As we have already seen, this was something which they did not provide for under the terms of the written agreement when they purchased from him his interest in the business, and they cannot now be permitted indirectly to attain this end which they failed to stipulate expressly for in negotiating the purchase, and which presumably was not included in fixing the amount of the consideration. The learned judge of the court below has with great industry and accuracy examined and assembled the eases bearing upon the exact questions here in dispute, has drawn from them the legal principles upon which they rest, and has with precision applied those principles to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We see no reason whatever to differ from any of the conclusions reached by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The exceptions are overruled, and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
