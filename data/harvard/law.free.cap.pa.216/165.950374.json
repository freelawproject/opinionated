Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-10\">The opinion of the Superior Court, Orlady, J., was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s son, aged about fifteen years, was killed at Cresson station on the defendant\u2019s railroad on November 20, 1902, about five o\u2019clock in the evening.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-12\">It is undisputed that the Union News Company, under an arrangement with the defendant, had a booth or stand, for the sale of papers, periodicals, etc., on the platform of Cresson station, and received its supplies at that point by baggage car service, the goods being delivered at the car door to the employees of the Union News Company, and by them taken to the .booth. John F. Parrish was the local agent of the Union News Company, and, as a personal enterprise, operated a small business in the name of the Cresson News Company, by deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ering papers, magazines, etc., in Cresson, at points away from the station.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\">Plenry Waltz was employed by Parrish for $2.50 a week to deliver papers received at the booth around the town, and to perform such other work as he was directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">On November 20, Parrish was obliged to go away from Cresson for the night, and requested his father to take care of the evening business at the booth, lock it up, and open it for business the next morning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">The morning daily papers arrived at six and eight thirty o\u2019clock by east and west trains. The news stand was generally kept open until about eight o\u2019clock p. M. On this evening, Parrish, the father, who was there representing his son, testified as follows: \u201c Q. Did you see Henry Waltz around there?- A. Yes, sir. Q. Where was he? A. Standing at the outside window; I was inside. Q. What was Henry Waltz doing there ? A. He was there for the purpose of helping that evening. Q. What were you doing there? A. I was tending to the news stand for the evening. Q. What was Henry doing ? A. Well, he intended \u2014 his idea was to bring the papers from the train, as the train pulled in there, he was to bring the papers to the stand to me. That is what he was there for, to bring the papers up to the stand. Q. You were in charge of the news stand that evening? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you invite Henry Waltz down there that evening? A. Yes, sir ; I asked him to help me out that evening. Q. You asked him to come down ? A. Yes, sir. Q. What were John Parrish and Mr. Waltz talking about? A. About newspapers. Q. What was the conversation? A. Mr. Parrish told him to go and get the newspapers when the train would come in from the west. He was to get them and distribute them among the customers. To get them ready. Q. What train did he look for the papers on? A. It was No. 84 (a passenger train).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">The boy was standing on the station platform near to the news booth, with baggage trucks in his immediate vicinity when, as the appellant in his history of the case states, \u201c The accident occurred by an engine running east on track No. 1, while the passenger train was standing on track No. 2, going in the same direction, striking a baggage truck, which was thrown against the deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>This engine had become disabled while hauling a train of cars from South Fork eastward and was obliged to leave the train at Portage, and from there the engineer reported its defective condition to the superintendent of the division. Orders were issued to the engineer to proceed to Altoona with the engine and tender alone, and while he was approaching Cress on station, owing to the escaping steam which filled the cab, he was unable to see along the line of the track and distinguish the passenger train standing at Cresson station. When quite near to the station he endeavored to bring his engine to a standstill, but found that the throttle would not work, and before he could apply the brakes successfully, the engine had passed through the station on the track between the one on which the passenger train was then standing and the station platform, striking the truck, and causing the death of the boy. This occupancy of the track by the engine was in direct violation of Rule No. 114, as follows: \u201c Trains approaching stations where a passenger train is receiving or discharging passengers must be stopped before reaching the passenger train.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">The only explanation of the violation of this rule was, that by reason of the defective freight engine, it could not be controlled. On the trial a prominent contention was that the boy was a trespasser on the track of the company, and unnecessarily exposed himself to a manifest danger by being there. This question was largely one of fact, and was fairly submitted to the jury, in the general charge as follows: \u201c If he was not there for a lawful purpose, if he was a trespasser and was not in some lawful pursuit, or was careless and that contributed in any degree to his death, then the plaintiff, in this case, could not recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">There was abundant evidence to justify the jury in finding that as an employee of the Union News Company, he -was acting under orders of the representative of that company in doing its necessary work, and at the very place and time where the railroad company provided that it was to be done, by delivering the papers at the car door, and that he was not a trespasser, but was 'there under his right as an employee of the Union News Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">This action was brought in the name of the father. The defendant\u2019s first point being, \u201c Inasmuch as Martha Waltz, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>mother of the deceased, is living, and is not a party to this action, the plaintiff cannot recover,\u201d which was refused by the court. The defendant\u2019s fifth point was as follows : \u201c The defendant requests the court to instruct the jury that if they find for the plaintiff, to state in their written verdict whether the damages so found are for full compensation for both parents of the deceased.\u201d This was answered as follows: \u201cWe instruct you, if you find for the plaintiff to find full compensation and damages, so far as it affects both parents, and you must say in your verdict that you so find. That is, you will find full compensation in damages, whether due the father, or due the mother, or due both the father and the mother.\u201d The verdict returned was as follows: \u201cSept. 9, 1904. We, the jurors impaneled in the above-entitled case, find for the parents, the sum of $1,446.56. Total damages for the death of their son.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-3\">The plaintiff filed a formal motion to amend by adding the name of Mary Waltz, the mother of the deceased, as one of the parties entitled to recover. On April 4, 1905, the amendment was allowed, and judgment was then entered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">Whatever of irregularity there was in the pleadings, it was relieved by this amendment. In Huntington &amp; Broad Top Mountain Railroad Company v. Decker, 84 Pa. 419, the proper practice to be followed, under the act of 1855, is fully considered so that there should be no controversy in the profession as to who are the proper parties, and how their demand should be stated. See also Kerr v. Pa. R. R. Co., 169 Pa. 95; Weaver v. Iselin, 161 Pa. 386; Haughey v. Pitts. R. R. Co., 210 Pa. 367; Hughes v. Williams, 17 Pa. Superior Ct. 229.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">The addition of the name Mary Waltz did not change the form of the action, and while her name should have been included in the statement as a person entitled to participate in the damages, its omission did not in any way harm the defendant in the light of the verdict returned by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">The negligence of the company in allowing the dismantled engine to proceed on its way to Altoona, when it could not be controlled by the engineer, was a proper matter for the consideration of the jury in determining whether that act was negligent or not. It would be straining the judgment of com-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>mon-sense jurors to hold under the testimony of the engineer who had it in charge that it was not negligent. This act of negligence was in the carrying out of the direct order of the superintendent of the division, after he was advised, \u201c That the engine was in no condition to haul the train. The packing was blown out of the throttle.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">In view of the character of his employment, the boy was not a trespasser while he was receiving the papers from the baggage car, and, conceding that he was engaged or employed about the depot within the meaning of the Act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 58, the plaintiff was entitled to recover by reason of the negligence of the company in permitting the freight engine to run through the station while the passenger train was standing at that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">The case was carefully tried in the court below and after a fair submission to the jury of all the disputed facts, no sufficient reason has been shown to warrant our disturbing the verdict as returned by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\"><em>JSrror assigned </em>was the judgment of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-8\"><em>H. W. Storey, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHG\">The court held that the amendment of bringing in a new party did no harm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-9\">The facts are these:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-10\">November, 20, 1902, the accident occurred; November, 18, 1903, this action was brought; September 9, 1904, trial took place; September 9,1904, defendant objects for want of parties; April 4, 1905; motion for anew trial refused; April 4,1905, plaintiff moves to amend by adding the name of Mary Waltz, which was granted under objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-11\">We contend there are several reasons why the amendment should be permitted, viz :</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-12\">1. The act of 1855 requires that the statement shall set forth who are entitled to recover. This was not done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-13\">2. Defendant objected at the first moment of the trial for the omission. There was no amendment then.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-14\">3. Defendant submitted two points on the subject. Still there was no amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-15\">When the court refused the first point, we then submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the fifth point, to ascertain definitely whether the jury would allow damages to one who was not a party.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuW\">January 7, 1907:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-3\">4.

Lackawanna Lumber Co., 212 Pa. 495.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AN5\">Mr. Justice Mestrezat,</author>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">This is not a common-law action, but an action brought under the provisions of the Acts of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, and April 26, 1855, P. L. 309. It is solely by virtue of the provisions of these statutes that damages are recoverable for the death of Henry Waltz. The latter act provides in its first section that \u201c the persons entitled to recover damages for any injury causing death shall be the husband, widow, children or parents of the deceased, and no other relative, and the sum recovered shall go to them in the proportion they would take his or her personal estate in case of intestacy;\u2019\u2019 and in the second section it is provided that \u201c the declaration shall state who are the parties entitled in such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Henry Waltz was a minor son of M. C. Waltz and of his wife Mary Waltz, and the parents are both living. It is, therefore, apparent that in bringing the suit the act of 1855 was entirely disregarded, notwithstanding the plain terms of the statute and the numerous decisions of this court pointing out the \u201cproper practice. The action should have been brought jointly in the names of both parents and the statement should have given the names of the parties who were entitled to the damages recovered. Neither of these requirements of the statute was complied with, and the trial court was clearly wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>in holding that \u201c the failure to join the husband and wife, the parents of the decedent, in this action \u201d was not error. The ruling of- the learned judge disclosed a misapprehension of the plain terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">But the error of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in bringing the action and of the ruling of the trial court was cured by what occurred at the trial. The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court \u201c to instruct the jury that if they find for the plaintiff, to state in their written verdict whether the damages so found are for the full compensation for both parents of the deceased.\u201d Complying with this request, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cWe instruct you, if you find for the plaintiff, to find full compensation and damages so far as affects both parents, and you must say in your verdict that you so find; that is, you will find full compensation in damages, whether due the father or due the mother, or due both the father and the mother.\u201d The written verdict of the jury was in the following language: \u201cWe, the jurors impaneled in the above-entitled case, find for the parents the sum of $1,446.50, total damages for death of son.\u201d Judgment was entered on this verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">It will therefore be observed that at the instance of the defendant company, the record was amended in fact, though not formally, on the trial so that both parents were made plaintiffs, and that the case\" was tried and the verdict was rendered for both on which a judgment was duly entered. It is from this judgment, in favor of both parents, we have this appeal; and it is not apparent to us how we can reverse the judgment because the parents were not joined in bringing the action and in recovering the judgment against the defendant. Mrs. Waltz, the mother of the deceased, is precluded from attacking the action of the court on the trial of the cause by which she was made a party plaintiff by the motion of her counsel to amend on April 4, 1905, which was allowed by the court. This was a ratification and approval by Mrs. Waltz of the action of the jury in considering and determining her rights as a party plaintiff in the action and of the entry of judgment on the verdict. She is therefore concluded as to any right of action accruing to her against the defendant by reason of the death of Henry Waltz. The defendant, company is likewise bound by the action of the court, taken on its initiative, in treating the suit as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>brought by the father and mother of the deceased and in directing the jury \u201c to find full compensation and damages so far as affects both parents.\u201d As thus amended, the proper parties were made plaintiffs, and the amendment made by the court on April 4, 1905, was unnecessary and'did-the defendant no harm, and hence may be regarded as harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The other questions raised on the record were properly disposed of by the Superior Court, and therefore, for the reasons above stated,</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
