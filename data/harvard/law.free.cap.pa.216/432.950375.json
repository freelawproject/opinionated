Bassett, agreed with defendant, in a telephone conversation at that time, that in consideration of defendant agreeing to make no further sales of said iron purchased under the contract he would, representing the plaintiff as aforestated, divert the iron under said contract and cancel the contract and discharge the defendant from all liability thereunder. Defendant agreed to this proposition as stated, and did not sell any of the aforesaid iron. The next day, to wit: May 3, 1903, defendant received a letter dated May 2, 1903, signed by the said Guy M. Bassett, and attached to plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, and says that notwithstanding said letter neither the said Bassett or defendant paid any further attention to the contract. About two months thereafter, to wit: in July, 1903, the price of said iron had gone down below the contract price, to wit: to $18.00 per ton, and the said Rogers, Brown <em>&amp; </em>Company, by the said Bassett, informed defendant that they would hold them to the terms of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">By reason of the premises defendant says it is not liable to the plaintiff in any sum whatsoever and that the cancellation of the contract, as made by the said Bassett, representing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>said plaintiff, canceled the contract and discharged defendant from, all liability thereunder.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVk6\">January 7, 1907:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-4\">All of which defendant says is true and correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">The court made absolute rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-7\"><em>Edmond </em>Englert, of <em>Burleigh, Gray &amp; Challener,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2p\">for appellant, cited : Keffer v.

The plaintiff company relies on a contract in writing, for the sale and delivery to the defendant, at different times, a certain amount of pig iron upon the terms specified in said agreement. There was partial delivery and payment in full for the amount so delivered. The defendant, alleging a cancellation of the contract, refused to take the balance of the pig iron to be delivered according to the terms of the contract. This action was brought to recover damages for the alleged breach on the ground that there had been no authorized cancellation of the contract. The original and supplemental affidavits of defense aver a cancellation and set out in \u00abdetail the time, place and manner when and where made. The averment is that the cancellation of the contract was made through the authorized agent of the plaintiff. The court below did not state any reason for holding the affidavits of defense to be insufficient, but the learned counsel for appellee rely on Weld v. Barker, 153 Pa. 465; and Newbold v. Pennock, 154 Pa. 591, to support their contention that the averment of the agency of Rogers, Brown &amp; Company and their authority to cancel the contract did not meet the legal requirements in such cases. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>latter case it was said that if the affiant cannot state the facts upon which he relies to defeat a recovery, of his own knowledge, that it is the best legal form to say that he \u201c is informed and believes and expects to be able to prove \u201d the facts at the trial of the cause. It was further suggested that the defendant or his counsel who departed from this approved form and undertook to establish another which he may think is a full equivalent, does so at his own risk. It, however, was not decided in that or any other case that it was an unbending requirement to use the words \u201cis informed, believes and expects to be able to prove,\u201d in an affidavit of defense, when affiant cannot state the facts of his own knowledge, although it is always wise to follow the approved form. In the present case the affiant uses the words \u201c believes and says \u201d in averring the agency and then gives in detail the facts and circumstances relating to the course of dealing between the parties through the alleged agent, specifically stating that the agent had the authority to cancel the contract, and did cancel it and concluded with the averment that all of the facts set out in the affidavit are \u201c true and correct.\u201d This is sufficient to put the parties on their proof. It may be that upon a trial of the cause when the evidence has been produced it would be the duty of the court to say as a matter of law that sufficient authority had not been shown in the alleged agent to cancel the contract, but that question cannot arise at this stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Judgment reversed with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
