Daniel Barnard and Elizabeth Barnard, the plaintiffs in '.\u2019this case, are the owners in fee of a tract of land in Deemston ; borough, in this county, containing' sixty-six acres, more or 'dess.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-14\">2. James B. Barnard owns in fee a tract of land adjoining the plaintiffs\u2019 land and containing 156 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-15\">3. The Monongahela Natural Gas Company, a corporation in the business of producing and marketing natural gas, holds a lease on each of these farms <em>u </em>for the purpose and with the ex- , elusive'right of drilling and operating thereon for petroleum and gas/\u2019^which said leases were in full force and effect when , the bill herein was filed and are yet in force and effect. 1 By the terms of these leases the Monongahela Natural Gas Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>pany is to pay to the respective lessors a fixed sum per year for the gas from each well drilled on their or his farm \u201c so long as it shall be sold therefrom.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\">4. The farm of James B. Barnard joins the farm of the plaintiffs, Daniel and Elizabeth Barnard, in such a way thatjat one corner of his farm there is an angle of about twelve degrees less than a right angle, and the lines of the adjoining farm that make this angle are respectively sixty-two and seventy-five rods long, so tlia|a circle large enough to include ten acres of ground with its center at this corner would inclose less than two and one-half acres of the land of James B. Barnard and seven and one-half acres of the land of Daniel and Elizabeth Barnard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">5. That the Monongahela Natural Gas Company, the defendant, lately drilled a well on the James B. Barnard farmjin the corner described in our previous finding which is fifty-five feet from the actual corner, andjabout thirty-five feet from either of the lines dividing the two farms, and upon the completion of said well it was found to be a paying gas well [such as to entitle the lessor to his annual rental, provided for in the lease?j This well was drilled on the location chosen after the plaintiffs had protested against it being located so near their lines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">6. That since this well was drilled on the James B. Barnard farm the defendant company has drilled a well on the plaintiffs\u2019 farm 1,350 feet away from the James B. Barnard welEand not far from an angle which the line of the plaintiffs\u2019 farm and their adjoiners make, f This well when completed failed to produce any gas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">7.

That .the defendant company, under all the facts of this case, is not guilty of either actual or legal fraud in that it drilled the James B.

But the plaintiffs\u2019 contention raises a question of law that is both novel and interesting, and if sustained by the highest court of our state would revolutionize the manner of developing oil and gas leaseholds. \u201c What the law ought to be \u201d and \u201c what the law is \u201d are different questions. The Supreme Court, ignoring the principi\u00e9 of stare decisis, on account of changed conditions or for any reason justifying it, may declare \u201c what ought to be the law \u201d to be henceforth \u201c the law,\u201d but the lower courts have no such authority ; our duty is to follow the lead of the decisions, not to qualify, explain, modify, overrule or reverse them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">What then are the questions of law involved in this case, and under existing decisions how must they be answered ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">The first question stated broadly is this: \u201c Can a landowner in gas territory, drill a well on his farm close to the line of his adjoining landowner and draw from the land of the latter three-fourths of the gas that his well may produce without so invading the property rights of the adjoining landowner as to be legally accountable therefor.\u201d There is no doubt that the oil and gas confined in the oil and gas-bearing sands pf a farm belong to the one who holds title to the farm,' but it is also recognized both as a question of fact and law that oil and gas are fugitive in their nature and will by reason of inherent pressure seek any opening from the.earth\u2019s surface that may reach the sand where they are confined. Mr. Justice Wiliams, in Wettengel v. Gormley, 160 Pa. 559, in discussing this question so far as it relates to oil, says: \u201c It is well understood among oil operators that the fluid is deposited in a porous sand rock, at a distance ranging from 500 to 3,000 feet below the surface. This rock is saturated throughout its extent with oil and when the hard stratum overlying it is pierced by the drill the oil and gas find vent and are forced by the pressure , to which they are subject into and through the well to the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>face.\u201d \u201cAn oil or gas well may draw its product from an indefinite distance and in time exhaust a large space. Exact knowledge on this subject is not at present attainable, but the vagrant character of the mineral and the porous sand rock in which it is found and through which it moves, fully justify the general conclusion we have stated above and have led to its general adoption by practical operators.\u201d \\</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-3\">\u201c The right of every landowner to drill a well on his own land at whatever spot he may see fit \u201d certainly must be conceded. If then the landowner drills on his own land at such a spot as best subserves his purposes what is the standing of the adjoining1 landowner whose oil or gas may be drained by this well ? He certainly ought not to be allowed to stop his neighbor from developing his own farm. There is no certain way of ascertaining how much of the oil and gas that comes out of the well was when in situ under this farm and how much under that. What then has been held to be the law ? \u2014 it is this, as we understand it, every landowner or his lessee may locate his wells wherever he pleases regardless of the interests of others. He may distribute them over the whole farm or locate them only on one part of it. He may crowd the adjoining farms so as to enable him to draw the oil and gas from them. What, then can the neighbor do? Nothing, only go and do likewise. He must protect his own oil and gas. He knows it is wild and will run away if it finds an opening and it is his business to keep it at home. This may not be the best rule, but neither the legislature nor our highest court has given us any better. No doubt many thousands of dollars have been expended \u201c in protecting lines \u201d in oil and gas territory that would not have been expended if some rule had existed by which it could have been avoided. Injunction certainly is not the remedy. If so, just how far niust the landowner be from the line of his neighbor to avoid the blow of \u201c this strong arm of the law \u201d ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-4\">This brings us to the second question in the case, and that is this, \u201cWill a lessee who has a lease on each of two adjoining farms be enjoined at the instance of one of the landowners from drilling a well on the farm of the other at such a point as will drain most of the gas that it produces from the land of the first? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">This question, has in it an element that is not in the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and that grows out of the fact the landowners have a common ' lessee. We think it is well settled that the lessee has the same rights in regard to the locating of his wells as the landowner would have if doing the operating, but he cannot take advantage of the fact that he has leases on adjoining farms so as to fraudulently deprive either of his lessors of his royalty or annual gas rental. (^The law of this position is found in Kleppner \u2018 v. Lemon, 176 Pa. 502, as explained in the later cases of Colgan v. Forest Oil Co., 194 Pa. 234, and Young v. Forest Oil Co., 194 Pa. 243. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-4\">The drilling of the well by the defendant company at. the point they did on the James B. Barnard farm was not as we have seen a fraud per se or simply because it would, drain gas from the plaintiffs\u2019 farm; it might become a fraud because of something other than the drilling of this well, and that would be in refusing to develop or protect the plaintiffs\u2019 farm. ' But I it appears that the defendant company soon after they drilled a well in\u00a3\u201cthe angle\u201d of]the James B. Barnard farm alsp located and drilled to completion a well injpr near \u201can angle , of the plaintiffs\u2019 farm where'he would have gotten some of the . gas of his neighbor on the other side of his farm had it been a producing well. The fact that this well proved a dry hole in no way militates against the defendant company\u2019s effort to do . \u2019 the fair thing, as between it and the <em>plaintiffs.''\u00a1A </em>Well on each farm, and James B. Barnard\u2019s farm twice as large as that of' the plaintiffs\u2019, does not show partiality toward James B. Bar- , nard. We are clearly of the opinion thatj there was no such fraud on the part of the defendant company in the premises as, would entitle the plaintiffs to either an injunction or an accounting for damages done by draining gas from their farm through the James B. Barnard well, and therefore the plaintiffs\u2019 bill ^should be dismissed with costs. . * \u00bb *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjV1\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-6\">' <em>Boyd </em>Grumrine, with him <em>E.
