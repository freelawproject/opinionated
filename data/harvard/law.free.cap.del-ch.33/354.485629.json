In order to be certain that application was made to the proper forum, a duplicate motion was also filed in the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In <em>duPont v. duPont, </em>46 <em>Del. (Terry) </em>592, 87 <em>A.2d </em>394 (400), after pointing out that allowances of fees normally involve findings of fact, that the trial court is the forum designed for determining facts, and, accordingly, that the trial court is usually the proper court to make allowances of fees and expenses, we, nevertheless, went on to say that in exceptional cases, i.e., in instances where no further proceedings are required in the lower court, and where no facts need be noticed except such as have been found of record, and no services or expenses are involved except such as relate directly to the proceedings in our own court, we might be under a duty to act upon applications for allowances. This is just such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The nature of the litigation, of course, was reviewed in our earlier opinion, and there is no necessity for recapitulation here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>In addition, the record shows that plaintiff\u2019s counsel, at the conclusion of the litigation below, applied t&amp;_fhe Chancellor for fees and expenses, representing, (a), that he had devoted four hundred sixteen and three quarters (416-3/4) hours of work to the case, and (b), that his efforts had resulted in a saving to the corporation of at least the equivalent of $94,909. Thereupon, the Chancellor allowed him refund of his disbursements and the sum of $23,725.25 as a fee. An affidavit supporting the motion before us indicates that plaintiff\u2019s counsel has spent an additional forty (40) hours in work upon the appeal. The corporation resists the instant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u25a0 We do not question that moving counsel devoted to the appeal the time specified in the affidavit, but, nevertheless, we cannot grant the application. As the fee allowed below was a one-fourth<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> part of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s own estimated minimum saving to the corporation, it appears to us that he was compensated, not on an hourly basis, but on what was akin to a contingent fee contract. The amount to which the percentage must be applied is no larger now than it was then. The Court of Chancery having allowed plaintiff\u2019s counsel the advantage of a \u201cpercentage\u201d rule, we cannot permit him now the additional advantage of changing to an hourly basis in order to provide an increment. Nor can we see our way clear, on the theory of additional services, to increase the percentage allowed below, for what the Court of Chancery allowed him, in the circumstances of this case, in our opinion provided adequate compensation for all he has done to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The motion for allowance of an additional fee will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\"> Lacking two dollars.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
