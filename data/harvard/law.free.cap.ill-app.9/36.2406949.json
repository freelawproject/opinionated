The People, 90 Ill. 512.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\" pgmap=\"32\">It is error to try an accused when no plea has been entered: Aylesworth v. The People, 65 Ill. 301; Gould v. The People, 89 Ill. 217.</p> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b32-12\" pgmap=\"32\">Davis, J.</author> <p id=\"AoB\" pgmap=\"32\">The plaintiff in error, and two others, were indicted for a riot, and on trial, the plaintiff was found \u201cnot guilty of riot, but guilty of an assault,\u201d and the two others were found not guilty. A motion was made by the plaintiff for a new trial, which was overruled by the court, and thereupon the plaintiff was sentenced to a fine of ten dollars and costs. To reverse the judgment this writ of error was prosecuted.</p> <p id=\"b32-13\" pgmap=\"32\">It is apparent that the judgment must be reversed. The record discloses that the plaintiff in error never pleaded to the indictment, or in any way consented to a -trial without a plea. In the absence of a plea there was no issue .for the jury to try, and a party convicted under such circumstances could not be properly sentenced. Johnson v. The People, 22 Ill. 314; Aylesworth v. The People, 65 Ill. 301; Yundt v. The People, 65 Ill. 374.</p> <p id=\"b32-14\" pgmap=\"32(10) 33(26)\">Another ground for reversal is, that under an indictment for a riot a defendant cannot be convicted of an assault. Freeland v. The People, 16 Ill. 380; Furguson et al. v. The People, 90 Ill. 510.</p> <p id=\"b33-4\" pgmap=\"33\">It is true that the last case cited has been overruled, but on other grounds, and the rule remains as established by the two cases.</p> <p id=\"b33-5\" pgmap=\"33\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
