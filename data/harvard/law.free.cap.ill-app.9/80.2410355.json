The plea is loosely drawn and is somewhat vague, but it is not demurred to specially, and upon general demurrer we incline to the opinion that the defense stated in the plea is substantially good.</p> <p id=\"b78-7\" pgmap=\"78\">Other errors are assigned that we regard as sufficient to entitle appellant to a reversal, but they are of such a character as to be easily obviated- on another trial, and not likely to occur again; we therefore deem it unnecessary to notice them further here. The judgment is reversed and cause remanded, with leave to defendant to amend his third plea. \u2019</p> <p id=\"b78-8\" pgmap=\"78\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
