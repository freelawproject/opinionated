Finding no exception in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA or Act), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602 <em>et seq., </em>applicable to Peterson\u2019s claims, the district court dismissed his law suit for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Peterson v. Royal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, </em>332 F.Supp.2d 189 (D.D.C.2004), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 342-58. He now appeals, arguing that Saudi Arabia is not entitled to sovereign immunity because the FSIA\u2019s \u201cexpropriation\u201d and \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exceptions apply to the claims he presses. Neither exception applies, we conclude, and thus there is no basis for federal court jurisdiction over Saudi Arabia for the purpose-of Peterson\u2019s suit. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">We accept as true the facts Peterson alleges in his complaint and briefly recount them now.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In November 1969, Saudi Arabia established the General Organization of Social Insurance (GOSI) by Royal Decree \u201cto promote foreign commerce and attract badly needed foreign workers to Saudi Arabia.\u201d J.A. 3-4. GOSI has two distinct branches: the Occupational Hazards Branch, which provides insurance coverage for employment-related injuries, and the Annuities Branch, which provides retirement and death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">From 1969 until 1987, Saudi Arabia required employers and their employees, regardless of national origin or citizenship, to make contributions to GOSI. Employers were required to contribute two per cent of their employees\u2019 salaries to the Occupational Hazards Branch. Each employer and each employee were responsible for contributing \u201cthirteen ... percent of the total value of the employee\u2019s wages and other benefits\u201d to the Annuities Branch, the employer contributing eight-per cent and the employee the remaining five per cent. J.A. 6. \u201cAll contributions,\u201d however, \u201cwere made for the benefit of, and in the name of, the employee.\u201d J.A. 6. GOSI invested the contributions it received in domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>corporations and organizations as well as international banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In 1987 Saudi Arabia issued Royal Decree No. M/43, \u201cwhich excluded non-Saudi workers from GOSI\u2019s Annuities] Branch.\u201d J.A. 6. The upshot of the Royal Decree was that non-Saudi workers were no longer eligible for retirement and death benefits. At some point between 1987 and 1990, however, Saudi Arabia decided to refund to non-Saudi workers a portion of the contributions made to the Annuities Branch in their names. Peterson, who had worked for multiple engineering and construction companies in Saudi Arabia from 1979 to 1990 and made contributions to GOSI, applied for and eventually received in 1988 a refund of the five per cent contribution he made to the Annuities Branch. Along with his refund check, Peterson received the following notice: \u201cAttached is a check for the value of your entitlements, due to you as per the applicable rules for this purpose. This payment represents your full dues from GOSI.\u201d J.A. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Peterson alleges that Saudi Arabia failed to publicize the refund program, failed to explain its decision to refund only five per cent of the contributions made in his name and failed to \u201cstate when the remaining eight percent would be paid.\u201d J.A. 9. Throughout June 2003, Peterson contacted the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington, D.C., by telephone, by mail and by facsimile to ask for a date certain by which he would receive the remaining eight-per cent contribution his employers made in his name. Peterson notified the embassy that he would give Saudi Arabia until June 23, 2003 to answer his inquiry and that he would deem its failure to respond a constructive denial of his request. He received no answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Peterson then sued Saudi Arabia in the district court on August 21, 2003. His complaint alleges four claims based on Saudi Arabia\u2019s failure to refund the full amount paid into the GOSI Annuities Branch in his behalf: (1) arbitrary and discriminatory expropriation of his property in violation of international law; (2) breach of contract; (3) conversion of his property; and (4) unjust enrichment. Saudi Arabia subsequently filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted on August 23, 2004. <em>See Peterson, </em>332 F.Supp.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Peterson\u2019s suit under FSIA because his claims failed to meet the Act\u2019s \u201cexpropriation\u201d or \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exceptions. <em>See id. </em>at 196-201. With respect to the \u201cexpropriation\u201d exception, the district court concluded that \u201cthe eight percent GOSI contribution, characterized by the plaintiff as an expectation interest in payments, does not qualify as a right in tangible property and the expropriation exception does not apply here for that reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. \u201cThe fact that the property in question is not \u2018tangible\u2019 property is,\u201d it explained, \u201cdis-positive of the question whether the expropriation exception of the FSIA can apply to defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198. Turning to FSIA\u2019s \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception, the district court found it inapplicable as well because \u201c[t]he termination of GOSI benefits for foreign workers is a sovereign, not a commercial, act and the termination cannot be understood to have had a \u2018direct effect\u2019 in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2)). The termination was \u201cdistinctly sovereign,\u201d to the court\u2019s mind, because \u201ca private player in the market certainly could not engage in the particular actions of initiating, administering, and ending a scheme of mandatory social insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200 (internal quotation marks omitted). And there was no \u201cdirect\u201d effect in the United States, the court explained, because \u201c[biased on the record before the Court, it appears that, to the extent Peterson expected a refund of his GOSI contributions in a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>place, it can at most be described as an implied agreement for payment in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. In the alternative, the district court further concluded that Peterson\u2019s claims were \u201cbarred under any applicable statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">He now appeals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. On <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm the judgment of the district court, <em>see Princz v. Fed. Republic of Germany, </em>26 F.3d 1166, 1168 (D.C.Cir.1994) (foreign government\u2019s entitlement to sovereign immunity is question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1121, 115 S.Ct. 923, 130 L.Ed.2d 803 (1995), as set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In the United States, there is only one way for a court to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign state and it is not a particularly generous one \u2014 the FSIA. <em>See Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 443, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989) (\u201c[T]he FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country....\u201d); <em>accord World Wide Minerals, Ltd. v. Republic of Kazakhstan, </em>296 F.3d 1154, 1161 (D.C.Cir.2002). FSIA provides that a district court has jurisdiction over a civil action against a foreign sovereign for any claim \u201cwith respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a); <em>see World Wide Minerals, Ltd., </em>296 F.3d at 1161. But under the Act, a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts alike, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1604, and remains so unless an international agreement, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1330(a), 1604, or one of several exceptions in the statute provides otherwise, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1605, 1607. <em>See Phoenix Consulting, Inc. v. Republic of Angola, </em>216 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C.Cir.2000). In the absence of an applicable exception, the foreign sovereign\u2019s immunity is \u201ccomplete\u201d \u2014 \u201c[t]he district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, </em>507 U.S. 349, 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993) (\u201c[U]nless a specified exception applies, a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim against a foreign state.\u201d (citations omitted)). Peterson maintains that Saudi Arabia is not entitled to sovereign immunity under either of two FSIA exceptions \u2014 the \u201cexpropriation\u201d exception or the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d one. We conclude neither applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Peterson first maintains that Saudi Arabia is not entitled- to sovereign immunity because it arbitrarily and discriminatorily expropriated his property in violation of international law. Under FSIA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">[a] foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case ... in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property or any property exchanged for such property is present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or that property or any property exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGY\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(3). Thus, for a claim to fit within this statutory exception, it must meet three requirements: At issue must be (1) \u201crights in property\u201d that (2) were taken in violation of international law and (3) the property at issue (or any property exchanged for it) must either (a) be present in the United States \u201cin connection with a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state\u201d or (b) \u201cowned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that agency or instrumentality\u201d engages in commercial activity in the United States. <em>Id. </em>Our analysis begins and ends with the exception\u2019s first two requirements. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The parties make assorted arguments regarding whether the eight-per cent GOSI contributions made by Peterson\u2019s employers on his behalf constitute a \u201cright[ ] in <em>property\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., the parties dispute whether the eight-per cent contribution constitutes property at all, what kind of property it is \u2014 tangible or intangible\u2014 and, if it is property, to whom it in fact belongs. They direct most of their attention to the question whether the employers\u2019 GOSI contributions constitute tangible or intangible property. Saudi Arabia contends that FSIA\u2019s expropriation exception encompasses only tangible property (such as physical assets), not intangible property (such as a right to receive payment), and therefore does not apply to Peterson\u2019s employers\u2019 GOSI contributions, which it characterizes as securing an \u201c[expectation interest[ ] in social insurance benefits.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellees\u2019 Br. at 14. Peterson disagrees, arguing that such a cramped interpretation is \u201cshortsighted, overly formalistic and contradicts Congressional intent,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12, and that his employers\u2019 GOSI contributions constitute tangible property in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The parties\u2019 focus on this question is not surprising inasmuch as the district court found the question pivotal, as have other district courts. Some courts have held that the term \u201cproperty\u201d as used in FSIA\u2019s expropriation exception \u201cmeans physical property not the right to receive payment.\u201d <em>Lord Day &amp; Lord v. Socialist Republic of Vietnam, </em>134 F.Supp.2d 549, 560 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (internal quotation marks &amp; citations omitted) (expropriation exception inapplicable because claim based on entitlement to funds was \u201cfatally flawed\u201d); <em>accord, e.g., Sampson v. Fed. Republic of Germany, </em>975 F.Supp. 1108, 1117 (N.D.Ill.1997) (expropriation exception inapplicable to claim not involving \u201closs of tangible property\u201d because \u201cproperty under this section refers to tangible property\u201d (internal quotation marks &amp; citation omitted)), <em>aff'd, </em>250 F.3d 1145 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Intercontinental Dictionary Series v. De Gruyter, </em>822 F.Supp. 662, 678 (C.D.Cal.1993) (\u201cintangible intellectual property rights or the right to receive payment on a contract alleged by IDS are not grounds for applying the [expropriation] exception\u201d); <em>Canadian Overseas Ores Ltd. v. Compania de Acero del Pacifico S.A., </em>528 F.Supp. 1337, 1346 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (expropriation exception inapplicable to breach of contract claim because it \u201cis on its face inapplicable to a contractual right to be paid\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>727 F.2d 274 (2d Cir.1984); <em>see generally De Sanchez v. Banco Cent. de Nicaragua, </em>770 F.2d 1385, 1395 (5th Cir.1985) (declining to decide issue but citing cases); <em>cf. Hirsh v. State of Israel, </em>962 F.Supp. 377, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (assuming reparation payments were expropriated, exception \u201cnevertheless ... inapplicable, as it has been interpreted to apply only to the expropriation of tangible property, not to the right to receive payments\u201d). In fact, this case is not the only instance in which our Circuit\u2019s district court has analyzed the tangible/intangible distinction in assessing subject matter jurisdiction under FSIA\u2019s expropriation exception. <em>See Rong v. Liaoning Provincial Gov\u2019t, </em>362 F.Supp.2d 83, 101 (D.D.C.2005) (\u201c[T]he FSIA applies where the property at issue is tangible property.\u201d (internal quotation marks &amp; citation omitted)). Arguing against this precedent, Peterson relies on a Ninth Circuit decision construing the Second Hickenlooper Amendment, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2370(e)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>observed that \u201cthe tangible/intangible characterization of property interests ... is a distinction without a difference.\u201d <em>West v. Multibanco Comermex, S.A., </em>807 F.2d 820, 830 (9th Cir.1987). For our part, we have not decided the question and need not do so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Regardless whether the eight-per cent GOSI contributions constitute tangible or intangible property or what significance, if any, the latter classification may carry under FSIA\u2019s expropriation exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(3), Peterson has failed to allege sufficient facts demonstrating that the contributions constitute a \u201cright[] in property\u201d in the first place. Peterson maintains that his \u201csubstantial cash investments in GOSI\u201d constitute tangible property. Complaint at 13, \u00b6 58, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 13. But his contributions were not placed in a private account in his name; rather, if GOSI had remained in force with respect to foreign workers, the contributions Peterson (and his employers) made would have been returned to him in the form of an annuity upon his retirement at age 60, provided he met certain conditions. <em>See </em>J.A. 216-17. The annuity, moreover, would not have been based on his five-per cent and his employers\u2019 eight-per cent contributions to GOSI but instead on the average monthly wages he received in the two years preceding his retirement. <em>See </em>J.A. 217 (According to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Social Insurance Law base amount is \u201ccomputed by multiplying one-fiftieth of the average monthly wages by the number of insurance years.\u201d). Peterson\u2019s counsel made two concessions at oral argument that confirm that Peterson had no right, contractual or otherwise, to this benefit stream, which resembles our Social Security system more than a pension \u2014 such as a 401(k) plan. Peterson\u2019s counsel conceded both that Peterson was not guaranteed a return of the eight-per cent contributions his employers made to GOSI in his behalf, <em>see </em>Tr. of Oral Argument at 32:39, and that Saudi Arabia could have unilaterally eliminated the GOSI program for <em>all </em>workers, foreign and domestic, <em>see </em>Tr. of Oral Argument at 4:37. Taken together, these factors rebut Peterson\u2019s assertion that his and Ms employers\u2019 contributions to GOSI constitute \u201crights in property\u201d of which he was deprived in derogation of international law. <em>See Brewer v. Socialist People\u2019s Republic of Iraq, </em>890 F.2d 97, 101 (8th Cir.1989) (expropriation exception inapplicable because \u201cbreach of contract did not create \u2018rights in property\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Human Rights in China v. Bank of China, </em>No. 02 Civ. 4361, 2005 WL 1278542, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 2005) (expropriation exception inapplicable because plaintiff had \u201cno legal right to the property\u201d after funds transferred to third party).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Peterson nonetheless makes two arguments to the contrary, neither of which we find persuasive. Citing various authorities \u2014 from another circuit\u2019s opinion, <em>Alt</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>mann v. Republic of Austria, </em>317 F.3d 954 (9th Cir.2002), to a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, <em>Sk\u00f3rkiewicz v. Poland (dec.), </em>App. 39860/98, Eur. Ct. H.R. (1999), <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 74, to a law review article, Diego Rodr\u00edguez-Pinz\u00f3n &amp; Claudia Martin, <em>The International Human Rights Status of Elderly Persons, </em>18 Am. U. Int\u2019l L. Rev. 915 (2003) \u2014 Peterson first contends that we should heed emerging international norms prohibiting a government\u2019s taking of a person\u2019s property interest in his contributions to a pension plan. But, as we noted, the GOSI program is not a pension plan but a social insurance system. Thus it is of no moment that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Royal Decree No. M/43 affected only one group of GOSI\u2019s beneficiaries, <em>viz., </em>non-Saudi employees. Citing United States Supreme Court cases, including <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979) and <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), as well as ours, <em>Nixon v. United States, </em>978 F.2d 1269 (D.C.Cir. 1992) and <em>Hall v. Ford, </em>856 F.2d 255 (D.C.Cir.1988), for the notion that property is \u201cmade up of mutually reinforcing understandings,\u201d <em>Nixon, </em>978 F.2d at 1275, Peterson additionally argues that his employers\u2019 eight-per cent GOSI contributions constitute his property because Saudi Arabia treated it as such by refunding to him his five-per cent GOSI contribution. \u201c[T]here is no common sense, or legal difference between the ownership of the 5% contribution and the <em>8% </em>contribution made by the employer in the employee\u2019s name,\u201d his argument goes. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 23. While it is debatable that Saudi Arabia\u2019s refund of Peterson\u2019s five-per cent contribution to GOSI represents a \u201cmutual[ ] ... understanding[ ]\u201d that the contribution was Peterson\u2019s property, it is indisputable that the refund does not further represent a \u201cmutual[ ] ... understanding[ ]\u201d that <em>his employers' </em>eight-per cent contributions also constituted Peterson\u2019s property inasmuch as the refund notified Peterson that the refund constituted \u201cfull dues from GOSI.\u201d J.A. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Peterson next maintains that FSIA\u2019s \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception supplies the necessary jurisdiction. Under this exception,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">[a] foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case ... in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the \"foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2). A foreign state is subject to jurisdiction under this exception based upon any of three distinct types of commercial activity: \u201ccommercial activity carried on in the United States,\u201d an \u201cact performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity ... elsewhere,\u201d or an \u201cact outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity ... elsewhere\u201d which \u201ccauses a direct effect in the United States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Peterson asserts that his claim is based upon the third type \u2014 an act that (1) takes place \u201coutside the territory of the United States\u201d; (2) \u201cin connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere\u201d; and (3) \u201ccauses a direct effect in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The act that took place outside the United States, he says, is Saudi Arabia\u2019s 1987 Royal Decree excluding non-Saudi employees from GOSI, Royal Decree No. M/43. The Decree was issued \u201cin connection with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>commercial activity,\u201d he continues, because the \u201cact of investing the employee contributions in private companies and providing loans to private industry constituted commercial activity,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 36-37, and because the retirement system was established for an \u201coverriding commercial <em>purpose\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., \u201cto attract highly skilled foreign workers ... to live and work in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of developing the country\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d -Appellant\u2019s Br. at 38. The Royal Decree caused a \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the United States, Peterson concludes, because Saudi Arabia is \u201caccustomed to sending refund checks to be deposited in bank accounts in the United States and [its] failure to send a full refund has thus caused [a] direct effect in the United States.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Whatever the merit of Peterson\u2019s arguments regarding the first two requirements, we conclude that his claim fails the final <em>one </em>\u2014 ie., that the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d causes a \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the United States. In <em>Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 607, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992), the Supreme Court defined the term \u201cdirect effects\u201d; \u201can effect is \u2018direct,\u2019 \u201d the <em>Weltover </em>Court said, \u201cif it follows \u2018as an immediate consequence of the defendant\u2019s ... activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160 (quoting &amp; citing <em>Weltover, Inc. v. Republic of Argentina, </em>941 F.2d 145, 152 (2d Cir.1991)) (ellipsis by Court). The <em>Weltover </em>Court concluded that Argentina\u2019s unilateral rescheduling of the maturity dates of certain bonds caused a \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the United States because the payees \u201chad designated their accounts in New York as the place of payment, and Argentina made some interest payments into those accounts before announcing that it was rescheduling the payments.\u201d 504 U.S. at 618-19, 112 S.Ct. 2160. \u201cBecause New York was thus the place of performance for Argentina\u2019s ultimate contractual obligations,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthe rescheduling of those obligations necessarily had a \u2018direct effect\u2019 in the United States: Money that was supposed to have been delivered to a New York bank for deposit was not forthcoming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 112 S.Ct. 2160. We applied <em>Weltover </em>in <em>Goodman Holdings v. Rafidain Bank, </em>26 F.3d 1143 (D.C.Cir. 1994), and concluded that no \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the United States resulted from an Iraqi bank\u2019s failure to honor letters of credit because that failure resulted in \u201cno \u2018immediate consequence\u2019 in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1146 (quoting <em>Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160). We found \u201c[t]he situation ... quite different\u201d from <em>Welt-over </em>because \u201c[n]either New York nor any other United States location was designated as the \u2018place of performance\u2019 where money was \u2018supposed\u2019 to have been paid\u201d to the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 619, 112 S.Ct. 2160). We explained that the bank \u201cmight well have paid them from funds in United States banks but it might just as well have done so from accounts located outside of the United States.\u201d 26 F.3d at 1146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Peterson\u2019s allegations fail to demonstrate that Saudi Arabia was \u201c \u2018supposed\u2019 to\u201d refund his GOSI contribution to him in the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 1146 (quoting <em>Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 619, 112 S.Ct. 2160). In his complaint, he asserted that he \u201cand other foreign workers, their employers, GOSI, and the Saudi Government all understood that Plaintiff would return to the United States and that GOSI benefits would be remitted here,\u201d Complaint at 7, \u00b6 28, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 7, and that he \u201cbelieved that his contributions to GOSI would be returned to him in the United States.\u201d Complaint at 7, \u00b6 29, <em>repnnted in </em>J.A. at 7. In his brief to us, he further states that he submitted to the district court \u201cnumerous declarations ... from other foreign - workers similarly situated demonstrating that [Saudi Arabia was] accustomed to refunding the GOSI contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tions in the United States\u201d and that \u201cremittances of GOSI annuity benefits ... were to be sent to the last known addresses of covered employees.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 40 &amp; n. 10. These assertions evidence no agreement \u2014 implied or express \u2014 that Peterson was to be paid in the United States. In fact, he was not paid in the United States. Although he claims to have made \u201cspecial arrangements,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 40, Peterson not only received his refund in Saudi Arabia but deposited it in a Saudi bank as well \u2014 the entire transaction occurred outside the United States. Moreover, Peterson\u2019s counsel stated below that Saudi Arabia \u201crepresented\u201d to non-Saudi employees that it would refund GOSI contributions \u201cwherever the workers lived,\u201d J.A. 320, so that, if Peterson chose to reside outside the United States, Saudi Arabia would have returned his contribution to him there, <em>see </em>J.A. 320 (\u201cOf course, if [Peterson] moved to another country, he would have asked to be paid elsewhere and he would have been paid elsewhere.\u201d). Thus, similar to the situation in <em>Goodman Holdings, </em>Saudi Arabia \u201cmight well have paid\u201d Peterson or another employee in the United States \u201cbut it might just as well have done so\u201d outside the United States. 26 F.3d at 1146-47; <em>see also Princz, </em>26 F.3d at 1172 (\u201cA \u2018direct effect\u2019 ... is one which has no intervening element, but, rather, flows in a straight line without deviation or interruption.\u201d (internal quotation marks &amp; citation omitted)). Accordingly, the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception does not provide any court in the United States with the jurisdiction necessary to entertain Peterson\u2019s suit against Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">* <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">. <em>See Saudi Arabia v.
