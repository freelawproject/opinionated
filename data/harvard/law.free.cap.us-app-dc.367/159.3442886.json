(Agency) &amp; Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union (Union), </em>59 FLRA 708 (2004) <em>(Customs Order), reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 271-96. The NTEU now petitions for review of the Authority\u2019s order, alleging that the Authority erred twice: initially, by concluding that Customs exercised statutorily protected management rights when it implemented a revised National Inspectional Assignment Policy (NIAP); and, again, by concluding that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Customs in fact exercised its managements right in implementing the revised NIAP, Customs was not obligated to bargain over the NTEU\u2019s ground rule proposal. Because the Authority erred in neither respect, we deny the NTEU\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS or Statute), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135, \u201cestablishes a collective bargaining regime in the federal public sector.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Civilian Technicians v.

This controversy involves the Statute\u2019s management rights doctrine codified in section 7106. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106. While the Statute generally obligates an agency to negotiate with its employees\u2019 bargaining representative over \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 <em>7103(a)(12&gt; </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201cpersonnel policies, practices, and matters ... affecting working conditions,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7103(a)(14) \u2014 section 7106 \u201creserv[es] to management officials the authority to, <em>inter alia, </em>make budget, organization, and work assignments.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>FLRA v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>994 F.2d 868, 871-72 (D.C.Cir.1993). Nonetheless, these rights of unilateral action, which are permissive subjects of bargaining, <em>see Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>399 F.3d 334, 340 &amp; n. 5 (D.C.Cir.2005), are not unqualified. An agency exercises management rights subject to bargaining over the \u201cimpact and implementation\u201d of the rights. <em>Dep\u2019t of the Navy v. FLRA, </em>962 F.2d 48, 50 (D.C.Cir.1992). \u201cNothing in this section,\u201d the Statute says, \u201cshall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating\u201d over either \u201cprocedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section ... or appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(2)-(3). Thus, \u201calthough an agency is not required to bargain with respect to its management rights <em>per se, </em>it is required to negotiate about the impact and implementation of those rights.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>962 F.2d at 50 (internal quotation marks omitted &amp; emphasis in original). Under the Statute, all bargaining must be carried out in \u201cgood faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7114(a)(4), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The distinction between an agency\u2019s exercise of management rights and its obligation to engage in impact and implementation bargaining is the crux of this controversy, which has its genesis in Customs\u2019 revised policy governing the assignment of Customs inspectors to tours of duty and overtime work known as the National Inspection Assignment Policy (NAIP). Customs and the NTEU, which represents \u201ca nationwide unit\u201d of Customs Service employees, including Customs inspectors, have negotiated a series of national level collective bargaining agreements (NLAs). The most recent NLA (and the one the parties were abiding by when this dispute arose) expired in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In 1993, the Congress passed the Customs Officers Pay Reform Act (COPRA), which overhauled the overtime system applicable to Customs inspectors. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 103-66, \u00a7 13811(a), 107 Stat. 312 (1993). (codified at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 267). To implement COPRA, that same year Customs and the NTEU formed a joint labor-management committee, whose work culminated, two years later, with the NIAP. <em>See </em>J.A. 272. The NIAP was developed independently of the 1999 NLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">At the time the NIAP was formulated, Customs, along with all other federal agencies, was required under Executive Order 12871 to negotiate over the permissive subjects of bargaining set forth in section 7106(b)(1) of the FSLMRS. <em>See </em>58 Fed. Reg. 52,201 (Oct. 1, 1993). Section 7106 identifies the .subjects as \u201cthe numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(1). In 2001, however, President George W. Bush revoked Executive Order 12871 by issuing Executive Order 13203. <em>See </em>66 Fed.Reg. 11,227 (Feb. 17, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Following Executive Order 13203, Customs advised the NTEU that it no longer intended to negotiate over permissive subjects of bargaining as previously required by article 5, section 2, of the NLA. In that section of the NLA, Customs agreed, \u201c[i]n the interest of partnership, ... to bargain with the Union over the numbers, types and grades of employees or positions assigned to any Customs Service organizational subdivision, work project or tour of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>duty, and the technology, methods and means of performing work within the Service.\u201d J.A. 273. Customs further advised the NTEU that it no longer considered itself bound by provisions of agreements\u2014 including the NLA and the NIAP \u2014 relating to permissive subjects of bargaining. Customs transmitted to the NTEU a draft of a revised NIAP that it planned to implement on September 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A correspondence battle ensued during August and September of 2001, only the salient aspects of which we recount now. On August 6, the NTEU invoked its right to bargain over the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP and served notice of its intent to renegotiate the expired NLA. Customs responded on August 16 by repeating its planned implementation of the revised NIAP on September 30, 2001. The following day, the NTEU iterated its intent to \u201copen the entire term agreement,\u201d highlighting various provisions which, it claimed, bore a \u201cdirect connection\u201d to the NIAP and to its section 7106 rights. On August 22, Customs informed the NTEU that it was prepared to \u201cwork out\u201d ground rules to govern renegotiation of the expired NLA but that, as to the proposed revised NIAP, Article 37 of the expired NLA \u201cestablishes standard ground-rules for the negotiation of interim topics such as the revised NIAP.\u201d J.A. 46-47. The NTEU replied the next day, stating that \u201cactual negotiations\u201d could not begin on any topic \u201cuntil the parties have reached agreement on ground rales.\u201d J.A. 47A. On August 27, Customs again declared that the ground rules set forth in Article 37 of the expired NLA governed negotiations over the revised NIAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">On August 29, Customs and the NTEU met to discuss ground rules but to no avail. They exchanged correspondence the following day: Customs stated it did not \u201cagree to merge,\u201d as the NTEU had proposed, negotiations over the revised NIAP with those regarding the expired NLA, while the NTEU said it \u201ccontinues to believe that concerns associated with\u201d the NIAP \u201cshould be addressed as part of the overall negotiations\u201d on the expired NLA. J.A. 53-54. In its letter, the NTEU also proposed that the existing NIAP be \u201crolled-over,\u201d subject to a few specified revisions. J.A. 55. Customs responded that it did not intend to delay the implementation of the revised NIAP until the parties renegotiated the NLA. On September 6, 2001, Customs had the last word in this exchange: It notified the NTEU that any delay in implementing the revised NIAP \u201cis unacceptable\u201d and, consequently, it \u201cdecline[d] to accept the NTEU\u2019s suggestion that [it] forego revision and implementation of the NIAP in order to address it during renegotiation of the national agreement.\u201d J.A. 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Believing the parties had reached an impasse over its proposal to negotiate the NIAP and NLA simultaneously, the Union sought assistance from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service the day it received Custom\u2019s last letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Customs proceeded to implement the revised NIAP on October 1, 2001, insisting in a letter to the NTEU that day that, in light of new requirements imposed after the catastrophic attacks by foreign terrorists against our nation\u2019s citizens on September 11, 2001, immediate implementation was \u201ccritical ... to ensure the necessary functioning of Customs.\u201d J.A. 65. The Union responded with a letter of its own and also filed a grievance with the Authority alleging that, by implementing the revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>NIAP, Customs violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the FSLMRS. Following submission of the Union\u2019s grievance to arbitration, an arbitrator concluded that the parties should bargain over revisions to the NIAP and, consequently, remanded the matter for the parties to negotiate the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP. Both parties filed exceptions to the arbitrator\u2019s award with the Authority-Customs to the award itself, the NTEU to the arbitrator\u2019s choice of remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The Authority granted Customs\u2019s exceptions and set the award aside. <em>See Customs Order, </em>59 FLRA at 708-11. At the outset of its analysis, the Authority observed that, because Customs had \u201cproposed a specific change in unit employees\u2019 conditions of employment pursuant to the exercise of its management rights under \u00a7 7106 of the Statute while the parties were contemplating negotiation of a new term agreement,\u201d the case presented an issue of first impression. <em>Id. </em>at 708. Resolution of the case, it said, turned on Customs\u2019s \u201clegal ability, if any, to refuse to bargain over the [NTEU]\u2019s proposed ground rule requiring [Customs] to combine its proposed impact and implementation bargaining obligation with the negotiation of a term agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two possible answers, the Authority observed, carried two different consequences for Customs. <em>See id. </em>On the one hand, if Customs could refuse to bargain over the NTEU\u2019s proposed ground rule, it explained, \u201cthe Union\u2019s refusal to engage further in impact and implementation bargaining would permit [Customs] to unilaterally implement its proposed change to conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If, on the other hand, Customs was required to bargain over the proposed ground rule, Customs \u201cwould commit an unfair labor practice by its unilateral implementation of the revised NIAP.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Authority chose the first answer, finding that \u201cthe Union\u2019s proposed ground rule constitutes a permissive subject of bargaining and, consequently, that the Agency was under no obligation to bargain on that subject as a precondition to impact and implementation of the revised NIAP.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In articulating the basis of its deci<em>sion </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201cthat an agency cannot be compelled to bargain over combining impact and implementation and term bargaining and it has the right to insist that such bargaining proceed on separate tracks\u201d\u2014 the Authority delineated two principles. <em>Id. </em>First, it noted that \u201c[w]here an agency action constitutes the exercise of a management right\u201d under sections 7106(a) and 7106(b)(1) of the FSLMRS, its \u201cobligation is limited to bargaining over the procedures governing the exercise of the right, under \u00a7 7106(b)(2) of the Statute, or appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of the right, under \u00a7 7106(b)(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, relying on our decision in <em>FLRA v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>994 F.2d 868 (D.C.Cir.1993), the Authority observed that, because an agency exercising a management right need not bargain over matters beyond the scope of impact and implementation bargaining, its \u201cduty to bargain over ground rules must be consistent with the parties\u2019 obligation to bargain in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">After finding that the NTEU\u2019s right to bargain \u201cwas limited to the impact and implementation of the proposed changes in the revised NIAP,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 711; <em>see also id. </em>at 708, because implementation of the revised NIAP involved the exercise of a statutory management right, the Authority then considered whether the NTEU\u2019s \u201cproposed ground rule addresse[d] only procedures or appropriate arrangements relating to the change in conditions of employment proposed\u201d by the revised NIAP. <em>Id. </em>at 710. \u201cClearly, it does not,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the Authority concluded, because \u201c[biased on the record, there is no question but that bargaining over a new term agreement would extend beyond the narrow scope of issues related to the procedures and appropriate arrangements governing implementation of the revised NIAP.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While it acknowledged that the NTEU \u201cidentified provisions of the NLA that related to the NIAP that it wished to discuss in term negotiations,\u201d the Authority found that \u201cit also demanded to bargain over other, unrelated provisions of the NLA as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Authority concluded, because the \u201cUnion proposed, as a condition precedent to bargaining over the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP, that [Customs] agree to bargain that matter as a part of bargaining over a new term agreement,\u201d the Union\u2019s ground rule \u201cexceeded the scope of impact and implementation bargaining and [Customs] had no obligation to bargain over [it].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The Authority additionally explained that, because the proposed ground rule sought in effect a waiver of Customs\u2019s right to bargain only over those procedures and arrangements related to the revised NIAP, it constituted a \u201cpermissive subject of bargaining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710. Consequently, in the Authority\u2019s view, Customs had the \u201cright not only to refuse to bargain to impasse over the matter, but also to implement the revised NIAP without completing bargaining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Authority concluded, Customs did not violate the FSLMRS by implementing the revised NIAP on October 1, 2001. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The Authority further reasoned that a contrary <em>rule </em>\u2014 ie., one <em>\u201crequiring </em>agencies to bargain [over] a ground rule conditioning impact and implementation bargaining on the negotiation of a term agreement,\u201d \u2014 would, to its mind, \u201cfrustrate the compromise reached by Congress in enacting \u00a7 7106.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Such a rule \u201cwould not,\u201d the Authority explained, \u201cgive full effect to the place of management rights in the statutory scheme because it would tie the exercise of a right to objectives that have nothing to do with the purposes for which the right was being exercised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Authority observed, \u201cit would be exceedingly anomalous if a union could achieve through ground rules bargaining an expansion of negotiations that it could not accomplish through bargaining over procedures and appropriate arrangements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Because Customs\u2019 \u201cimplementation of the revised NIAP, in the face of a proposal over which it was not obligated to bargain, was, therefore, not a violation of the Statute,\u201d the Authority concluded that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in deciding otherwise and set his award aside.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The NTEU then timely filed a petition for review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">We begin with the standards by which we review the Authority\u2019s order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>First, there is the familiar Administrative Procedure Act standard, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706): \u201c[W]hen acting \u2018within its authority\u2019 and \u2018consistent with the congressional mandate,\u2019 the Authority\u2019s decision may. only be set aside if it is found to be \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accoi'dance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA, </em>250 F.3d 778, 782 (D.C.Cir.2001) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms v. FLRA </em>464 U.S. 89, 97 &amp; n. 7, 98 &amp; n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 439, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983)); <em>see also AFGE Local, 2313 v. FLRA, </em>144 F.3d 85, 88 (D.C.Cir.1998). In addition there is the classic two-step methodology governing the Authority\u2019s interpretation of the Statute: If the Congress \u201chas directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\u201d the court \u201cgive[s] effect to [its] unambiguously expressed intent,\u201d but if the statute is silent or ambiguous the court defers to the Authority\u2019s interpretation so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see also Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. FLRA, </em>294 F.3d 192, 196 (D.C.Cir.2002). These standards are deferential ones, for, as the Supreme Court has reminded us, the Authority \u2014 not this court \u2014 is the expert on federal labor relations. Because \u201cthe Authority\u2019s function is \u2018to develop specialized expertise in its field of labor relations and to use that expertise to give content to the principles and goals set forth in the Act,\u2019 ... it \u2018is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its \u201cspecial function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities\u201d of federal labor relations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Fed. Employees v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>526 U.S. 86, 99, 119 S.Ct. 1003, 143 L.Ed.2d 171 (1999) (quoting <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>464 U.S. at 97, 104 S.Ct. 439 (in turn quoting <em>NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., </em>373 U.S. 221, 236, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 10 L.Ed.2d 308 (1963))). The application of these deferential standards of review is fatal to NTEU\u2019s two arguments, each of which we take up \u2014 and reject \u2014 in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The NTEU\u2019s opening attack is on the Authority\u2019s conclusion that Customs exercised its statutory management rights in proposing revisions to the NIAP. According to the NTEU, the Authority\u2019s \u201cerroneous premise\u201d falls apart once it is recognized that the proposed revisions altered \u201cpre-existing negotiated procedures and appropriate arrangements,\u201d a topic outside Customs\u2019 statutory management rights and therefore within Customs\u2019 duty to bargain. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 32. That is, in the NTEU\u2019s words: \u201c[W]hen Customs proposed to replace the negotiated procedures and appropriate arrangements of [the NIAP] with new procedures and appropriate arrangements ... it was proposing a change in conditions of employment over which it had a substantive obligation to bargain.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 34..</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The NTEU\u2019s <em>Chevron </em>step-one argu<em>ment </em>\u2014 i.e., that the Authority mischaraeterized the implementation of the NIAP as the exercise of a management right rather than as a bargainable change to appropriate arrangements and procedures \u2014 is a non-starter at best. The NTEU is right that the language and structure of section 7106 manifest a \u201cdeliberate distinction\u201d between an agency\u2019s management rights, on the one hand, and matters subject to bargaining on the other. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 33. The language of the statute does indeed qualify the management rights: The phrase \u201cnothing ... shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency\u201d begins subsection (a), while the provision that \u201c[n]othing ... shall preclude any agency and any labor organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>from negotiating\u201d introduces the matters set forth in subsection (b). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)-(b). Subsection (b), moreover, identifies two subjects of mandatory negotiation: \u201cprocedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7106(b)(2), and \u201cappropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7106(b)(3). The distinction between management rights and negotiable matters is further reinforced by the statute\u2019s structure, which (with the exception of subsection (b)(1)) divides management rights from the negotiable matters by placing them in different subsections, <em>compare id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 7106(b)(2)-(3) \u2014 a division highlighted by the statute\u2019s command that actions under subsection (a) be taken \u201c[sjubject to\u201d subsection (b). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a). But the NTEU\u2019s insistence that Customs\u2019 subsection (a) management rights must be exercised \u201c[sjubject to\u201d subsection (b)(2) procedures and subsection (b)(3) appropriate arrangements does little to advance its argument, the gravamen of which is that the Authority wrongly concluded that Customs\u2019 revision constitutes the exercise of management rights rather than the alteration of procedures and arrangements by which it exercises those rights. In other words, it does not, as the NTEU contends, \u201cfollow necessarily\u201d from either the statutory structure or text that the NIAP falls into section 7106\u2019s negotiable procedures and arrangements category rather than the management rights category.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The gist of NTEU\u2019s argument on this point appears to be based on its view that \u201cit is clear that several significant provisions of the NIAP had no relationship whatsoever to the exercise of any management right,\u201d a view it supports by citing various \u201cprocedures and appropriate arrangements that the parties had previously negotiated to govern the exercise of Customs\u2019s authority to assign work\u201d resulting from the revisions. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 32. The Authority, however, reached a contrary conclusion. The NIAP involves management rights, it said, because its review of the revised NIAP \u201cindicatefdj that the revised NIAP constitutes, among other things, criteria governing employee work assignments, under \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, and staffing patterns, under \u00a7 7106(b)(1).\u201d <em>Customs Order, 59 </em>FLRA at 708 n. 16. While the Authority\u2019s analysis is unquestionably terse, its characterization is borne out by the administrative record. The revised NIAP specifically provides that management decisions pertaining to, <em>inter alia, </em>scheduling, staffing levels and overtime are to be governed by \u201coperational needs\u201d and \u201cbudgetary limitations.\u201d J.A. 30-32. We have, in the past, recognized that the specification of \u201ccriteria pursuant to which substantive decisions are to be made,\u201d such as, in this case, \u201coperational needs\u201d and \u201cbudgetary limitations,\u201d comes within the exercise of management rights. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Treasury v. FLRA, </em>857 F.2d 819, 821 (D.C.Cir.1988). We do so again with respect to the revised NIAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The NTEU also argues that, in concluding the revised NIAP implicates management rights, the Authority departed from an earlier <em>decision </em>\u2014 United <em>States Dep\u2019t of Treasury, Customs Serv. Region IV, Miami Dist., Miami, Fla. (Respondent) &amp; Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union (Charging Party), </em>38 FLRA 838 (1990) <em>(Miami Customs) </em>\u2014 without explanation. <em>Miami Customs, </em>according to the NTEU, \u201cdemonstrates that Customs was obligated to bargain over the substance <em>of </em>its decision to revise [the] NIAP, not merely its impact and implementation.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 34. We do not agree. In <em>Miami C%istoms, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the Authority held that the Miami District Customs Service violated the FSLMRS in implementing a new rotation system after refusing to bargain over a negotiable union proposal addressing the length of an inspector\u2019s time on a given assignment. <em>See Miami Customs, </em>38 FLRA at 844. Unless a proposal involving the right to assign work directly interferes with the exercise of a management right, the Authority explained, it is negotiable. <em>See id. </em>at 842. Accordingly, because \u201cproposals which address only the length of an assignment within such a rotation schedule do not interfere with the management\u2019s right to assign work,\u201d the Miami District Customs Service was obligated to bargain over the union\u2019s proposal. <em>Id. </em>at 843. Nothing in <em>Miami Customs </em>at all undermines the Authority\u2019s conclusion that Customs\u2019 specification in the revised NIAP of substantive criteria governing management decisions pertaining to scheduling, staffing and overtime was the exercise of a management right and therefore not a matter over which Customs had a mandatory duty to bargain under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We find the NTEU\u2019s next argu<em>ment </em>\u2014 i.e., even assuming that Customs exercised its management rights in implementing the revised NIAP, it was nevertheless obligated to bargain over the proposed ground rule regarding the timing of bargaining over both the NIAP and a new NLA \u2014 wanting as well. The Authority\u2019s conclusion in this regard, the NTEU maintains, stems from a misapplication of the analysis we outlined in <em>FLRA v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>994 F.2d 868 (D.C.Cir.1993), to its ground rule proposal and produces \u201can anomalous result that undermines the statutory purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 50. Not so. Because it constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the mutual statutory duty to bargain in good faith, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C \u00a7 7114(a)(4), (b), we uphold the Authority\u2019s conclusion that Customs was not obligated to bargain over a ground rule proposal that is inconsistent with the parties\u2019 specific obligation to bargain in this case \u2014 that is, in the Authority\u2019s words, one that \u201cexceeded the scope of impact and implementation bargaining.\u201d <em>Customs Order, </em>59 FLRA at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">First, we cannot say the Authority misapplied our <em>Dep\u2019t of Justice </em>decision here. There, we addressed a petition for enforcement of an Authority order requiring the San Diego Border Patrol to bargain over the impact and implementation of a relocation of employees to various locations in San Diego County. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>994 F.2d at 870-72. We held that the Border Patrol did not violate the FSLMRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>in refusing to bargain over the union\u2019s proposal to use the vacated space resulting from the relocation. <em>See id. </em>at 873. We explained that \u201cthe term \u2018impact and implementation\u2019 includes only the procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising management rights and appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of such rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 872 (further internal quotation marks &amp; citations omitted). The \u201cdisputed subject matter\u201d did not \u201cfit[ ] within either of those subsets,\u201d we concluded, because it was \u201cclear that the creation of an office for the Union has nothing to do with the procedures used by management for the resource and personnel allocation involved in the decentralization of the unit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Here, the Authority\u2019s conclusion that the \u201climitation on the scope of impact and implementation bargaining\u201d in <em>Dep\u2019t of Justice </em>is \u201cno different when the question ... concerns an agency\u2019s obligation to bargain over the ground rules for negotiating over the impact and implementation of an exercise of a management right,\u201d <em>Customs Order, </em>59 FLRA at 709, derives from our declaration in <em>Dep\u2019t of Justice </em>that a \u201c \u2018proposal must address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right.\u2019 \u201d 994 F.2d at 872 (quoting &amp; citing <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Treasury v. FLRA, </em>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C.Cir.1992)). As the Authority recognized, it \u201cwould be exceedingly anomalous\u201d if the NTEU could use a ground rule proposal to expand the scope of negotiations beyond that of impact and implementation bargaining itself. <em>Customs Order, </em>59 FLRA at 711. Furthermore, we cannot help but note that the Authority\u2019s interpretation is wholly consistent with other precedent. Its observation fifteen years ago that \u201cground rules proposals must, at a minimum, be designed to further, not impede, <em>the bargaining for which the ground rules are proposed,\u2019\u2019 United States Dep\u2019t of the Air Force Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (Respondent) &amp; AFGE, Council 214 (Charging Party), </em>36 FLRA 524, 533 (1990) (emphasis added), is simply another way of stating that \u201cthe duty to bargain over ground rules must be consistent with the parties\u2019 obligation to bargain in a particular case.\u201d <em>Customs Order, </em>59 FLRA at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Moreover, the Authority\u2019s interpretation of the mutual statutory duty to bargain in good faith makes sense even without resort to supporting precedent. Notwithstanding the NTEU\u2019s contrary characterization, the Authority did not conclude that an agency is never obligated to bargain over a ground rule proposal to combine negotiations; rather, it held only that Customs was under no such duty to do so in this instance because the NTEU\u2019s \u201cproposed ground rule exceeded the scope of impact and implementation bargaining.\u201d <em>Customs Order, </em>59 FLRA at 710. The Authority\u2019s holding, as it noted, advances statutory objectives we also recognize. In the past, we have stated that \u201c[b]y ascribing certain management rights to agencies, but tempering those rights through the requirements of impact and implementation bargaining\u201d the Congress balanced \u201cthe agency\u2019s need to manage itself efficiently and the employees\u2019 right to participate in the decisions that affect them.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>962 F.2d at 50 n. 1. We described the balance as a \u201cdelicate\u201d one, <em>id., </em>and we think the Authority reasonably determined that the balance would be upset if the NTEU could use a ground rule proposal to require Customs to negotiate on matters unrelated to the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP. Not only would the inevitably resulting delay in implementing the revised NIAP frustrate the Statute\u2019s \u201clarger goal of promoting \u2018an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>effective and efficient government,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>857 F.2d at 822 (quoting &amp; citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(b)), but requiring Customs to bargain over such a proposal would diminish the role of management rights in the statutory scheme by conditioning their exercise on bargaining over matters having nothing to do with the exercise of the rights themselves. <em>Cf. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>994 F.3d at 872 (To fall within subparagraph(b)(3) \u201cproposal must address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right.\u201d). Because it is clear to us, as it was to the Authority, that bargaining over the terms of a new NLA would necessarily extend further and take longer than bargaining over the impact and implementation of Customs\u2019 revised NIAP, we conclude that the Authority reasonably upheld both the Customs\u2019 refusal to consider NTEU\u2019s proposal to bargain over the two matters simultaneously as well as Customs\u2019 implementation of the revised NIAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the NTEU\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-12\">.
