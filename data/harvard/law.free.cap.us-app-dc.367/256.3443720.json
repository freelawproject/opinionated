The district court rested its decision on the ground that the judgment did not require the remedy Heartland seeks \u2014 a direction that it is entitled to \u201csole community hospital\u201d status under the Medicare statute and to reimbursement in accordance with such status. We agree with the district court and affirm the denial of the hospital\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">The federal Medicare program reimburses hospitals for the cost of medical care for older persons and other eligible individuals. Medicare operates according to a prospective payment system (PPS), under which hospitals are paid a fixed rate based on a patient\u2019s diagnosis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d). A hospital is exempt from PPS \u2014 and therefore eligible for higher payments based on its historic costs \u2014 if it qualifies as a \u201csole community hospital\u201d (SCH). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(i). At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>relevant time, the Medicare statute defined an SCH as any hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">(I) that [the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ] determines is located more than 35 road miles from another hospital, [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">(II) that, by reason of factors such as the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care ..., location, weather conditions, travel conditions, or absence of other like hospitals ..., is the sole source of inpatient hospital services reasonably available to individuals in a geographic area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(iii) (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The Medicare statute directed HHS to \u201cpromulgate a standard for determining whether a hospital meets the criteria for classification as a sole community hospital under\u201d clause (II) of the above definition. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(iv). Under the regulations promulgated pursuant to that direction, and in effect during the relevant period, a hospital qualified as an SCH under clause (II) only if it was \u201clocated in a rural area\u201d and met other listed criteria. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92(a) (1992). Thus, under the regulations, a hospital located fewer than 35 miles from another hospital \u2014 and thus ineligible under clause (I) \u2014 -could not obtain SCH status unless it was located in a rural area. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>HHS justified this \u201crural location requirement\u201d on the ground that \u201curban areas generally have better roads, faster snow-clearing, and the choice of more available hospitals.\u201d Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board, Procedures and Criteria, Final Rule, 56 Fed.Reg. 25,458, 25,483 (June 4, 1991). For purposes of SCH eligibility, a \u201crural area\u201d was defined as \u201cany area outside an urban area,\u201d and an \u201curban area\u201d was defined as a \u201cMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) ... as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.62(f)(ii), (iii) (1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">Heartland Hospital, located in the city of St. Joseph, Missouri, is an acute-care facility situated fewer than 35 miles from other hospitals. In May 1992, Heartland submitted an application for SCH status to its Medicare fiscal intermediary, Mutual of Omaha, in accordance with HHS regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The intermediary recommended that the Health Care Financing Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>(HCFA),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an HHS component, deny the application based on Heartland\u2019s location. HCFA did so on the ground that, because Heartland was \u201clocated in an urban area and the closest like hospital [was] fewer than 35 miles away,\u201d it was ineligible under the rural location requirement. Letter from Edward M. Brennan, HHS, to Richard G. Bath, Mutual of Omaha (Jan. 22,1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Heartland appealed HCFA\u2019s decision to HHS\u2019s Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB), seeking expedited judicial review of the denial of SCH status pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (f)(1)- Under that provision, a hospital is entitled to expedited judicial review of any determination that \u201cinvolves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy\u201d that the Board \u201cis without authority to decide.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (f)(1). Because Heartland\u2019s appeal challenged the validity of the regulatory requirement that a hospital situated within 35 miles of another hospital be located in a rural area, and thereby raised \u201ca question of law or regulations\u201d that the PRRB lacked authority to decide, the PRRB granted Heartland\u2019s request. Letter from Ii-vin Kues, HHS, to Christopher L. Cross-white, Vinson &amp; Elkins (Mar. 29, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Heartland then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the validity of the rural location requirement on a number of grounds. The case was assigned to the late Judge Harold Greene, who held that the requirement was consistent with the Medicare statute and that HHS had established a rational basis for adopting it. <em>Heartland Hospital v. Shalala (Heartland I), </em>No. 95-951, slip op. at 15, 19 (D.D.C. June 15, 1998). But the court also found that HHS had failed to consider reasonable alternatives proposed by commenters when it chose an MSA-based definition of \u201curban area.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe failure of the Secretary to respond to reasonable alternative[s]\u201d to MSAs \u201cas the relevant measure of an urban area,\u201d the court held, \u201crenders the adoption of the regulations arbitrary and capricious and, consequently, invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. The order accompanying the district court\u2019s 1998 opinion granted-Heartland\u2019s motion for summary judgment and remanded the case to HHS \u201cfor action consistent with the foregoing opinion.\u201d <em>Heartland I, </em>order at 1 (June 15, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Following the district court\u2019s decision, things did not go as Heartland had hoped. In 1999, HHS conducted a rule-making regarding a number of Medicare reimbursement issues. In the course of that rulemaking, the agency considered\u2014 and rejected \u2014 the alternative definitions of \u201curban area\u201d noted in <em>Heartland I. </em>The agency explained why it believed that the MSA-based definition was the better one, and announced that it would continue to use that definition. <em>See </em>Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2000 Rates, Final Rule, 64 Fed.Reg. 41,490, 41,513-15 (July 30, 1999); Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Systems and Fiscal Year 2000 Rates, Proposed Rule, 64 Fed.Reg. 24,716, 24,732 (May 7, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In 2000, HCFA took up the remand from <em>Heartland I. </em>Once again, the agency concluded that Heartland did not qualify for SCH status, giving three reasons. First, HCFA determined that <em>Heartland I </em>did not vacate the SCH regulation, but merely remanded the case to HHS to further explain its definition of \u201curban area.\u201d Decision of the Administrator, <em>Heartland Hosp. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>PRRB Case No. 93-0648E, at 21 (Sept. 6, 2000). Finding that, in the 1999 rulemaking, HHS had \u201carticulated a reasonable basis for the use of an MSA-based definition of rural, as opposed to other alternatives,\u201d HCFA concluded that \u201cthe MSA-based rural criteri[on] is properly applied in adjudicating this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. And because Heartland was \u201clocated in an urban area and [was] within 35 miles of other like hospitals,\u201d HCFA determined that it did \u201cnot meet the applicable criteria for designation as a sole community hospital.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Second, HCFA found that, even if the court\u2019s order did vacate the regulation, the district court \u201cdid not order the payment of money to [Heartland] based on designation as a sole community hospital,\u201d and \u201cdid not comment on whether [Heartland] should be designated as a sole community hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At most, HCFA said, \u201cthe Court\u2019s action affected that part of the regulation which defines \u2018rural\u2019 within the context of MSAs,\u201d but \u201cdid not invalidate the rural requirement itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at.28. Concluding that \u201cthe establishment of a definition of rural, through adjudication, would not constitute retroactive rulemaking,\u201d <em>id., </em>HCFA determined that \u201cthe adoption of a MSA-based rural definition is appropriate and reasonable for the reasons\u201d articulated in the 1999 rulemaking. <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Finally, HCFA reasoned that, even if the rural requirement were deleted from the regulation altogether, Heartland still would not qualify for SCH status because it had failed to demonstrate that it met the other regulatory criteria that HHS had established for qualification under clause (II). <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Heartland then returned to the district court with a two-pronged attack on HCFA\u2019s decision. First, it filed a motion to enforce the <em>Heartland I </em>judgment, seeking a declaration of SCH status as well as reimbursement and interest. Second, Heartland filed a separate action challenging HCFA\u2019s decision on remand under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. In light of the death of Judge Greene, both matters were reassigned to another district judge. Heartland and HHS agreed to stay the APA action pending the disposition of Heartland\u2019s motion to enforce the judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">In August 2004, the district court denied that motion. <em>Heartland Hosp. v. Thompson (Heartland II), </em>328 F.Supp.2d 8 (D.D.C.2004). The court determined that \u201cJudge Greene did not intend to grant [Heartland] SCH status, reimbursement and interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. \u201c[A]ll that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>required by the prior judgment,\u201d the court said, was that HHS \u201creconsider[ ] the alternatives to\u201d the MSA-based definition of \u201curban area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding that HHS had reconsidered those alternatives and \u201cconcluded that they are inferior,\u201d the court held that Heartland had received all the relief the judgment required. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Heartland filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The parties spend the bulk of their briefs disputing whether Judge Greene\u2019s 1998 opinion in <em>Heartland I </em>vacated the rural area requirement. Notwithstanding that the word \u201cvacate\u201d does not appear in that opinion, Heartland contends that the decision vacated the requirement by pronouncing the regulations \u201cinvalid,\u201d and that vacatur entitled the hospital to SCH status and reimbursement. HHS maintains that the decision did not vacate the rural area requirement, but merely remanded for consideration of alternative definitions of \u201curban area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">We do not need to resolve this interpretive dispute in order to decide this case. Success on a motion to enforce a judgment gets a plaintiff only \u201cthe relief to which [the plaintiff] is entitled under [its] original action and the judgment entered therein.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Washington, </em>511 F.2d 404, 406 (D.C.Cir.1975). Regardless of whether the district court vacated the rule, it is clear that the <em>Heartland I </em>judgment does not entitle the hospital to the remedy it seeks: a declaration of SCH status and reimbursement. Our reasoning is set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Even if <em>Heartland I </em>vacated the rural area requirement, nothing on the face of that decision compelled HHS to grant Heartland SCH status and reimbursement. The court\u2019s order merely remanded the case to HHS \u201cfor action consistent with the foregoing opinion.\u201d <em>Heartland I, </em>order at 1. The \u201cforegoing opinion,\u201d in turn, found the rural area requirement in the HHS regulations invalid solely on the ground that HHS had \u201cfailed to consider or respond to reasonable alternatives to the use of [MSAs] as the relevant measure of an urban area,\u201d and hence as the definition of a rural area. <em>Heartland I, </em>slip op. at 24. Accordingly, even if <em>Heartland I </em>vacated the rural area requirement, the only obligation it expressly imposed on the agency was to consider the two alternatives suggested during the comment period.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">That is precisely what the agency did. After the court issued its decision in <em>Heartland I, </em>HHS considered the alternatives and then reissued its MSA-based definition of \u201curban area\u201d and \u201crural area.\u201d <em>See </em>64 Fed.Reg. 24,716, 24,732 (May 7, 1999) (setting forth the proposed definition and soliciting comments); 64 Fed.Reg. 41,-490, 41,513-15 (July 30, 1999) (adopting the definition and rejecting alternatives). Thereafter, in its decision on remand from <em>Heartland I, </em>HCFA incorporated HHS\u2019s rationale for rejecting the alternatives and adopting the MSA-based definition. In short, the agency complied with the judgment in <em>Heartland I </em>by filling the analytical gap identified in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">Nor did <em>Heartland I </em>imply that anything more was required. It certainly did not suggest that, after considering the alternatives, the agency was barred from reinstating the same definition or from reaching the same result through case-by-case adjudication. To the contrary, the usual rule is that, with or without vacatur, an agency that cures a problem identified by a court is free to reinstate the original</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>result on remand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nothing in <em>Heartland I </em>suggested that this usual rule would not apply because, for example, the rural location requirement was irredeemable. Rather, Judge Greene held that the requirement was \u201cwell within the realm of permissible interpretations of\u2019 the Medicare statute, <em>Heartland I, </em>slip op. at 15, that \u201cthe Secretary [had] established ... a rational basis for the ... requirement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 19, and that it was \u201cplausible ... that [MSAs] are a valid measure of urban areas,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">This is not to say, of course, that the agency\u2019s reaffirmation of the same result in this case is invulnerable to attack on a ground other than the agency\u2019s failure to consider reasonable alternatives \u2014 for example, on the ground that the agency <em>arbitrarily </em>rejected those alternatives. <em>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 48, 56, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). But whether or not the agency\u2019s post-<em>Heartland I </em>rejection of the alternatives was arbitrary is a determination that must be made in Heartland\u2019s separate APA action challenging HHS\u2019s post-remand decisions. Nothing in <em>Heartland I </em>itself addresses that question, and therefore a motion to enforce the <em>Heartland I </em>judgment is not the proper means to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The same is true for Heartland\u2019s oblique suggestion that if Judge Greene vacated the rural area requirement, then HHS\u2019s attempt to reimpose the requirement on remand \u2014 whether through rulemaking or adjudication \u2014 effectively constituted impermissible retroactive rulemaking. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 2 n.l; <em>see also Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., </em>488 U.S. 204, 215, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (holding that HHS \u201chas no authority to promulgate retroactive cost-limit rules\u201d under the Medicare Act). Our cases establish a five-factor \u201cframework for evaluating retroactive application of rules announced in agency adjudications.\u201d <em>Cassell v. FCC, </em>154 F.3d 478, 486 (D.C.Cir. 1998) (quoting <em>Clark-Cowlitz Joint Operating Agency v. FERC, </em>826 F.2d 1074, 1081 (D.C.Cir.1987) (en banc)). Nothing in <em>Heartland I </em>indicates whether HCFA\u2019s adjudicatory application of the rural requirement would survive examination under that framework. Accordingly, that, too, is a determination that must await disposition of Heartland\u2019s separate APA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Heartland contends that, even if the face of <em>Heartland I </em>did not require HHS to grant the hospital SCH status, vacation of the rural area requirement would have \u201celiminatfed] the only remaining barrier to SCH status for Heartland.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. That is so, the hospital maintains, because \u201c[u]nder the applicable statute and regulations, the [PRRB] can grant expedited judicial review only if it first determines that there are no disputed issues of fact and no disputed legal issues that the Board is authorized to resolve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. Thus, Heartland insists, by granting its request for expedited review, the PRRB \u201cnecessarily determined that Heartland had met all the statutory and regulatory criteria to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>obtain SCH status and that the only remaining question was the validity of [HHS\u2019s] rural requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">There are two problems with this argument. First, even if Heartland is correct that at the time of <em>Heartland I </em>the rural area requirement was the only hurdle still standing between it and SCH status, the judgment did not say so. Even if the agency had implicitly decided prior to <em>Heartland I </em>that the hospital met all the other SCH criteria, at best that would mean the post-remand denial was inconsistent with those implicit findings. And while such inconsistency might justify a court in concluding that HCFA\u2019s post-<em>Heartland I </em>denial of the hospital\u2019s SCH status was arbitrary and capricious (and thus in violation of the APA), that is a conclusion Judge Greene did not reach in <em>Heartland I </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The second \u2014 and more significant \u2014 \u2022 problem with Heartland\u2019s argument is that it reads too much into the PRRB\u2019s expedited judicial review determination. In denying Heartland SCH status, both HCFA and the intermediary relied solely on the hospital\u2019s failure to satisfy the' regulation\u2019s rural location requirement. Neither considered whether there might be other reasons for denial; neither said that, but for the regulation, the hospital\u2019s application would have been granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, when Heartland asked the PRRB to grant expedited review, it emphasized that \u201cthe sole basis for its appeal of HCFA\u2019s denial is that the regulatory requirement of location in a rural area is invalid.\u201d Provider\u2019s Request for Expedited Judicial Review, <em>Heartland Hosp. v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., </em>PRRB Case No. 93-0648, at 10-11 (Mar. 6, 1995). And when the PRRB granted Heartland\u2019s request, it did so on the ground that it was \u201cwithout authority to decide the legal question of whether the Medicare regulation governing the classification as a sole community hospital ... is valid.\u201d Letter from Kues to Crosswhite at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Nor is Heartland correct that the statute and regulation <em>required </em>the PRRB to decide every factual and legal question within its power \u2014 including those on which the intermediary did not rely in recommending denial of Heartland\u2019s SCH status \u2014 before it could grant expedited review regarding the validity of the legal ground on which the intermediary did rely. The statute itself states only that health care providers \u201chave the right to obtain judicial review of any action of the fiscal intermediary which involves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy whenever the Board determines ... that it is without authority to decide the question.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (f)(1). Here, the intermediary\u2019s denial of Heartland\u2019s application on the basis of the rural location requirement plainly involved \u201ca question of law or regulations,\u201d that was \u201crelevant to the matters in controversy,\u201d and that the PRRB was \u201cwithout authority to decide.\u201d <em>See Bethesda Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Bowen, </em>485 U.S. 399, 406, 108 S.Ct. 1255, 99 L.Ed.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cNeither the fiscal intermediary nor the Board has the authority to declare regulations invalid.\u201d). Thus, Heartland\u2019s appeal fell squarely within the expedited review provision of the statute whether or not Heartland met the other SCH criteria.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The HHS regulation that governs expedited review similarly permits expedition if there are no \u201cfactual or legal issues in dispute on <em>an issue </em>within the authority of the Board to decide.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1842(g)(2) (emphasis added). The regulation does not suggest that the PRRB is barred from granting expedited review unless it first decides all factual questions within its competence, including those regarding other issues not relied upon by HCFA or the intermediary. Indeed, the regulatory language is to the contrary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As Heartland stresses, HHS did state at the time the regulation was promulgated that the statute\u2019s expedited judicial review provision \u201cauthorizes the bypassing of the required Board hearing only with respect to those matters in dispute for which <em>the sole issue to be resolved </em>is the validity of the law, regulations, or HCFA rulings which the Board cannot decide.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7 (quoting Provider Reimbursement Review Board, Expedited Administrative Review, Final Rule, 48 Fed.Reg. 22,920, 22,922 (May 23, 1983)) (emphasis added in Appellant\u2019s Br.). But in this instance, the sole issue to be resolved \u2014 because it was the sole basis for Heartland\u2019s appeal \u2014 was the validity of the rural location requirement, an issue that involved no factual or legal issues within the Board\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In sum, both the statute and the regulation permitted the Board to grant expedited review, regarding the validity of the rural location requirement without first deciding all other possible bases for denying Heartland SCH status \u2014 none of which were addressed by the intermediary, by HCFA, or by Heartland. Hence, in granting expedited review, the Board did not determine \u2014 \u201cnecessarily\u201d or otherwise\u2014 that Heartland had met all the statutory and regulatory criteria for such status.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that, regardless of whether the district court intended to vacate the rural area requirement in <em>Heartland I, </em>the court\u2019s judgment did not entitle Heartland Hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tal to the relief it seeks on this appeal. What the judgment did require was what Heartland received \u2014 HHS\u2019s reconsideration of the alternatives to the MSA-based definition of \u201curban area.\u201d Accordingly, if Heartland is to obtain further relief, it must seek it through a separate APA challenge to HCFA\u2019s <em>post-Heartland I </em>decisions, rather than through a motion to enforce the <em>Heartland I </em>judgment itself. The district court\u2019s denial of Heartland\u2019s motion is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">.
