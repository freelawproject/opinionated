The district court granted summary judgment partially in their favor, but declined to include in their award fees paid to expert witnesses beyond the amounts permitted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Goldring v.

They now appeal, alleging that the district court erred because, as they see it, an award of expert witness fees to a party prevailing under the IDEA is not so limited. The question before us thus is whether \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs,\u201d words that are used in section 1415, encompass \u201cexpert fees,\u201d words that are not. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). We say no \u2014 and therefore affirm the district court \u2014 because under United States Supreme Court precedent section 1415 of the IDEA precludes the awarding of expert witness fees as part of a prevailing party\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">To \u201censure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education ... designed to meet their unique needs,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A), the IDEA conditions eligibility for federal education assistance on a state\u2019s implementation of \u201cpolicies and procedures to ensure\u201d that resident children \u201cwho are in need of special education and related services\u201d are \u201cidentified, located, and evaluated\u201d and receive \u201c[a]n individualized education program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(3)-(4).

Following due process hearings, they requested the District to reimburse their fees and costs pursuant to the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting statute.

The parents and children sued to recover the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The district court granted partial summary judgment in their favor. <em>See Goldring, </em>No. 02-CV-1761, slip op. at 10. Relevant to this appeal, it concluded that they could not recover the entirety of their expert fees, \u201cbut instead must be limited to no more than what 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920 permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. According to the district court, because Supreme Court precedent holds that \u201c \u2018when a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses, a federal court is bound by the limit of [section] 1821(b), absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary,\u2019 \u201d the critical question was \u201cwhether the IDEA provides such \u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019 permitting recovery of expert witness fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 (quoting <em>Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 439, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987)). The IDEA did not, it concluded; therefore, it awarded the appellants only $120.00 in expert witness fees \u2014 not the $6,836.50 they sought. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The appellants sought reconsideration but were no more successful. <em>See Goldring v.

The district court rejected both of their arguments \u2014 that is, that our decision in <em>Moore v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>907 F.2d 165 (D.C.Cir.1990), held that a prevailing party is entitled to an award of expert fees under the IDEA and that the IDEA\u2019S legislative history demonstrates that the Congress intended a party prevailing under the IDEA to recover expert fees. <em>See Goldring, </em>No. 02-CV-1761, slip op. at 3-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The parents and children timely appealed on July 28, 2004. We have jurisdiction to entertain their appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and on <em>ele novo </em>review, <em>see, e.g., Diamond v. Atwood, </em>43 F.3d 1538, 1540 (D.C.Cir.1995), we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The question whether the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision \u2014 section 1415 \u2014 enables a prevailing party to recover expert fees as part of his costs is one of first impression in our Circuit and one not free of controversy in others. To date four of our sister circuits have treated this issue and divided evenly into opposing camps, two holding an IDEA prevailing party cannot recover expert fees, <em>see T.D. v. La-Grange Sch. Dist. No. 102, </em>349 F.3d 469, 481-82 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Neosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark, </em>315 F.3d 1022, 1031-33 (8th Cir.2003), two holding he can, <em>see Murphy v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>402 F.3d 332, 337-39 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Arons v. N.J. Bd. of Educ., </em>842 F.2d 58, 62 (3d Cir.1988). The district courts have likewise failed to reach a consensus on the question, <em>compare, e.g., BD v. DeBuono, </em>177 F.Supp.2d 201, 207-08 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (allowing recovery of expert fees); <em>Mr. J. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>98 F.Supp.2d 226, 242-43 (D.Conn.2000) (same); <em>Field v. Haddonfield Bd. of Educ., </em>769 F.Supp. 1313, 1323 (D.N.J.1991) (same), <em>with Eirschele v. Craven County Bd. of Educ., </em>7 F.Supp.2d 655, 659-60 (E.D.N.C.1998) (refusing recovery of expert fees); <em>Cynthia K. v. Bd. of Educ. of Lincoln-Way High Sch. Dist., </em>1996 WL 164381, at *2 (N.D.Ill., April 1, 1996) (same), including those within our Circuit, <em>compare, e.g., Czarniewy v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>No. 02-CV-1496, slip op. at 4-5, 2005 WL 692081 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2005) (allowing recovery of expert fees); <em>Bailey v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>839 F.Supp. 888, 892 (D.D.C.1993) (same); <em>Aranow v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>791 F.Supp. 318, 318 (D.D.C. 1992) (same), <em>with George v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>No. 02-CV-1656, mem. at 2 (D.D.C. Mar. 8, 2004) (refusing recovery of expert fees); <em>Goldring, </em>No. 02-CV-1761, slip op. at 9 (same). The correct decision does not seem to us to be difficult to reach, for the Supreme Court has stated in fairly unequivocal terms that language nearly identical to that used in section 1415 is unambiguous and, more to the point, does not allow a prevailing party to shift his expert fees. Accordingly, today we join the Seventh and Eighth Circuits in holding that a prevailing party under the IDEA cannot recover expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs ... to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). That the crucial statutory language \u2014 \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u2014 fails to allow a prevailing party to shift his expert fees flows directly from the application of two Supreme Court decisions. One tells us that \u201cwhen a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses a federal court is bound by the limit of \u00a7 1821(b) absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary.\u201d <em>Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 439, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987). The other tells us that the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision contains no such \u201cexplicit statutory authority to the contrary.\u201d <em>See W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, </em>499 U.S. 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">In <em>Casey, </em>the Court addressed whether an earlier version of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which provided that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs,\u201d satisfied the <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 111 S.Ct. 1138. The Court concluded that it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Looking to the \u201crecord of statutory usage,\u201d it explained that, \u201c[w]hile some fee-shifting provisions, like \u00a7 1988, refer only to \u2018attorney\u2019s fees,\u2019 ... many others explicitly shift expert witness fees <em>as well as </em>attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (emphasis in original). By the Court\u2019s count, \u201c[a]t least 34 statutes in.10 different titles of the United States Code explicitly shift attorney\u2019s fees <em>and </em>expert witness costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (emphasis in original); <em>see id. </em>at n. 4. In view of a record of usage that demonstrated \u201cbeyond question\u201d that attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees are \u201cdistinct items of expense,\u201d the Court concluded that, if it were to hold that \u201cthe one includes the other, dozens of statutes referring to the two separately become an inexplicable exercise in redundancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Not surprisingly, the Court declined to so hold. Accordingly, because section 1415 and the version of section 1988 construed in <em>Casey </em>contain materially identical language and <em>Casey </em>held that section 1988\u2019s language does not enable a prevailing party to shift his expert fees, we cannot but conclude that section 1415 does likewise. That is the end of the matter for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">But it is not the end for the appellants. Finding the statute\u2019s text unhelpful, they seek refuge in its history. Legislative history is a traditional tool of statutory construction to divine congressional intent, they argue, and, when considered here, it reveals an intent to allow a prevailing party to shift expert fees under section 1415. The appellants point to a single sentence in the House Conference Report on the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act (Conference Report), which amended the IDEA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">The conferees intend that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding, as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">H.R. CONF. REP. No. 99-687, at 5 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1789, 1808. While two of our sister circuits have looked to this language in construing section 1415, <em>see Murphy, </em>402 F.3d at 336-37; <em>Arons, </em>842 F.2d at 62, we believe recourse to it is simply unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">While \u201c[r]eference to statutory design and pertinent legislative history may often shed new light on congressional intent, notwithstanding statutory language that appears superficially clear,\u201d <em>Natural Res. Def. Council v. Browner, </em>57 F.3d 1122, 1127 (D.C.Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord, e.g., Sierra Club v. EPA, </em>353 F.3d 976, 988 (D.C.Cir. 2004); <em>Consumer Elec. Ass\u2019n v. FCC, </em>347 F.3d 291, 298 (D.C.Cir.2003), we do not confront \u201csuperficially clear\u201d language here. In <em>Casey, </em>the Supreme Court said that the expression \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d <em>is </em>clear, not just superficially so. <em>See </em>499 U.S. at 98-99, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (rejecting argument that section 1988\u2019s purpose must overcome ordinary meaning of statutory terms because \u201c[w]here [statutory text] contains a phrase that is unambiguous \u2014 that has a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practice \u2014 we do not permit it to be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process\u201d). This is good enough for us for \u201cwhen the statute\u2019s language is plain, the sole function of the courts \u2014 at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd \u2014 is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Lamie v. United States Trustee, </em>540 U.S. 526, 534, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Ratzlaf v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 147-48, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994) (courts should \u201cnot resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear\u201d); <em>Davis v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>489 U.S. 803, 808-09 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (\u201cLegislative history is irrelevant to the interpretation of an unambiguous statute.\u201d). In our view this case represents a paradigmatic one for application of the principle that statutory text enacted by the Congress trumps the views expressed by one of its committees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Neosho R-V Sch. Dist., </em>315 F.3d at 1032 (\u201cAbsent some ambiguity in the statute, we have no occasion to look to legislative history.\u201d); <em>accord T.D., </em>349 F.3d at 482. As we said last term, \u201cthere would be no need for a rule\u2014 or repeated admonition from the Supreme Court \u2014 that there should be no resort to legislative history when language is plain and does not lead to an absurd result, if the rule did not apply precisely when plain language and legislative history may seem to point in. opposite directions.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., </em>380 F.3d 488, 494-95 (D.C.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Continuing down this path, the appellants maintain that the Conference Report gains additional relevance in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent reliance on it in <em>Casey. </em>The appellants are not alone in this view: In reaching a holding contrary to our own, the Second Circuit found the <em>Casey </em>Court\u2019s characterization of this snippet of legislative history as \u201can apparent effort to depart from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art,\u201d 499 U.S. at 91 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 1138, to support its construction of section 1415. <em>See Murphy, </em>402 F.3d at 336-38. \u201c[A]pparent\u201d or no, we conclude, as have two other circuits, <em>see T.D., </em>349 F.3d at 482; <em>Neosho R-V Sch. Dist., </em>315 F.3d at 1032, that the Conference Report\u2019s \u201ceffort\u201d is a failure. A sentence in a conference report cannot rewrite unambiguous statutory text, particularly text with a Supreme Court-tested and -approved meaning. The <em>Casey </em>holding declares that \u201c[w]here [the statute] contains a phrase that is unambiguous\u2014 that has a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practice \u2014 we do not permit it to be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process.\u201d 499 U.S. at 99-100, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (citing <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Nor are we convinced to reach a different result by the appellants\u2019 other arguments derived from the <em>Casey </em>Court\u2019s footnote reference to the Conference Report. First, we are unpersuaded by the fact that the Justice who included the footnote is a reputed textualist. <em>See Murphy, </em>402 F.3d at 337 (\u201cTo those who would question our resort to legislative history, we observe that it was Justice Scalia, a noted skeptic of the use of legislative history, who authored Casey\u2019s dicta about the apparent effort by Congress to depart from the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018costs\u2019 in the IDEA.\u201d). If the Court had found this one sentence of legislative history compelling, it would have included section 1415 in its catalogue of statutes autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>rizing a prevailing party to shift attorney\u2019s fees as well as. expert fees. In other words, the Court would have counted \u201c[a]t least\u201d 35 such statutes, not 34. <em>Casey, </em>499 U.S. at 89, 111 S.Ct. 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Second, we cannot agree with the Second Circuit that \u201cit [is] reasonable to infer that Congress, on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Casey, </em>saw no need to amend the IDEA because the Court had recognized that, in enacting the IDEA, Congress sufficiently indicated in the Conference Committee Report that prevailing parties could recover expert fees under the Act.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>402 F.3d at 337. While the Supreme Court has instructed us that \u201c[t]he fact that inaction may not always provide crystalline revelation ... should not obscure the fact that it may be probative to varying degrees,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Transp. Agency of Santa Clara Cty., </em>480 U.S. 616, 629 n. 7, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987); <em>accord United States v. Delgado-Garcia, </em>374 F.3d 1337, 1359 (D.C.Cir.2004), we doubt that the Congress\u2019s inaction with respect to section 1415 following <em>Casey </em>is probative at all. More to the point, given that the <em>Casey </em>Court merely labeled the Conference Report an \u201capparent effort\u201d by the congressional committee and did not number section 1415 among the statutes authorizing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees <em>and </em>expert fees, we are unwilling to infer from the Congress\u2019s failure after <em>Casey </em>to amend section 1415 that the Congress believed that the Supreme Court had considered the text to have been altered by the Conference Report. Indeed, given that the version of section 1988 construed in <em>Casey </em>is nearly identical to section 1415, the more reasonable inference to draw from the fact that, following <em>Casey, </em>the Congress amended section 1988 but not section 1415 is that the Congress had no intention of allowing recovery of expert fees under the IDEA. Before the Court handed down <em>Casey, </em>the Congress had a proven track record demonstrating its ability to shift expert fees when it desired and, following the Court\u2019s decision, the Congress was \u2014 and is \u2014 unquestionably on notice of the precise language required to do so. The former inferential path, in any event, leads to where reason goes to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Moving from Supreme Court precedent to our own, the appellants cite our decision in <em>Moore v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>907 F.2d 165 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 998, 111 S.Ct. 556, 112 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990), as well as the procedural history leading up to it, for the proposition that we have long allowed an IDEA prevailing party to recover expert fees. In <em>Moore, </em>however, we addressed only the issue \u201cwhether the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act ... authorizes a court to award attorney fees to a party who has prevailed in an administrative proceeding under the Education of the Handicapped Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal citations omitted), and ' \u201ceonclude[d] that both the text and the legislative history of HCPA evidence congressional intent to authorize recovery of fees by a parent who prevails in EHA administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176. Our holding in <em>Moore </em>did not consider whether a prevailing party may shift his expert fees, as appellants themselves readily concede. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 29 (\u201cTh[e] [expert fees] issue simply was never addressed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The appellants\u2019 last argument is that, given the critical role of professional opinion in assessing the educational needs of a child with disabilities, the upshot of denying an IDEA prevailing party expert fees will be that parents seeking to contest a school district\u2019s educational placement may face a severe informational \u2022, disadvantage vis-\u00e1-vis the school district. While we are not unsympathetic to the challenges that these and other parents often confront in securing an appropriate free education for their children with disabilities, this line of argument \u2014 based on considerations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>public policy rather than statutory interpretation \u2014 is. in our view, addressed to the wrong branch of government under our constitutional design. Our job is to interpret the law as it is, not as it should be. <em>See Neosho R-V Sch. Dist., </em>315 F.3d at 1033 (\u201c \u2018[T]he problems of public policy are for the legislature and [the court\u2019s] job is one of interpreting statutes, not redrafting them.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Welsh v. Boy Scouts of Am., </em>993 F.2d 1267, 1270-71 (7th Cir. 1993))). Accordingly, a prevailing party under the IDEA may shift expert fees only to the extent allowed under sections 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Finally, a word or two about our colleague\u2019s dissent. Of course, the Congress may adopt a term of art in a fee-shifting statute. <em>See Casey, </em>499 U.S. at 91 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Of course, a conference report offers \u201c \u2018persuasive evidence of congressional intent\u2019 <em>after statutory text itself.\u201d Moore, </em>907 F.2d at 175 (quoting <em>&amp; </em>citing <em>Demby v. Schweiker, </em>671 F.2d 507, 510 (D.C.Cir.1981)) (emphasis added). But the words of the statute do indeed enjoy pride of place: Our \u201cinquiry into the Congress\u2019s intent proceeds, as it must, from \u2018the fundamental canon that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Labor &amp; Congress of Indus. Orgs. v. Fed. Elec. Comm\u2019n, </em>333 F.3d 168, 180 (D.C.Cir.2003) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>&amp; </em>citing <em>Butler v. West, </em>164 F.3d 634, 639 (D.C.Cir.1999)). Thus job one is to read the statute, read the statute, read the statute. <em>See Am. Fed\u2019n of Labor &amp; Congress of Indus. Orgs., </em>333 F.3d at 180 (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment) (citing HENRY J. FRIENDLY, BENCHMARKS 202 (1967) (\u201c(1) Read the statute; (2) read the statute; (3) read the statute!\u201d (quoting Justice Frankfurter\u2019s \u201cthreefold imperative to law students\u201d))). Moreover, we do not read section 1415 in a precedential vacuum. Despite the dissent\u2019s characterization of <em>Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 439, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1\u00a787), as allowing a court to \u201cimpl[y]\u201d or \u201cinfer\u201d \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d to shift expert fees, Dissent at 7, 9, the Supreme Court held otherwise in <em>Casey </em>in deciding \u201cwhether the term \u2018attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 in \u00a7 1988 provides the \u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019 required by <em>Crawford Fitting </em>\u201d to shift expert fees. <em>Casey, </em>499 U.S. at 87, 111 S.Ct. 1138. It held that the term \u201cunambiguously]\u201d does not; the term \u201chas a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practice,\u201d a meaning not \u201cexpanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislatures or <em>committees.\u201d Id. </em>at 98, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the dissent\u2019s observation that \u201cnothing in <em>Casey </em>precludes reference to legislative history clearly indicating that Congress intends to depart from the ordinary meaning of a statutory phrase and to define that phrase as a term of art\u201d proves nothing with respect to section 1415. Dissent at 6. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Given that the Congress used a \u201crestrictive\u201d term in section 1415 and section 1988, <em>Casey, </em>499 U.S. at 99, 111 S.Ct. 1138, our applying the same \u201crestrictive\u201d meaning to it now can hardly be labeled an \u201coverreading\u201d of <em>Casey. </em>Dissent at 7. And given that the Supreme Court found the term <em>unambiguous, </em>our rejection of a legislative committee\u2019s differing gloss cannot, consistent with Supreme Court precedent and our own, fairly be described as allowing \u201cthe Court to trump Congress in defining statutory terms.\u201d Dissent at 5. To do otherwise would substitute the Congressional Record for the United States Code, as the Supreme Court cautioned us against in <em>Casey. See </em>499 U.S. at 98, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Thus, while the dissent \u201cinfer[s]\u201d \u201ca comprehensive statement of congressional intent\u201d by reading a brief passage of legislative history, Dissent at 4, 9, we find no \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d to shift expert fees in section 1415 by reading the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-13\">.

Casey, </em>499 U.S. 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991), the Supreme Court construed the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 not to include fees for experts\u2019 services. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92 &amp; n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Listing 34 statutes that explicitly shift both attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees, <em>see id. </em>at 89 &amp; n. 4, 111 S.Ct. 1138, the Court explained that \u201cthis statutory usage shows beyond question that attorney\u2019s fees and expert fees are distinct items of expense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 92, 111 S.Ct. 1138. The Court further explained that while lower courts may have relied previously on their equitable powers to shift fees for experts\u2019 services, they did not shift them as an element of attorney\u2019s fees, <em>see id. </em>at 92, 111 S.Ct. 1138, and at the time \u00a7 1988 was enacted, \u201cneither statutory nor judicial usage regarded the phrase \u2018attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 as embracing fees for experts\u2019 services,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 97, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Thus, the Court concluded that the \u201cclearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practice\u201d of the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d was \u201cunambiguous\u201d and could not be \u201cexpanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 111 S.Ct. 1138. The Court therefore held that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d in \u00a7 1988 did not provide the necessary \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d to shift fees for experts\u2019 services beyond the limits set in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (quoting <em>Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 439, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987)). While my colleagues treat this conclusion as \u201cthe end of the matter\u201d because the fee-shifting provision of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), contains the same language construed by the Court in <em>Casey, </em>Op. at 7, I conclude, in light of this court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Moore v. District of Columbia, </em>907 F.2d 165 (D.C.Cir.1990) (en banc), that the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d does not apply to the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision because Congress clearly expressed its intent in the Conference Report to define the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d as a term of art to include fees for experts\u2019 services. <em>See </em>H.R.

The statement is an apparent effort to <em>depart </em>from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art.\u201d <em>Casey, </em>499 U.S. at 91 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Thus, the Court recognized in footnote 5 that Congress could depart from the ordinary meaning of the statutory phrase in \u00a7 1988 by defining it as a term of art. While the Second and Third Circuits view the Conference Report accompanying the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision as persuasive evidence that Congress intended to authorize recovery of fees for experts\u2019 services in IDEA proceedings, <em>see Murphy v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>402 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Arons v. New Jersey State Bd. of Educ., </em>842 F.2d 58, 62 (3d Cir.1988), my colleagues join the Seventh and Eighth Circuits in rejecting reliance on the Conference Report on the grounds that the Supreme Court in <em>Casey </em>defined the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d and that the \u201capparent effort\u201d in the Conference Report to depart from that meaning was unsuccessful. <em>See </em>Op. at 76; <em>T.D. v. LaGrange Sch. Dist. No. 102, </em>349 F.3d 469, 482 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Neosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark, </em>315 F.3d 1022, 1032 (8th Cir.2003). In my view, that conclusion is inconsistent with this court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Moore </em>and rests on a misreading of <em>Casey </em>and <em>Crawford Fitting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Sitting en banc, this court in <em>Moore </em>relied on a conference report as evidence of congressional intent to authorize recovery of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in IDEA administrative proceedings. <em>See Moore, </em>907 F.2d at 175. In so doing, the court recognized that a conference report \u201c \u2018is the most persuasive evidence of congressional intent\u2019 after statutory text itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Demby v. Schweiker, </em>671 F.2d 507, 510 (D.C.Cir.1981)). Similarly, in relying on the Conference Report accompanying the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision as evidence of congressional intent to allow the shifting of fees for experts\u2019 services in IDEA proceedings, the Second Circuit in <em>Murphy </em>explained why a joint explanatory statement in a conference report is more persuasive as evidence of legislative intent than a committee report prepared before either the House or the Senate has passed a bill. <em>See Murphy, </em>402 F.3d at 337. Because a conference report \u201crepresents the final statement of terms agreed to by both houses, next to the statute itself it is the most persuasive evidence of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Disabled in Action of Metro. N.Y. v. Hammons, </em>202 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir.2000)). Although my colleagues observe that Congress does not vote on the joint explanatory statement, <em>see </em>Op. at 75 n. 3 (citing <em>Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>333 F.3d 228, 236 (D.C.Cir.2003)), it is nonetheless true that in voting on the statutory language agreed to by the House and Senate conferees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Congress can reasonably be understood to accept the joint explanatory statement as the intended meaning of the statutory text. <em>See Moore, </em>907 F.2d at 176; <em>see also Murphy, </em>402 F.3d at 337 (citing ROBERT A. KATZMANN, COURTS AND CONGRESS 63-64 (1997)). As conference reports are often terse statements unaccompanied by the kind of extended analysis contained in the initial reports of the individual committees of the House and Senate, the fact that the Conference Report accompanying the fee-shifting provision of the IDEA contains only a \u201csingle sentence\u201d on fees for experts\u2019 services is not a reason for rejecting its persuasive force, Op. at 74, especially when that sentence is a comprehensive statement of congressional intent on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">While, as my colleagues point out, Op. at 74-75, the Supreme Court has held that there is no occasion to resort to legislative history when the statutory language is clear, the Court has also held that the \u201c \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent [can be] rebutted ... when a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed,\u201d such as a \u201cconclusive statement in the legislative history.\u201d <em>Ardestani v. INS, </em>502 U.S. 129, 135-36, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991) (quoting <em>Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981)) (internal citation omitted). Indeed, because the ultimate purpose of statutory construction is to effectuate congressional intent, <em>cf. Chickasaw Nation v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 84, 94, 122 S.Ct. 528, 151 L.Ed.2d 474 (2001), a statutory phrase is to be given its ordinary meaning only \u201c[i]n the absence of persuasive reasons to the contrary.\u201d <em>Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Ass\u2019n, </em>390 U.S. 459, 465, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968); <em>Nat\u2019l Insulation Transp. Comm. v. ICC, </em>683 F.2d 533, 537 (D.C.Cir.1982). Although the Court in <em>Casey </em>found no persuasive evidence of congressional intent to depart from the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d in \u00a7 1988, <em>see </em>499 U.S. at 98, 111 S.Ct. 1138, here the Conference Report accompanying the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision clearly and conclusively states Congress\u2019s intent to define the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d as a term of art to include fees for experts\u2019 services. To apply the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d to the IDEA in the face of contrary legislative intent is to allow the Court to trump Congress in defining statutory terms. While my colleagues correctly point out that the \u201cinquiry into the Congress\u2019s intent ... <em>begins </em>with the language of the statute,\u201d Op. at 77 (quoting <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Labor &amp; Congress of Indus. Orgs. v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, </em>333 F.3d 168, 180 (D.C.Cir.2003) (Henderson, J., concurring in the judgment) (emphasis added)), they fail to acknowledge that it does not always end there. The situation might be somewhat different had the Court in <em>Casey </em>purported to define \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d as a term of art, as it did with the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. </em>West <em>Virginia Department of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 604-05, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). Even in that situation, this court and other circuits have recognized that the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d in <em>Buckhannon </em>is only presumptive and that \u201csome good reason\u201d may compel the court to construe the term differently in a different statute. <em>Oil, Chem. &amp; Atomic Workers Int'l Union v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>288 F.3d 452, 455 (D.C.Cir.2002); <em>see also Doe v. Boston Pub. Sch., </em>358 F.3d 20, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2004); <em>T.D., </em>349 F.3d at 475 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Thus, while the Court in <em>Casey </em>reasoned that construing the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d in \u00a7 1988 to include fees for experts\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>services would render superfluous the statutory language in the 34 statutes explicitly shifting both attorney\u2019s fees and expert fees, <em>see </em>499 U.S. at 92, 111 S.Ct. 1138, it did so in the context of defining the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees,\u201d recognizing in footnote 5 the possibility that Congress could depart from the ordinary meaning of the term by defining the statutory phrase as a term of art. Moreover, while the Court in <em>Casey </em>took pains to demonstrate that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d had a \u201cclearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practice\u201d at the time \u00a7 1988 was enacted, <em>id. </em>at 98, 111 S.Ct. 1138, it offered only a conclusory response to the dissent\u2019s position that fees for experts\u2019 services were part of \u201ccosts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. 1138. Finally, while the Court in <em>Casey </em>warned that legislative history could not change the unambiguous ordinary meaning of a statutory phrase, <em>see id. </em>at 98, 111 S.Ct. 1138, that statement was based on the Court\u2019s observation that, in enacting \u00a7 1988, Congress intentionally \u201cchose ... to enact more restrictive language\u201d than that in the 34 statutes that explicitly shift both attorney\u2019s fees and expert fees, <em>id. </em>at 99, 111 S.Ct. 1138. The Conference Report indicates, as footnote 5 acknowledges, that Congress made a different choice in enacting the fee-shifting provision of the IDEA: instead of relying on the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees,\u201d it chose to define the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d as a term of art to include fees for experts\u2019 services. Thus, while <em>Casey </em>instructs that legislative history cannot alter the ordinary meaning of a statutory phrase that the Court has construed, nothing in <em>Casey </em>precludes reference to legislative history clearly indicating that Congress intends to depart from the ordinary meaning of a statutory phrase and to define that phrase as a term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In disregarding the Conference Report as evidence of congressional intent, my colleagues reason that if the Supreme Court in <em>Casey </em>had viewed Congress\u2019s \u201capparent effort\u201d in enacting IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision to depart from the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d as successful, it would have listed 35 statutes instead of 34. <em>See </em>Op. at 75 - 76. In listing the 34 statutes, however, the Court did not purport to catalog every statute that authorizes the shifting of fees for experts\u2019 services; rather, it identified only the statutes that <em>\u201cexplicitly </em>shift attorney\u2019s fees <em>and </em>expert witness fees,\u201d <em>Casey, </em>499 U.S. at 89, 111 S.Ct. 1138 (first emphasis added), saying nothing, other than in footnote 5, about statutes like the IDEA that implicitly do so by defining the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d as a term of art to include fees for experts\u2019 services. Thus, the fact that the IDEA is not included in the list of statutes that explicitly shift both attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees does not indicate that the Court viewed Congress\u2019s \u201capparent effort\u201d to depart from the ordinary meaning of \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d as unsuccessful. Nor does footnote 5 itself indicate that the \u201capparent effort\u201d was a failure. While the word \u201capparent\u201d can mean \u201costensible rather than actual,\u201d suggesting that the effort was unsuccessful, it can also mean \u201ccapable of being easily understood,\u201d or \u201cobvious,\u201d suggesting that the effort was successful. <em>See </em>RANDOM HOUSE WEBSTER\u2019S COLLEGE DICTIONARY 64-65 (1999). Thus, in concluding that the Court in <em>Casey </em>viewed the \u201capparent effort\u201d as a failure, my colleagues read too much into footnote 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">My colleagues also read too much into <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>essentially adopting the overreading by the Seventh and Eighth Circuits in <em>T.D. </em>and <em>Neosho. See </em>Op. at 6. While the Eighth Circuit acknowledged in <em>Neosho </em>that the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d in the IDEA \u201cassumes, by its construction, that costs include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>something more than attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d 315 F.3d at 1031 (quoting <em>Pazik v. Gateway Reg. Sch. Dist., </em>130 F.Supp.2d 217, 220 (D.Mass.2001)) (internal quotation marks omitted), it concluded based on <em>Crawford Fitting </em>that \u201c[a]bsent a specific definition of costs,\u201d the recovery of expert fees is limited by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920, <em>id. </em>Noting that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision does not explicitly authorize the shifting of fees for experts\u2019 services in excess of the limits set in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the \u201capparent effort\u201d to shift fees for experts\u2019 services in the Conference Report was \u201cunsuccessful\u201d because it was not the kind of \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d required by <em>Crawford Fitting. Id. </em>at 1032. Adopting the Eighth Circuit\u2019s reasoning, the Seventh Circuit in <em>T.D., </em>349 F.3d at 481-82, agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Crawford Fitting </em>that a court may not shift expert witness fees in excess of the amounts authorized in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920 \u201cabsent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary.\u201d 482 U.S. at 439, 107 S.Ct. 2494. As the separate opinions of Justice Blackmun and Justice Marshall indicate, the Court in <em>Crawford Fitting </em>did not reach the question whether \u00a7 1988, or any other statute, authorized the shifting of expert witness fees. <em>See id. </em>at 445, 107 S.Ct. 2494 (Blackmun, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 446 n. 1, 107 S.Ct. 2494 (Marshall, J., dissenting). In that c\u00e1se, involving the antitrust laws, the district court invoked no specific statute in shifting expert witness fees, instead relying solely on its general discretion to award costs under Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See id. </em>at 438-39, 107 S.Ct. 2494. Thus, in the context of the <em>Crawford Fitting </em>decision, the phrase \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d refers not to explicit statutory language, but to specific statutory authority apart from the court\u2019s general discretion to shift costs under a procedural rule. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, the Court emphasized the necessity of \u201cplain evidence of congressional intent to supercede\u201d the limits set in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 107 S.Ct. 2494. While it is true that the Court indicated that explicit statutory text would serve as plain evidence of congressional intent to shift expert witness fees, it did not state that statutory text was the only acceptable evidence of congressional intent. Rather, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">We will not lightly infer that Congress has repealed \u00a7\u00a7 1920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or any other provision not referring explicitly to witness fees. As always, \u201c\u2018[w]here there is no <em>dear </em>intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of the priority of enactment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration and emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Radzanower v. Touche </em>Ross <em>&amp; Co., </em>426 U.S. 148, 153, 96 S.Ct. 1989, 48 L.Ed.2d 540 (1976)). By stating that it would not <em>lightly </em>infer authority to shift expert witness fees absent an explicit statutory provision, the Court acknowledged that there may be certain circumstances in which it would infer such authority based on plain evidence of clear congressional intent. Because this court treats conference reports as strong evidence of congressional intent, <em>see Moore, </em>907 F.2d at 176, and because the Conference Report accompanying the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision provides plain evidence that Congress clearly intended for the statutory phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs\u201d to authorize the shifting of fees for experts\u2019 services, that statutory phrase provides the \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d required by <em>Crawford Fitting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Accordingly, I would reverse and vacate the order of the district court denying appellants an award of fees for experts\u2019 services in excess of the amounts set in 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">.
