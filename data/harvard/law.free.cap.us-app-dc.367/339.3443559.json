FERC approved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>amendment over the opposition of petitioners \u2014 two lakefront homeowners \u2014 who argued that the expansion was not in the public interest. In particular, they maintained that the cove where the marina is located had exceeded its \u201ccarrying capacity,\u201d precluding further growth. They also contended that FERC could not approve the expansion in the absence of comprehensive guidelines for shoreline development on the project, and that FERC erred in approving the state agency\u2019s waiver of one of its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Our review of FERC\u2019s decision is limited, and under that limited review we conclude that FERC considered the impact of the proposal on a variety of non-development objectives, as required by the applicable statute, and that FERC\u2019s treatment of the carrying capacity issue was not arbitrary or capricious or lacking in substantial evidence. We also find that FERC adequately explained its decision to proceed in the absence of comprehensive guidelines for shoreline development, and its determination to approve the departure from the state agency\u2019s regulations. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The Pensacola dam in northeast Oklahoma impounds the waters of the Grand or Neosho River, creating the Grand Lake O\u2019 the Cherokees. The dam and resulting lake are regulated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA), a state agency, pursuant to a license issued by FERC. <em>See Grand River Dam Authority, Order Issuing New License, </em>59 FERC \u00b6 62,073, 1992 WL 510727 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">FERC\u2019s licensing authority for such hydroelectric projects is governed by Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(e). That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">In deciding whether to issue any license under this subchapter for any project, the Commission, in addition to the power and development purposes for which licenses are issued, shall give equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation, the protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat), the protection of recreational opportunities, and the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Further guidance is found in Section 10(a)(1), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a)(1), which conditions all licenses on a requirement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">the project adopted ... shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of waterpower development, for the adequate protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat), and for other beneficial public uses, including irrigation, flood control, water supply, and recreational and other purposes referred to in section 797(e) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">GRDA\u2019s license calls on that agency to develop a long-term recreation management plan for Grand Lake, including an estimate of the lake\u2019s \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d \u2014 defined as \u201cthe level of use ... that would begin to detract from a safe or enjoyable recreation experience\u201d \u2014 and \u201cmeasures for managing lake use if it exceeds the carrying capacity.\u201d <em>Order Issuing New License, </em>59 FERC at 63,230. Regarding the agency\u2019s oversight of boat docks, the license permits GRDA to authorize the construction of \u201cnoncommercial\u201d structures \u201cthat can accommodate no more than 10 watercraft at a time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63,231. Larger undertakings require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>agency to apply to FERC for a license amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">GRDA filed a recreation plan in 1997. Appended to the plan was a study of carrying capacity conducted by faculty and students at Oklahoma State University. <em>See </em>Pensacola Recreation Management Plan, App. F. That study, the plan noted, did not \u201cdefin[e] a \u2018magic number\u2019 that represented the statistical carrying capacity of Grand Lake.\u201d Rec. Plan at 15-16. The plan also included a separate memorandum by the study\u2019s principal author, Professor Lowell Caneday, which did set forth a specific capacity figure for the lake: 0.13 boats per acre. <em>Id., </em>App. I at 3. Based on aerial photographs, estimated boating densities for the lake as a whole were below Dr. Caneday\u2019s figure in 1996, but above it in 1997. <em>See id., </em>App. G &amp; H.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">GRDA explained in the recreation plan that, in light of the carrying capacity information, it had adopted the goal of making certain changes in the management of Grand Lake. Rec. Plan at 16. Notably, these changes did not include a halt to shoreline development, although a management proposal featured in the OSU study called for such a step. <em>Compare id., </em>App. J (GRDA management strategy) (\u201cGrand Lake will provide ... (F) Shoreline development following best management practices and existing regulations\u201d) <em>with id., </em>App. F at 83 (OSU proposal) (\u201cGrand Lake ... will provide ...(f) restriction of further shoreline development\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The recreation plan also addressed the license requirement that it include recommended measures for managing lake use if carrying capacity were exceeded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">If the use of the project exceeded its documented carrying capacity, GRDA could implement seasonal rules targeted at the activity. More seasonal patrolmen could be hired to enforce existing and future restrictions. Special events could be limited to certain days of the week or the months they would be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 17. Finally, the plan featured proposed rules and regulations governing shore and water use \u2014 including a rule that docks may not extend into the water the longer of 125 feet or one-third of the distance to the opposite shore. <em>Id., </em>App. B at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">FERC approved the recreation plan. <em>See Grand River Dam Authority, Order Modifying and Approving Long-Term Recreation Plan, </em>84 FERC \u00b6 62,144, 1998 WL 481851 (1998). In particular, the Commission endorsed GRDA\u2019s capacity management approach, including its decision not to implement the strategy outlined in the OSU study that would be more restrictive with respect to development. <em>See id. </em>at 64,229 (\u201cWhile [the OSU strategy] includes greater restrictions, we believe the licensee\u2019s proposal is reasonable at this time given the project\u2019s slower than expected growth in recreation uses and the currently underutilized recreation facilities\u201d). Anticipating that the lake would experience increased shoreline development in the future, however, and noting GRDA\u2019s express willingness to do so, FERC stated that GRDA \u201cshould continue its efforts to work with project stakeholders on the development of a comprehensive [shoreline] management plan [CSMP] for the project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64,231. FERC also directed the agency to file periodic reports monitoring recreation use and shoreline development, as well as progress updates on the development of a CSMP. <em>Id. </em>at 64,232.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Duck Creek cove is an arm of Grand Lake described as \u201cone of the lake\u2019s most frequently used boating areas.\u201d Final Environmental Assessment at 27. In 2001, the owner of Arrowhead North Marina, a commercial facility located on Duck Creek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>cove, asked GRDA for permission to expand and reconfigure the facility. The expansion sought to add 64 boat slips, many for large boats. GRDA endorsed the plan, and, as required by its license, filed an application with FERC for a license amendment permitting the expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Numerous area residents, as well as the U.S. Department of the Interior, submitted comments regarding the proposal. Intervenors opposing the expansion included Mike Brady and Cheryl Creekmore, owners of property on Duck Creek. While proceedings were pending before the Commission, GRDA filed its first monitoring report on recreation use and shoreline development, which showed a continuing rise in boating densities on the lake. <em>See </em>2003 Recreation Plan Monitoring Report at 3 &amp; Attachment C.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">FERC approved the marina expansion, over the dissent of one Commissioner. <em>Grand River Dam Authority, Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Property, </em>105 FERC \u00b6 61,100, 2003 WL 22422344 (2003). The Commission reasoned that the proposed expansion would have \u201cbeneficial impacts on employment, tax revenues and tourism,\u201d offsetting \u201csome adverse impacts on the visual character and scenic quality of the landscape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,506-07. The Commission further found that the expansion \u201cwould result in only moderate long-term adverse impacts to boating use and navigational safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,507. The Commission also held that it could approve the proposal even though the reconfigured marina exceeded GRDA\u2019s dock length restrictions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Turning specifically to the issue of carrying capacity, FERC found that \u201cwhile there is evidence that boating densities in the cove are increasing, such evidence does not confirm that the cove has reached its carrying capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a final environmental assessment accompanying the order, FERC staff added that \u201cthe resources of Grand Lake\u2019s Duck Creek arm are approaching carrying-capacity limits ' for boating-related facilities and activities\u201d and promised to \u201cintensively scrutinize any future non-project proposals involving this cove.\u201d Final Environmental Assessment at 51. Lastly, although GRDA had not yet developed a CSMP, the Commission refused to delay consideration of the proposal until such a plan was submitted. <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use, </em>105 FERC at 61,507.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Brady and Creekmore filed requests for rehearing, which were denied without further opinion. <em>Grand River Dam Authority, Notice of Denial of Rehearing, </em>105 FERC \u00b6 61,310, 2003 WL 22987231 (2003). They now petition for review of FERC\u2019s order approving the marina expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In reviewing licensing proceedings, we will uphold FERC\u2019s conclusions unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The Commission\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825l (b). In both regards, the scope of our review is quite limited; \u201c[s]o long as the Commission has examined the relevant data and provided a reasoned explanation supported by a stated connection between the facts found and the choices made, we will defer to the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. FERC, </em>112 F.3d 1175, 1189 (D.C.Cir.1997); <em>see also U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior v. FERC, </em>952 F.2d 538, 543 (D.C.Cir.1992) (\u201cIn a licensing decision such as this, where few explicit statutory provisions govern, our role is narrowly circumscribed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">A. Brady and Creekmore begin with the Federal Power Act. They assert that, in approving the marina expansion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>FERC abdicated its duty to give \u201cequal consideration\u201d to the non-development purposes specified in Section 4(e) of the FPA, including protection of fish and wildlife, recreational opportunities, and other aspects of environmental quality, and failed to ensure that the project is \u201cbest adapted to a comprehensive plan\u201d that incorporates such non-development purposes, as required by Section 10(a)(1) of the FPA. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 797(e), 803(a)(1). <em>See </em>Pet. Br. at 26. Congress directed that FERC consider a variety of factors in making licensing decisions under the FPA, but the decision about how to weigh those factors remains with FERC. The judicial role is \u201cnarrowly circumscribed,\u201d and \u201c[t]he statutory \u2018equal consideration\u2019 requirement does not change the standard of review that we, as an appeals court, apply.\u201d <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>952 F.2d at 543, 545. FERC decides how to balance the various elements listed in the FPA; our task is to ensure that it considers the statutory factors and that its decisions meet the threshold standards of non-arbitrariness and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Contrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, FERC did not fail to consider non-development public uses. <em>See Order Approving Non-Project Use, </em>105 FERC at 61,506-07 (discussing, in addition to \u201cvisual character and scenic quality,\u201d impacts on \u201cfish and wildlife, air and water quality, ambient noise levels, [and] shoreline access,\u201d as well as \u201cboating use and navigational safety\u201d). Nothing on the face of FERC\u2019s order suggests a disregard of the considerations listed in the FPA. While Brady and Creekmore would strike the balance differently, against further development, the policy decision about how to weigh the pertinent factors is FERC\u2019s to make. The amendments to the FPA that added the \u201cequal consideration\u201d language \u201cwere aimed primarily at increasing FERC\u2019s sensitivity to environmental concerns,\u201d but those amendments \u201cdo not give environmental factors preemptive force.\u201d <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>952 F.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In making the foregoing determination, we note that petitioners have only raised FERC\u2019s duty to balance development with competing considerations. They have not challenged \u2014 either in their petitions for rehearing before FERC or in the briefs submitted to us \u2014 the propriety of the Commission\u2019s reliance on \u201cemployment, tax revenues and tourism\u201d as the development benefits of this proposal. Accordingly, we do not address whether the Commission may consider these particular benefits, either generally or under the particular circumstances of this case. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825i (b) (\u201cNo objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable grounds for failure to do so.\u201d); <em>compare Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. FERC, </em>912 F.2d 1471, 1482-83 (D.C.Cir. 1990) (presenting a challenge to FERC\u2019s reliance on \u201cwater supply\u201d benefits under FPA Section 4(e)). All we conclude is that the Commission satisfied the statutory requirement to consider a variety of specified public uses, including those militating against development.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">B. Petitioners attempt to buttress their statutory argument by focusing on the concept of carrying capacity. They maintain that the evidence before the Commission indicates that the lake\u2019s capacity has been exceeded, and that in approving further development, FERC necessarily proceeded on the erroneous assumption that it had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We agree that the record contains evidence of crowded conditions at Duck Creek. Aerial photographs taken in 1997 show that boating densities in the cove were significantly higher than those for the lake as a whole. <em>See </em>Rec. Plan, App. H. In surreys conducted as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>OSU study, more people listed Duck Creek as a place to avoid than any other area of the lake, citing \u201ctoo many boats\u201d and \u201cunsafe or too dangerous\u201d conditions. <em>Id., </em>App. F at 72. The 2003 monitoring report indicates that, prior to the institution of directional traffic lanes, the cove was the site of more boating accidents than any other arm of the lake. <em>See </em>2003 Recreation Plan Monitoring Report, Attachment B.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">FERC, however, did not ignore this evidence. In the order approving the marina expansion, the Commission expressly acknowledged that \u201cboating densities in the lake and the cove continue to increase,\u201d and that \u201cboating densities in the cove are increasing.\u201d <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use, </em>105 FERC at 61,507. FERC noted the new boat-traffic lanes and speed limits GRDA had implemented to accommodate the increasing number of boats in the cove, and required a slight change in the location of several of the proposed slips to ensure that boats entering and leaving the marina did not present a safety concern. <em>Id. </em>The issue of crowding was plainly recognized and addressed by FERC.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">FERC also specifically addressed the issue of crowding relative to the concept of carrying capacity. The Commission concluded that \u201cwhile there is evidence that boating densities in the cove are increasing, such evidence does not confirm that the cove has reached its carrying capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite the acknowledged crowded conditions in Duck Creek, this conclusion was a permissible one for the Commission to reach:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">First, the concept of \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d does not present the sort of bright-line limit that would mandate a particular finding on the facts before the Commission. The recreation plan does not treat capacity in quantitative terms. As noted in the text of the plan, the appended OSU study did not set forth a \u201cmagic number\u201d of boats above which the collective lake experience becomes unsafe or unenjoyable. <em>See </em>Rec. Plan at 15-16. Dr. Caneday\u2019s separate memorandum, which does set forth such a value, concedes that a \u201cconcern with this number is that it reflects merely the standard \u2018quantity\u2019 of watercraft without consideration for the \u2018quality<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of experience for the visitor or \u2018quality\u2019 of the lake environment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>App. I at 3. What is more, the OSU study makes clear that \u201c[tjhere are many types of carrying capacity,\u201d <em>id., </em>App. F at 82, and that the \u201cmanagement-objective recreation carrying capacity\u201d is \u201cundefined,\u201d because it depends on the goals and objectives of the managing agency. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 90. The amorphous nature of the carrying capacity concept (or concepts) as presented by the OSU study makes it difficult for us to fault FERC\u2019s conclusion that the record evidence did not <em>confirm </em>that the capacity of the cove had been exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Second, Dr. Caneday\u2019s estimate speaks to the capacity of the lake as a whole, whereas FERC\u2019s order focuses on the capacity <em>of the cove. </em>This difference is significant: according to the OSU study, \u201c[m]easurements of recreational carrying capacity must be site specific.\u201d Rec. Plan, App. F at 81. The record amply demonstrates that Duck Creek has characteristics not shared by the lake as a whole: for instance, boats must proceed through a portion of the cove at \u201cno wake\u201d speed, and no waterskiing or swimming is permitted in the directional traffic lanes at any time. <em>See </em>2003 Recreation Plan Monitoring Report, Attachments D &amp; E. Dr. Cane-day\u2019s estimate for the lake, by contrast, factors in space for activities such as unlimited powerboating and waterskiing. <em>See </em>Rec. Plan, App. I at 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>limited tangible guidance is provided by the record does not speak to the particular issue before the Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Petitioners broaden their argument to challenge not only FERC\u2019s dismissal of their evidence on carrying capacity, but more generally FERC\u2019s decision to approve the license amendment on what petitioners regard as the necessary \u201cassumption\u201d that the cove has not exceeded carrying capacity. <em>See </em>Reply Br. at 1-2, 9. Nothing, however, requires FERC to conduct its statutorily-mandated consideration and balancing of the pertinent factors under the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d framework. Certainly nothing in the FPA does so \u2014 the statute never mentions \u201ccarrying capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Nor does the recreation plan mandate that FERC discharge its responsibilities by assessing carrying capacity; GRDA\u2019s license required it to submit a plan including an estimate of carrying capacity, but the recreation plan does not state that the estimate would or should become the benchmark for FERC under the FPA. Under the recreation plan, a finding that carrying capacity has been exceeded does not trigger a ban on commercial development. In the section of the plan titled \u201cCarrying Capacity Management Methodology,\u201d GRDA commits to monitoring future recreation use in consultation with other state agencies. <em>See </em>Rec. Plan at 16-17. The agency then proposes the following methods of dealing with an exceeded capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">If the use of the project exceeded its documented carrying capacity, GRDA could implement seasonal rules targeted at the activity. More seasonal patrolmen could be hired to enforce existing and future restrictions. Special events could be limited to certain days of the week or the months they would be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 17. Plainly, these remedies do not include the suspension of commercial development.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">With respect to development, the recreation plan seems to contemplate a different approach: \u201cThe construction of commercial facilities will be controlled by demand and the decreasing availability of suitable locations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. FERC recognized this, noting in its order approving the amendment that \u201c[ujnder the approved recreation plan for the project, shoreline development is currently controlled by demand and site availability.\u201d <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use, </em>105 FERC at 61,505; <em>see also id. </em>at 61,507 (noting, with respect to earlier expansion of another marina, that \u201cunder the project\u2019s recreation plan approved in 1998, shoreline development is currently controlled by demand and site availability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">This is not to say that FERC may rest on \u201cdemand and site availability\u201d in approving license amendments; on the contrary, the FPA requires the Commission to weigh a number of factors. It does make clear, however, that the recreation plan itself cannot be read as imposing a duty on FERC to block development solely in light of any particular level of carrying capacity, or to assess proposals in light of a carrying capacity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>And that is in fact not how FERC read the plan when it approved it. FERC\u2019s order approving the plan noted that GRDA \u201cdoes not specify a specific number for carrying capacity but proposes to use the previously prepared recreation study to assist in its determination and implementation of future actions at the project to protect and promote recreation usage on Grand Lake.\u201d <em>Order Modifying and Approving Long-Term Recreation Plan, </em>84 FERC at 64,227-28. FERC recognized GRDA\u2019s commitment that \u201cif recreation use exceeds documented carrying capacity\u201d GRDA could take a number of specified steps \u2014 none of which included a ban on development. <em>Id. </em>at 64,228. Petitioners rely to a large extent on the evidence in the 1997 recreation plan to establish that carrying capacity has been exceeded, but FERC obviously had that evidence before it when it approved the plan in 1998, and in particular approved GRDA\u2019s decision to adopt a less restrictive approach to development than that recommended by the OSU study. <em>See id. </em>at 64,229. It was obvious from the get-go, therefore, that neither the recreation plan nor FERC\u2019s approval of it interpreted carrying capacity as a necessary limit on development, as petitioners now envisage it, and certainly not as a limit on how FERC analyzes proposed license amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Consistent with the foregoing, FERC\u2019s precedents since the approval of the recreation plan do not dictate a \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d analysis. Of the many prior decisions approving dock expansions on Grand Lake, only one squarely engaged the concept, and it failed to give carrying capacity any discernible weight. <em>See Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Lands and Waters, </em>95 FERC \u00b6 62,184, 64,268-70, 2001 WL 586944 (2001) (noting the shortcomings of Dr. Caneday\u2019s numeric estimate); <em>compare, e.g., Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Lands, </em>97 FERC \u00b6 62,132, 2001 WL 1379467 (2001) (no discussion of carrying capacity); <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Lands, </em>94 FERC \u00b6 62,263, 2001 WL 323208 (2001) (same); <em>Order Modifying and Approving Non-Project Use of Project Lands and Waters, </em>92 FERC \u00b6 62,235, 2000 WL 1349361 (2000) (same); <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Lands and Waters, </em>92 FERC \u00b6 62,238, 2000 WL 1358717 (2000) (same); <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Property, </em>89 FERC \u00b6 61,139, 1999 WL 989535 (1999) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Finally, the absence of support for petitioners\u2019 broader argument should come as no surprise. A carrying capacity analysis would simply determine whether approval of a proposal entails a net detriment with respect to recreational opportunities. <em>See Order Approving New License, </em>59 FERC at 63,230 (defining carrying capacity as \u201cthe level of use ... that would begin to detract from a safe or enjoyable <em>recreation </em>experience\u201d) (emphasis added). But just as we have held that environmental factors do not have \u201cpreemptive force\u201d in the weighing process, <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>952 F.2d at 545, neither do recreational factors. FERC recognized that approving the proposal would result in \u201cmoderate long-term adverse impacts to boating use and navigational safety,\u201d 105 FERC at 61,507, but determined that the perceived benefits \u2014 not challenged here \u2014 were nonetheless worth it. Our \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d role, <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>952 F.2d at 543, does not include second-guessing that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">C. Petitioners next turn to what they decry as the absence of any definitive standards for development on Grand Lake. According to Brady and Creekmore, FERC should have imposed a moratorium on development pending the creation of a CSMP, or at least required the Arrowhead marina to conform to the length restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tions in GRDA\u2019s rules and regulations. Without a CSMP, petitioners argue, the rules are the only possible standards to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">When it approved GRDA\u2019s recreation plan in 1998, FERC noted that the state agency should continue its efforts to develop a CSMP, and directed the agency to file periodic reports documenting its progress. <em>Order Modifying and Approving Long-Term Recreation Plan, </em>84 FERC at 64,-231. The state agency has yet to complete the CSMP, and FERC has accordingly been compelled to consider license amendments on a case-by-case basis. Such an approach does not provide a clear roadmap for ordered development of the Pensacola project.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">FERC staff, however, found that a CSMP \u201cwill require a substantial and uncertain amount of time to develop.\u201d Final Environmental Assessment at 52. Under these circumstances, it was within the Commission\u2019s authority to act on the expansion proposal instead of instituting a moratorium. At any rate, neither the text of the FPA nor FERC\u2019s prior orders relating to the project preclude such a course. <em>See, e.g., </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a)(2)(A) (Commission shall consider \u201c[t]he extent to which the project is consistent with a comprehensive plan <em>(where one </em>exists)\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Order Modifying and Approving Long-Term Recreation Plan, </em>84 FERC at 64,231-32 (requiring GRDA to submit progress reports but failing to establish a deadline for development of the plan itself).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As for the departure from GRDA\u2019s regulations, FERC noted in its decision that the regulations had not been adopted by FERC as license conditions. <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use, </em>105 FERC at 61,507. The FPA sets forth the criteria that FERC is to consider in approving a proposed license amendment, and that process cannot be preempted or displaced by local regulations. As FERC explained, \u201cwe may consider a proposal\u2019s consistency with these regulations, but we are not bound by them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">D. Brady and Creekmore raise two other objections that merit only brief discussion. First, they contend that the Commission improperly relied on the lack of county land use requirements in deciding that lakefront homeowners did not have a \u201crealistic expectation that their environs would remain undisturbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,507. Second, they argue that FERC disregarded two alternate configurations for the Arrowhead marina proposed by petitioner Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">As for the first objection, petitioners rightly maintain, as we just noted, that local land use requirements cannot supplant the Commission\u2019s duties under the FPA. But FERC does not suggest otherwise; rather, the Commission explained that it simply noted expectations affected by local land use \u2014 in addition to the many other factors it examined \u2014 as part of the overall statutory balancing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The second objection is simply incorrect. The final environmental assessment considered, and rejected, both of Brady\u2019s alternate designs. <em>See </em>Final Environmental Assessment at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">The Federal Power Act requires FERC to balance various public uses in making licensing decisions. In its oversight of the Pensacola project, the Commission to date has plainly seen the balance of statutory factors as tipping in favor of development. Brady and Creekmore make a vigorous case for the opposite outcome, but so long as FERC\u2019s decisions are not arbitrary or capricious, or lacking in substantial evidence, this court does not have the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>to alter the Commission\u2019s judgment. The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">.

In addition, FERC noted that the number of private and commercial slips on the lake had <em>decreased </em>since 1997 from 7500 to 6359, or by 15 percent, <em>Order Approving Non-Project Use, </em>105 FERC at 61,507 n. 28, suggesting that any alleged increase in the number of boats using the lake was not due to the number of slips.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b361-5\">STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Agx\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Two generations have now grown up with Garrett Hardin\u2019s famous article, <em>The Tragedy of the Commons, </em>162 SCIENCE 1243 (1968), exploring the risk of over-exploitation when many people have unlim-. ited access to a resource. Using the simple example of a common field in which neighboring farmers are all entitled to pasture their cows, Hardin pointed out that if there are no constraints the farmers will keep adding cows to the point where a farmer who did so would gain nothing; because of the trampling and crowding of the already grazing cows, the extra cow and her owner would enjoy no net benefits. Under management aimed at maximizing the net value of the pasture, by contrast, farmers would add cows only to the point where the feeding benefits for the next added cow just equaled the reduction in benefits for cows already in the field. Here, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission flirted with Hardin\u2019s insight, but it didn\u2019t click.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">As the court\u2019s opinion makes clear, FERC supervised the creation and adoption of a \u201crecreation plan\u201d for the Grand Lake O\u2019 the Cherokees. Although the drafters left the ultimate goal somewhat obscure, the plan points strongly toward net-value maximization. Using the ambiguous term \u201ccarrying capacity,\u201d it nonetheless looks essentially to \u201cbenefits (net of congestion disutilities),\u201d with suitable additional adjustments for out-of-pocket costs and ecological damage not already counted as part of the \u201ccongestion disutilities.\u201d Pensacola Recreation Management Plan, App. F, at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In considering whether to let the Grand River Dam Authority increase the number of boat slips, FERC never quite determined whether the extra boats would push usage beyond the lake\u2019s \u201ccarrying capacity.\u201d To resolve its apparent doubts, FERC reached out to find that any resulting injury was balanced by \u201cbeneficial impacts on employment, tax revenues and tourism.\u201d <em>Grand River Dam Authority, Order Approving Non-Project Use of Project Property, </em>105 FERC \u00b661,100.at 61,-506-07 (2003). It appears from the briefing that FERC relies on \u00a7 4(e)\u2019s reference to \u201cpower and development purposes\u201d and \u00a7 10(a)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cimprovement and utilization of water-power development\u201d to justify such a balancing operation. As the court\u2019s opinion emphasizes, petitioners here never claimed that the Commission lacked statutory authority to consider such factors in this context. Thus we cannot resolve that issue. There are, however, reasons to question FERC\u2019s implicit reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The references seem aimed directly at the issue of licensing hydro power dams themselves, a process obviously involving a trade-off between the values of natural amenity and power development. Further, in considering power development, the Commission must consider associated development: there would, for example, be little point in a hydropower dam if there were no prospect of users for the resulting power.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Here, by contrast, a recreational resource has been created as a side effect of power development. The sole issue is how to use it. Can the Commission rely on expected increases in tourism, employment and tax revenues, under the \u201cdevelopment\u201d language of \u00a7\u00a7 4(e) and 10(a)(1), to justify the possible loss in recreational value?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Consider tourism first. If the plan has identified a standard that maximizes the lake\u2019s net value as a tourist resource (the level at which the marginal benefit from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>extra tourist equals the marginal detriment in congestion and other costs), then to breach that standard, in the name of \u201cdevelopment,\u201d is to say that FERC wants toui\u2019ism to a degree that <em>diminishes </em>the lake\u2019s contribution to aggregate welfare. Such an interpretation of the statute is not self-evidently reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Taxes and employment seem no better a fit. Consider another form of net maximization of a resoui\u2019ce, oil-and-gas unitization. Unitization aims at preventing over-exploitation of the oil or gas field, i.e, exploitation that reduces the field\u2019s net value. Among the methods employed is limiting the number of wells; at some point the reductions in output at other wells exceed the costs of an extra well, just as the congestion costs of an extra boat (or cow!) at some point exceed its benefits. Suppose the Commission were in charge of managing oil and gas pooling and unitization, and it found that optimal exploitation of a field called for 20 wells. But then it approved the addition of another 10 because their construction and operation would generate local taxes and employment. Could the employment and taxes drawn to the locality (and presumably <em>away </em>from another locality, as the money spent on the extra wells would have had multiplier effects in its alternative uses) qualify as \u201cdevelopment\u201d under the guiding statutes? Again, the answer is not obviously affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Petitioners, however, failed to question whether the Commission had authority to invoke touxdsm, employment and tax revenues as offsetting values, or even to argue that reliance on supposed increases in the three was arbitrary or capricious in this context. I therefore join in the opinion of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
