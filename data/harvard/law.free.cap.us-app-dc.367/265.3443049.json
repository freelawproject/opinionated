Hamdan\u2019s captors turned him over to the American military, which transported him to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. The military initially kept him in the general detention facility, known as Camp Delta. On July 3, 2003, the President determined \u201cthat there is reason to believe that [Hamdan] was a member of al Qaeda or was otherwise involved in terrorism directed against the United States.\u201d This finding brought Hamdan within the compass of the President\u2019s November 13, 2001, Order concerning the Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism, 66 Fed.Reg. 57,833. Accordingly, Hamdan was designated for trial before a military commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">In December 2003, Hamdan was removed from the general population at Guantanamo and placed in solitary confinement in Camp Echo. That same month, he was appointed counsel, initially for the limited purpose of plea negotiation. In April 2004, Hamdan filed this petition for habeas corpus. While his petition was pending before the district court, the government formally charged Hamdan with conspiracy to commit attacks on civilians and civilian objects, murder and destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent, and terrorism. The charges alleged that Hamdan was Osama bin Laden\u2019s personal driver in Afghanistan between 1996 and November 2001, an allegation Hamdan admitted in an affidavit. The charges further alleged that Hamdan served as bin Laden\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>bodyguard, delivered weapons to al Qaeda members, drove bin Laden to al Qaeda training camps and safe havens in Afghanistan, and trained at the al Qaeda-sponsored al Farouq camp. Hamdan\u2019s trial was to be before a military commission, which the government tells us now consists of three officers of the rank of colonel. Brief for Appellants at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, </em>542 U.S. 507, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004), Hamdan received a formal hearing before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal. The Tribunal affirmed his status as an enemy combatant, \u201ceither a member of or affiliated with Al Qaeda,\u201d for whom continued detention was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On November 8, 2004, the district court granted in part Hamdan\u2019s petition. Among other things, the court held that Hamdan could not be tried by a military commission unless a competent tribunal determined that he was not a prisoner of war under the 1949 Geneva Convention governing the treatment of prisoners. The court therefore enjoined the Secretary of Defense from conducting any further military commission proceedings against Hamdan. - This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The government\u2019s initial argument is that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over Hamdan\u2019s habeas corpus petition. <em>Ex parte Quirin, </em>317 U.S. 1, 63 S.Ct. 1, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942), in which captured German saboteurs challenged the lawfulness of the military commission before which they were to be tried, provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions. The Supreme Court ruled against the petitioners in <em>Quirin, </em>but only after considering their arguments on the merits. In an effort to minimize the precedential effect of <em>Quirin, </em>the government points out that the decision predates the comity-based abstention doctrine recognized in <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975), and applied by this court in <em>New v. Cohen, </em>129 F.3d 639 (D.C.Cir.1997). <em>Councilman </em>and <em>New </em>hold only that civilian courts should not interfere with ongoing court-martial proceedings against citizen servicemen. The cases have little to tell us about the proceedings of military commissions against alien prisoners. The serviceman in <em>Councilman </em>wanted to block his court-martial for using and selling marijuana; the serviceman in <em>New </em>wanted to stop his court-martial for refusing to obey orders. The rationale of both cases was that a battle-ready military must be able to enforce \u201ca respect for duty and discipline without counterpart in civilian life,\u201d <em>Councilman, </em>420 U.S. at 757, 95 S.Ct. 1300, and that \u201ccomity aids the military judiciary in its task of maintaining order and discipline in the armed services,\u201d <em>New, </em>129 F.3d at 643. These concerns do not exist in Hamdan\u2019s case and we are thus left with nothing to detract from Quirin\u2019s precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Even within the framework of <em>Councilman </em>and <em>New, </em>there is an exception to abstention: \u201ca person need not exhaust remedies in a military tribunal if the military court has no jurisdiction over him.\u201d <em>New, </em>129 F.3d at 644. The theory is that setting aside the judgment after trial and conviction insufficiently redresses the defendant\u2019s right not to be tried by a tribunal that has no jurisdiction. <em>See Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). The courts in <em>Councilman </em>and <em>New </em>did not apply this exception because the servicemen had not \u201craised <em>substantial </em>argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>merits denying the right of the military to try them at all.\u201d <em>New, </em>129 F.3d at 644 (citing <em>Councilman, </em>420 U.S. at 759, 95 S.Ct. 1300). Hamdan\u2019s jurisdictional challenge, by contrast, is not insubstantial, as our later discussion should demonstrate. While he does not deny the military\u2019s authority to try him, he does contend that a military commission has no jurisdiction over him and that any trial must be by court-martial. His claim, therefore, falls within the exception to <em>Councilman </em>and, in any event, is firmly supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of <em>Quirin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In an argument distinct from his claims about the Geneva Convention, which we will discuss next, Hamdan maintains that the President violated the separation of powers inherent in the Constitution when he established military commissions. The argument is that Article I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,\u201d that Congress has not established military commissions, and that the President has no inherent authority to do so under Article II. <em>See </em>Neal K. Katyal &amp; Laurence H. Tribe, <em>Waging War, Deciding Guilt: Trying the Military Tribunals, </em>111 Yale L.J. 1259, 1284-85 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">There is doubt that this separation-of-powers claim properly may serve as a basis for a court order halting a trial before a military commission, <em>see United States v. Cisneros, </em>169 F.3d 763, 768-69 (D.C.Cir.1999), and there is doubt that someone in Hamdan\u2019s position is entitled to assert such a constitutional claim, <em>see People\u2019s Mojahedin Org. v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>182 F.3d 17, 22 (D.C.Cir.1999); <em>32 County Sovereignty Comm. v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>292 F.3d 797, 799 (D.C.Cir.2002). In any event, on the merits there is little to Hamdan\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The President\u2019s Military Order of November 13, 2001, stated that any person subject to the order, including members of al Qaeda, \u201cshall, when tried, be tried by a military commission for any and all offenses triable by [a] military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed ....\u201d 66 Fed.Reg. at 57,834. The President relied on four sources of authority: his authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, U.S. Const., art. II, \u00a7 2; Congress\u2019s joint resolution authorizing the use of force; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 821; and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836. The last three are, of course, actions of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">In the joint resolution, passed in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress authorized the President \u201cto use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided\u201d the attacks and recognized the President\u2019s \u201cauthority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States.\u201d Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub.L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224, 224 (2001). <em>In re Yamashita, </em>327 U.S. 1, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946), which dealt with the validity of a military commission, held that an \u201cimportant incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military commander, not only to repel and defeat the enemy, but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who, in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort, have violated the law of war.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 66 S.Ct. 340. \u201cThe trial and punishment of enemy combatants,\u201d the Court further held, is thus part of the \u201cconduct of war.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We think it no answer to say, as Hamdan does, that this ease is different because Congress did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>formally declare war. It has been suggested that only wars between sovereign nations would qualify for such a declaration. <em>See </em>John M. Bickers, <em>Military Commissions are Constitutionally Sound: A Response to Professors Katyal and Tribe, </em>34 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 899, 918 (2003). Even so, the joint resolution \u201cwent as far toward a declaration of war as it might, and as far or further than Congress went in the Civil War, the Philippine Insurrection, the Boxer Rebellion, the Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the invasion of Panama, the Gulf War, and numerous other conflicts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. The plurality in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, </em>in suggesting that a military commission could determine whether an American citizen was an enemy combatant in the current conflict, drew no distinction of the sort Hamdan urges upon us. 124 S.Ct. at 2640-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><em>Ex parte Quirin </em>also stands solidly against Hamdan\u2019s argument. The Court held that Congress had authorized military commissions through Article 15 of the Articles of War. 317 U.S. at 28-29, 63 S.Ct. 1; <em>accord In re Yamashita, </em>327 U.S. at 19-20, 66 S.Ct. 340. The modern version of Article 15 is 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 821, which the President invoked when he issued his military order. Section 821 states that court-martial jurisdiction does not \u201cdeprive military commissions ... of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commissions.\u201d Congress also authorized the President, in another provision the military order cited, to establish procedures for military commissions. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836(a). Given these provisions and <em>Quirin </em>and <em>Yamashita, </em>it is impossible to see any basis for Hamdan\u2019s claim that Congress has not authorized military commissions. <em>See </em>Curtis A. Bradley &amp; Jack L. Goldsmith, <em>Congressional Authorization and the War on Terrorism, </em>118 Harv. L. Rev. 2048, 2129-31 (2005). He attempts to distinguish <em>Quirin </em>and <em>Yamashita </em>on the ground that the military commissions there were in \u201cwar zones\u201d while Guantanamo is far removed from the battlefield. We are left to wonder why this should matter and, in any event, the distinction does not hold: the military commission in <em>Quirin </em>sat in Washington, D.C., in the Department of Justice building; the military commission in <em>Yamashita </em>sat in the Phillipines after Japan had surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We therefore hold that through the joint resolution and the two statutes just mentioned, Congress authorized the military commission that will try Hamdan.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">This brings us to Hamdan\u2019s argument, accepted by the district court, that the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316 (\u201c1949 Geneva Convention\u201d), ratified in 1955, may be enforced in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u201cTreaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. Even so, this country has traditionally negotiated treaties with the understanding that they do not create judicially enforceable individual rights. <em>See Holmes v. Laird, </em>459 F.2d 1211, 1220, 1222 (D.C.Cir.1972); <em>Canadian Transport Co. v. United States, </em>663 F.2d 1081, 1092 (D.C.Cir.1980). As a general matter, a \u201ctreaty is primarily a compact between independent nations,\u201d and \u201cdepends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and honor of the governments which are parties to it.\u201d <em>Head Money Cases, </em>112 U.S. 580, 598, 5 S.Ct. 247, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884). If a treaty is violated, this \u201cbecomes the subject of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ternational negotiations and reclamation,\u201d not the subject of a lawsuit. <em>Id.; see Charlton v. Kelly, </em>229 U.S. 447, 474, 33 S.Ct. 945, 57 L.Ed. 1274 (1913); <em>Whitney v. Robertson, </em>124 U.S. 190, 194-95, 8 S.Ct. 456, 31 L.Ed. 386 (1888); <em>Foster v. Neilson, </em>27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 306, 314, 7 L.Ed. 415 (1829), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v. Percheman, </em>32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 51, 8 L.Ed. 604 (1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Thus, \u201c[ijnternational agreements, even those directly benefitting private persons, generally do not create private rights or provide for a private cause of action in domestic courts.\u201d Restatement (Third) Of The Foreign Relations Law Of The United States \u00a7 907 cmt. a, at 395 (1987). The district court nevertheless concluded that the 1949 Geneva Convention conferred individual rights enforceable in federal court. We believe the court\u2019s conclusion disregards the principles just mentioned and is contrary to the Convention itself. To explain why, we must consider the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the Third Geneva Convention of 1929 in <em>Johnson v. Eisentrager, </em>339 U.S. 763, 70 S.Ct. 936, 94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950), and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Holmes v. Laird, </em>neither of which the district court mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>Eisentrager, </em>German nationals, convicted by a military commission in China of violating the laws of war and imprisoned in Germany, sought writs of habeas corpus in federal district court on the ground that the military commission violated their rights under the Constitution and their rights under the 1929 Geneva Convention. 339 U.S. at 767, 70 S.Ct. 936. The Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Jackson, wrote in an alternative holding that the Convention was not judicially enforceable: the Convention specifies rights of prisoners of war, but \u201cresponsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789 n. 14, 70 S.Ct. 936. We relied on this holding in <em>Holmes v. Laird, </em>459 F.2d at 1222, to deny enforcement of the individual rights provisions contained in the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, an international treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">This aspect of <em>Eisentrager </em>is still good law and demands our adherence. <em>Rasul v. Bush, </em>542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), decided a different and \u201cnarrow\u201d question: whether federal courts had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 \u201cto consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals\u201d at Guantanamo Bay. <em>Id. </em>at 2690. The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rasul </em>had nothing to say about enforcing any Geneva Convention. Its holding that federal courts had habeas corpus jurisdiction had no effect on Eisentrager\u2019s interpretation of the 1929 Geneva Convention. That interpretation, we believe, leads to the conclusion that the 1949 Geneva Convention cannot be judicially enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Although the government relied heavily on <em>Eisentrager </em>in making its argument to this effect, Hamdan chose to ignore the decision in his brief. Nevertheless, we have compared the 1949 Convention to the 1929 Convention. There are differences, but none of them renders Eisentrager\u2019s conclusion about the 1929 Convention inapplicable to the 1949 Convention. Common Article 1 of the 1949 Convention states that parties to the Convention \u201cundertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\u201d The comparable provision in the 1929 version stated that the \u201cConvention shall be respected ... in all circumstances!\u2019 Geneva Convention of 1929, art. 82. The revision imposed upon signatory nations the duty not only of complying themselves but also of making sure other signatories complied. Nothing in the revision altered the method by which a nation would en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>force compliance. Article 8 of the 1949 Convention states that its provisions are to be \u201capplied with the cooperation and under the scrutiny of the Protecting Powers .... \u201d This too was a feature of the 1929 Convention. <em>See </em>Geneva Convention of 1929, art. 86. But Article 11 of the 1949 Convention increased the role of the protecting power, typically the International Red Cross, when disputes arose: \u201c[I]n cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention, the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement.\u201d Here again there is no suggestion of judicial enforcement. The same is true with respect to the other method set forth in the 1949 Convention . for settling disagreements. Article 132 provides that \u201cat the request of a Party to the conflict, an enquiry shall be instituted, in a manner to be decided between the interested Parties, concerning any alleged violation of the Convention.\u201d If no agreement is reached about the procedure for the \u201cenquiry,\u201d Article 132 further provides that \u201cthe Parties should agree on the choice of an umpire who will decide upon the procedure to be followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Hamdan points out that the 1949 Geneva Convention protects individual rights. But so did the 1929 Geneva Convention, as the Court recognized in <em>Eisentrager, </em>339 U.S. at 789-90, 70 S.Ct. 936. The NATO Status of Forces Agreement, at issue in <em>Holmes v. Laird, </em>also protected individual rights, but we held that the treaty was not judicially enforceable. 459 F.2d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><em>Eisentrager </em>also answers Hamdan\u2019s argument that the habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, permits courts to enforce the \u201ctreaty-based individual rights\u201d set forth in the Geneva Convention. The 1929 Convention specified individual rights but as we have discussed, the Supreme Court ruled that these rights were to be enforced by means other than the writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Rasul </em>decision did give district courts jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of Guantanamo detainees such as Hamdan. But <em>Rasul </em>did not render the Geneva Convention judicially enforceable. That a court has jurisdiction over a claim does not mean the claim is valid. <em>See Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). The availability of habeas may obviate a petitioner\u2019s need to rely on a private right of action, <em>see Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 140-41 &amp; n. 16 (2d Cir.2003), but it does not render a treaty judicially enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We therefore hold that the 1949 Geneva Convention does not confer upon Hamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court. <em>See Huynh Thi Anh v. Levi, </em>586 F.2d 625, 629 (6th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Even if the 1949 Geneva Convention could be enforced in court, this would not assist Hamdan. He contends that a military commission trial would violate his rights under Article 102, which provides that a \u201cprisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power.\u201d One problem for Hamdan is that he does not fit the Article 4 definition of a \u201cprisoner of war\u201d entitled to the protection of the Convention. He does not purport to be a member of a group who displayed \u201ca fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance\u201d and who conducted \u201ctheir operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.\u201d <em>See </em>1949 Convention, arts. 4A(2)(b), (c) <em>&amp; </em>(d). If Hamdan were to claim prisoner of war status under Article 4A(4) as a person who ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>companied \u201cthe armed forces without actually being [a] member[ ] thereof,\u201d he might raise that claim before the military commission under Army Regulation 190-8. <em>See </em>Section VII of this opinion, <em>infra. </em>(We note that Hamdan has not specifically made such a claim before this court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Another problem for Hamdan is that the 1949 Convention does not apply to al Qaeda and its members. The Convention appears to contemplate only two types of armed conflicts. The first is an international conflict. Under Common Article 2, the provisions of the Convention apply to \u201call cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.\u201d Needless to say, al Qaeda is not a state and it was not a \u201cHigh Contracting Party.\u201d There is an exception, set forth in the last paragraph of Common Article 2, when one of the \u201cPowers\u201d in a conflict is not a signatory but the other is. Then the signatory nation is bound to adhere to the Convention so long as the opposing Power \u201caccepts and applies the provisions thereof.\u201d Even if al Qaeda could be considered a Power, which we doubt, no one claims that al Qaeda has accepted and applied the provisions of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The second type of conflict, covered by Common Article 3, is a civil war \u2014 that is, an \u201carmed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties .... \u201d In that situation, Common Article 3 prohibits \u201cthe passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by a civilized people.\u201d Hamdan assumes that if Common Article 3 applies, a military commission could not try him. We will make the same assumption <em>arguendo, </em>which leaves the question whether Common Article 3 applies. Afghanistan is a \u201cHigh Contracting Party.\u201d Hamdan was captured during hostilities there. But is the war against terrorism in general and the war against al Qaeda in particular, an \u201carmed conflict not of an international character\u201d? <em>See </em>Int\u2019l Comm. Red Cross, Commentary: III Geneva Convention Relative To The Treatment Of Prisoners Of War 37 (1960) (Common Article 3 applies only to armed conflicts confined to \u201ca single country\u201d). President Bush determined, in a memorandum to the Vice President and others on February 7, 2002, that it did not fit that description because the conflict was \u201cinternational in scope.\u201d The district court disagreed with the President\u2019s view of Common Article 3, apparently because the court thought we were not engaged in a separate conflict with al Qaeda, distinct from the conflict with the Taliban. <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, </em>344 F.Supp.2d 152, 161 (D.D.C.2004). We have difficulty understanding the court\u2019s rationale. Hamdan was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001, but the conflict with al Qaeda arose before then, in other regions, including this country on September 11, 2001. Under the Constitution, the President \u201chas a degree of independent authority to act\u201d in foreign affairs, <em>Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, </em>539 U.S. 396, 414, 123 S.Ct. 2374, 156 L.Ed.2d 376 (2003), and, for this reason and others, his construction and application of treaty provisions is entitled to \u201cgreat weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Stuart, </em>489 U.S. 353, 369, 109 S.Ct. 1183, 103 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989); <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, </em>457 U.S. 176, 185, 102 S.Ct. 2374, 72 L.Ed.2d 765 (1982); <em>Kolovrat v. Oregon, </em>366 U.S. 187, 194, 81 S.Ct. 922, 6 L.Ed.2d 218 (1961). While the district court determined that the actions in Afghanistan constituted a single conflict, the President\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>decision to treat our conflict with the Taliban separately from our conflict with al Qaeda is the sort of political-military decision constitutionally committed to him. <em>See Japan Whaling Ass\u2019n v. Am. Cetacean Soc\u2019y, </em>478 U.S. 221, 230, 106 S.Ct. 2860, 92 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986). To the extent there is ambiguity about the meaning of Common Article 3 as applied to al Qaeda and its members, the President\u2019s reasonable view of the provision must therefore prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Suppose we are mistaken about Common Article 3. Suppose it does cover Hamdan. Even then we would abstain from testing the military commission against the requirement in Common Article 3(l)(d) that sentences must be pronounced \u201cby a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\u201d <em>See Councilman, </em>420 U.S. at 759, 95 S.Ct. 1300; <em>New, </em>129 F.3d at 644; <em>supra </em>Part I. Unlike his arguments that the military commission lacked jurisdiction, his argument here is that the commission\u2019s procedures \u2014 particularly its alleged failure to require his presence at all stages of the proceedings \u2014 fall short of what Common Article 3 requires. The issue thus raised is not <em>whether </em>the commission may try him, but rather <em>how </em>the commission may try him. That is by no stretch a jurisdictional argument. No one would say that a criminal defendant\u2019s contention that a district court will not allow him to confront the witnesses against him raises a jurisdictional objection. Hamdan\u2019s claim therefore falls outside the recognized exception to the <em>Councilman </em>doctrine. Accordingly, comity would dictate that we defer to the ongoing military proceedings. If Hamdan were convicted, and if Common Article 3 covered him, he could contest his conviction in federal court after he exhausted his military remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">After determining that the 1949 Geneva Convention provided Hamdan a basis for judicial relief, the district court went on to consider the legitimacy of a military commission in the event Hamdan should eventually appear before one. In the district court\u2019s view, the principal constraint on the President\u2019s power to utilize such commissions is found in Article 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial, military commissions and other military tribunals ... may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, <em>but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">(Emphasis added.) The district court interpreted the final qualifying clause to mean that military commissions must comply in all respects with the requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). This was an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Throughout its Articles, the UCMJ takes care to distinguish between \u201ccourts-martial\u201d and \u201cmilitary commissions.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 821 (noting that \u201cprovisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions ... of concurrent jurisdiction\u201d). The terms are not used interchangeably, and the majority of the UCMJ\u2019s procedural requirements refer only to courts-martial. The district court\u2019s approach would obliterate this distinction. A far more sensible reading is that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>establishing military commissions, the President may not adopt procedures that are \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d the UCMJ\u2019s provisions governing military commissions. In particular, Article 39 requires that sessions of a \u201ctrial by <em>coxi/rbmartial ... </em>shall be conducted in the presence of the accused.\u201d Hamdan\u2019s trial before a <em>military commission </em>does not violate Article 36 if it omits this procedural guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Madsen v. Kinsella, </em>343 U.S. 341, 72 S.Ct. 699, 96 L.Ed. 988 (1952), provides further support for this reading of the UCMJ. There, the Court spoke of the place of military commissions in our history, referring to them as \u201cour commonlaw war courts.... Neither their procedure nor their jurisdiction has been prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346-48, 72 S.Ct. 699. The Court issued its opinion two years after enactment of the UCMJ, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to square the Court\u2019s language in <em>Madsen </em>with the sweeping effect with which the district court would invest Article 36. The UCMJ thus imposes only minimal restrictions upon the form and function of military commissions, <em>see, e.g., </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 828, 847(a)(1), 849(d), and Hamdan does not allege that the regulations establishing the present commission violate any of the pertinent provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">VH.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Although we have considered all of Hamdan\u2019s remaining contentions, the only one requiring further discussion is his claim that even if the Geneva Convention is not judicially enforceable, Army Regulation 190-8 provides a basis for relief. This regulation, which contains many subsections, \u201cimplements international law, both customary and codified, relating to [enemy prisoners of war], [retained personnel], [civilian internees], and [other detainees] which includes those persons held during military operations other than war.\u201d AR 190-8 \u00a7 1 \u2014 1(b). The regulation lists the Geneva Convention among the \u201cprincipal treaties relevant to this regulation.\u201d \u00a7 1-1(b)(3); <em>see Hamdi, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2658 (Souter, J., concurring) (describing AR 190-8 as \u201cimplementing the Geneva Convention\u201d). One subsection, \u00a7 l-5(a)(2), requires that prisoners receive the protections of the Convention \u201cuntil some other legal status is determined by competent <em>authority.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The President found that Hamdan was not a prisoner of war under the Convention. Nothing in the regulations, and nothing Hamdan argues, suggests that the President is not a \u201ccompetent authority\u201d for these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Hamdan claims that AR 190-8 entitles him to have a \u201ccompetent tribunal\u201d determine his status. But we believe the military commission is such a tribunal. The regulations specify that such a \u201ccompetent tribunal\u201d shall be composed of three commissioned officers, one of whom must be field-grade. AR 190-8 \u00a7 1.6(c). A field-grade officer is an officer above the rank of captain and below the rank of brigadier general \u2014 a major, a lieutenant colonel, or a colonel. The President\u2019s order requires military commissions to be composed of between three and seven commissioned officers. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.4(a)(2), (3). The commission before which Hamdan is to be tried consists of three colonels. Brief for Appellants at 7. We therefore see no reason why Hamdan could not assert his claim to prisoner of war status before the military commission at the time of his trial and thereby receive the judgment of a \u201ccompetent tribunal\u201d within the meaning of Army Regulation 190-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b288-5\">WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWN\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">I concur in all aspects of the court\u2019s opinion except for the conclusion that Common Article 3 does not apply to the United States\u2019s conduct toward al Qaeda personnel captured in the conflict in Afghanistan. Maj. Op. 41-42. Because I agree that the Geneva Convention is not enforceable in courts of the United States, and that any claims under Common Article 3 should be deferred until proceedings against Hamdan are finished, I fully agree with the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">There is, I believe, a fundamental logic to the Convention\u2019s provisions on its application. Article 2 (\u00b6 1) covers armed conflicts between two or more contracting parties. Article 2 (\u00b6 3) makes clear that in a multi-party conflict, where any two or more signatories are on opposite sides, those parties \u201care bound by [the Convention] in them mutual relations\u201d \u2014 but not (by implication) vis-a-vis any non-signatory. And as the court points out, Maj. Op. at 41, under Article 2 (\u00b6 3) even a non-signatory \u201cPower\u201d is entitled to the benefits of the Convention, as against a signatory adversary, if it \u201caccepts and applies\u201d its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Non-state actors cannot sign an international treaty. Nor is such an actor even a \u201cPower\u201d that would be eligible under Article 2 (\u00b6 3) to secure protection by complying with the Convention\u2019s requirements. Common Article 3 fills the gap, providing some minimal protection for such non-eligibles in an \u201carmed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties.\u201d The gap being filled is the non-eligible party\u2019s failure to be a nation. Thus the words \u201cnot of an international character\u201d are sensibly understood to refer to a conflict between a signatory nation and a non-state actor. The most obvious form of such a conflict is a civil war. But given the Convention\u2019s structure, the logical reading of \u201cinternational character\u201d is one that matches the basic derivation of the word \u201cinternational,\u201d i.e., <em>between nations. </em>Thus, I think the,context compels the view that a conflict between a signatory and a non-state actor is a conflict \u201cnot of an international character.\u201d In such a conflict, the signatory is bound to Common Article 3\u2019s modest requirements of \u201chumane[ ]\u201d treatment and \u201cthe judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">I assume that our conflicts with the Taliban and al Qaeda are distinct, and I agree with the court that in reading the Convention we owe the President\u2019s construction \u201cgreat weight.\u201d Maj. Op. at 41. But I believe the Convention\u2019s language and structure compel the view that Common Article 3 covers the conflict with al Qaeda.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
