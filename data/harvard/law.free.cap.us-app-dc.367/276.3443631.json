After the TTAB granted their petition, the team\u2019s owner, Pro-Football, Inc., brought suit seeking reversal of the TTAB\u2019s decision. The district court granted summary judgment to Pro-Football on two alternate grounds, holding that the TTAB should have found the Native Americans\u2019 petition barred by laches and that in any event the TTAB\u2019s cancellation decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. The Native Americans now appeal. Because we find that the district court applied the wrong standard in evaluating laches as to at least one of the Native Americans, we remand the record for the district court to revisit this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The Lanham Trademark Act provides protection to trademark owners. <em>See generally </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127, 1141-1141n. To take advantage of many of its provisions, trademark owners must register their marks with the Patent and Trademark Office. Not all marks, however, can be registered. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052, the PTO must deny registration to certain types of marks, including those which, in subsection (a)\u2019s language, \u201cmay disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Another section, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3), provides that if a mark is registered in violation of section 1052(a), \u2019 \u201cany person who believes that he is or will be damaged by the registration\u201d may file a petition \u201c[a]t any time\u201d with the PTO to cancel the registration. This triggers a proceeding before the TTAB, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1067, which takes evidence and determines whether to cancel the mark. Yet another provision, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1069, states that \u201c[i]n all ... proceedings equitable principles of laches, estoppel, and acquiescence, where applicable may be considered and applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">This case concerns the registrations of six trademarks owned by Pro-Football, the corporate owner of the Washington Redskins football team, that include the word \u201cRedskin.\u201d The first \u2014 \u201cThe Redskins\u201d written in a stylized script \u2014 was registered in 1967, three more in 1974, another in 1978, and the sixth \u2014 the word \u201cRedskinettes\u201d \u2014 in 1990. Pro-Football uses all these marks in connection with goods and services related to its football team, including merchandise and entertainment services.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">In 1992, seven Native Americans petitioned for cancellation of the registrations, claiming that the marks had disparaged Native Americans at the times of registration and had thus been registered in violation of section 1052(a). Pro-Football defended its marks, arguing among other things that laches barred the Native <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Americans\u2019 claim. Rejecting this argument, the TTAB found laches inapplicable due to the \u201cbroader interest \u2014 an interest beyond the personal interest being asserted by the present petitioners \u2014 in preventing a party from receiving the benefits of registration where a trial might show that respondent\u2019s marks hold a substantial segment of the population up to public ridicule.\u201d <em>Harjo v. Pro Football Inc., </em>30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1828, 1831 (TTAB 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On the merits, the parties presented the TTAB with a variety of evidence, including (1) dictionary entries for \u201credskin,\u201d some of which contained usage labels identifying the term as offensive and others of which did not; (2) book and media excerpts from the late nineteenth century through the 1940s that used the term \u201credskin\u201d and portrayed Native Americans in a pejorative manner; (3) a study that found derogatory use of the term in Western-genre films from before 1980; (4) petitioners\u2019 testimony about their views of the term; (5) results from a 1996 survey of the general population and Native Americans that asked whether various terms, including \u201credskin,\u201d were offensive; (6) newspaper articles and game program guides from the 1940s onward using Native American imagery in connection with Washington\u2019s football team; and (7) testimony and documents relating to Native American protests, including one in 1972, aimed specifically at the team. In a lengthy opinion, the TTAB concluded that a preponderance of the evidence showed the term \u201credskin\u201d as used by Washington\u2019s football team had disparaged Native Americans from at least 1967 onward. <em>Harjo v. Pro-Football Inc., </em>50 U.S.P.Q.2d 1705 (TTAB 1999). The TTAB cancelled the registrations. Cancellation did not require Pro-Football to stop using the marks, but it did limit the team\u2019s ability to go after infringers under the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b), Pro-Football filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking reinstatement of its registrations on the grounds that: (1) laches barred the Native Americans\u2019 petition; (2) the TTAB\u2019s finding of disparagement was unsupported by substantial evidence; and (3) section 1052(a) violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution both facially and as applied by the TTAB. Although in suits challenging TTAB decisions parties may introduce new evidence in the district court, <em>see Material Supply Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Sunmatch Indus. Co., </em>146 F.3d 983, 989-90 (D.C.Cir.1998), in this case the only such evidence of note related to laches. After discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. Without reaching the constitutional issues, the district court granted summary judgment to Pro-Football on the alternate grounds that laches barred the Native Americans\u2019 petition and that the TTAB\u2019s conclusion of disparagement was unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo, </em>284 F.Supp.2d 96 (D.D.C.2003). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">An equitable doctrine, \u201c[Ijaches is founded on the notion that equity aids the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights.\u201d <em>NAACP v. NAACP Legal Def. &amp; Educ. Fund, Inc., </em>753 F.2d 131, 137 (D.C.Cir.1985). This defense, which Pro-Football has the burden of proving, <em>see Gull Airborne Instruments, Inc. v. Weinberger, </em>694 F.2d 838, 843 (D.C.Cir.1982), \u201crequires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 121-22, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>this case, the Native Americans contend both that the statute bars the defense of laches and that even were laches an available defense, Pro-Football has failed to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The Native Americans\u2019 statutory argument runs as follows: because section 1064(3) permits petitions alleging wrongful registration under section 1052(a) to be filed \u201c[a]t any time,\u201d laches is not a valid defense in cancellation proceedings. We disagree. The words \u201c[a]t any time\u201d demonstrate only that the act imposes no statute of limitations for bringing petitions. Those words have nothing to do with what equitable defenses may be available during cancellation proceedings. \u2022 Indeed, under the Native Americans\u2019 logic, equitable defenses would never be available as long as cancellation petitions are brought within the specified statute of limitations\u2014\u201c[a]t any time\u201d for petitions alleging wrongful registration under section 1052(a) or certain other grounds, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3)-(5), and \u201c[wjithin five years\u201d of registration for petitions brought for all other reasons, <em>see id </em>\u00a7 1064(1). This would make section 1069, which explicitly permits consideration of laches and other equitable doctrines, meaningless as to cancellation petitions. For this reason, we disagree with the Third Circuit\u2019s suggestion that laches is not an available defense to cancellation petitions brought pursuant to section 1064(3), <em>see Marshak v. Treadwell, </em>240 F.3d 184, 193-94 &amp; n. 4 (3d Cir.2001). Instead, we join the Federal Circuit, <em>see Bridgestone/Firestone Research, Inc. v. Auto. Club De L\u2019Ouest De La France, </em>245 F.3d 1359, 1360-61 (Fed.Cir.2001) (permitting the defense of laches to a cancellation petition brought under section 1064(3)), and our own district court, <em>see Pro-Football, Inc. v. Haiyo, </em>57 U.S.P.Q.2d 1140, 1145 (D.D.C.2000), in concluding that the statute does not bar the equitable defense of laches in response to section 1064(3) cancellation petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The Native Americans also offer several reasons why, in their view, the district court erred in its assessment of laches in this case. At this point, we need only consider one: their claim that the district court mistakenly started the clock for assessing laches in 1967\u2014the time of the first mark\u2019s registration\u2014for <em>all </em>seven Native Americans, even though one, Mateo Romero, was at that time only one year old.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We agree with the Native Americans that this approach runs counter to the well-established principle of equity that laches runs only from the time a party has reached his majority. The Supreme Court first embraced this principle in 1792, holding in a case dealing with conflicting 1761 land grants that <em>\u201claches </em>cannot ... be imputed\u201d as the \u201crights do not seem to have been abandoned; for in 1761, the children were infants, and were hardly of age, when this action was brought.\u201d <em>Gander\u2019s Lessee v. Bums, </em>4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 122, 1 L.Ed. 768 (1792). The Court has since held to this principle. <em>See Hoyt v. Sprague, </em>103 U.S. 613, 636-37, 26 L.Ed. 585 (1880) (evaluating laches \u201cafter [complainants] came of age\u201d); <em>Wetzel v. Minn. Ry. Transfer Co., </em>169 U.S. 237, 240, 18 S.Ct. 307, 42 L.Ed. 730 (1898) (acknowledging \u201cthat the minors were not affected by laches until they became of age\u201d); <em>cf. Wagner v. Baird, </em>48 U.S. (7 How.) 234, 242, 12 L.Ed. 681 (1849) (noting that equity makes allowances for \u201ccircumstances to account for [a party\u2019s] neglect, such as imprisonment, infancy, coverture, or by having been beyond seas\u201d); 2 Joseph Story, <em>Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence, as administered in England and America </em>844 n.(b) (photo, reprint 1988) (Melville M. Bigelow, ed., 13th ed. 1886) (stating that \u201c[i]t is not laches to wait until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>one is in a legal condition to sue\u201d); William MacPherson, <em>A Treatise on the Law Relating to Infants </em>338-39 (Philadelphia, John S. Littel 1843) (observing that \u201c[i]t is a maxim of law that laches is not to be imputed to an infant, because he is not supposed to be cognizant of his rights, nor capable of enforcing them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Pro-Football asserts that were we to apply this principle here, it \u201cwould logically mean that trademark owners could never have certainty, since a disparagement claim could be brought by an as yet unborn claimant for an unlimited time after a mark is registered.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 48. At the least, this assertion is overstated \u2014 only owners of those trademarks that may disparage a population that gains new members (as opposed to one that disparages, say, a single corporate entity, <em>see, e.g., Greyhound Corp. v. Both Worlds Inc., </em>6 U.S.P.Q2d 1635 (TTAB 1988)), would face such a prospect. But even if registrations of some marks would remain perpetually at risk, it is unclear why this fact authorizes \u2014 let alone requires \u2014 abandonment of equity\u2019s fundamental principle that laches attaches only to parties who have unjustifiably delayed in bringing suit. Pro-Football forgets that \u201claches is not, like limitation, a mere matter of time,\u201d <em>Holmberg v. Armbrecht, </em>327 U.S. 392, 396, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946) (internal quotation marks omitted), but rather turns on whether the party seeking relief \u201cdelayed inexcusably or unreasonably in filing suit\u201d in a way that was \u201cprejudicial\u201d to the other party, <em>Rozen v. District of Columbia, </em>702 F.2d 1202, 1203 (D.C.Cir.1983) (per curiam). Why should equity give more favorable treatment to parties that harm expanding numbers of people (in which case, under Pro-Football\u2019s theory, laches runs from the date of harm) than it gives to parties that harm only a few people (in which case laches runs from whenever those people are free of legal disabilities)? Why should equity elevate Pro-Football\u2019s perpetual security in the unlawful registration of a trademark over the interest of a Native American who challenged this registration without lack of diligence? Why should laches bar <em>all </em>Native Americans from challenging Pro-Football\u2019s \u201cRedskins\u201d trademark registrations because <em>some </em>Native Americans may have slept on their rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The fact that Pro-Football may never have security in its trademark registrations stems from Congress\u2019s decision not to set a statute of limitations and instead to authorize petitions for cancellation based on disparagement \u201c[a]t any time.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3). Congress knew perfectly well how to set statutes of limitations \u2014 as noted earlier, it required that petitions for cancellations on many other grounds be brought \u201c[w]ithin five years\u201d of registration, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1064(1) \u2014 but consciously declined to do so with respect to cancellation petitions based on disparagement. Indeed, Congress may well have denied companies the benefit of a statute of limitations for potentially disparaging trademarks for the very purpose of discouraging the use of such marks. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1065 (providing that marks \u201cshall be incontestable\u201d after five years <em>\u201c[ejxcept </em>on a ground for which application to cancel may be filed at any time under paragraphs (3) and (5) of section 1064\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>cf. In re Riverbank Canning Co., </em>25 C.C.P.A. 1028, 95 F.2d 327, 329 (1938) (noting that the \u201cfield is almost limitless from which to select words for use as trade-marks, and one who uses debatable marks does so at the peril that his mark may not be entitled to registration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Here, Romero has brought his own claim, and there is no reason why the laches of others should be imputed to him. In accordance with the context-specific ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>proach required by equity, the district court should have measured both his delay and the resulting prejudice to Pro-Football based on the period between his attainment of majority and the filing of the 1992 cancellation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">For several reasons, we prefer not to undertake our own analysis of Romero\u2019s laches. The district court never addressed this issue, the parties have briefed it minimally at best, and, most significantly, we may owe deference to the district court\u2019s assessment of laches. <em>Compare Daingerfield Island Protective Soc\u2019y v. Lujan, </em>920 F.2d 32, 38 (D.C.Cir.1990) (conducting abuse-of-discretion evaluation of laches in reviewing a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling), <em>with CarrAmerica Realty Coop. v. Kaidanow, </em>321 F.3d 165, 172 (D.C.Cir.2003) (conducting de novo evaluation of laches in reviewing a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling). Therefore, we shall remand the record for the district court to evaluate Romero\u2019s laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In assessing prejudice, the district court should address both trial and economic prejudice. As to trial prejudice, the court should consider the extent to which Romero\u2019s post-majority delay resulted in a \u201closs of evidence or witnesses supporting [Pro-Football\u2019s] position,\u201d <em>see Gull Airborne Instruments, </em>694 F.2d at 844. As to economic prejudice, we express no view as to how such prejudice should be measured where, as here, what is at stake is not the trademark owner\u2019s right to use the marks but rather the owner\u2019s right to Lanham Act protections that turn on registration. We encourage the district court to take briefing on whether economic prejudice should be measured based on the owner\u2019s investment in the marks during the relevant years, on whether the owner would have taken a different course of action\u2014 e.g., abandoned the marks \u2014 had the petitioner acted more diligently in seeking cancellation, or on some other measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">While retaining jurisdiction over the case, we remand the record to the district court for the purpose of evaluating whether laches bars Mateo Romero\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
