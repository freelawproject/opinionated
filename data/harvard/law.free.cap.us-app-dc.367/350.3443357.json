The appellants are farmers whose discrimination claims were denied in adjudications conducted pursuant to a Consent Decree and whose petitions for review of the adverse adjudications were rejected as untimely because they were filed after the stipulated deadlines that the parties negotiated and the court approved in a Stipulation and Order (S <em>&amp; </em>0). The appellants challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for relief from the stipulated deadlines under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) and the court\u2019s inherent equitable authority. Because the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">In 1997 a class of black farmers filed this action in the district court alleging racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On April 14, 1999 the district court entered the Consent Decree which established a two-track system for resolving the individual class members\u2019 claims. <em>Pigford v. Glickman, </em>185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C.1999), <em>affirmed, </em>206 F.3d 1212 (D.C.Cir.2000). Under Track A, a class member with little or no documentary evidence could submit his claim to an adjudicator and obtain payment of $50,000 and forgiveness of debt owed the Department if he proved discrimination by substantial evidence. Such a claimant \u201chas a fairly low burden of proof but his recovery is limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. Track B, by contrast, set no dollar cap on a claimant\u2019s recovery but the claimant must prove discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201ca higher burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A claimant in either track could file a petition for review of an adverse decision by the adjudicator with an independent monitor who \u201cshall direct the adjudicator to reexamine the claim if he determines that \u2018a clear and manifest error has occurred\u2019 that is \u2018likely to result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97 (quoting Consent Decree \u00b6 12(b)(iii), at 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Because the Consent Decree provided no timetable for seeking review by the monitor, the parties negotiated filing deadlines which are set out in the S &amp; O entered by the district court on July 14, 2000. Under the S &amp; O any claimant who had received an adverse adjudicator decision as of the date of the S &amp; O had 120 days from that date (i.e., by November 13, 2000) to file a petition with the monitor. Any claimant who received an adverse decision after the S &amp; O\u2019s date had 120 days from the date of the adjudication to file a petition. The S &amp; O expressly recites: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cNo extensions of these deadlines will be granted for any reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">On October 31, 2000 the claimants\u2019 class counsel filed a motion seeking to \u201credesign\u201d the \u201cunworkable\u201d petition filing process, noting that as of that date counsel had filed petitions on behalf of only 297 of the 3,873 claimants requesting filing assistance. Pis.\u2019 Mot. for Expedited Hearing at 7, 3-4 (filed Oct. 31, 2000). Following a conference with the parties the district court issued an order on November 8, 2000 directing that, in lieu of a completed petition for each of the claimants, counsel could satisfy the November 13, 2000 deadline by submitting a \u201cRegister of Petitions\u201d (Register) which simply listed the name and claim number of each claimant who had sought counsel\u2019s assistance in filing a petition for review of an adverse decision issued as of the S &amp; O date. <em>Pigford v. Glickman, </em>C.A. Nos. 97-1978, 98-1693, 2000 WL 34292618 (D.D.C. filed Nov. 8, 2000). The court explained that, while \u201ccounsel should be held to the commitments to which they agreed,\u201d nonetheless \u201ccounsel\u2019s failings should not be visited on their clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 4, 2000 WL 34292618, at *1. The court further directed that class counsel file 400 of the Register\u2019s petitions by December 15, 2000 and another 400 by the 15th of each month thereafter up to a final filing date of May 15, 2001. The order recited: \u201cUnder no circumstances shall the Monitor accept supporting materials or withdrawals after May 15, 2001.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 2000 WL 34292618, at *3. In effect, the court doubled the stipulated time to file a petition for review of an adjudication decided as of the date of the S &amp; O.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On March 15, 2001 the appellants filed a motion for an order suspending the May 15, 2001 deadline. The district court held a status conference and on April 27, 2001 issued an order directing \u201cthat all deadlines set forth in the Court\u2019s Order of November 8, 2000, are suspended until further order of the Court\u201d pending a scheduled meeting on May 1, 2001 between class counsel and outside lawyers \u201cwho might be able to assemble a team of <em>pro bono </em>lawyers to assist class counsel on an emergency basis.\u201d <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>144 F.Supp.2d 16, 20 (D.D.C.2001). In addition, the court ordered that if, after the May 1 meeting, class counsel decided additional time was necessary they should file a motion for extension no later than May 4, 2001 setting out a \u201crealistic\u201d filing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">After the <em>pro bono </em>meeting the appellants proposed extending the filing deadline to September 15, 2001 and the district court so ordered on May 15, 2001, finding the new deadline \u201cboth realistic and reasonable\u201d in light of the \u201cimpressive commitment made by <em>pro bono </em>counsel to assist Class Counsel.\u201d <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>143 F.Supp.2d 28, 30 (D.D.C.2001). The May 15, 2001 order warned that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances ... shall the Monitor accept supporting materials or withdrawals that are filed after September 15, 2001.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Class counsel, with <em>pro bono </em>assistance, succeeded in filling all of the remaining petitions by the new deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">On July 19, 2002 class counsel filed a motion seeking relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) or the court\u2019s inherent equitable authority on behalf of 387 claimants whose review petitions had been rejected as untimely. On June 2, 2003 the district court denied the motion, concluding there were no changed circumstances that justified modifying the S &amp; O deadlines (as amended). <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>265 F.Supp.2d 41 (D.D.C.2003). The claimants moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied on March 10, 2004. <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>307 F.Supp.2d 43 (D.D.C.2004). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The appellants comprise two groups of late-filing claimants: (1) those represented by class counsel, now numbering 92, and some 208 others who either proceeded <em>pro se </em>or were represented by lawyers unaffiliated with class counsel. Class counsel argues on behalf of each group that the district court erred in denying relief from the filing deadlines under either Rule 60(b)(5) or its inherent equitable power. We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to modify a consent order, either under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) or pursuant to its inherent authority, for abuse of discretion. <em>See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. 367, 389, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992) (Rule 60(b)); <em>Shepherd v. Am. Broad. Cos., </em>62 F.3d 1469, 1475 (D.C.Cir.1995) (inherent authority). We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellants\u2019 motion for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>A. Class Counsel Petitions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The district court denied the appellants\u2019 motion for relief as to the 92 petitions filed late by class counsel because the appellants failed to demonstrate \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d to warrant modifying the S &amp; O schedule under Rule 60(b)(5), which provides in relevant part: \u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (5) ... it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application .... \u201d The appellants challenge the court\u2019s Rule 60(b)(5) decision on two grounds. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">First, the appellants assert the district court incorrectly invoked Rule 60(b)(5) because the rule governs only orders that are final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellants contend that the S <em>&amp; </em>O was not a final order and that therefore the court should have decided whether to grant relief solely under its inherent equitable authority. <em>See Envtl. Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, </em>636 F.2d 1229, 1240 (D.C.Cir.1980) (\u201cThe power of a District Court sitting as a court of equity to modify the terms of a settlement agreement it previously adopted cannot be drawn into question.\u201d). As a practical matter, it makes little difference whether the district court resolved the motion under Rule 60 or under its equitable authority as the standard for each is. substantially the same. <em>Compare Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. 367, 393, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992) (under Rule 60(b)(5), \u201ca party seeking modification of a consent decree must establish that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision of the decree and that the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance\u201d), <em>with Envtl. Defense Fund, Inc, </em>636 F.2d at 1240 (\u201c[Sjound exercise of judicial discretion may require that terms of a consent decree be modified when there has been a significant change in the circumstances obtaining at the time the consent decree was entered.\u201d). Nonetheless, we conclude that the court correctly invoked Rule 60(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The appellants do not dispute that the Consent Decree itself is final within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5). <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 19. They contend, however, that because the S &amp; 0 simply \u201cestablishes] procedures for enforcing or implementing the decree,\u201d the S &amp; 0 is \u201cnot considered \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 60.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. W. Elec. Co., </em>777 F.2d 23 (D.C.Cir.1985); <em>Bogard v. Wright, </em>159 F.3d 1060 (7th Cir.1998)). The authorities the appellants cite do not support their position. In <em>Western Elec, </em>this court reviewed the district court\u2019s denial of a request for waiver from restrictions in a consent decree based on the district court\u2019s decision not to consider the merits of such a waiver request until a later time when \u201c \u2018there is substantial competition in local tele-communications service.\u2019 \u201d 777 F.2d at 25 (quoting <em>United States v. W. Elec. Co., </em>592 F.Supp. 846, 868 (D.D.C. 1984)). We explained that the district court\u2019s order denying the request was not \u201cfinal\u201d \u201cbecause the district court contemplated further proceedings before ruling on the requests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. Similarly in <em>Bogard, </em>the Seventh Circuit concluded that an order that extended the term of a monitor initially appointed for a three-year term \u201cunless extended by order of this court\u201d was not a final order because it had \u201cno termination date\u201d and therefore \u201c[t]he postjudgment proceeding could drag on for many years and involve a host of far-reaching orders the consequences of which could not be undone when (if ever) the postjudgment proceeding ended with a showing of compliance so complete that the monitor\u2019s services could be dispensed with.\u201d 159 F.3d at 1062-63. By contrast, the district court\u2019s S &amp; O fixed <em>final </em>deadlines for filing petitions with the monitor. <em>See </em>S &amp; O \u00b6 5, at 4 (\u201cNo extensions of these deadlines will be granted for any reason.\u201d). As with the Consent Decree, which the S &amp; O supplemented, no further court action was contemplated at the time the S &amp; O issued. That the S &amp; O was in fact subsequently modified by the court in response to the appellants\u2019 requests does not make it any less final. Such modification of a final order is precisely what Rule 60(b) contemplates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Next, the appellants contend that even if the S &amp; O is a final order subject to Rule 60(b), the district court abused its discretion in failing to modify the S &amp; O for changed circumstances. Again we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In the June 2, 2003 order denying the appellants\u2019 motion for relief, the district court rejected their contention that \u201cthe large volume of claimants requesting assistance with petitions during a short period of time\u201d constituted a changed circumstance because it \u201coccurred <em>before, </em>not after, the relevant deadlines were agreed to by the parties and endorsed by the Court.\u201d 265 F.Supp.2d at 46 (emphasis by court). The court explained: \u201cThe exponential increase in claimants was fully apparent when plaintiffs and defendant negotiated and agreed to the July 14, 2000 Stipulation and Order, including its clear provision that \u2018no extensions of these deadlines will be granted for any reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46 (quoting (S &amp; O \u00b6 5, at 4)). The appellants do not quibble with the court\u2019s analysis, <em>see </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 22, but contend the court abused its discretion by failing to grant relief based on four other changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>circumstances: (1) the unusually high number of claimants with meritorious grounds for review of them claim denials (caused by an unusually high rate of errors by the adjudicators); (2) the extreme work load borne by the two small class counsel firms because outside \u201cof counsels\u201d participated only \u201cminimally\u201d in the review petition filing (particularly after the court\u2019s March 8, 2001 ruling that attorney\u2019s fees for monitor review work not be available until after readjudication of reviewed claims produced a \u201cdisincentive to work on the monitor review process,\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 24); (3) the exhaustion of class counsel\u2019s funds and credit by March 2, 2001; and (4) the \u201cextra step\u201d created by the Register provision. It is no surprise that the district court did not address these four changed circumstances in its initial decision as the appellants raised them for the first time in their motion for reconsideration. <em>Compare </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Relief at 32-34 (filed July 19, 2002) <em>and </em>Pis.\u2019 Reply to Def.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to Mot. for Relief at 4-7 (filed Nov. 6, 2002) <em>with </em>Pis.\u2019 Mot. for Recons, at 9-16 (filed June 16, 2003). When the court addressed these newly raised circumstances in the reconsideration order, its response was admittedly brief: \u201cThe Court is well aware of the circumstances surrounding these petitions and further elaboration does not change this Court\u2019s opinion that plaintiffs have not demonstrated changed circumstances sufficient to justify modification of the Court\u2019s Orders under Rule 60(b)(5).\u201d 307 F.Supp.2d at 48. The court\u2019s brevity, however, is understandable given what had come before.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">To the extent the four new circumstances adversely affected the petition filing process, the court had already taken them into account and provided the appellants with relief. In response to class counsel\u2019s October 31, 2000 plea of an unexpectedly high volume of meritorious review petitions, the court modified the S &amp; O on November 8 to permit class counsel to satisfy the November 13, 2000 filing deadline through the simple Register listing, a remedy the appellants accepted without complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When class counsel sought relief in spring 2001 because of their depleted resources, both financial and human,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court granted a four-month extension until September 15, 2001, by which deadline all of the remaining petitions were .filed. Given the district court\u2019s repeated accommodation of class counsel\u2019s continuing delinquency, we cannot say the court abused its discretion in denying the appellants\u2019 motion for further relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The dissent contends the district court erred in two respects. First, it argues the court erred in relying on a finding of fact that the \u201ccritical changed circumstances\u201d occurred before the parties agreed to the deadline in the S <em>&amp; </em>O. Dissent at 24, 27. We perceive no such error. The court was correct when it found as a fact in its June 2, 2003 decision denying relief that \u201c[t]he exponential increase in <em>claimants </em>was fully apparent when plaintiffs and defendant negotiated and agreed to the July 14, 2000 Stipulation and Order,\u201d 265 F.Supp.2d at 47, as the appellants acknowledge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court was also correct when it stated in the June 2, 2003 order that \u201cthe critical \u2018changed circumstance\u2019 <em>on which plaintiffs rely </em>occurred <em>before, </em>not after, the relevant deadlines were agreed to by the parties and endorsed by the Court.\u201d 265 F.Supp.2d at 47 (first emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The appellants had argued at that stage that relief from the deadlines was warranted because of \u201c[t]he predominant change in circumstances, since the Consent Decree was approved in 1999,\u201d namely, that \u201cthe number of participants, with or without counsel, has increased 400-500%, overwhelming the system set up by the Consent Decree,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Reply to Def.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to Mot. for Relief at 4-5, plainly referring to the increased number of claimants. It is not at all surprising if, as the dissent notes, Dissent at 23, the court\u2019s June 2, 2003 order \u201cignored the key distinction argued by appellants in the motion for reconsideration\u201d of the order, which was filed on June 16, 2003. Further, as we noted <em>supra, </em>the court had already granted relief from the increase in meritorious petitions when it established the simplified Register procedure for meeting the November 13, 2000 filing deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Second, the dissent asserts the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to consider whether class counsel\u2019s failures to meet the deadlines amounted to an \u201cunforeseen obstacle warranting relief.\u201d Dissent at 27. The dissent relies on the court\u2019s decision in <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>292 F.3d 918 (D.C.Cir.2002) <em>(Pigford I), </em>for the proposition that \u201cwhere class members lack competent counsel, counsel\u2019s failure to meet deadlines itself may amount to an \u2018unforeseen obstacle\u2019 that makes the decree \u2018unworkable.\u2019 \u201d Dissent at 25 (quoting <em>Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 925). <em>Pigford I, </em>however, presented a different situation in two respects. First, contrary to the dissent\u2019s characterization, <em>Pigford I </em>did not present \u201cthe <em>same </em>issue of modification of deadlines\u201d as here, Dissent at 26 (emphasis by dissent), so as to implicate law of the case. In <em>Pigford I </em>the court modified the consent order to permit arbitrators to extend the deadlines for filing evidentiary materials in Track B litigation, set out in paragraph 10 of the Consent Decree, based on class counsel\u2019s \u201cmalpractice\u201d in the Track B litigation, namely, \u201cits inability to represent all Track B claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>adequately,\u2019 \u201d <em>Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 925 (quoting 182 F.Supp.2d at 52), as exemplified by one lawyer\u2019s failure to timely file a claimant\u2019s direct testimony with the arbitrator. Here, the appellants seek to modify the S &amp; O\u2019s Track A deadlines for filing review petitions under paragraph 12(b)(iii), relying on their repeated failures to meet the filing deadlines. Second, <em>Pigford I </em>came before us in a different posture. In that decision, we rejected the district court\u2019s determination that the consent decree could be interpreted to permit extending deadlines but affirmed the decision to extend deadlines based on the alternative ground, not addressed by the district court, that the decree could be so modified under Rule 60(b)(5) because counsel\u2019s failures amounted to changed circumstances warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(5). Because we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision, we were free to do so, as we did, on a ground not reached by the district court and without reviewing the district court\u2019s rationale. <em>EEOC v. Aramark Corp., </em>208 F.3d 266, 268 (D.C.Cir.2000) (\u201cAlthough the district court never addressed the safe harbor provision, the issue is fully briefed, and because we review the district court\u2019s judgment, not its reasoning, we may affirm on any ground properly raised.\u201d) (citing <em>Doe v. Gates, </em>981 F.2d 1316, 1321-22 (D.C.Cir.1993)). In this case, however, we review the district court\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to grant relief and \u201cmay overturn such an order only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Summers v. Howard Univ., </em>374 F.3d 1188, 1192 (D.C.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Computer Prof'ls for Soc. Responsibility v. U.S. Secret Serv., </em>72 F.3d 897, 903 (D.C.Cir.1996); <em>Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, </em>841 F.2d 1133, 1138 (D.C.Cir.1988)). Although the district court might have been warranted in modifying the deadlines based on class counsel\u2019s failure to meet deadlines, as we explained <em>supra, </em>the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so. For us to decide the question <em>sua sponte </em>or require the district court to do so as a matter of law, as the dissent suggests, would infringe on the district court\u2019s discretion and run counter to \u201cthe presumption of client accountability for attorney conduct\u201d which, as we confirmed in <em>Pigford I, </em>applies in class actions. <em>See Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\n<em>B.

The appellants further urged the court to apply the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard in exercising its inherent authority as well as the four factors the Third Circuit adopted under the standard in <em>Orthopedic, </em>namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">1) the danger of prejudice to the nonmovant; 2) the length of the delay and its potential effect on judicial proceedings; 3) the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant; and 4) whether the movant acted in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">246 F.3d at 322-23 (citing <em>Pioneer Inv.

The district court applied the Third Circuit\u2019s formulation and under the first and third factors found no excusable neglect warranting equitable relief because of the potential prejudice to the Department and the appellants\u2019 role in drafting the S &amp; O. The court concluded (1) that the government \u201c \u2018will \u201cbe prejudiced to the tune of almost one million dollars\u201d if the Court permits consideration of the late petitions and if even five percent of them are successful,\u2019 \u201d 307 F.Supp.2d at 50 (quoting <em>Pigford v.

In so concluding the court did not abuse its discretion. As the district court pointed out in the May 27, 2001 order suspending the deadlines: \u201cAs part of the bargain struck between the parties and approved by the Court in the Order of July 14, 2000, class counsel agreed to meet the 120 day deadline in return for the government\u2019s agreement to admit more than 1,100 Track A claimants into the class who otherwise would have been excluded.\u201d 144 F.Supp.2d at 19 n. 2. If the district court had granted the requested relief from the deadlines, the government would have lost the benefit of its bargain \u2014 certainty and finality as to its maximum liability as of the agreed upon date- \u2014 while the claimant class would have recovered the bargained-away right to compensation for claimants filing review petitions beyond the stipulated deadlines (as extended by the court).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The prejudice to the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>distinguishes this case from <em>In re Orthopedic </em>in which the court found the defendant would suffer no prejudice because the addition of claimants would have \u201cno effect on the amount [the defendant] would pay to those aggrieved by its products\u201d as its liability had been capped by a settlement agreement. 246 F.3d at 323. Here, because there is no cap, the expansion of the number of successful claimants (which would result from extending the deadline) will substantially expand the Department\u2019s monetary liability. <em>See id. </em>(noting consideration of prejudice there was \u201ca unique inquiry\u201d and expansion of plaintiff class \u201cin the ordinary class action will be to the detriment of the defendant\u201d); <em>cf.

The task has not been easy for a number of reasons, including the complications necessarily associated with ensuring relief to eligible class members and the deficiencies of class counsel, as determined by the district court. While the district court\u2019s efforts so far have ensured that only a small portion of the class will not have their claims for Monitor review considered, as a result of the court\u2019s decision today, the claims of 305 class members are Unduly extinguished: 97 farmers will lose the opportunity to have independent administrative review of their claims by a Monitor in accordance with the claims procedure in the consent decree, and 208 farmers (170 without counsel), who may not have received notice of the filing deadlines, will lose their opportunity to pursue their claims at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">In denying appellants\u2019 motion of July 19, 2002 for relief for these 305 class members, and the motions for reconsideration of June 13 &amp; 16, 2003, the district court clearly erred in relying on a finding of fact regarding the increased claims workload, and erred, alternatively, as a matter of law by failing to consider, in accordance with <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>292 F.3d 918 (D.C.Cir.2002) <em>(\u201cPigford I </em>\u201d), whether class counsel\u2019s untimely filings was a changed circumstance within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). It also erred by failing to inquire whether 208 claimants\u2019 late filings were due to the inadequacy of the notice procedures before determining whether to deny any relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b). Accordingly, while I concur in the holding that the July 14, 2000 Order establishing the original filing deadlines was a final appealable order, <em>see </em>Op. at 17, I would reverse and remand the case to the district court to determine whether the filing deadlines were \u201cunworkable,\u201d and thus warranting relief for 97 class members pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5), and to determine whether 208 class members failed to receive notice of the filing deadlines as a result of inadequate notice procedures and were entitled to relief under Rule 6(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">The question on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ing appellants\u2019 motions for an extension of the filing deadlines, and for reconsideration under Rule 60(b). <em>Evans v.

While our review is deferential, an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, fails to consider a relevant factor, or applies the wrong legal standard. <em>See In re Vitamins Antitrust Class Actions, </em>327 F.3d 1207, 1209 (D.C.Cir.2003); <em>Evans, </em>206 F.3d at 1298; <em>Marina Mgmt.

Such change need not be \u201cunforeseeable, but only unforeseen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 112 S.Ct. 748. The Supreme Court in <em>Rufo </em>explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag3\">Ordinarily ... modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree, [citations omitted] If it is clear that a party anticipated changing conditions that would make performance of the decree more onerous but nevertheless agreed to the decree, that party would have to satisfy a heavy burden to convince a court that it agreed to the decree in good faith, made a reasonable effort to comply with the decree, and should be relieved of the undertaking under Rule 60(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Pigford I, </em>the court held that changed circumstances may include \u201cunforeseen obstacles\u201d that make an order \u201cunworkable.\u201d <em>Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 925; <em>see Rufo, </em>502 U.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The district court found that the large increase in the number of claimants occurred <em>before </em>the deadlines in the July 14th Order were agreed to, and therefore did not amount to unanticipated \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d rendering the deadlines \u201cunworkable\u201d within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5). <em>See Pigford v. Veneman, </em>265 F.Supp.2d 41, 47 (D.D.C.2003), <em>reconsideration denied, Pigford v. Veneman, </em>307 F.Supp.2d 43 (D.D.C.2004). In so finding the district court, as does the court today, Op. at 19 - 20, ignored the key distinction argued by appellants in their motion for reconsideration and supported by evidence in the record. Appellants pointed out that the critical \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d was not the vastly greater number of <em>total </em>claimants, but the unanticipated large number of claimants seeking Monitor review because their claims likely had been denied erroneously in the first instance by the adjudicator, and had potentially meritorious grounds for seeking Monitor review. Appellants explained that class counsel originally had anticipated that the vast majority of would-be seekers of Monitor review would not meet the high standards for such review set forth in the consent decree \u2014 \u201cclear and manifest error\u201d that is \u201clikely to result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d Consent Decree \u00b6 12(b)(iii) \u2014 and therefore, at the time they agreed to the July 14th Order deadlines, had estimated that only approximately 2,500 petitions would require processing for Monitor review. However, class counsel subsequently discovered that a much higher number of the claims rejected by the adjudicator were potentially meritorious claims even under the high standard for Monitor review. In fact, the total vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ume of claims actually processed for Monitor review was much higher than 2,500: Class counsel and the of-counsel law firm Chestnut, Sanders ended up processing 3,700 Track A requests for Monitor review, with other firms processing other, smaller numbers of requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In support of this distinction, appellants pointed to the high success rates of claims upon Monitor review: The facilitator\u2019s report cited by appellants indicated that approximately 48% of the claimants who had filed for review with the assistance of counsel had been approved by the Monitor for reexamination by the adjudicator, and 100% of reexamined petitions prevailed on the merits. This statistical evidence substantiated class counsel\u2019s argument that many meritorious claims had been erroneously denied by the adjudicator, necessitating the filing of petitions for Monitor review and creating more work for class counsel than was anticipated when the July 14th Order deadlines were agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The record further indicates that the number of class members seeking Monitor review was unanticipated by either party or by the district court when the parties agreed to those deadlines. As noted, when the district court established the Register of Petitions process in the November 11, 2000 Order, class counsel was estimating a total of 2,500 petitions for Monitor review. The district court relied on this estimate to set the filing schedule for fully supported petitions. The November 11th Order further indicated that the higher volume of petitions for Monitor review was not anticipated, for the district court acknowledged that neither the Department nor the Monitor were prepared to handle and process the higher volume of petitions. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">It is obvious that if Class Counsel, Of Counsel and all unaffiliated counsel were forced to file thousands of fully supported Petitions by November 13, the government would be unable to respond to them in a meaningful way within the 60 days that it has to file a response, [citation omitted] Furthermore, the Monitor informed 'the Court at the hearing that even if the government had the resources to complete such a task, the Monitor initially will be unable to decide the Petitions at a pace greater than 200 to 300 each month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Indeed, the district court later acknowledged at the April 19, 2001 status conference that \u201csome of the failings of the lawyers, if we want to call them that, are simply because people were overworked. <em>There was much more to be done than ;people thought.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">In light of the record evidence that the high number of class members seeking Monitor review was unanticipated at the time the July 14th Order deadlines were agreed to, the district court clearly erred in relying on its finding in its opinion of June 2, 2003 that the \u201ccritical \u2018changed circumstance\u2019\u201d had \u201coccurred <em>before, </em>not after, the relevant deadlines were agreed to,\u201d in denying appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration in its opinion of March 19, 2004, Pigford, 307 F.Supp.2d at 48, without distinguishing between the overall number of claimants and the number of petitions for Monitor review. Instead, the district court denied reconsideration stating that, notwithstanding appellants\u2019 \u201cfurther elaboration,\u201d \u201cthe [c]ourt declines to revisit its determination that the asserted \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 presented by [appellants] do not justify modification of the [c]ourt\u2019s prior orders under Rule 60(b)(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the court states that the district court established the Register procedure to provide relief from the increased volume of meritorious petitions, Op. at 19, that relief created filing problems of its own and, in any event, the district court underestimated the volume of Monitor-review petitions even then.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Moreover, in denying appellants\u2019 motions, the district court failed to consider the instruction of <em>Pigford I </em>that where class members lack competent counsel, counsel\u2019s failure to meet deadlines itself may amount to an \u201cunforeseen obstacle\u201d that makes the decree \u201cunworkable\u201d under Rule 60(b)(5). <em>Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 925.

Veneman, </em>307 F.Supp.2d 51 (D.D.C.2004), but at a time when there was, as the district court stated, \u201cmuch more to be done than people thought,\u201d and the critical filing deadlines were drawing near, class counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>and of-counsel were in dire financial straits as a result of the lack of payment of interim fees by the government, as appellants reminded the district court in their motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court recognized at a status conference held on April 19, 2001 that the delay in awarding interim fees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMJ\">had an impact on the number of lawyers and the amount of time that those lawyers are spending <em>on the Monitor petition </em>process.... if you have to succeed or prevail to get paid, then getting new lawyers in the act would be hard, and I understand that it is also having an impact on the existing lawyers. [Class counsel] has cut back on [its] staff,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWC\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Today, by affirming the denial of appellants\u2019 motions, the court ignores our analysis in <em>Pigford I </em>and the duty of the trial judge to protect class members who do not chose their own counsel when unanticipated circumstances have created \u201ca situation where there were too many cases and too few lawyers.\u201d Br. for Appellants at 22. By declining to account for <em>Pigford </em>I\u2019s contrary holding as an infringement of the district court\u2019s discretion, Op. at 20, the court ignores that <em>Pigford I </em>involved the <em>same </em>unique history, the <em>same </em>consent decree, the <em>same </em>class counsel, and the <em>same </em>issue of modification of deadlines missed by class counsel under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) considered in the <em>same </em>court, and as such its holding is nearly akin to the law of the case, in addition to being law of the circuit. See <em>LaShawn A. v. Barry, </em>87 F.3d 1389, 1393, 1395 (D.C.Cir.1996) (en banc). That <em>Pig-ford I </em>involved claims under Track B rather than Track A does not change the fact that the legal issue before the court is the same: whether appellants are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5) for counsel\u2019s fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ures to meet filing deadlines. <em>See </em>Op. at 19-20. While the court points out that <em>Pigford I </em>acknowledged \u201cthe presumption of client accountability for attorney conduct,\u201d <em>id., </em>it ignores that <em>Pigford I </em>also found this presumption overcome because class counsel was not freely chosen by class members and the circumstances of the case, together with the terms of the decree, made retention of other lawyers \u201cunlikely.\u201d <em>Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 926. Here, the very same circumstances remain, and were further exacerbated by additional unanticipated circumstances which created \u201ca situation where there were too many cases and too few lawyers.\u201d Br. for Appellants at 22. This court cannot avoid, by pointing to \u201ca different procedural posture,\u201d Op. at 19, that the district court is bound, under <em>Pigford I, see LaShawn A., </em>87 F.3d at 1393, 1395, to separate class counsel\u2019s failings from the claims of the class members, particularly in light of the district court\u2019s affirmative duty to \u201crenew its stringent examination of the adequacy of class representation throughout the entire course of the litigation,\u201d <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litigation, </em>617 F.2d 22, 27 (3d Cir.1980), and that the district court\u2019s failure to do so is an abuse of discretion, <em>Evans, </em>206 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Finally, while the Secretary would distinguish <em>Pigford I </em>as concerned with extinguishing a class member\u2019s claim, <em>see Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 922, from the denial of an opportunity to seek Monitor review, from the perspective of the class member whose claim has been wrongfully denied, the effect is the same: Neither class member will have the opportunity to utilize the remedial process established in the consent decree. Taken together, the circumstances identified in appellants\u2019 motions suggest that the 97 class members should not bear the burden of counsel\u2019s failures to meet filing deadlines. In order to avoid a \u201cdouble betrayal\u201d of the class members, the district court was required to separate the failures of counsel from the claims of the class members in order to ensure that the opportunity to pursue the claims process established in the consent decree not be foreclosed. <em>Id. </em>at 927. It did not do so, and the court today fails to explain how the district court fulfilled its responsibilities in accordance with the analysis in <em>Pigford I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Because the district court, in denying the motion for reconsideration, erroneously relied on its finding in its opinion of June 2, 2003 that the \u201ccritical changed circumstance\u201d occurred before the July 14th Order deadlines were agreed to without taking into account record evidence demonstrating that the volume of petitions for Monitor review \u2014 the relevant change in circumstance \u2014 was not anticipated at the time the deadlines were agreed to, and in the alternative erred as a matter of law by failing to consider whether class counsel\u2019s failures to meet the deadlines amounted to an \u201cunforeseen obstacle\u201d warranting relief, I would reverse and remand the case to the district court to address whether the deadlines were \u201cunworkable\u201d under Rule 60(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Additionally, the district court failed to inquire whether adequate notice was provided to 208 class members, for whom appellants proffered evidence that these class members had not received notice of the filing deadlines for Monitor review, in determining whether relief was warranted under the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The July 14 Order modified the consent decree to limit the period within which class members could seek Monitor review of denied claims and, as the district court noted, it did not provide for individual notice to unsuccessful Track A class mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>bers. Instead, the July 14th Order required only that a copy of it be (1) posted in every USDA Farm Services Agency county office, and (2) sent by the facilitator to those persons who requested a claim sheet and election form. According to the Monitor\u2019s Report, \u201cfew people eligible to file a petition with the Monitor would have received direct notice of the 120-day deadline from the mailing,\u201d and many claimants would not see a posting in a USDA Farm Services Agency county office. <em>See </em>Monitor\u2019s Report to the Court Regarding Notice to the Class of the 120-Day Deadline to File a Petition for Monitor Review (May 30, 2003). The Monitor attempted to remedy the situation by mailing additional notices to farmers who had either requested or made telephonic inquiries regarding claim forms. Still, appellants proffered evidence that 208 class members had received no notice of the filing deadlines. <em>See, e.g., </em>Joint Appendix at 186; 218-233, 248, 254, 256, 258, 265, 268, 269, 286, 321; <em>id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Nonetheless, the district court denied relief under the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard of Rule 6(b). Applying the four-factor test of <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 398-99,113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993), the district court found first, that the government would be \u201cprejudiced to the tune of almost one million dollars\u201d by allowing consideration of late petitions if five percent were successful, and second, that \u201cbecause the [July 14th Order] deadlines were negotiated and agreed to by the [appellants], it logically follows that the resulting failure to meet those deadlines had been within the reasonable control of [appellants].\u201d Each finding is problematic given the district court\u2019s duty to ensure that adequate notice procedures were, in fact, established to provide class members with notice of filing deadlines. The district court made no finding that appellants were not proceeding in good faith or that there would be undue delay of the proceedings by granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The district court\u2019s finding of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the government is ironic. <em>See Pigford v. Glickman, </em>185 F.R.D. 82, 95 (D.D.C.1999); <em>see also Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 927. In approving the consent decree, the district court observed that \u201cthe settlement is a fair resolution of the claims brought in this ease and a good first step towards assuring that the kind of discrimination that has been visited on African American farmers <em>since Reconstruction </em>will not continue into the next century.\u201d <em>Pigford, </em>185 F.R.D. at 86 (emphasis added). The July 14th Order deadlines were not imposed in order to limit the government\u2019s liability as such, but rather, according to the district court, to bring closure to the process through fair procedures that would identify the number of class members seeking Monitor review. Moreover, the dollar amount of prejudice claimed by the Secretary represents 0.04% of the estimated settlement, <em>see Pigford, </em>206 F.3d at 1244, and 0.125% of the amount actual paid out by the government at that time. This court, in turn, mistakenly relies on the Secretary\u2019s argument that class counsel\u2019s agreement that the July 14th Order deadlines would not be extended was the <em>quid pro quo </em>for its agreement to admit other Track A claimants into the class who would otherwise have been excluded. <em>See </em>Op. at 21 - 22; Br. for the Appellee at 24. This is not the analysis adopted by the district court in denying appellants\u2019 motions; instead, the district court addressed that <em>quid pro quo </em>in imposing monetary sanctions on class counsel in a separate order, <em>see Pigford v. Veneman, </em>144 F.Supp.2d 16, 19 n. 2 (D.D.C.2001), which is not on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The district court\u2019s second finding, that the failure to meet the deadlines was within the farmers\u2019 control because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>agreed to the July 14th Order deadlines, is clearly erroneous because it ignored the threshold question of whether the agreed-to notice provisions ensured that adequate notice would be provided to class members, many proceeding <em>pro se, </em>whose claims had been denied by the adjudicator. The fact that class counsel agreed to the notice procedures did not discharge the district court\u2019s obligation to ensure notice was directed in a reasonable manner. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1)(B); <em>Doe v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov\u2019t, </em>407 F.3d 755, 761 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Pigford I, </em>292 F.3d at 926 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4)). Once the Monitor determined that the notice procedures were inadequate and appellants proffered evidence that 208 class members claimed not to have received notice, the district court had a duty to inquire whether the notice procedures were adequate in fact. In an analogous context, the Second Circuit pointed out that the district court has \u201cthe inherent power and duty to protect unnamed, but interested persons,\u201d <em>Zients v. LaMorte, </em>459 F.2d 628, 630 (2d Cir.1972), and although the notice procedures in the settlement agreement were complied with, the Second Circuit reversed the exclusion of claims filed late due to the lack of actual notice, <em>id. </em>As the Third Circuit observed, the district court\u2019s equitable powers under Rule 23 \u201care retained by the court until the settlement fund is actually distributed.\u201d <em>In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>246 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Whether the prejudice to the government outweighed other considerations could not be determined by the district court until it first determined \u2014 -in light of the proffered evidence that the agreed-to notice procedures were inadequate for 208 class members- \u2014 the adequacy of the agreed-to notice procedures, and whether the late filings were the result of inadequate notice. Only then could the district court determine whether the 208 class members were entitled to relief under Rule 6(b). Therefore, I would reverse and remand the case for the district court to determine the adequacy of the notice procedures and whether the 208 class members were entitled to relief. <em>See Pigford I, 292 </em>F.3d at 925-27; <em>In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>246 F.3d at 321-29; <em>Zients, </em>459 F.2d at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part II of the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. <em>See In re Wireless Tel. Fed. Cost Recovery Fees Litig., </em>396 F.3d 922, 932 (8th Cir.2005) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)); <em>In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>246 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir.2001); <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>617 F.2d 22, 27 (3d Cir.1980); <em>Zients v.

While the district court noted that these cases involved earlier stages of class action proceedings, it failed to articulate any reason why this principle would not apply at the remedial stages of class action proceedings. <em>See Pigford, </em>307 F.Supp.2d 43, 50 (D.D.C.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\">. Six months before the November filing deadline, the motion of May 8, 2000 for an interim award of attorneys' fees, costs and expert fees filed by class counsel and certain of-counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">It is now nearly three years since this case began. During this time the firms incurred crushing expense. For example, [class counsel] Conlon, Frantz incurred substantial obligations \u2014 borrowing $1,000,000 simply to remain solvent. Mr. Pires was not paid for over 15 months. He obtained multiple mortgages to pay his personal expenses .... [The Of-counsel law firm of] Chestnut, Sanders was forced by the scope of the litigation to borrow $1 million, hire new employees and cut partner salaries by 60%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On August 4, 2000, the district court, acknowledging \"the dire financial straits in which several firms affiliated with class counsel currently find themselves,\" ordered an immediate preliminary award to counsel of $7 million, which covered only previously incurred costs and amounted to less than one-half the cumulative loadstar amount of $14,582,703. Although, in response to class counsel's motion for an extension of the July 14th Order deadlines, the district court set up the Register of Petitions process in November 2000, counsel still missed filing deadlines. When the parties' attempt, at the district court's suggestion, to resolve their differences regarding counsel's May 8th request fees and costs proved unsuccessful, on January 12, 2001 class counsel, of-counsel, and one counsel moved for additional interim fees alleging \"significant hardship\" as a result of continued financing of implementation of the Consent Decree, without the regular payment of fees, through bank loans to cover staff salaries and expenses. A further payment of interim fees and costs was ordered on March 8, 2001, well after the filing deadlines, and still, because of the government's resistence, class counsel did not receive any payment until July 2001, of $14.9 million, <em>see Pigford </em>v. <em>Veneman, </em>369 F.3d 545 (D.C.Cir.2004); a further payment of $500,000 was ordered on December 2, 2002, <em>Pigford v. Veneman, </em>239 F.Supp.2d 68, 71 (D.D.C.2003). The delay in approving payment and the delay in actual receipt of interim fees by class counsel are ignored by the court in discussing the district court's \"repeated .accommodation of class counsel\u2019s continuing delinquency.\u201d Op. at 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
