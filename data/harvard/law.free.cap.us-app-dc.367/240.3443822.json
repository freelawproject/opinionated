Norton, </em>298 F.Supp.2d 68 (D.D.C.2003) <em>(NAHB). </em>The lawsuit revolves around the FWS\u2019s promulgation of a survey protocol, first in 1999 and again in revised form in 2000 (together, Protocols), that provides a methodology for the detection of an endangered subspecies of butterfly in certain areas of southern California. Before the district court, Home Builders asserted violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531 <em>et seq., </em>arguing that the FWS failed to comply with those statutes\u2019 notice and comment provisions. The district court dismissed the claims for lack of jurisdiction. <em>NAHB, </em>298 F.Supp.2d at 80. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-19\">The ESA provides \u201ca means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b). Under section four of the ESA, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) must promulgate regulations that list species deemed \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d due to, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cpresent or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>its habitat or range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1533(a)(1)(A), \u00a9}(1); <em>see also Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 157-58, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary is further charged with developing and implementing a \u201crecovery plan\u201d for the \u201cconservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1533(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Once a species is designated \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened,\u201d the ESA provides a variety of protections, including a prohibition on \u201ctake\u201d of the species. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1538(a)(1). \u201cTake\u201d is a term uniquely defined by the ESA to mean: \u201cto harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect\u201d the listed species. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1532(19). Following the statutory labyrinth one step deeper, regulations passed pursuant to the ESA define \u201charm\u201d as used in the definition of \u201ctake\u201d to include \u201csignificant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.3; <em>see also, generally, Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Redefinition of \u201cHarm,\u201d </em>46 Fed. Reg. 54,748 (1981). Thus, a landowner can effect a take of an endangered species, subjecting himself to liability under the ESA, if he alters the habitat of an endangered species in a manner that causes death or injury to a member of the species. The ESA establishes civil and criminal penalties for any person who unlawfully takes an endangered species. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540. In addition to more traditional enforcement mechanisms using federal and state personnel, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1540(e), the ESA contains a \u201ccitizen suit\u201d provision that permits a private party to seek injunctive relief against any landowner \u201calleged to be in violation\u201d of the ESA, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1540(g)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Section 10 of the ESA does permit landowners and other non-federal entities to obtain a permit to \u201ctake\u201d a listed species \u201cif such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1539(a)(1)(B). To obtain such a permit, the landowner must demonstrate to the Secretary through a documented conservation plan that the owner will, <em>inter alia, </em>minimize the impact of the taking and that the \u201clikelihood of the survival and reeovei\u2019y of the species\u201d will not be diminished by the taking. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv). In addition, the ESA authorizes the grant of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201crecovery\u201d permit, which enables a researcher to engage in actions \u201cfor scientific purposes\u201d that could result in a taking. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1539(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The quino checkerspot butterfly (Quino) is a small butterfly native to southwestern California and northwestern Mexico. The Quino was listed as an endangered species on January 16, 1997. <em>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Endangered Status for the Laguna Mountains Skipper and the Quino Checkerspot Butterfly </em>(Euphydryas editha quino), 62 Fed.Reg. 2313 (1997) (Listing Rule). Once abundant, only seven or eight known colonies of Quino remain in the United States, all in Riverside and San Diego counties in California. <em>Id. </em>at 2315. The primary suspected cause of the loss of the species is the destruction of Quino habitat through development, grazing and fragmentation. <em>Id. </em>at 2317-2319. <em>See also Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Critical Habitat for the Quino Checkerspot Butterfly </em>(Euphydryas editha quino), 67 Fed.Reg. 18,356, 18,359 (2002) (Critical Habitat Designation). Quino require a very particular habitat to survive, owing in part to their reliance on specific host plants during the larval life stage. Listing Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 2314. The Quino live as adult butterflies only for a period of roughly four to eight weeks. <em>Id. </em>The wingspan of an adult Quino measures a mere one inch. <em>Id. </em>Their flight season lasts from mid-January until late April, but peaks in March and April. <em>Id. </em>Quino do not fly in adverse weather conditions such as rain or wind, however, which, combined with their short lifespan and small size, can make detection difficult. The FWS issued its first guidance for detecting the Quino several months after listing the butterfly as fully protected by the ESA. <em>See </em>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Interim General Survey Protocols and Mitigation Guidelines for the Endangered Quino Checkerspot Butterfly (November 4, 1997) (Interim Protocol).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Based on information gathered during the 1998 field season, as well as consultation with scientists and species experts, the FWS revised the Interim Protocol and promulgated the \u201cSurvey Protocol for the Endangered Quino Checkerspot Butterfly <em>(Euphydryas editha </em>quino) for the 1999 Field Season\u201d (1999 Protocol), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 87-111, on January 25, 1999. The FWS did not, however, engage in formal notice and comment proceedings in drafting the 1999 Protocol. On February 1, 1999, a notice of availability for the 1999 Protocol was published in the Federal Register.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Notice of Availability of a Recommended Survey Protocol for the Endangered Quino Checkerspot Butterfly </em>(Euphydryas editha quino) <em>for the 1999 Field Season, </em>64 Fed.Reg., 4890 (1999) (1999 Notice of Availability). The notice of availability referred to the 1999 Protocol in both its title and text as \u201crecommended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also provided an address where \u201ccomments,\u201d \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cmaterials concerning the survey protocol\u201d could be sent for the FWS\u2019s consideration during the development of a revised protocol for the 2000 field season. <em>Id. </em>The text of the 1999 Protocol identified on a map attached to the 1999 Protocol as Appendix B \u201careas with no potential for Quino, with potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>habitat where adult surveys may be necessary of [sic] suitable habitat occurs on a site, and with Quino habitat where adult surveys should be conducted.\u201d 1999 Protocol at 1 &amp; App. B, <em>reprinted, in </em>J.A. at 90, 98. It recommended, but did not mandate, habitat assessment in areas designated by the FWS as Potential Habitat Areas and adult surveys in the Adult Focused Survey Areas or if a habitat assessment indicated suitable Quino habitat. <em>Id. </em>The 1999 Protocol stipulated that in order to avoid take of the species, adult surveys \u201cmust be conducted by a biologist possessing a recovery permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the [ESA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 90; <em>see </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The FWS published a revised protocol in the year 2000. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Quino Checkerspot Butterfly (Eu<em>phydryas editha </em>quino) Year 2000 Survey Protocol (2000 Protocol), <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 112-21. Again, a notice of availability regarding the \u201crecommended survey protocol for the 2000 field season\u201d was published in the Federal Register. <em>Notice of Availability of a Recommended Year 2000 Sui~vey Protocol for the Endangered Quino Checkerspot Butterfly </em>(Euphydryas editha quino), 65 Fed.Reg. 8188 (2000) (2000 Notice of Availability). The revisions were based on information derived from public workshops, the input of a new \u201crecovery team,\u201d the development of the recovery plan, the 1999' survey reports and public comments. 2000 Protocol at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 113. The 2000 Protocol provides substantially more detail regarding survey methodology than the 1999 Protocol did. <em>Compare </em>1999 Protocol at 1-4, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 90-93, <em>with </em>2000 Protocol at 2-6, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 114-118. As with the 1999 Protocol, however, the FWS describes the 2000 Protocol as merely \u201crecommended\u201d except for \u201crequirements for biologists conducting quino butterfly surveys under recovery permits.\u201d 2000 Protocol at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 113. Both Protocols also warn that \u201csurveys may not be considered valid if ... the specific survey methods described above are not followed.\u201d 2000 Protocol at 6, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 118; <em>see also </em>1999 Protocol at 4, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Home Builders, a non-profit advocacy group that represents individuals and companies in the residential construction industry, filed suit in federal district court, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the 1999 and 2000 Protocols constituted a \u201crule\u201d subject to the notice and comment provisions of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. Thus, according to Home Builders, in promulgating the Protocols the FWS exceeded its authority under the ESA by failing to comply with section 553 of the APA and section 4(b)(4) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(4) (incorporating APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements with respect to \u201cany regulation promulgated to carry out the purposes\u201d of the ESA). Compl. 13-25. In <em>NAHB, </em>the district court dismissed the suit at the summary judgment stage, holding that the Protocols did not constitute \u201cfinal agency action\u201d and thus the court lacked jurisdiction under sections 702 and 704 of the APA. 298 F.Supp.2d at 79. Specifically, the court found that the Protocols did not satisfy the finality test established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997), because \u201cthe Protocols do not determine rights or obligations of landowners and legal consequences do not flow from them.\u201d <em>NAHB, </em>298 F.Supp.2d at 76.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Home Builders timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. v. Thompson, </em>355 F.3d 690, 693 (D.C.Cir.2004). The APA authorizes judicial review of \u201c[a]gency action made renewable by statute and <em>final agency action </em>for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (emphasis added). There exists no statutory review provision in the ESA that authorizes judicial review of agency action beyond that provided for in the APA. <em>See Cabinet Mountains Wilderness/Scotchman\u2019s Peak Grizzly Bears v. Peterson, </em>685 F.2d 678, 685 (D.C.Cm.1982). Thus, an agency action must be final in order to be judicially renewable. <em>See, e.g., Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>396 F.3d 1152, 1165 (D.C.Cir.2005) (\u201cAPA ... bars review prior to final agency action.\u201d); <em>Indep. Petroleum Ass\u2019n of Am. v.

If the agency action is not final, the court ... cannot reach the merits of the dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting DRG Funding Corp. v. Sec\u2019y of Housing &amp; Urban Dev., </em>76 F.3d 1212 (D.C.Cir.1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The Supreme Court has established a two-part test to determine when an agency action is reviewable as \u201cfinal.\u201d First, the action under review \u201cmust mark the \u2018consummation\u2019 of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process \u2014 it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 177-78, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997) <em>(citing Chicago &amp; S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 437, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948)). Second, the action must \u201cbe one by which \u2018rights or obligations have been determined,\u2019 or from which \u2018legal consequences will flow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bennett, </em>520 U.S. at 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154 <em>(quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 62, 71, 91 S.Ct. 203, 27 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>203 (1970)). The Protocols at issue in this case clearly marked the consummation of the decisionmaking process. The Protocols were published after the FWS solicited input from specialists and reviewed data from past field seasons. 1999 Protocol at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 90; 2000 Protocol at 2, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 114. A notice of availability was published each year in the Federal Register. 1999 Notice of Availability, 64 Fed.Reg. at 4890; 2000 Notice of Availability, 65 Fed.Reg. at 8180. Ongoing revisions to the Protocols based on new data and feedback from interested parties do not negate finality. <em>See United States Air Tour Ass\u2019n. v. FAA, </em>298 F.3d 997, 1013 (D.C.Cir.2002). Thus, the pivotal issue is whether the 1999 and 2000 Protocols published by the FWS are documents \u201cby which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>520 U.S. at 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Home Builders asserts three arguments to support its view that the Protocols impose legal obligations. It first claims that the Protocols are binding on their face. This argument fails to pass muster. The Protocols are consistently referred to in agency documents as \u201crecommended,\u201d rather than mandatory. <em>See, e.g., </em>1999 Notice of Availability, 64 Fed. Reg. at 4890 (referring to 1999 Protocol as \u201crecommended\u201d in both title and text); 2000 Notice of Availability, 65 Fed.Reg. at 8188 (same); 1999 Protocol at I, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 88 (protocol \u201crecommended\u201d); 2000 Protocol at 3, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 114 (protocol surveys \u201crecommended\u201d). Moreover, in a letter from the FWS Director to several members of the Congress, the agency stated that the \u201csurvey protocol does not contain any prohibitions or restrictions on land development, nor should the protocol be interpreted as such.\u201d Letter from Clark to Calvert at 1 (Apr. 16, 1999). An agency\u2019s past characterization of its own action, while not decisive, is entitled to respect in a finality analysis. <em>See Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944) (agency opinion constitutes \u201cbody of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance\u201d); <em>see also Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (opinion letters entitled to respect under <em>Skidmore </em>\u201cto the extent those interpretations have the power to persuade\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). <em>But cf. Appalachian Power Co. v. Envt\u2019l Prot. Agency, </em>208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C.Cir.2000) (disregarding \u201cboilerplate\u201d non-final action language in guidance document). Despite some mandatory language in the Protocols regarding how the survey should be conducted in order to maximize accuracy and minimize incidental take of the species (\u201cButterfly surveys may only be conducted by a biologist possessing a current recovery permit,\u201d 2000 Protocol at 2, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 113), neither the 1999 nor the 2000 Protocol contains any language compelling a landowner to conduct a survey at all. \u201cProtocol surveys,\u201d according to the FWS, merely \u201care <em>recommended </em>for all sites partially or completely within ... survey areas.\u201d 2000 Protocol at 2, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Given the voluntary nature of the language contained in the Protocols, it is futile for Home Builders to argue that the Protocols are binding on their face. Home Builders goes on to argue, however, that the Protocols constitute final agency action because in practice they have a coercive effect on both landowners and local governments, in effect compelling compliance with the Protocols in order to avoid prosecution for unlawful take of the species. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24-35. Finality resulting from the practical effect of an ostensibly non-binding agency proclamation is a concept we have recognized in the past. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Envt\u2019l Prot. Agency, </em>290 F.3d 377, 383 (D.C.Cir.2002) (\u201cif the language of the document is such that private parties can rely on it as a norm or safe harbor by which to shape their actions, it can be binding as a practical matter\u201d); <em>McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, </em>838 F.2d 1317, 1321 (D.C.Cir. 1988) (agency action, though facially nonbinding, \u201ccreated a norm with present day binding effect\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, if the practical effect of the agency action is not a certain change in the legal obligations of a party, the action is non-final for the purpose of judicial review. <em>See DRG Funding Corp. v. Sec\u2019y of Housing and Urban Dev., </em>76 F.3d 1212, 1214 (D.C.Cir.1996) (agency order non-final that \u201cdoes not itself adversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we have held that \u201c[practical consequences, such as the threat of having to defend itself in an administrative hearing should the agency actually decide to pursue enforcement, are insufficient to bring an agency\u2019s conduct under our purview.\u201d <em>Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass\u2019n v. Envt\u2019l Prot. Agency, </em>372 F.3d 420 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">There is nothing in the record to support Home Builders\u2019 claim that the Protocols could affect the outcome of an enforcement proceeding. Just as compliance with the Protocols does not provide a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from prosecution, <em>Gen. Elec., </em>290 F.3d at 383, failure to comply does not change the legal burden placed on the government (or on a private party in a citizen suit) in a suit for injunctive relief: the enforcing party must convince the court that \u201cthe alleged activity has actually harmed the species or ... will actually, as opposed to potentially, cause harm to the species.\u201d <em>Am. Bald Eagle v. Bhatti, </em>9 F.3d 163, 166 (1st Cir.1993). The results of the suivey, the decision to conduct a site assessment but not a survey, the failure to perform either, or any other course of action by the landowner would constitute just one piece of the evidence necessary to obtain an injunction. At the time of any enforcement proceeding, the landowner can challenge the soundness of the Protocols\u2019 methodology, <em>Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Fed. Power Comm\u2019n, </em>506 F.2d 33, 39 (D.C.Cir.1974) (methodology \u201csubject to complete attack\u201d), and to demonstrate that no take is likely to result from his actions. <em>AT &amp; T v. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>270 F.3d 973, 976 (D.C.Cir. 2001) (Agency guidance \u201chas force only to the extent the agency can persuade a court to the same conclusion.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the ESA has not brought any enforcement action against a landowner for failing to comply with the Protocols. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Thus, in the absence of any record evidence to the contrary, it appears that the scope of a landowner\u2019s liability under section nine of the ESA remains exactly as it was before the Protocols\u2019 publication: a complete prohibition on \u201ctake\u201d of any endangered species. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1538(a)(1)(B); <em>see Indep. Equip. Dealers, </em>372 F.3d at 428 (agency action \u201cleft the world just as it found it, and thus cannot be fairly described as implementing, interpreting, or prescribing law or policy\u201d); <em>Reliable Automatic Sprinkler Co. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n, </em>324 F.3d 726, 732 (D.C.Cir.2003) (Agency action not reviewable if action does not \u201cimpos[e] any obligation..., deny[] any right..., or fix[ ] any legal relationship.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Home Builders\u2019 argument that the Protocols exert a coercive effect on local governments is likewise unavailing. Home Builders asserts that local permitting agencies have adopted the Protocols to guard against their own potential liability under section nine of the ESA. <em>See, e.g., Strahan v. Coxe, </em>127 F.3d 155, 164 (1st Cir.1997) (state regulatory scheme constituted \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d of section nine of ESA); <em>United States v. Town of Plymouth, </em>6 F.Supp.2d 81, 91 (D.Mass.1998) (inadequate shoreline management \u201charmed\u201d protected species).- Drawing on <em>Appalachian Power, </em>Home Builders characterizes this case as one in which the agency action \u201cleads private parties or State permitting authorities to believe that it will declare permits invalid unless they comply with the terms of the document.\u201d 208 F.3d at 1021. Yet in <em>Appalachian Power </em>we were addressing a very different statutory scheme from the one at issue here. <em>Appalachian Power </em>involved the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401 <em>et seq., </em>which establishes an intricate permitting process that involves federal review of state operating permits. <em>See Appalachian Power, </em>208 F.3d at 1017. The FWS does not have comparable authority under the ESA to \u201cdeclare permits invalid,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1021. Furthermore, while the record demonstrates that Riverside and San Diego counties have adopted the 1999 Protocol as part of their building permit process, there is no evidence that helps to reveal the local officials\u2019 reason for doing so, much less evidence that local officials were coerced by the FWS. While the FWS did issue a letter to the City of Thousand Oaks, California in response to a draft environmental impact report for a proposed golf course in which it noted that the location of the golf course was within a potential habitat area for Quino, Letter from Noda to Smith (Feb. 22, 1999), such warning is within the authority of the FWS under section nine of the ESA. <em>Marbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, </em>83 F.3d 1068, 1074 (9th Cir.1996). Thus, the record is inadequate to support a finding that the Protocols have the practical effect of binding interested parties to their terms. <em>Gen. Elec. Co., </em>290 F.3d at 383; <em>McLouth Steel, </em>838 F.2d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Home Builders\u2019 third argument is that the Protocols constitute final agency action because they cabin the agency\u2019s discretion. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 36. In <em>Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v. Young, </em>818 F.2d 943 (D.C.Cir. 1987), this court concluded that an FDA action level for alfatoxins in corn was a substantive rule because the language of the action level resulted in a \u201ccabining of [the] agency\u2019s prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948. The language of the Protocols at issue here is not nearly as severe as that in <em>Community Nutrition. </em>The regulation in <em>Community Nutrition </em>stated that \u201can action level ... may be established to define the level of contamination at which food <em>will be deemed to be adulterated.\u201d Id. </em>at 947 (emphasis in original). The FDA had also made statements that any shipment exceeding the stated toxin level would <em>\u201cbe considered adulterated and sub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>ject to condemnation.\" Id. </em>at 948 (emphasis in original). No such binding language appears in either of the Protocols. Nonconforming surveys may be accepted. 2000 Protocol at 6. Conforming surveys may also be rejected through the \u201cfalse negative\u201d designation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There have been no enforcement actions that indicate whether the FWS considers itself bound by survey results. Thus, there is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that either of the Protocols binds the agency sufficiently to make it a substantive rule under the reasoning of <em>Community Nutrition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\">. Home Builders' lawsuit originally named Bruce Babbitt and James Clark as defendants in their official capacities as Secretary of the Interior and Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, respectively.

Williams, current FWS Director, have been automatically substituted as parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\">. The ESA also authorizes the Secretary to designate a certain geographical area as \"critical habitat.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(a)(3). Critical habitat is defined as land \u201cessential for the conservation of the species.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1532(5)(A)(ii). A critical habitat designation under section four affects the obligations of federal agencies under section seven of the ESA, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1536, but does not alter the scope of an individual\u2019s potential liability under section nine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1538, which extends beyond land specifically designated as critical habitat. <em>Compare id. </em>\u00a7 1536(a)(2) (\"Each Federal agency shall ... insure that any [agency action] is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary ... to be critical....\u201d) <em>with </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.3 (establishing liability under section nine if an individual's action causes \"significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife\u201d). \"The designation of critical habitat has no effect on non-Federal actions taken on private land, even if the private land is within the mapped boundary of designated critical habitat.\u201d <em>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Designation of Critical Habitat for the Cactus Feiruginous Pygmy-owl </em>(Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum) 64 Fed.Reg. 37,419, 37,428 (1999). That there is some overlap between section nine and section seven of the ESA \"is unexceptional and simply reflects the broad purpose of the Act.\u201d <em>Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon, </em>515 U.S. 687, 703, 115 S.Ct. 2407, 132 L.Ed.2d 597 (1995) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">.

Because we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the Protocols do not constitute final agency action necessary to confer jurisdiction under the APA and the ESA, we express no opinion on the standing and ripeness issues discussed by the district court and raised in the parties' briefs. <em>See N.J. Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>393 F.3d 219, 221 (D.C.Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. \"Agency action\u201d is defined by the APA as \"the whole or part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(13). The FWS and Interior argue that \" the term [agency action] is not so all-encompassing as to authorize ... judicial review over everything done by an administrative agency,\u2019 \u201d and that the Protocols at issue in this case do not meet the statutory definition of \"agency action.\u201d Appellee's Br. at 21 <em>(quoting Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass\u2019n v. EPA, </em>372 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C.Cir.2004) (omission in brief)). Home Builders counters that the Protocols are \"rules\" within the APA\u2019s definition of \"agency action.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16-17. A \"rule\u201d is defined as \"the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4). Courts have struggled to classify documents such as the Protocols here. <em>See, e.g., Syncor Int\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>127 F.3d 90, 93-94 (D.C.Cir. 1997) (citing cases discussing difficulty in distinguishing between \"guidance\u201d documents and rules). Because we find the issue of finality dispositive on the question of jurisdiction, we need not decide whether each Protocol constitutes a \"rule\u201d as defined by the APA. Moreover, we express no opinion on whether the Protocols might constitute a procedural or substantive rule for purposes of the APA's notice and comment provisions. <em>Compare </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)( 1 )-(3), \u00a9, (d) (requiring notice and comment proceedings to promulgate rule) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 553(b)(A) (exempting \"interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\u201d from notice and comment requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-4\">. The Ninth Circuit confronted an analogous situation with respect to the Incidental Take Permit (ITP), a statutorily-authorized permit issued by the FWS under certain circumstances to applicants whose actions may result in take incident to other lawful activity. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539(a)(1)(B). In <em>Defenders of Wildlife v. Bernal, </em>204 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 1999), the Ninth Circuit held that \"pursuing an ITP is not mandatory and a party can choose whether to proceed with the permitting process. However, if a party chooses not to secure a permit and the proposed activity, in fact, takes a listed species, the ESA authorizes civil and criminal penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927 (internal citations omitted). The Protocols differ from an ITP in that compliance with the Protocols is not a bar to liability if take occurs, but in both situations the landowner must decide how confident he is of his own ability \u2014 without agency guidance \u2014 to act without causing take of the species.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b261-18\">. The \"false negative\u201d designation is one used by the FWS if it has reason to believe that a survey in close proximity to a known Quino population may have incorrectly found no Quino present. <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter from Barrett to Lacy (Sept. 9, 1999) (\u201c[T]he ... flight season was poor and ... false negative surveys were highly probable in the vicinity (within 2 km) of known Quino colonies.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
