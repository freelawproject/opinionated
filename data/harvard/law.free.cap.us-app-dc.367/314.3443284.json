Although in this case the outcome of the duel is not particularly close, it would not matter if it were. The standard of review that governs interpretive dueling before this court compels us to defer to the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of her own regulations unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations. Because the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is neither, we grant her petition to vacate a Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission decision that adopted a conflicting construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Section 201 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the \u201cMine Act\u201d) directs the Secretary of Labor to issue \u201cimproved mandatory health or safety standards for the protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or other mines.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a). Acting through the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 557a, the Secretary has promulgated a wide array of such standards, which MSHA enforces by inspecting mines and issuing citations for violations, <em>see </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814(a). A mine operator can contest a citation before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (FMSHRC), an adjudicative agency independent of the Department of Labor. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 815(d). After a hearing, FMSHRC can affirm, modify, or vacate the citation. <em>See id. </em>Under the statutory scheme, however, the Commission is required to accord deference to \u201c \u2018the Secretary\u2019s interpretations of the law and regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Secretary of Labor v.

FMSHRC, </em>272 F.3d 590, 595 (D.C.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">Cannelton Industries idled its Shadrick Mine on May 3, 2002. <em>Cannelton Indus., Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>2002 WL 31696939, 24 FMSHRC 707 (2002) <em>(\u201cALJ Decision\u201d). </em>Because the company contemplated reactivating the mine at a later date, it needed to keep its electric pumps running to prevent the mine from flooding. The mine\u2019s electrical system, including a network of trolley wires that ran throughout the mine, was kept energized. On May 6, 2002, Cannelton began sending \u201cpumpers\u201d \u2014 miners who maintain and repair pumps \u2014 into the mine to work on the pumps. <em>Id. </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">On May 15, 2002, a MSHA inspector issued Cannelton a citation for violating 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360(a)(1), a mandatory safety standard that requires certified examiners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>to conduct a \u201cpreshift examination\u201d before a mine operator may send miners underground. In particular, the citation charged that Cannelton had failed to have examiners inspect the energized trolley wires before the pumpers entered the mine. <em>See Secretary of Labor v. Cannelton Indus., Inc., </em>26 FMSHRC 146, 148 (2004) <em>(\u201cFMSHRC Decision </em>\u201d). The company contested the citation before a FMSHRC administrative law judge (ALJ), who vacated the citation on the ground that the \u201cpumpers\u2019 exception\u201d to the preshift examination requirement, 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360(a)(2), rendered such an examination unnecessary. <em>See ALJ Decision, </em>24 FMSHRC at 709-10. On the Secretary\u2019s petition for review, the Commission upheld the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>See FMSHRC Decision, </em>26 FMSHRC at 150-54. The Secretary then petitioned for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In September 2004, Cannelton\u2019s parent company was the subject of a bankruptcy order, pursuant to which the parent of Spartan Mining Company purchased Cannelton\u2019s assets. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r Br. at 35-38. Spartan now owns the Shadrick mine. <em>See </em>Resp\u2019t Br. at 5. On January 12, 2005, we granted Spartan\u2019s unopposed motion to substitute itself for Cannelton as respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">It is well-settled that this court must defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of a MSHA standard as long as that interpretation is not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc. v. FMSHRC, </em>212 F.3d 1301, 1303 (D.C.Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994)); <em>see Secretary of Labor v. Excel Mining, LLC, </em>334 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C.Cir.2003). It is equally well-settled that we owe the Secretary this deference even if FMSHRC interprets the standard differently. <em>See id.; Akzo Nobel Salt, </em>212 F.3d at 1303; <em>Energy W. Mining Co. v. FMSHRC, </em>40 F.3d 457, 462-63 (D.C.Cir.1994); <em>Cannelton Indus., </em>867 F.2d at 1435.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The regulations at issue in this case are contained in subsections (a) and (b) of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360. The preshift examination requirement is set forth in paragraph (a)(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\"><em>Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, </em>a certified person designated by the operator must make a preshift examination within 3 hours preceding the beginning of any 8-hour interval during which any person is scheduled to work or travel underground. No person other than certified examiners may enter or remain in any underground area unless a preshift examination has been completed for the established 8-hour interval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360(a)(1) (emphasis added). The substance of the required preshift examination is contained in subsection (b), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">The person conducting the preshift examination shall examine for hazardous conditions ... at the following locations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ais\">(1) Roadways, travelways and track haulageways where persons are scheduled ... to work or travel during the oncoming shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(3) Working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, if anyone is scheduled to work on the section or in the area during the oncoming shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">(7) Areas where trolley wires or trolley feeder wires are to be or will remain energized during the oncoming shift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(b). Finally, the pumpers\u2019 exception \u2014 referenced by the phrase in paragraph (a)(1) italicized above \u2014 is set forth in paragraph (a)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Preshift examinations of areas where pumpers are scheduled to work or travel shall not be required prior to the pumper entering the areas if the pumper is a certified person and the pumper conducts an examination for hazardous conditions ... where the pumper works or travels. The examination of the area must be completed before the pumper performs any other work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The Secretary interprets these interconnected provisions as follows. Paragraph (a)(1) requires certified persons to conduct a preshift examination before anyone else may enter a mine. Subsection (b) describes the specific areas of the mine in which this examination must be conducted. These include certain areas, such as \u201croadways\u201d and sections where \u201cequipment is being installed,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(b)(1), (b)(3), that must be examined only if persons are scheduled to work or travel there. They also include other areas, such as those \u201cwhere trolley wires or trolley feeder wires ... remain energized,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(b)(7), that must be examined even if no one is scheduled to work or travel there. <em>Compare id. </em>(not containing a \u201cscheduled to work\u201d caveat), <em>with, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) (all containing the caveat). Finally, the introductory clause of paragraph (a)(1) \u2014 \u201c[ejxcept as provided in paragraph (a)(2)\u201d \u2014 directs the reader to the sole exception to this preshift examination requirement. That exception, which permits pumpers to conduct their own examinations, applies only in \u201careas where pumpers are scheduled to work or travel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">It is undisputed that Cannelton\u2019s pumpers properly conducted all required examinations of the areas where they worked or traveled, but that other areas went unexamined. In particular, no one examined areas where trolley wires remained energized, as subsection (b)(7) requires for preshift examinations. Spartan offers a series of reasons \u2014 each of which FMSHRC accepted \u2014 for reading \u00a7 75.360 to include the trolley wire areas within the pumpers\u2019 exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">First, Spartan contends that the opening clause of paragraph (a)(1) \u2014 \u201c[ejxcept as provided in paragraph (a)(2)\u201d- \u2014 means that the pumpers\u2019 exception is a complete exemption from the preshift examination requirement, and thus eliminates the obligation to examine non-work areas like those where energized trolley wires are found. The plain language of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), however, gives the Secretary the better of this argument. The opening clause creates an exception only \u201cas provided in\u201d paragraph (a)(2), and that paragraph does not dispense with the preshift examination requirement altogether. To the contrary, it permits a pumpers\u2019 examination to substitute for a preshift examination only in \u201careas where pumpers are scheduled to work or travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(a)(2). Because the preshift examination requirement otherwise remains applicable, energized trolley wires must be examined, before pumpers may enter a mine. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Second, Spartan notes paragraph (a)(l)\u2019s declaration that \u201c[n]o person <em>other than </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>certified examiners </em>may enter or remain in any underground area unless a preshift examination has been completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(a)(1) (emphasis added). Reading this as permitting \u201ccertified examiners\u201d to enter without a preshift examination, and further noting that the pumpers\u2019 exception applies only \u201cif the pumper is a certified person,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 75.360(a)(2), Spartan concludes that no preshift examination is required before a (certified) pumper begins his or her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The Secretary disagrees. In her view, the quoted sentence \u2014 which comes immediately after the sentence that imposes the preshift examination requirement \u2014 merely means that a certified examiner may enter the mine before a preshift examination in order to conduct that examination. The quoted sentence thus serves an important purpose: it avoids the Catch-22 that would result if an examiner could not enter an area to conduct a preshift examination until an examiner had conducted such an examination. Spartan\u2019s reading of the sentence, by contrast, would render the pumpers\u2019 exception superfluous. If paragraph (a)(1) wholly exempted pumpers from the preshift examination requirement, there would be no need for the pumpers\u2019 exception of paragraph (a)(2). The Secretary\u2019s contrary reading is thus perfectly reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Next, Spartan turns for support to the Federal Register preamble that accompanied the 1996 revision of \u00a7 75.360. \u201cWhile this issue is not expressly resolved by the preamble or any other regulatory comments to the rule,\u201d Spartan contends, \u201cthe preamble contains numerous references that the pumpers\u2019 examination may be performed \u2018in lieu of,\u2019 rather than in addition to, a pre-shift examination.\u201d Resp\u2019t Br. at 14. Spartan\u2019s introductory disclaimer signals the uphill climb it faces in relying on the preamble, and the course indeed proves too steep. The preamble does state, as Spartan notes, that <em>\u201ceither </em>a preshift examination must be made in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) before a pumper enters an area, or certified pumpers must conduct an examination under paragraph (a)(2).\u201d <em>Safety Standards for Underground Coal Mine Ventilation, </em>61 Fed.Reg. 9765, 9792 (Mar. 11,1996) <em>(\u201cSafety Standards </em>\u201d) (emphases added). But the Secretary reasonably construes this alternative as applying only to the area the \u201cpumper enters.\u201d Another sentence in the preamble confirms this construction: \u201cParagraph (a)(2) of the final rule provides that preshift examinations <em>of areas tohere pumpers are scheduled to work or travel </em>are not required ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Similarly, although Spartan stresses the preamble\u2019s statement that \u201cthe pumper is conducting an examination in a limited area only for himself or herself,\u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Secretary reasonably explains that this language merely means that the pumpers\u2019 examination is a substitute for the preshift examination that would take place \u201cin the limited area\u201d in which the pumper \u201chimself or herself\u2019 is working. It is not a substitute for the broader examination otherwise required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Spartan also maintains that two subsections of the Mine Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 863(d) and \u00a7 863(m), \u201cwhen reviewed separately and together, clearly indicate that Congress did not intend to require a pre-shift examination of an idle mine outside the area where pumpers are working and traveling.\u201d Resp\u2019t Br. at 16. Although our own review reveals no such negative intent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> examination of those sections is beside the point. Congress made quite clear that \u201c[t]he provisions of sections 862 through 878 of this title shall be interim mandatory safety standards applicable to all underground coal mines until superseded in whole or in part by improved mandatory safety standards promulgated by the Secretary.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(a). Whatever the import of those interim provisions, they have now been superseded by the Secretary\u2019s safety standards, including \u00a7 75.360.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Switching its attention from regulatory interpretation to policy, Spartan further contends that the Secretary\u2019s \u201cinterpretation is not entitled to deference because it diminishes, rather than promotes, safety.\u201d Resp\u2019t Br. at 10. That is so, Spartan insists, because sending pre-shift examiners \u201cto conduct pre-shift examinations for areas far remote from those in which the pumpers will work and travel ... will unnecessarily expose the preshift examiners to mine hazards, without measurably improving the health and safety of the pumpers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The company is certainly correct that sending preshift examiners as well as pumpers into a mine exposes the examiners to hazards they would not experience if the pumpers went in alone. But the Secretary believes that the preshift examiners\u2019 risk is minimized by the fact that they, unlike the pumpers, are focused on a single task: detecting and correcting hazards. And on the other side of the ledger, the Secretary believes that sending in the examiners protects pumpers from serious hazards \u2014 particularly the risk of fire triggered by energized trolley wires\u2014 that can originate in areas other than those in which the pumpers are working and that are therefore beyond the scope of the pumpers\u2019 own examination. The Secretary\u2019s balancing of these safety risks and benefits is a reasonable policy judgment to which this court must defer. <em>See Excel Mining, </em>334 F.3d at 11; <em>Energy W. Mining, </em>40 F.3d at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Finally, Spartan contends that, \u201ceven if the Secretary\u2019s interpretation was entitled to deference, the standard cannot be enforced in this instance because Cannelton did not have fair notice of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation\u201d as required by the Due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Process Clause. Resp\u2019t Br. at 10. Spartan\u2019s due process argument falls short of the mark. This is not a case in which the Secretary\u2019s \u201cinterpretation is so far from a reasonable person\u2019s understanding of the regulations that they could not have informed [Cannelton] of the agency\u2019s perspective.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. v. EPA, </em>53 F.3d 1324, 1330 (D.C.Cir.1995). To the contrary, the regulation is \u201csufficiently clear to warn a party about what is expected of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328; <em>see Trinity Broad. of Fla., Inc. v. FCC, </em>211 F.3d 618, 628 (D.C.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Because the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360 is reasonable, FMSHRC\u2019s contrary interpretation cannot stand. We therefore vacate the decision below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\n<em>Granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">. We agree with the parties that Cannelton's inadvertent payment of the $259 fine imposed by the contested citation did not moot this case. As the Secretary observes, FMSHRC precedent indicates that if Spartan prevails in this proceeding, the company will be able to recover the money paid to the Secretary. <em>See, e.g., Secretary of Labor v. Phelps Dodge Sierrita, Inc., </em>24 FMSHRC 661, 662 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">. <em>See also Safety Standards, </em>61 Fed.Reg. at 9792 (\"[T]he final rule provides an option for pumpers to perform examinations for themselves if they are certified.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\"The pumper may only perform an examination in lieu of a preshift for himself or herself.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. Spartan also notes the preamble's statement that \u201careas where persons are not scheduled to work or travel are not required to be examined under the final rule.\u201d <em>Safety Standards, </em>61 Fed.Reg. at 9791. But as the Secretary points out, this statement was not a reference to the pumpers' exception, but rather a response to a specific comment suggesting that only a limited preshift examination be required when miners are \u201cto work in the shaft, slope, drift, or ... bottom area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no indication that the statement was intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to contradict the text of \u00a7 75.360 \u2014 which requires examination of \"[ajreas where trolley wires or trolley feeder wires are to be or will remain energized,\u201d 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360(b)(7), regardless of whether anyone is scheduled to work there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-5\">. The language of subsection 863(d) is similar to that of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.360 and does not undercut the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the latter. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 863(d)(1) (\u201d[B]e-fore any miner in [a] shift enters the active workings of a coal mine, certified persons designated by the operator of the mine shall examine such workings and any other underground area of the mine designated by the Secretary or his authorized representative.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 863(d)(2) (\"No person (other than certified persons designated under this subsection) shall enter any underground area, except during any shift, unless an examination of such area as prescribed in this subsection has been made within eight hours immediately preceding his entrance into such area.\u201d). The language of \u00a7 863(m) is similar to that of the preamble and is likewise reasonably subject to the Secretary\u2019s construction. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 863(m) (providing that \u201d[p]er-sons, such as pumpmen, who are required regularly to enter [idle and abandoned] areas in the performance of their duties ... are authorized to make such examinations for themselves\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
