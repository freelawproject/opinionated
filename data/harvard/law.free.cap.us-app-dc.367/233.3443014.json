Aerol\u00edneas acknowledges that it is paying user charges for international flights that are roughly one third of what United States carriers are being charged, but it argues that because the disparity stems not from any intentional discrimination on the part of the Government of Argentina, but rather from \u201cconflicting [Argentine] judicial decisions,\u201d the DoT abused its discretion by treating the discrepancy as an \u201cunreasonable discriminatory ... practice against\u201d the United States carriers within the condemnation of the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41310(c)(1)(A). In any event, argues Aerol\u00edneas, because neither the Argentine Congress nor the Executive can control the decisions of the Argentine Judiciary, the DoT\u2019s countermeasure will not eliminate the difference and was therefore arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>For its part, the DoT argues first that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 deprives the court of jurisdiction to review the challenged order because it comes within the exception to reviewability for orders \u201crelating] to a foreign air carrier [and] subject to disapproval by the President.\u201d On the merits, the DoT argues the order was within its authority under \u00a7 41810 and easily withstands the deferential review called for under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Because the DoT\u2019s order is no longer subject to the President\u2019s disapproval, we hold the court has jurisdiction to entertain Aerol\u00edneas\u2019 petition, which we deny on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In early 2002 the Government of Argentina delinked its peso from the U.S. dollar, whereupon the value of the peso quickly fell to about 33 U.S. cents. In an attempt to mitigate the ensuing panic, the Argentine Congress passed a law requiring that public service tariffs, including airport user fees, which were formerly denominated in dollars, be paid in pesos as though each peso were still worth $1.00, that is, at a one-to-one rate. The Argentine Executive, however, issued a Decree purporting to supersede that law and requiring that airport user charges for international flights \u2014 for landing, parking, and am traffic control \u2014 at Buenos Aires International Airport (Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini de Ezeiza, or Ezeiza) be paid in dollars at the floating exchange rate of roughly three-to-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Several airlines challenged the constitutionality of the Decree in the Argentine courts, and it is the divergent results of those actions that gave rise to this case. First, Aerol\u00edneas obtained a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Decree, thereby allowing it to pay the airport charges at the one-to-one rate. Then carriers from the United States and other foreign countries sought, but were denied, the same relief in a different Argentine court. As a result, since September 2002 Aerol\u00edneas has been paying user charges at Ezeiza that are roughly one third of what the United States carriers must pay for the same services.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Four United States carriers filed complaints with the DoT pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41310(d)(1).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The discrepancy in charges, they argued, put the Government of Argentina in violation of its bilateral agreement with the United States that \u201c[a]irlines shall not be required to pay charges higher than those paid by the airlines of the [other] party,\u201d Air Transport Services Agreement Between the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Argentina, Oct. 22, 1985, T.I.A.S. No. 11262, and therefore constituted an \u201cunreasonable discriminatory ... practice against\u201d the United States carriers, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41310(c)(1)(A). The DoT agreed, concluding \u201cthe imposition of higher fees at Ezeiza airport on U.S. carriers than those paid by Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas constitutes, on its face, the type of activity that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41310 was intended to reach.\u201d After diplomatic efforts to avoid a confrontation failed, the DoT imposed a countermeasure: Aerolineas\u2019 permit to operate in the United States was conditioned upon the airline\u2019s depositing in an escrow account in the United States the difference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>for each of its international flights landing at Ezeiza, between the user fee it pays and the fee that United States carriers pay there.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Shortly thereafter Aerol\u00edneas moved the DoT to stay its order because an appellate court in Argentina had modified the preliminary injunction granted in its favor and required the carrier to pay the same difference (that is, two pesos on the dollar) into an escrow account in Argentina pending final resolution on the merits of its constitutional challenge to the Decree. The DoT refused to stay its order because Aerol\u00edneas had appealed the modification to the Supreme Court of Argentina and, in the meantime, was not making escrow payments in Argentina. Aerol\u00edneas then petitioned this court for review of the DoT\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Aerol\u00edneas argues first that conflicting decisions by the courts of Argentina do not amount to a \u201cdiscriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice\u201d by the Government of Argentina against the United States carriers within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41310(c)(1)(A) and, in any event, the DoT\u2019s countermeasure should be set aside as arbitrary and capricious, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), because in Argentina, as here, neither the Congress nor the Executive can dictate the decisions of the Judiciary. Before turning to those contentions, however, we must address the DoT\u2019s objection that we are without jurisdiction to review the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41307, the Secretary of Transportation was required to submit his order to the President for review as a \u201cdecision [to] ... amend ... a permit ... authorizing a foreign air carrier ... to provide foreign air transportation.\u201d Under that section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">The President may disapprove the decision of the Secretary only if the reason for disapproval is based on foreign relations or national defense considerations that are under the jurisdiction of the President. The President may not disapprove ... if the reason is economic .... A decision of the Secretary \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">(2)(A) takes effect as a decision of the Secretary if the President does not disapprove the decision not later than 60 days after the decision is submitted to the President; and (B) when effective, may be reviewed judicially under section 46110 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Section 46110 makes renewable in this court any order of the Department of Transportation \u201c[e]xcept for an order related to a foreign air carrier subject to disapproval by the President under section 41307.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">The DoT argues its order to Aerol\u00edneas comes within the exception in \u00a7 46110 and is therefore unreviewable. Aerol\u00edneas responds as follows: (1) The DoT\u2019s decision was \u201ceconomic,\u201d and because \u201cthe President may not disapprove \u2018economic\u2019 decisions\u201d the order was not \u201csubject to disapproval by the President\u201d; and (2) even if the order was initially subject to disapproval by the President, because he did not disapprove it within the 60 days provided therefor, and the order has since \u201ctake[n] effect as a decision of the Secretary\u201d that is no longer subject to presidential disapproval, it is now subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Aerol\u00edneas\u2019 first \u201cargument\u201d is really a conclusion, for which it offers no support whatsoever. We reject it in kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Aerol\u00edneas\u2019 second argument gains traction from <em>South African Airways v. Dole, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>817 F.2d 119, 123 (D.C.Cir.1987), in which we considered the predecessor to \u00a7 46110, and concluded that \u201cif a DOT action is not disapproved [by the President, then] it \u2018shall take effect as [an] action of [the DoT], not of the President, and as such shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 1486 of this Appendix.\u2019 49 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1461(a) (1982).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The DoT points out that \u00a7 1486 differed from the current \u00a7 46110 in that it excepted from judicial review any order relating to a foreign air carrier \u201csubject to the approval\u201d \u2014 not the \u201cdisapproval\u201d \u2014 of the President; the order at issue in that case was by statute made subject only to the disapproval of the President, and we therefore concluded it was not within the exception to judicial review. 817 F.2d at 122. Because the order under review in this case was subject to the \u201cdisapproval\u201d of the President, pursuant to the exception in \u00a7 46110, the DoT argues the result in this case should be different. The DoT fails to appreciate, however, that in the prior case we went on to explain that \u201ceven if we were to equate \u2018subject to approval\u2019 with \u2018subject to disapproval,\u2019 \u201d \u2014 that is, even if the exception to reviewability in \u00a7 1486 were the same as the exception in \u00a7 46110 \u2014 \u201cthe order would still be reviewable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That leaves the DoT with no basis upon which to distinguish <em>South African Airways.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We now make explicit what was necessarily implicit in <em>South African Airways, </em>namely, that \u00a7 46110 does not permanently preclude judicial review of an order \u201crelating] to a foreign air carrier\u201d merely because the order was initially \u201csubject to disapproval by the President.\u201d When an order is no longer \u201csubject to disapproval by the President,\u201d there is no longer any reason to shield it from judicial scrutiny, or so the Congress apparently concluded. Here, the order was submitted for the President\u2019s review on November 19, 2003, and on November 25 the President\u2019s designee <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> notified the DoT that he did not intend to disapprove it. Even absent such notification, \u201c60 days after the decision is submitted to the President\u201d or his designee, if not disapproved the order \u201ctakes effect as a decision of the Secretary\u201d and, \u201cwhen effective, may be reviewed judicially under section 46110.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41307(2)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">If the Congress had intended permanently to shield from judicial review all orders initially \u201csubject to disapproval by the President,\u201d then it would have said so. The more natural meaning of the phrase \u201csubject to disapproval\u201d is as a temporal limitation; a court may not review an order \u201crelating to a foreign air carrier\u201d as long as that order is \u201csubject to disapproval by the President.\u201d The lack of presidential disapproval, however, indicates only that the order is not harmful to the foreign relations or defense of the Nation. We should not lightly presume the Congress intended to grant the DoT an unreviewable discretion to engage in otherwise noxious decisionmaking. <em>See Steenholdt v. FAA, </em>314 F.3d 633, 638 (D.C.Cir.2003) (noting the \u201cstrong presumption of review-ability under the [APA]\u201d). Accordingly, as we held in <em>South African Airways, </em>\u201cif a DOT action is not disapproved, it ... shall be subject to judicial review\u201d pursuant to the APA. 817 F.2d at 123.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>B. The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Aerol\u00edneas argues \u201cthe plain language of \u00a7 41310 requires discriminatory intent,\u201d whereas \u201cthe current different rates being paid by different carriers is strictly ... fortuitous.\u201d The DoT takes issue with the carrier\u2019s premise, arguing \u201cit is irrelevant whether the foreign government\u2019s discriminatory activity was intentional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">No action taken by any branch of the Government of Argentina appears to have been aimed at disadvantaging United States carriers. Nevertheless, as the DoT explained in its order, \u201cthe Government of Argentina is a signatory to an agreement with ... the United States,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">User charges, imposed by the competent charging authority of the other Party shall be just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory. Airlines shall not be required to pay charges higher than those paid by airlines of the charging Party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afe\">The treaty makes no exception for \u201cfortuitous\u201d circumstances and contemplates no inquiry into the cause of higher charges or, indeed, whether it is within the power of a signatory government to eliminate that difference; it simply states \u201c[ajirlines shall not be required to pay charges higher than those paid by airlines of the [other nation],\u201d and thereby defines \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d in terms of impact, rather than intent. Because Aerol\u00edneas does not dispute that it is paying only about one third of what the United States carriers are paying for international flights at Ezeiza, we can hardly say the DoT acted unreasonably in concluding the United States carriers are paying \u201ccharges higher\u201d than them Argentine counterpart, contrary to the agreement between the Government of Argentina and the United States prohibiting \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Whether the higher charges constitute an \u201cunreasonable discriminatory ... practice\u201d under \u00a7 41310(c) is a question committed to the DoT to answer \u201cin the public interest,\u201d subject only to limited review by the President and to judicial review under the APA, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (court shall \u201cset aside agency action ... found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d). To the extent Aerol\u00edneas argues the DoT misconstrued \u00a7 41310, we must defer to the DoT\u2019s reasonable interpretation of that section. <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\u201c[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The DoT points out that \u201cthe words \u2018intentional\u2019 or \u2018intent\u2019 appear nowhere in the statut[e],\u201d and we see no reason to think, in this context, the term \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d necessarily requires a showing of intent, as opposed merely to a disparate impact. <em>Cf. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, </em>540 U.S. 44, 52, 124 S.Ct. 518, 157 L.Ed.2d 357 (2003) (\u201cUnder a disparate-impact theory of discrimination, a facially neutral employment practice may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence of the employer\u2019s subjective intent to discriminate\u201d). Absent such a requirement, Aerol\u00edneas offers no reason to believe the DoT acted unreasonably in concluding that charging Argentine and United States carriers different rates was an \u201cunreasonable discriminatory ... practice\u201d under \u00a7 41310(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">C. The Countermeasure</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Aerol\u00edneas also argues the DoT abused its discretion in adopting a countermeasure without \u201cindicating] just how assessing Aerol\u00edneas with additional fees will eliminate the alleged discriminatory activity.\u201d According to Aerol\u00edneas, because the Argentine Executive is not empowered to dictate the decisions of the Argentine Judiciary, the DoT\u2019s countermeasure will have no effect. As the DoT points out, however, the Executive could unilaterally eliminate the difference in user charges at Ezeiza merely by staying its own Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Aerol\u00edneas\u2019 next argument, that the DoT may not \u201c[take] it upon itself ... to level the playing field,\u201d is directly contrary to statute; \u00a7 41310(b) provides that \u201c[i]f the discrimination is not ended in a reasonable time through negotiation, the [DoT] shall establish a compensating charge equal to the discriminatory charge.\u201d Whether this means the DoT might have taken the further step of passing Aerol\u00edneas\u2019 escrow payments through to the United States carriers, we need not decide. The DoT was plainly authorized to levy the charge it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Finally, Aerol\u00edneas argues the DoT\u2019s order may itself prove to be \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d because Aerol\u00edneas, in the event it loses its appeal to the Supreme Court of Argentina, would \u201cbe in the position of paying a total of three pesos in Argentina and two to the DOT, making it the only airline that is paying at the rate of five\u201d pesos per dollar for user charges on international flights at Ezeiza. The DoT\u2019s order, however, requires Aerol\u00edneas to pay into escrow in the United States only the difference between what it is paying for the use of Ezeiza and what United States carriers are paying. The DoT reasonably represents that, \u201c[i]f circumstances ... change, and Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas in fact begins paying at the rate charged to other carriers, it will have every opportunity to bring this to the attention of the Department,\u201d where we trust it will find relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41310(d)(1) provides: \"An air carrier ... may file a complaint under [\u00a7 41310(c)],\u201d which authorizes the DoT to \"take actions ... in the public interest to eliminate an activity of a government of a foreign country\u201d that is \"an unjustifiable or unreasonable discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice against an air carrier.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> By Executive Order 12597 the President delegated this authority to the Secretary, who in turn delegated it to the General Counsel of the DoT. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.57(p).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\"> We recognize this interpretation of \u00a7 46110 leaves the exception to judicial review with only limited practical effect; despite the court's best efforts, judicial review could hardly be had in less than 60 days, nor would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>we ordinarily review an order before it \u201ctakes effect.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41307. It is the cumulative effect of several Acts of Congress, however, and not our decision today, that accounts for the limited sweep of the exception. The original version of the exception in what is now \u00a7 46110 was crafted prior to the Congress's having regularized judicial review of administrative action in the APA, <em>see </em>Pub.L. No. '75-706, June 23, 1938, 52 Stat. 1024 (\"except any order in respect of any foreign air carrier subject to the approval of the President\u201d). Meanwhile, \u00a7 41307 has been changed significantly over time: An order \"amendfing] ... any permit issuable to any foreign air carrier\u201d was originally made \"subject to the approval of the President\u201d without any limitation either of time or of the ground upon which he might reject it. 52 Stat. 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Although all such orders had to be \"submitted to the President before publication,\" <em>id., </em>another section provided that \"all orders ... of the [then-Civil Aeronautics] Authority shall take effect within such reasonable time as the Authority may prescribe,\u201d 52 Stat. 1023. Thus, it was apparently possible for an order to take effect while it was still subject to the President\u2019s \"approval ... denial, transfer, amendment, cancellation or suspension,\u201d <em>Chicago &amp; So. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 109, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948), and the exception precluded judicial review until such time as the President had acted. Now the President\u2019s time to act has been cut short, but the order does not take effect until that time is up, leaving little if any time during which the exception bars judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
