No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81, took aim at two perceived demons of federal electoral contests: \u201csoft money,\u201d i.e., use of unregulated political party activities to influence federal elections, and \u201csham issue ads,\u201d i.e., ostensibly issue-related advocacy functioning in practice as unregulated campaign advertising. These two tactics, given broad scope by permissive Federal Election Commission rulings, infused federal campaigns with hundreds of millions of dollars in federally unregulated funds, much of it contributed by corporations and labor unions. Now BCRA\u2019s House sponsors (joined by Senate sponsors as amici) claim the FEC has undone their hard work, resurrecting in its regulations practices BCRA eradicated and thus forcing them to seek reelection in illegally constituted electoral contests. Considering this facial challenge to the regulations, the district court invalidated some fifteen rules, finding some inconsistent with the statute and others arbitrary and capricious. The FEC appeals regarding five key rules: standards for \u201ccoordinated communication,\u201d definitions of the terms \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect,\u201d the interpretation of \u201celectioneering communication,\u201d allocation rules for state party employee salaries, and a de minimis exemption from allocation rules governing certain contributions, known as \u201cLevin funds,\u201d to state and local parties. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">Needless to say, federal campaign finance law is complex, and BCRA is no exception. Though few of its details are important to this litigation (and those that are we describe later in our analysis), we here provide a brief overview of the statute\u2019s background and objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>McConnell v. FEC, </em>540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), which upheld BCRA\u2019s core provisions against constitutional challenge, \u201cBCRA is the most recent federal enactment designed \u2018to purge national politics of what was conceived to be the pernicious influence of \u201cbig money\u201d campaign contributions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <em>United States v. Auto. Workers, </em>352 U.S. 567, 572, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957)). Even before BCRA, federal campaign finance laws, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (\u201cFECA\u201d), Pub.L. 92-225, 86 Stat. 3, and amendments to that statute, restricted campaign \u201ccontributions,\u201d defined as \u201cany gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made ... for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(8)(A)(i). Individuals could contribute to federal candidates and their campaigns only within strict dollar limits, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a), and corporations and labor unions could not contribute at all (though they could sponsor special political funds known as \u201cpolitical action committees\u201d or \u201cPACs\u201d), <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 441b(a), (b)(2)(C). <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 117-19, 124 S.Ct. 619. FECA also restricted \u201cexpenditures,\u201d i.e., \u201cany purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made ... for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(9)(A)(i). <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 118-19, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Although in <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam), the Supreme Court upheld FECA\u2019s contribution limitations as well as various reporting and disclosure requirements, the Court invalidated expenditure limits for individual donors, candidates, and campaigns. <em>See id. </em>at 143-44, 96 S.Ct. 612. (Though unchallenged in <em>Buckley, </em>FECA also codified a pre-existing ban on election-related spending by corporations and unions. <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b; <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 116-17,122,124 S.Ct. 619; <em>FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 238, 247-48, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986).) In addition, invoking constitutional avoidance, the <em>Buckley </em>Court construed the term \u201cexpenditure\u201d to cover communications only where they \u201cadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office,\u201d and do so using \u201cexpress terms\u201d such as \u201c Vote for,\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u2018elect,\u2019 \u2018support,\u2019 \u2018cast your ballot for,\u2019 \u2018Smith for Congress,\u2019 Vote against,\u2019 \u2018defeat,\u2019 \u2018reject.\u2019 \u201d 424 U.S. at 43-44 <em>&amp; </em>n. 52, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In the political world, several terms of art emerged to describe the boundaries of this pre-BCRA law \u2014 terms we shall use throughout this opinion. Most important, contributions subject to federal source, amount, and disclosure requirements are called \u201chard money\u201d or \u201cfederal money.\u201d <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 122, 124 S.Ct. 619. Funds outside FECA\u2019s sphere are called \u201cnonfederal\u201d or \u201csoft.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 122-23, 124 S.Ct. 619. Due to its reliance on specific phrases like \u201cvote for\u201d and \u201cvote against,\u201d the express advocacy standard became known as the \u201cmagic words\u201d test. <em>See id. </em>at 126,124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Because FECA defined both \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in terms of the \u201cpurpose of influencing any election for <em>federal </em>office,\u201d <em>see </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431(8)(A), (9)(A) (emphasis added), donations aimed at state and local elections were unregulated, i.e., \u201csoft.\u201d Thus, as <em>McConnell </em>explains, \u201cquestions arose concerning the treatment of contributions intended to influence both federal and state elections.\u201d 540 U.S. at 123, 124 S.Ct. 619. Charged with administering federal campaign finance laws, the Federal Election Commission (\u201cFEC\u201d) took a permissive view. \u201cAlthough a literal reading of FECA\u2019s definition of \u2018contribution\u2019 would have required funding such activities with hard money, the FEC ruled that political parties could fund mixed-purpose activities\u2014 including get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising \u2014 in part with soft money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Parties had to allocate such costs between hard and soft accounts, but rules in place after 1990 allowed national parties to fund as much as 35-40% of their mixed-purpose activities with soft money. <em>Id. </em>at 123 n. 7, 124 S.Ct. 619. Even more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>generous, rules for state and local party organizations allowed allocation based on the ratio of federal to nonfederal offices on a given ballot, \u201cwhich in practice meant that they could expend a substantially greater proportion of soft money than national parties to fund mixed-purpose activities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Over time, political parties took increasing advantage of these soft money opportunities. Although the two major parties spent only $21.6 million in soft money in the 1984 election cycle, by 2000 that figure had risen to $498 million \u2014 roughly 42% of their total spending. <em>Id. </em>at 124, 124 S.Ct. 619. Because this \u201csoft\u201d money fell outside FECA\u2019s contribution limitations, parties could raise it in massive dollops from single contributors, including corporations and unions. <em>See id. </em>at 124-25, 124 S.Ct. 619. Though federal candidates often played a key role in raising these funds, the parties shifted much of their soft money ($280 million in 2000) to the state level, where the FEC\u2019s more generous state-party allocation rules applied, and where certain disclosure regulations applicable to national parties did not. <em>See id. </em>at 124-26, 124 S.Ct. 619; <em>McConnell v. FEC, </em>251 F.Supp.2d 176, 198-99 (D.D.C.2003) (per curiam) (decision of three-judge district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Just as soft money spending was exploding, a related phenomenon, \u201csham issue ads,\u201d also developed. The term \u201cissue ad\u201d derives from Buckley\u2019s \u201cmagic words\u201d construction of FECA, the idea being that express advocacy relates to candidates whereas non-express advocacy relates to \u201cissues.\u201d <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 126, 124 S.Ct. 619. However \u201cneat in theory,\u201d this distinction proved meaningless in practice \u2014 hence the \u201csham.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 126-27, 124 S.Ct. 619. Free to mention candidates by name and even discuss their views and voting records, those financing non-express advocacy could generate ads \u201cfunctionally identical\u201d to campaign ads, notwithstanding the absence of \u201cmagic words.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 126, 124 S.Ct. 619. \u201cLittle difference existed, for example, between an ad that urged viewers to \u2018vote against Jane Doe\u2019 and one that condemned Jane Doe\u2019s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to \u2018call Jane Doe and tell her what you think,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 126-27, 124 S.Ct. 619, a ruse employed in many ostensibly issue-oriented ads, <em>see McConnell, </em>251 F.Supp.2d at 301 (Henderson, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). Indeed, the record in the <em>McConnell </em>litigation showed that even when permitted to employ express advocacy, advertisers typically used more indirect language. <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 127 &amp; n. 18, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Beginning in about 1996, corporations and unions \u2014 both barred from direct contributions and expenditures, <em>see </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b(a), but permitted to finance non-express advocacy under the \u201cmagic words\u201d construal of \u201cexpenditure,\u201d <em>see Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. at 249, 107 S.Ct. 616 \u2014 began spending large sums on such issue advertising. <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 127-28, 124 S.Ct. 619; <em>McConnell, </em>251 F.Supp.2d at 201. Apparently negligible before that point, such spending climbed to hundreds of millions of dollars by 2000. <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 127, 124 S.Ct. 619; <em>McConnell, </em>251 F.Supp.2d at 201. The FEC, compounding the problem, construed \u201cexpenditure\u201d to mean \u201cmagic words\u201d 'for political parties, too, thus freeing them to spend their soft money war chests on still more sham issue advertising. <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 123-24, 124 S.Ct. 619; <em>McConnell, </em>251 F.Supp.2d at 199 &amp; n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Surveying the landscape in 1998, a Senate investigative committee concluded that the campaign finance system had suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>a \u201c \u2018meltdown.\u2019 \u201d <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 129, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting S.Rep. No. 105-167, vol. 4, at 4611 (1998)). Four years later, enacting reforms proposed by that committee, Congress passed BCRA. <em>See id. </em>at 132, 124 S.Ct. 619. Among other changes, the new law barred federal candidates and national parties from soft-money fundraising, restricted activities to which state and local parties could devote non-federal funds, and replaced the \u201cmagic words\u201d standard for issue ads with a more robust concept termed \u201celectioneering communication.\u201d At the same time, compensating to some degree for these new restrictions, the statute raised hard money contribution limits. Various plaintiffs challenged BCRA\u2019s constitutionality, but the Supreme Court largely rejected their claims in <em>McConnell. See </em>540 U.S. at 224, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Now we confront a lawsuit cutting the opposite way \u2014 arguments not that BCRA is too tough, but that FEC implementing regulations are too lax. Plaintiffs, appellees herein, are Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan, Members of Congress from Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively, who were BCRA\u2019s principal sponsors in the House of Representatives. (The Senate sponsors John McCain and Russell Feingold, joining the suit as amici, support this challenge.) Claiming standing not based on then\u2019 sponsorship of the legislation, but rather as candidates waging reelection contests governed by BCRA, Shays and Meehan challenged numerous FEC interpretive rules in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They argued that by construing BCRA\u2019s prohibitions too narrowly, these rules effectively permit conduct that BCRA bans, an effect that arises because the statute gives a defense against \u201cany sanction\u201d to \u201cany person\u201d relying in good faith on FEC regulations. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(e). In an exceptionally thorough opinion ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court invalidated and remanded some fifteen rules, while upholding a few more. <em>See Shays v. FEC, </em>337 F.Supp.2d 28, 130-31 (D.D.C.2004). Despite a request from the FEC, the court declined to stay its remand pending appeal. <em>See Shays v. FEC, </em>340 F.Supp.2d 39, 54 (D.D.C.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The FEC now appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision with respect to five rules: (1) standards for \u201ccoordinated communication\u201d; (2) definitions of the terms \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d; (3) the interpretation of \u201celectioneering communication\u201d; (4) allocation rules for state party employee salaries; and (5) a de minimis exemption from allocation rules governing certain contributions, known as \u201cLevin funds,\u201d to state and local parties. Following a preliminary discussion of our jurisdiction, we address each rule in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">As a threshold matter, the FEC challenges our jurisdiction, asserting both that Shays and Meehan lack standing and that their claims are unripe. With respect to standing, the district court held that because \u201cthe regulations shape the environment in which Plaintiffs must operate\u201d as officeholders and candidates, Shays and Meehan could bring suit challenging those rules. <em>See </em>337 F.Supp.2d at 44. As to ripeness, the court explained that despite the pre-enforcement timing of Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s suit, the purely legal nature of the issues removed any constitutional or prudential impediment to immediate consideration of their claims. <em>See id. </em>at 47-50. Reviewing de novo, <em>see, e.g., Nat\u2019l Wrestling Coaches Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>366 F.3d 930, 937 (D.C.Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2537, 162 L.Ed.2d 274 (2005); <em>Fed. Express Corp. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>67 F.3d 961, 964 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1995), we agree with both conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Derived from the Constitution\u2019s \u201ccase- or-controversy\u201d requirement for federal court jurisdiction, Article III standing requires plaintiffs to establish, as an \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum,\u201d that they face \u201cinjury in fact\u201d caused by the challenged conduct and redressable through relief sought from the court. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <em>see also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). The first element, \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d requires \u201can invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest.\u201d <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 227, 124 S.Ct. 619. Harm must be \u201cactual or imminent,\u201d not \u201cconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted). The second element, causation, demands \u201ca causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, alterations, and ellipses omitted). Finally, redressability requires that it be \u201clikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In addition to these constitutional requirements, parties claiming standing under the APA must show that them claims fall \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>522 U.S. 479, 488, 118 S.Ct. 927, 140 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Amgen, Inc. v. Smith, </em>357 F.3d 103, 108 (D.C.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We begin with the last \u2014 and easiest \u2014 of these requirements. Never \u201cespecially demanding,\u201d <em>Amgen, </em>357 F.3d at 108 (internal quotation marks omitted), the zone of interests standard easily encompasses Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s claims, considering that, as officeholders and candidates for office, they are among those who benefit from BCRA\u2019s restrictions on practices Congress believed to be corrupting. Of course, they are also \u201camong the targets of regulation,\u201d as the FEC points out, <em>see </em>Reply Br. at 3, but that poses no obstacle. Indeed, the statute\u2019s regulation of candidates is part of the reason <em>why </em>candidates like Shays and Meehan possess APA standing, for who suffers more directly when political rivals get elected using illegal financing? <em>Cf. PDK Labs., Inc. v. DEA, </em>362 F.3d 786, 791 (D.C.Cir.2004) (deeming the zone of interests test satisfied where agency orders, by regulating petitioner\u2019s supplier, \u201cnecessarily regulate[d]\u201d petitioner). Indeed, the FEC can hardly maintain otherwise, for in arguing that this facial challenge is unripe, the Commission urges Shays and Meehan to await specific abuses and then challenge them through FECA\u2019s and BCRA\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d judicial review provision, which permits aggrieved parties \u201cto challenge the FEC\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to enforce,\u201d <em>see Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. FEC, </em>69 F.3d 600, 603 (D.C.Cir.1995) (discussing 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437g(a)(8)) \u2014 an option that would make no sense if enforcement of these statutes couldn\u2019t protect the two Congressmen\u2019s interests. Accordingly, like the district court, we consider it \u201cself-evident that Plaintiffs meet the \u2018zone of interests\u2019 test.\u201d 337 F.Supp.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Turning to the constitutional analysis, Shays and Meehan argue that because BCR A thus protects them from prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>campaign practices, the challenged rules, which they argue permit those very practices, cause them injury redressable through judicial review. Recall that FECA precludes \u201cany sanction\u201d as to \u201cany person\u201d who relies in good faith on FEC rules, \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(e); <em>see also supra </em>at 82. Given this defense, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s opponents may undertake any conduct permitted by the challenged regulations without fear of penalty, even if that conduct violates campaign statutes. Thus, as Shays and Meehan see it, the FEC rules infringe their BCRA-protected interest in BCRA-compliant elections \u2014 an injury the Congressmen believe supports standing. Disagreeing, and relying chiefly on the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of standing as to two sets of constitutional claimants in <em>McConnell, </em>the FEC disputes Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s theory with respect to both injury in fact and causation. Specifically, the Commission argues that because Shays and Meehan challenge what the rules permit rather than what they constrain and because Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s affidavits demonstrate no specific use of the rules by their political opponents, the two Congressmen cannot show injury. In addition, the Commission asserts that because the rules grant Shays and Meehan the same legal options as their opponents, any disadvantage they suffer stems not from those rules, but from their own choice not to exploit them. We address these arguments in turn, starting with injury in fact and proceeding from there to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Since parties invoking jurisdiction at summary judgment may not rest on \u201c \u2018mere allegations,\u2019 but must \u2018set forth\u2019 by affidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019 \u201d demonstrating standing, <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e)), Shays and Meehan submitted affidavits in the district court supporting their standing claim. They assert that, as Members of Congress and candidates for reelection, they are not only \u201csubject to regulation under [FECA], BCRA, and the Commission\u2019s implementing rules,\u201d but also \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by opportunities those statutes and regulations create for their \u201cpotential election opponents\u201d and \u201ccontributors to and supporters of [their] opponents.\u201d (Shays Decl. \u00b6 3; Meehan Decl. \u00b6 3.) Thus, they aver that \u201c[i]f any of the campaign finance reforms embodied in BCRA is subverted, eroded, or circumvented by the Commission\u2019s implementing regulations, I will be forced once again to raise money, campaign, and attempt to discharge my important public responsibilities in a system that is widely perceived to be, and I believe in many respects will be, significantly corrupted by the influence of special-interest money.\u201d (Shays Decl. \u00b6 4; Meehan Decl. \u00b6 4.) Particularizing this claim of injury, the Congressmen then identify consequences for their own campaigns flowing from FEC subversion of each key category of BCRA restrictions. For example, as to BCRA\u2019s \u201csoft-money provisions,\u201d Shays and Meehan state, \u201c[i]f [FEC] regulations do not faithfully implement the soft-money ban, I face the strong risk that unregulated soft money contributions will again be used in an attempt to influence federal elections in which I am a candidate.\u201d (Shays Decl. \u00b6 5; Meehan Decl. \u00b6 5.) As to the \u201csham issue ad provisions,\u201d they assert, \u201c[i]f those regulations do not faithfully implement [BCRA], I will be open to attack, during critical time periods just before the primary and general elections, in broadcast advertising campaigns mounted by groups seeking to evade the contribution limits, source prohibitions, and disclosure requirements imposed by Congress.\u201d (Shays Decl. \u00b67; Meehan Decl. \u00b6 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Through these and other like assertions, Shays and Meehan aver that under FEC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>regulations permitting what BCRA prohibits, they suffer injury to their interest, protected by that statute, in seeking reelection through contests untainted by BCRA-banned practices. They assert, in other words, that under such illegal rules, they are \u201copen to attack\u201d by BCRAbanned advertising, face the \u201cstrong risk\u201d that opponents will use improper soft money spending against them, and generally must \u201craise money, campaign, and attempt to discharge [their] important public responsibilities\u201d in an environment rife with practices Congress has proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In analogous cases, courts have routinely recognized this type of injury \u2014 i.e., illegal structuring of a competitive environment \u2014 as sufficient to support Article III standing. In the administrative context, for example, we have held that when agencies adopt procedures inconsistent with statutory guarantees, parties who appear regularly before the agency suffer injury to a legally protected interest in \u201c \u2018fair decisionmaking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Electric Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. FERC, </em>391 F.3d 1255, 1262 (D.C.Cir.2004) <em>(EPSA\u201d) </em>(quoting <em>Prof'l Air Traffic Controllers Org. v. FLRA, </em>685 F.2d 547, 563 (D.C.Cir.1982) <em>(\u201cPATCO </em>\u201d)) (upholding- repeat litigant\u2019s standing to challenge allegedly unlawful agency rules on ex parte communication); <em>see also Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 572-73 &amp; nn. 7-8, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (indicating that plaintiffs possess standing \u201cto enforce a procedural requirement the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs\u201d and giving as an example \u201cthe procedural requirement for an environmental impact statement before a federal facility is constructed next door to them\u201d); <em>Fla. Audubon Soc\u2019y v. Bentsen, </em>94 F.3d 658, 664 (D.C.Cir.1996) (en banc) (holding that litigants may establish injury in fact by \u201cshowing] that the government act performed without the procedure in question will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff\u2019). By the same logic, Shays and Meehan, as regular candidates for reelection, suffer injury to a statutorily protected interest if under FEC rules they must compete for office in contests tainted by BCRA-banned practices. True, the forum here is an election, not agency rulemaking or adjudication, but much as administrative procedures determine how interested regulated parties may go about persuading agencies, so do the challenged FEC campaign finance rules structure candidates\u2019 regulated opportunities to persuade the electorate. Thus, given that regulated litigants suffer legal injury when agencies set the rules of the game in violation of statutory directives, the same is true here insofar as the FEC has exposed these regulated candidates to BCRA-proscribed campaign practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Likewise indicating that illegal structuring of a competitive environment injures those who are regulated in that environment, longstanding precedent establishes that when a statute \u201creflects] a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest, [an] injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.\u201d <em>Hardin v. Ky. Utils. Co., </em>390 U.S. 1, 6, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968). Accordingly, when an agency authorizes certain brokerage services by regulated banks, rival securities dealers may challenge that decision based on their interest in limiting market competition. <em>See Clarke v. Secs. Indus. Ass\u2019n, </em>479 U.S. 388, 390-94, 403, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987) (upholding standing based on zone of interests test without specifically addressing Article III requirements); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin., </em>522 U.S. at 488, 118 S.Ct. 927 (stating that \u201ccompetitors of financial institutions have standing to challenge agency action relaxing statutory restrictions on the activities of those institutions\u201d); <em>Ass\u2019n of Data Processing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 152, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970) (indicating \u201c[tjhere can be no doubt\u201d as to injury in fact where an agency authorized competition in a market served by petitioner). And when the government grants an application to produce controlled substances, a current manufacturer of the same drugs may challenge that action because \u201c \u2018increased competition represents a cognizable Article III injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>MD Pharm., Inc. v. DEA, </em>133 F.3d 8, 11 (D.C.Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Liquid Carbonic Indus. Corp. v. FERC, </em>29 F.3d 697, 701 (D.C.Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">To be sure, in this case, the challenged rules create neither more nor different rival candidates \u2014 the electoral analogue to participants in a market. Nor, as the FEC points out, do Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s rivals enjoy \u201cspecial benefits\u201d unavailable to the two Congressmen, Reply Br. at 5. Yet Shays and Meehan do face <em>intensified </em>competition. That is, under FEC rules permitting what BCRA prohibits, the two Congressmen must anticipate and respond to a broader range of competitive tactics than federal law would otherwise allow. For example, under one challenged regulation (described in detail below), rival candidates may have supporters finance issue ads more than 120 days before the election; according to Shays and Meehan, BCRA restricts such spending. <em>See infra </em>at 97-98 (discussing 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.21). Likewise, rival state parties may spend soft money to pay employees devoting a quarter of their time to defeating Shays and Meehan; the Congressmen believe BCRA requires hard money for such salaries. <em>See infra </em>at 57-58 (discussing 11 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 106.7(c)(1), (d)(1), 300.33(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Given that accounting for additional <em>rivals </em>constitutes injury in fact, <em>see, e.g., MD Pharm., </em>133 F.3d at 11, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s need to account for additional <em>practices </em>\u2014 and thus, as the dissent concedes, additional campaign activity, <em>see </em>sep. op. at 115 (Henderson, J., dissenting) \u2014 likewise supports Article III standing. As with promulgation of illegal administrative procedures, both these changes \u2014 additional competitors and additional tactics \u2014 fundamentally alter the environment in which rival parties defend their concrete interests (e.g., their interest in persuading regulators, retaining customers, or winning reelection). Considering that competitors may challenge one such form of change\u2014 authorization of rivals \u2014 it would be odd if they couldn\u2019t challenge more elementary distortions that alter the competitive environment\u2019s overall rules. <em>Cf. Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 157, 167-68, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997) (holding that parties who \u201chave competing economic and other interests\u201d in a certain water supply could challenge agency action reducing that supply in the aggregate). To draw an example from the case law, if drug producers may challenge permits for other manufacturers, <em>see MD Pharm., </em>133 F.3d at 11-12; <em>cf. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Shalala, </em>91 F.3d 1493, 1497-99 (D.C.Cir.1996) (upholding drug manufacturer\u2019s standing to challenge regulations governing approval of competing generic drugs), couldn\u2019t they also challenge rules, say, allowing all producers to forgo mandated warnings, or to advertise in ways Congress has forbidden? And if securities dealers may challenge rules allowing banks to broker stocks, <em>see Clarke, </em>479 U.S. at 403, 107 S.Ct. 750; <em>cf. Inv. Co. Inst. v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 618-19, 621, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971) (upholding investment companies\u2019 standing to challenge regulations authorizing banks to operate mutual funds), couldn\u2019t they likewise dispute regulations allowing all brokerages \u2014 bank-based or not \u2014 to stay open until ten o\u2019clock though a statute mandates closure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>by five? No less than when agencies unleash illegal competitors or implement illegal procedures, such across-the-board changes undermine statutorily protected expectations, requiring competitors to account for adverse activity prohibited by law. Because Shays and Meehan have asserted equivalent injury \u2014 competition intensified by BCRA-banned practices \u2014 and thus face an equivalent need to adjust their campaign strategy, they too suffer harm to their legally protected interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Indeed, our own case law, though avoiding resolving the issue definitively, supports applying competitor standing to politics as well as business. In <em>Gottlieb v. FEC, </em>143 F.3d 618 (D.C.Cir.1998), although rejecting a PAC\u2019s standing to challenge use of public matching funds by a candidate it opposed, we explained, \u201cAmeriPAC cannot claim standing as a \u2018competitor\u2019 ... because it was never in a position to receive matching funds itself. <em>Only another candidate </em>could make such a claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621 (emphasis added); <em>see also Common Cause v. FEC, </em>108 F.3d 413, 419 n. 1 (D.C.Cir.1997) (per curiam) (observing that a candidate-plaintiff who had not appealed \u201cmay be a political competitor\u201d of political parties). Moreover, we stated in <em>Chamber of Commerce v. FEC, </em>albeit in dicta, that if the FEC declined to enforce certain rules affecting the plaintiff, \u201ca <em>political competitor </em>could challenge the Commission\u2019s dismissal of its complaint\u201d under FECA\u2019s judicial review provision, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437g(a)(8). <em>See </em>69 F.3d at 603 (emphasis added). Given that Shays and Meehan \u2014 unlike the <em>Gottlieb </em>plaintiffs \u2014 clearly do face genuine rivalry from candidates and parties \u201cin a position,\u201d <em>Gottlieb, </em>143 F.3d at 621, to exploit FEC-created loopholes, our cases thus support analogizing their situation to business rivalry, a context where, as explained above, ample precedent supports standing, <em>see, e.g., Clarke, </em>479 U.S. at 403, 107 S.Ct. 750; <em>Inv. Co. Inst., </em>401 U.S. at 621, 91 S.Ct. 1091; <em>MD Pharm., </em>133 F.3d at 11-12; <em>Bristol-Myers Squibb, </em>91 F.3d at 1497-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Thus, at least two lines of precedent (procedural rights and competitor standing cases) embody a principle that supports Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s standing: that when regulations illegally structure a competitive environment \u2014 whether an agency proceeding, a market, or a reelection race\u2014 parties defending concrete interests (e.g., retention of elected office) in that environment suffer legal harm under Article III. As the district court recognized, opponents\u2019 campaign finance options necessarily \u201caffect[ ] the way these politicians ... will run their campaigns,\u201d such that Shays and Meehan \u201care at the very least harmed by having to anticipate other actors taking advantage of the regulations to engage in activities that otherwise would be barred.\u201d 337 F.Supp.2d at 42-43; <em>see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, </em>4 F.3d 26, 36-37 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that where state law required candidates to choose between public and private financing, that choice\u2019s \u201cimpact on the strategy and conduct of an office-seeker\u2019s political campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to confer standing\u201d). Based on our case law and the Supreme Court\u2019s, this harm is sufficient for Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Resisting this conclusion, the FEC makes two arguments, both embraced by the dissent and both flawed. First, the Commission points out that campaign finance restrictions benefit the general public as well as candidates. Yet the same is true of other statutes that structure rivals\u2019 playing fields \u2014 statutes routinely held to support such rivals\u2019 standing. Consider: although Congress may well have \u201cdesigned,\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 2130, environmental assessment requirements to advance a general public interest in environmental protection, <em>Lu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>jan </em>makes clear that \u201cone living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency\u2019s failure to prepare an environmental impact statement\u201d when following that procedure could prevent concrete injury (e.g., the flooding of plaintiffs home), <em>see id. </em>at 572 &amp; n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Likewise, although statutory restrictions on brokerage services and drug manufacturing serve (one hopes) to protect the public rather than simply to create monopolistic fiefs, businesses benefiting from such barriers to entry possess standing to enforce them. <em>See Clarke, </em>479 U.S. at 403, 107 S.Ct. 750; <em>MD Pharm., </em>133 F.3d at 11-12. By the same token, because BCRA-banned practices may harm Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s electoral prospects, and given that Shays and Meehan actively seek reelection in contests governed by the challenged rules \u2014 a far cry from living \u201cat the other end of the country from [a challenged] dam,\u201d sep. op. at 115 (Henderson, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130) \u2014 the two Congressmen may demand adherence to BCRA\u2019s requirements, notwithstanding that statute\u2019s intended public benefits such as preventing corruption and supporting informed voting. <em>Cf. Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (\u201cThe Art. III judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party, even though the court\u2019s judgment may benefit others collaterally.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The FEC\u2019s second argument is that <em>McConnell </em>forecloses Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s standing. It is true that in <em>McConnell </em>the Supreme Court dismissed plaintiffs asserting a supposed \u201ccompetitive injury\u201d \u2014 specifically, \u201cfundraising disadvantage\u201d due to BCRA\u2019s elevated hard money caps. 540 U.S. at 228, 124 S.Ct. 619. In citing this dismissal, however, the FEC removes McConnell\u2019s holding entirely from its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In <em>McConnell, </em>the so-called \u201cAdams plaintiffs\u201d \u2014 a group of voters, voter organizations, and candidates asserting constitutional challenges to BCRA\u2019s elevation of hard money limits \u2014 presented two standing theories. First, they argued that \u201cthe increases in hard money limits enacted by [BCRA] deprive them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 124 S.Ct. 619. Disagreeing, the Court explained that because \u201c \u2018[political \u201cfree trade\u201d does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources,\u2019 \u201d the asserted injury implicated no \u201clegally cognizable right\u201d and thus failed to show invasion of any legally protected interest, as required for standing. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616). Second, the Adams plaintiffs asserted that because the federal candidates in their group would refuse on principle to accept large contributions, those candidates suffered \u201c \u2018fundraising disadvantage,\u2019 making it more difficult for them to compete in elections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 107 S.Ct. 616 (quoting complaint). Rejecting this theory, too, the Court explained: \u201cTheir alleged inability to compete stems not from the operation of [the elevated caps], but from their own personal \u2018wish\u2019 not to solicit or accept large contributions, <em>i.e., </em>their personal choice. Accordingly, the Adams plaintiffs fail here to allege an injury in fact that is \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to BCRA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">As the district court recognized, McConnell\u2019s analysis is distinguishable from this case because here, unlike in <em>McConnell </em>where plaintiffs had no right to equal funding, a statute \u2014 namely, BCRA\u2014 specifically protects the interest in fair reelection contests that Shays and Meehan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>assert. As the Supreme Court has long recognized, \u201cCongress may enact statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing, even though no injury would exist without the statute.\u201d <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617 n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973); <em>see also Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 578, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (reaffirming this principle). Here, by banning certain campaign practices, Congress has created such rights. And because Shays and Meehan fall within the \u201czone of interests\u201d protected by BCRA, <em>see supra </em>at 83-84, the Congressmen hold a \u201clegally cognizable right,\u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 227, 124 S.Ct. 619, to enforce the statute\u2019s prohibitions under the APA. <em>See Clarke, </em>479 U.S. at 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interest\u2019 test is a guide for deciding whether ... a particular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.\u201d); <em>Mudd v. White, </em>309 F.3d 819, 824 (D.C.Cir.2002) (describing the \u201czone of interests\u201d test as assessing whether the plaintiffs \u201casserted interest is among the group of claims that is envisioned by the relevant statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Obviously distinguishing the Supreme Court\u2019s first holding on the Adams plaintiffs (lack of legally protected interest), this difference also places Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s suit outside McConnell\u2019s competitive injury analysis. True, much as the Adams plaintiffs could \u201cchoose\u201d to accept hard money up to BCRA\u2019s maximum, Shays and Meehan could perhaps reduce or even neutralize their opponents\u2019 advantages by exploiting illegal FEC safe harbors themselves. To repeat examples given above, they too could have supporters finance issue ads or commit state party employees 25% to federal races. But because being put to the choice of either violating BCRA or suffering disadvantage in their campaigns is itself a predicament the statute spares them, having to make that choice constitutes Article III injury. <em>Cf. Vote Choice, 4 </em>F.3d at 36-37 (upholding standing in a candidate\u2019s constitutional challenge to state campaign finance laws requiring her to choose \u201ceither to shun or to embrace public financing\u201d). Indeed, in a constitutional system based on the rule of law, it would be ironic, to say the least, if Article III barred the courthouse doors to citizens like Shays and Meehan who, because of unlawful government action, may protect their interest in election to Congress only by violating that lawmaking body\u2019s own dictates. Given that BCRA\u2019s prohibitions would apply absent the challenged safe harbors, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s asserted injury \u2014 having to defend their office in illegally constituted reelection fights \u2014 is not a matter of \u201ctheir personal choice,\u201d as it was in <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 228, 124 S.Ct. 619. Rather, it stems from the \u201coperation,\u201d <em>id., </em>of regulations permitting what BCRA bans. Thus, the dissent wrongly views the claimed predicaments in <em>McConnell </em>and in this case as identical: there no right existed; here one does. <em>See </em>sep. op. at 122-123 (Henderson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\"><em>McConnell </em>itself emphasizes the connection between its two Adams holdings (lack of legal harm and lack of competitive injury). As the Court put it, the Adams plaintiffs\u2019 twin standing theories shared \u201cthe same premise\u201d \u2014 that BCRA\u2019s \u201cincreased hard-money limits allow plaintiffs-candidates\u2019 opponents to raise more money, and, consequently, the plaintiffs-candidates\u2019 ability to compete or participate in the electoral process is diminished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having already rejected the premise (cognizable funding inequity), the Court naturally rejected the deduction (wrongful disadvantage) posed by plaintiffs\u2019 second theory. Instead, the court attributed the asserted injury to plaintiffs\u2019 own choice \u2014 for if funding inequity wasn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>cognizable, what besides choice could explain the candidates\u2019 disadvantage? Here, in contrast, due to BCRA and the APA, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s asserted interest in getting elected through legally financed campaigns is fully cognizable. Accordingly, their claimed injury, having to seek reelection in illegally structured contests (and thus needing either to violate BCRA or to suffer disadvantage), may support Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Furthermore, and clinching the point, <em>McConnell </em>gives no indication of modifying, much less overruling, cases supporting Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s standing \u2014 cases like <em>Lujan, Clarke, </em>and <em>Hardin </em>(not to mention this court\u2019s decisions in <em>EPSA, Maryland Pharmaceutical, </em>and <em>Gottlieb, </em>among others). Nor did the Court suggest that campaign finance laws require unique standing rules; quite the opposite, <em>McConnell </em>applies an entirely conventional standing analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 225-26, 124 S.Ct. 619 (applying Article III standing test after observing that \u201c[o]n many occasions, we have reiterated the three requirements that constitute the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Given the analogous precedent supporting standing, and considering that <em>McConnell </em>is distinguishable in any event, Shays and Meehan have presented a valid theory of injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">This same precedent \u2014 cases involving illegally structured environments \u2014 further assures us that notwithstanding Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s failure to show specific adverse use of challenged safe harbors, the Congressmen\u2019s asserted injury is sufficiently \u201cconcrete and particularized,\u201d as well as \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\u201d <em>e.g., Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 180, 120 S.Ct. 693. Although the FEC insists that the Congressmen must demonstrate that specific rivals have exploited each challenged rule, our cases hold that when adverse use of illegally granted opportunities appears inevitable, affected parties may challenge the government\u2019s authorization of those opportunities without waiting for specific competitors to seize them. <em>See, e.g., La. Energy &amp; Power Auth. v. FERC, </em>141 F.3d 364, 367 (D.C.Cir.1998) (noting that \u201cwe have not required litigants to wait until increased competition actually occurs\u201d); <em>Associated Gas Distribs. v. FERC, </em>899 F.2d 1250, 1259 (D.C.Cir.1990) (\u201c[Pjetitioners sufficiently establish their constitutional standing by showing that the challenged action authorizes allegedly illegal transactions that have the clear and immediate potential to compete with petitioners\u2019 own sales.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Given what <em>McConnell </em>calls the \u201chard lesson of circumvention\u201d evident in \u201cthe entire history of campaign finance regulation,\u201d 540 U.S. at 165, 124 S.Ct. 619, it is indisputable here that regulated parties will seize opportunities created by the challenged rules and thus taint contests through which Shays and Meehan seek reelection. To give two simple examples, one of the challenged regulations permits state and local parties to finance certain salaries with soft money; another allows such parties to use unregulated funds for generic party advertising costing less than $5,000. It seems obvious that party organizations fighting Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s reelection will employ these options, rather than complying unnecessarily with hard money strictures. <em>Cf. United Transp. Union v. ICC, </em>891 F.2d 908, 912 n. 7 (D.C.Cir. 1989) (observing that \u201ccourts routinely credit\u201d assertions founded on \u201cbasic economic logic\u201d in upholding standing). Accordingly, FEC safe harbors will \u201calmost surely cause\u201d Shays and Meehan harm, <em>Bristol-Myers Squibb, </em>91 F.3d at 1497 (quoting <em>El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. FERC, </em>50 F.3d 23, 27 (D.C.Cir.1995)), and the Congressmen must therefore account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>for use of those safe harbors in their own campaign strategy, <em>cf. Vote Choice, </em>4 F.3d at 37 (noting that because \u201cthe coerced choice between public and private financing colored [a candidate\u2019s] campaign strategy from the outset,\u201d the \u201cimpact\u201d of that choice \u201con the strategy and conduct of [the candidate\u2019s] political campaign\u201d supported standing (internal quotation marks omitted)). Hence, \u201cthere is no need to wait for injury from specific transactions to claim standing.\u201d <em>Bristol-Myers Squibb, </em>91 F.3d at 1497 (quoting <em>El Paso Natural Gas, </em>50 F.3d at 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Cases in the administrative context point to the same conclusion. Although we have described administrative litigants\u2019 interest in \u201c \u2018fair decisionmaking,\u2019 \u201d <em>EPSA, </em>391 F.3d at 1262 (quoting <em>PATCO, </em>685 F.2d at 563) \u2014 analogous to Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s interest in \u201cfair\u201d reelection fights \u2014 as \u201csubstantive,\u201d <em>see Ctr. for Law &amp; Educ. v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>396 F.3d 1152, 1161 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.2005), Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s right to BCRA-compliant electoral contests is also \u201cprocedural\u201d insofar as campaign finance rules establish procedures through which candidates seek reelection. When parties claim standing based on violations of a procedural right, they \u201ccan assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 572 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130; <em>see also Wyo. Outdoor Council v.

Specifically, \u201cso long as the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of [the plaintiffs] that is the ultimate basis of his standing,\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 2130, the party invoking jurisdiction may establish injury in fact by \u201cshowing] that the government act performed without the procedure in question will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of [that party],\u201d <em>Fla. Audubon, </em>94 F.3d at 664. Thus, to repeat <em>Lujan\u2019s, </em>example mentioned earlier, parties living alongside a proposed dam may challenge errors in the construction licensing procedure, \u201ceven though [they] cannot establish with any certainty that [adherence to the procedure] will cause the license to be withheld or altered.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 572 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130. And as we held in <em>EPSA, </em>a repeat litigant may challenge rules on ex parte communications between the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and certain outside parties, even before FERC ever applies them. <em>See </em>391 F.3d at 1262. Insofar as the litigant \u201cis seeking to enforce procedural requirements designed to protect [its] concrete interest in the outcome of hearings to which [it] is a party,\u201d its standing, we explained, \u201cis not defeated by the fact that it cannot show, with any certainty, that its or its members\u2019 financial interests will be damaged by the operation of the ... exemption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">By the same token, Shays and Meehan may challenge FEC subversion of BCRA\u2019s guarantees without \u201cestablishing] with any certainty,\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 572 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130, that the challenged rules will disadvantage their reelection campaigns. Indeed, given the multiplicity of factors bearing on elections and the extreme political sensitivity of judgments about what caused particular candidates to win, requiring candidates to establish that but for certain campaign finance rules they could have won an election seems no more reasonable than requiring plaintiffs to \u201cdemonstrate that, but for the procedural defect, the final outcome of the rulemaking process would have been different\u201d \u2014 precisely the showing that administrative cases do <em>not </em>require. <em>See Ctr. for Law &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Educ., </em>396 F.3d at 1160 (citing <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 572 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130). Because BCRA establishes campaign procedures \u201cdesigned to protect [the Congressmen\u2019s] threatened concrete interest,\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 2130, in winning reelection, Shays and Meehan possess standing to insist on those procedures based on the \u201cdistinct risk,\u201d <em>Fla. Audubon, </em>94 F.3d at 664, documented in their affidavits, that political rivals will exploit the challenged rules to their disadvantage. <em>See Ctr. for Law &amp; Educ., </em>396 F.3d at 1161 n. 3 (indicating that \u201ca federal agency\u2019s arguably <em>ultra vires </em>publications of regulations purporting to authorize ex parte communications in violation of the Sunshine Act\u201d violates \u201csubstantive rights created under the Act,\u201d thus conferring standing on affected litigants challenging those rules (discussing <em>EPSA, </em>391 F.3d at 1261-62)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Again, the FEC, like the dissent, cites <em>McConnell </em>as contrary authority, but again the analogy falls short. Dismissing different parties from those mentioned earlier (\u201cMcConnell plaintiffs\u201d as opposed to \u201cAdams plaintiffs\u201d), the <em>McConnell </em>Court found no standing as to plaintiffs challenging time-limited broadcast restrictions based on one senator\u2019s stated desire to violate them during his next reelection campaign \u2014 then over four years away. <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 224-25, 124 S.Ct. 619. \u201cBecause Senator McConnell\u2019s current term does not expire until 2009,\u201d the Court observed, \u201cthe earliest day he could be affected by [the challenged provision] is 45 days before the Republican primary election in 2008. This alleged injury in fact is too remote temporally to satisfy Article III standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 124 S.Ct. 619. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion that <em>McConnell </em>broadly requires identification of \u201csome specific injury arising from the regulations,\u201d sep. op. at 14 (Henderson, J., dissenting), the Court thus relied entirely on lack of immediacy in finding the McConnell plaintiffs\u2019 injury insufficient for standing. In other words, far from foreclosing standing for regulated parties like Shays and Meehan, the <em>McConnell </em>Court concluded that because any relevant application of the challenged rules would occur far in the future, the McConnell plaintiffs were not in fact \u201csubject to regulation\u201d at all, <em>id. </em>at 84. As House members, Shays and Meehan face reelection every two years \u2014 and indeed undeiwent reelection during the pendency of this appeal. Accordingly, no comparable imminence problem exists here. Following analogous cases such as <em>Lujan, EPSA, </em>and <em>Louisiana Energy </em>\u2014 precedent untouched by <em>McConnell </em>\u2014 we therefore conclude that Shays and Meehan suffer injury in fact insofar as FEC rules permit BCRA-banned practices, thereby depriving the Congressmen of their right to reelection contests conducted in accordance with that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">As to causation, the two Congressmen argue that their asserted injury \u2014 deprivation of fair reelection contests guaranteed by BCRA \u2014 is fairly traceable to the FEC\u2019s rules because absent those rules BCRA\u2019s prohibitions would prevent their opponents from tainting their electoral fights (or at least impose a \u201csanction\u201d for doing so, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(e); <em>see also supra </em>at 82, 84). The FEC. sees the issue quite differently. Since the challenged rules merely permit conduct by others rather than \u201crestrict[ ]\u201d conduct Shays and Meehan would themselves undertake, the Commission insists its rules have caused the Congressmen no harm. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Abundant precedent contradicts the FEC\u2019s .view. In fact, \u201cthe causation requirement for constitutional standing is met when a plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged agency action authorizes the conduct that allegedly caused the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>injuries, if that conduct would allegedly be illegal otherwise.\u201d <em>Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Glickman, </em>154 F.3d 426, 440 (D.C.Cir.1998) (en banc) (upholding standing in a facial challenge to regulations allegedly authorizing statutorily proscribed inhumane treatment of animals) (citing <em>Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 45 n. 25, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). Thus, for example, in <em>Japan Whaling Association v. American Cetacean Society, </em>478 U.S. 221, 106 S.Ct. 2860, 92 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986), scientists and whale-watchers possessed standing even though the agency action they challenged \u2014 failure to certify Japan as a bad apple under international whaling conventions \u2014 limited restraints on whale-hunting rather than imposing them on whale-watching. <em>See id. </em>at 230 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. 2860. Likewise, to repeat examples given above, FERC litigants may challenge administrative procedures that could benefit rivals, <em>see EPSA, </em>391 F.3d at 1261-62, and economic competitors may challenge decisions allowing additional entrants into their markets, <em>see, e.g., Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin., </em>522 U.S. at 488, 118 S.Ct. 927. If it makes no difference in such cases that actual injury depends on action by non-governmental third-parties \u2014 those spearing whales, competing economically, or trading secret missives with FERC \u2014 neither should it matter here that the challenged rules unchain Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s opponents, rather than chaining the two Congressmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Attempting to show otherwise, the FEC once again cites McConnell\u2019s dismissal of the Adams plaintiffs. It insists that based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, the only cause of Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s asserted injury is the Congressmen\u2019s own \u201cchoice\u201d not to fight fire with fire by exploiting FEC safe harbors themselves. This causation theory fails for the same reason the FEC\u2019s injury argument fails. Whereas in <em>McConnell </em>the asserted injury stemmed from no law\u2019s \u201coperation,\u201d 540 U.S. at 228, 124 S.Ct. 619, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s injury-deprivation of BCRA-compliant reelection contests \u2014 exists only insofar as FEC safe harbors permit what BCRA forbids. Consequently, regardless of how Shays and Meehan \u201cchoose\u201d to negotiate the illegally structured environment in which the FEC has placed them, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s injury is \u201cfairly traceable,\u201d <em>e.g., Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 180, 120 S.Ct. 693, to the FEC\u2019s alleged violation of congressional commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Again, substantial precedent reassures us of this conclusion \u2014 precedent <em>McConnell </em>never mentions, much less questions. At bottom, though dealing with the same subject-matter as that case, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s suit is an entirely conventional administrative law claim, i.e., a facial challenge to allegedly invalid regulations affecting the Congressmen\u2019s interests. Viewed in such terms, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s causation theory is unremarkable. As noted earlier, we held in <em>ALDF, </em>based in part on Supreme Court precedent, that \u201ca plaintiff satisfies the causation prong of constitutional standing by establishing that the challenged agency rule permitted the activity that allegedly injured her, when that activity would allegedly have been illegal otherwise.\u201d 154 F.3d at 440-41. <em>Japan Whaling </em>rests on the same view. Although there the injury-defining law was a whale-harvesting treaty rather than a campaign finance statute, the causal theory was identical: by tolerating what the law condemned, the government caused plaintiffs\u2019 injury. <em>See Japan Whaling, </em>478 U.S. at 230 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. 2860. Likewise, in competition cases, the Supreme Court has upheld challenges to rules allowing competition allegedly prohibited by statute \u2014 again, a claim that parallels Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin., </em>522 U.S. at 488, 118 S.Ct. 927; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Data Processing, </em>397 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Although the FEC insists this case falls outside the conventional rule because Shays and Meehan possess the same legal options as them rivals and thus could potentially benefit from the challenged rules, our case law shows otherwise. Ordinarily, of course, mimicking injurious conduct does nothing to interrupt causation: the whale-watchers in <em>Japan Whaling </em>could hardly protect their pastime by joining the hunt. And while here use of challenged rules could perhaps mitigate any harm to Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s electoral prospects, the same was true in <em>EPSA, </em>where the disputed regulations, which allowed ex parte communication with certain third parties called market monitors, could well have helped, rather than hurt, the petitioner. There, far from suggesting that potential benefit foreclosed standing, we held that petitioner satisfied Article III because it \u201croutinely appeared] before FERC in contested hearings in which market monitors have an interest,\u201d 391 F.3d at 1262 \u2014 a condition that created opportunity for benefit as well as detriment. Similarly, in Lujan\u2019s dam example, affected parties could insist on statutorily required procedures even though adherence to those procedures might well hasten, not prevent, the dam\u2019s construction. <em>See </em>504 U.S. at 572-73 &amp; nn. 7-8, 112 S.Ct. 2130. As in these cases, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s injury entails deprivation of a statutory right to \u201c\u2018fair decisionmaking,\u2019\u201d <em>EPSA, </em>391 F.3d at 1262 (quoting <em>PATCO, </em>685 F.2d at 563). Accordingly, FEC rules structuring reelection contests in violation of that right cause harm regardless of whether those rules ultimately hurt or help the Congressmen\u2019s reelection prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">To illustrate the counterintuitive character of the FEC\u2019s position, we think it worth noting that were the Commission\u2019s causation argument correct, Shays and Meehan would never have standing to challenge the rules. Even if an opponent made express use of illegal safe harbors, even if that use demonstrably influenced voters, and indeed even if Shays and Meehan responded by seeking administrative enforcement and then challenging the FEC\u2019s dismissal of their complaint \u2014 a review procedure the Commission urges the Congressmen to follow in its ripeness argument, <em>see infra </em>at 95-96 \u2014 the Congressmen would nevertheless lack standing. As the FEC sees it, even then, Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s own scruples, not allegedly illegal FEC rules, would have caused their injury. Although \u201can inescapable result of any standing doctrine application is that at least some disputes will not receive judicial review,\u201d <em>Fla. Audubon, </em>94 F.3d at 665, that result would be surprising here given that Shays and Meehan, as directly regulated parties, are the most natural challengers for these rules, and agency regulations are ordinarily subject to review. <em>Cf. Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, </em>476 U.S. 667, 670, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986) (noting \u201cthe strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action\u201d); <em>United States v. Nourse, </em>34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 8, 28-29, 9 L.Ed. 31 (1835) (Marshall, C.J.) (\u201cIt would excite some surprise if, in a government of laws and of principle, ... a ministerial officer might, at his discretion, issue this powerful process, ... leaving to that debtor no remedy, no appeal to the laws of his country ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Accordingly, finding <em>McConnell </em>distinguishable, and following the long line of cases holding that affected parties may challenge regulations allowing what a statute prohibits, <em>see, e.g., Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin., </em>522 U.S. at 488, 118 S.Ct. 927; <em>Data Processing, </em>397 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. 827; <em>Japan Whaling, </em>478 U.S. at 230 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. 2860; <em>ALDF, </em>154 F.3d at 440, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>conclude that Shays and Meehan have shown causation, as well as injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This leaves only redressability. The FEC doesn\u2019t dispute this element, nor could it, for \u201c[w]here an agency rule causes the injury, as here, the redressability requirement may be satisfied by vacating the challenged rule.\u201d <em>Ctr. for Energy &amp; Econ. Dev. v. EPA, </em>398 F.3d 653, 657 (D.C.Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Thus, Shays and Meehan have satisfied all three requirements of constitutional standing. \u201c[Fjorced,\u201d as they put it, to seek reelection in illegally structured contests, the Congressmen seek no mere \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d \u2014 the evil Article III averts, <em>see Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 96-97 &amp; n. 14, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Rather, because invalidation of FEC safe harbors permitting what BCRA bans would vindicate Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s right to BCRA-compliant elections, the two Congressmen possess \u201csuch a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult ... questions,\u201d <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). Having reached this conclusion, we need not consider Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s fallback argument that the challenged rules\u2019 effects on disclosure requirements give them \u201cinformational standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>Ripeness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In addition to challenging standing, the FEC argues that Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s suit is unripe. A further requirement of justiciability, albeit one \u201c \u2018drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d ripeness \u201crequires us to evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Park Hospitality Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>538 U.S. 803, 808, 123 S.Ct. 2026, 155 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2003) (quoting <em>Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 43, 57 n. 18, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993)). Under our case law, \u201cthe primary focus of the ripeness doctrine is to balance the petitioners\u2019 interest in prompt consideration of allegedly unlawful agency action against the agency\u2019s interest in crystallizing its policy before that policy is subject to review and the court\u2019s interest in avoiding unnecessary adjudication and in deciding issues in a concrete setting.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Corp. v. FCC, </em>349 F.3d 692, 699 (D.C.Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Here, as to fitness, because this case is \u201cpurely one of statutory interpretation,\u201d <em>Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 457, 479, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001), the issues are \u201cpurely legal\u201d and thus \u201cpresumptively suitable to judicial review,\u201d <em>AT &amp; T, </em>349 F.3d at 699 (internal quotation marks omitted). In fact, in this ease, no \u201ccrystalliz[ationj\u201d of the disputed policies will ever occur, for as Shays and Meehan point out, conduct protected by the challenged safe harbors will <em>never </em>be subject to enforcement proceedings. (As noted earlier, good-faith reliance on FEC regulations affords a defense against FEC sanction, <em>see </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(e).) For that very reason, moreover, the regulations also cause hardship. By removing certain conduct from any risk of enforcement, the challenged safe harbors establish \u201clegal rights\u201d to engage in that conduct, thus \u201ccreating] adverse effects of a strictly legal kind.\u201d <em>See Ohio Forestry Ass\u2019n v. Sierra Club, </em>523 U.S. 726, 733, 118 S.Ct. 1665, 140 L.Ed.2d 921 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Making a related point, the FEC also suggests that because FECA permits judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>cial review to determine whether even noi7-enforcement decisions are \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d <em>see 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 437g(a)(8); <em>supra </em>at 83, Shays and Meehan cannot show that \u201cno other adequate remedy in a court\u201d exists, as required for APA jurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704; <em>see generally Nat\u2019l Wrestling Coaches Ass\u2019n, </em>366 F.3d at 945. We think this claim even weaker. To begin with, although we have identified \u201cimpermissible interpretation of the Act\u201d as an element of the \u201ccontrary to law\u201d test, we did so in a case reviewing an advisory opinion, not an FEC regulation. <em>See Orloski v. FEC, </em>795 F.2d 156, 161 (D.C.Cir. 1986). Were a regulation applicable, given that reliance on that regulation would afford a defense to \u201cany sanction,\u201d <em>see 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 438(e), the court might well uphold FEC non-enforcement without ever reaching the regulation\u2019s validity. <em>Cf. Chamber of Commerce, </em>69 F.3d at 603 (identifying the risk of enforcement under section 437g(a)(8) as a basis for standing though going on to invalidate the rule that would thus be enforced). Moreover, because of that defense, the particular conduct at issue could never be sanctioned, though penalties might have been possible under valid rules. Given these deficiencies, this alternative remedy hardly appears adequate, and so poses no barrier to Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s facial challenge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On the merits, we undertake our analysis pursuant to two familiar standards of review: <em>Chevron </em>and the Administrative Procedure Act. As both sides agree, because the regulations at issue interpret statutes the FEC administers, we review them under the two-step analysis set forth in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), asking first \u201cwhether Congress has spoken \u2018directly- ... to the precise question at issue,\u2019 \u201d and second, if it has not, whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>See AFL-CIO v. FEC, </em>333 F.3d 168, 172-73 (D.C.Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Chevron, 467 </em>U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778) (reviewing FEC regulations). At the same time, because the regulations reflect final agency action under the APA, we ask whether they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Applying these standards here, we affirm the district court\u2019s invalidation of all five rules at issue in this appeal. In reviewing each rule, we begin with <em>Chevron </em>step one, asking whether the rule runs counter to the \u201cunambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\u201d <em>Chevron, 467 </em>U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. We conclude that two rules \u2014 the \u201csolicit\u201d/\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201celectioneering communication\u201d definitions \u2014 fail this threshold inquiry. As to the remaining three \u2014 the coordinated communication standard, salary allocation provision, and de minimis exemption \u2014 -we affirm the district court\u2019s invalidation on APA grounds without reaching <em>Chevron </em>step two. As our cases explain, \u201cour inquiry at the second step of <em>Chevron, </em>i.e., whether an ambiguous statute has been interpreted reasonably, overlaps with the arbitrary and capricious standard,\u201d <em>Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. FEC, 76 </em>F.3d 1234, 1235 (D.C.Cir.1996) (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Regulatory Utility Comm\u2019rs v. ICC, </em>41 F.3d 721, 726-27 (D.C.Cir.1994)), for \u201c[wjhether a statute is unreasonably interpreted is close analytically to the issue whether an agency\u2019s actions under a statute are unreasonable,\u201d <em>Gen. Instrument Corp. v. FCC, </em>213 F.3d 724, 732 (D.C.Cir. 2000); <em>see also Gen. Am. Transp. Co. v. ICC, </em>872 F.2d 1048, 1053 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\u201cBoth questions require us to determine whether the Commission, in effecting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>reconciliation of competing statutory aims, has rationally considered the factors deemed relevant by the Act.\u201d). Here, we need not decide whether these three rules represent altogether impermissible interpretations of FECA and BCRA \u2014 the <em>Chevron </em>step two inquiry, see <em>Bluewater Network v. EPA, </em>372 F.3d 404, 410 (D.C.Cir.2004) (indicating that at <em>Chevron </em>step two we \u201cdefer to the agency\u2019s interpretation as long as it is \u2018based on a permissible construction of the statute\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778)) \u2014 because in any event the FEC has given no rational justification for them, as required by the APA\u2019s arbitrary and capricious standard, <em>see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (interpreting the APA to require that agencies \u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for [them] action including \u2018a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962))).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\n<em>Coordinated Communication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ax8\">FECA has long restricted coordination of election-related spending between official campaigns and outside groups. The reason for this is obvious. Without a coordination rule, politicians could evade contribution limits and other restrictions by having donors finance campaign activity directly \u2014 say, paying for a TV ad or printing and distributing posters. To avoid such subterfuge, FECA defines \u201ccontribution\u201d to include any \u201cexpenditure[] made in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate,\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(7)(B)(i), and then defines \u201cexpenditure\u201d as any purchase, payment, loan, or gift \u201cmade ... for the purpose of influencing\u201d a federal election, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 431(9)(A). Thus, if someone makes a purchase or gift with the purpose <em>of </em>influencing an election and does so in cooperation with a candidate, FECA counts that payment as a campaign contribution. At the same time, and as a further stopgap, FECA\u2019s coordination provision designates any \u201cfinancing ... of the dissemination, distribution, or republication\u201d of campaign materials as an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d and thus as a \u201ccontribution\u201d when coordinated. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 441 a(a)(7)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">BCRA made two important changes to these provisions. First, as part of its effort to reign in party fundraising, the statute added a coordination rule for parties comparable to the preexisting rule for candidates. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 441a(a)(7)(B)(ii). Second, and more important here, Congress ordered the FEC to rewrite its regulations interpreting these provisions with respect to \u201ccoordinated communication.\u201d <em>See </em>BCRA \u00a7 214(c), 116 Stat. 81, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Under pre-BCRA regulations, the FEC determined whether public communications such as radio and television ads were \u201ccoordinated\u201d based largely on whether the candidate had engaged in \u201csubstantial discussion or negotiation\u201d with an outsider, resulting in \u201ccollaboration or agreement.\u201d <em>See Shays, </em>337 F.Supp.2d at 55-56 &amp; n. 25 (quoting old regulation). Absent that degree of cooperation, the communication was considered uncoordinated and thus would not count as a FECA contribution. BCRA instructed the Commission to scrap this approach. \u201cThe regulations on coordinated communications ... are repealed,\u201d Congress declared. \u201cThe Federal Election Commission shall promulgate new regulations on coordinated communications paid for by persons other than candidates, authorized committees of candidates, and party committees. The regulations shall not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination.\u201d BCRA \u00a7 214(c), 116 Stat. at 95. Apart from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>negative command \u2014 \u201cshall not require\u201d\u2014 BCRA merely listed several topics the rules \u201cshall address,\u201d providing no guidance as to how the FEC should address them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Acting pursuant to this open-ended directive, the FEC adopted the regulation at issue here. Under its new test, communications count as \u201ccoordinated\u201d (and thus as contributions) if: (1) someone other than the candidate, party, or official campaign pays for them, (2) the communication itself meets specified \u201ccontent standards,\u201d and (3) the payer\u2019s interaction with the eandidate/party satisfies specified \u201cconduct standards.\u201d 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109.21. Under the \u201ccontent\u201d element \u2014 the only component at issue here \u2014 communications made within 120 days of a general election or primary and \u201cdirected\u201d at the relevant electorate may qualify as \u201ccoordinated\u201d if they refer to a political party or \u201cclearly identified candidate for Federal office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 109.21(c)(4). Before the 120-day mark, the rule covers only communications that either recycle official campaign materials or \u201cexpressly advocate[ ] the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 109.21(e)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">According to Shays and Meehan, this limitation on the rule\u2019s coverage outside the 120-day window offers politicians and their supporters an unreasonably generous safe harbor. Several examples should help illustrate them concerns. Under the new rules, more than 120 days before an election or primary, a candidate may sit down -with a well-heeled supporter and say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you run some ads about my record on tax cuts?\u201d The two may even sign a formal written agreement providing for such ads. Yet so long as the supporter neither recycles campaign materials nor employs the \u201cmagic words\u201d of express advocacy \u2014 \u201cvote for,\u201d \u201cvote against,\u201d \u201celect,\u201d and so forth \u2014 the ads won\u2019t qualify as contributions subject to FECA. Ads stating \u201cCongressman X voted 85 times to lower your taxes\u201d or \u201ctell candidate Y your family can\u2019t pay the government more\u201d are just fine. And even within 120 days of the election (though Shays and Meehan appear not to challenge this aspect of the rule), supporters need only avoid communications that identify candidates or parties by name. Ads regarding, say, economic effects of high taxes or tragic consequences of foreign wars are not contributions \u2014 again, even if formally coordinated with the official campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The district court held that nothing in BCRA permits such content-based exclusions. Although the court rejected Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s <em>Chevron </em>one argument, explaining that because BCRA ordered promulgation of new regulations while \u201cprovid[ing] no express guidance on the matter of content restrictions,\u201d Congress had not spoken directly to the issue, <em>see </em>337 F.Supp.2d at 61-62, it held that the FEC\u2019s regulations \u201cundercut[] FECA\u2019s statutory purposes\u201d and thus were \u201centitled to no. <em>[Chevron </em>two] deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64-65. \u201cA communication that is coordinated with a candidate or political party,\u201d the district court wrote, \u201chas value to the political actor. To exclude certain types of communications regardless of whether or not they are coordinated would create an immense loophole that would facilitate the circumvention of the Act\u2019s contribution limits, thereby creating \u2018the potential for gross abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65 (quoting <em>Orloski, </em>795 F.2d at 165).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">We reach the same result, though for slightly different reasons. Regarding <em>Chevron </em>step one, we agree that Congress has not spoken directly to the issue at hand. To be sure, it seems hard to imagine that Representatives and Senators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>voting for BCRA would have expected regulations like these. Although Congress abrogated the FEC\u2019s old \u201ccollaboration or agreement\u201d standard, the new rule permits significant categories of expression \u2014 e.g., non-express advocacy more than 120 days before an election \u2014 even where formal collaboration or agreement occurs. And while BCRA\u2019s \u201celectioneering communication\u201d provisions (mentioned earlier and discussed below, <em>see infra </em>at 101, 107 -108) disavow the \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d test \u2014 a standard <em>McConnell </em>describes as \u201cfunctionally meaningless,\u201d 540 U.S. at 193, 124 S.Ct. 619 \u2014 the FEC has resurrected that standard here, allowing unrestricted collaboration outside the 120 days so long as the communication\u2019s paymasters avoid magic words and redistribution. That said, in the BCRA provision most clearly on point \u2014 the directive calling for new regulations \u2014 Congress studiously avoided prescribing any specific standard, save abrogation of the \u201ccollaboration or agreement\u201d test. Given this \u201clack of guidance in the statute,\u201d we cannot say that BCRA clearly forecloses the FEC\u2019s approach. <em>See George E. Warren Corp. v. EPA, </em>159 F.3d 616, 624 (D.C.Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Nor do we see clearly contrary intent, as do Shays and Meehan, in FECA\u2019s preexisting \u201cexpenditure\u201d and \u201ccontribution\u201d definitions. True, under the statute, coordinated expenditures \u201cshall be considered to be a contribution,\u201d so if a communication involves \u201cexpenditure\u201d and is made \u201cin cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of\u2019 a candidate or party \u2014 the provision\u2019s two elements, <em>see </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(7)(B)(i), (ii)\u2014 then the FEC lacks discretion to exclude that communication from its coordinated communication rule. Yet to qualify as \u201cexpenditure\u201d in the first place, spending must be undertaken \u201cfor the purpose of influencing\u201d a federal election (or else involve \u201cfinancing\u201d for redistribution of campaign materials). <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431(9)(A), 441a(a)(7)(B)(iii). And as the FEC points out, time, place, and content may be critical indicia of communicative purpose. While election-related intent is obvious, for example, in statements urging voters to \u201celect\u201d or \u201cdefeat\u201d a specified candidate or party, the same may not be true of ads identifying a federal politician but focusing on pending legislation \u2014 a proposed budget, for example, or government reform initiatives \u2014 and appearing three years before the next election. Nor is such purpose necessarily evident in statements referring, say, to a Connecticut senator but running only in San Francisco media markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Insofar as such statements may relate to political or legislative goals independent from any electoral race \u2014 goals like influencing legislators\u2019 votes or increasing public awareness \u2014 we cannot conclude that Congress unambiguously intended to count them as \u201cexpenditures\u201d (and thus as \u201ccontributions\u201d when coordinated). To the contrary, giving appropriate <em>Chevron </em>deference, we think the FEC could construe the expenditure definition\u2019s purposive language as leaving space for collaboration between politicians and outsiders on legislative and political issues involving only a weak nexus to any electoral campaign. Moreover, we can hardly fault the FEC\u2019s effort to develop an \u201cobjective, bright-line test [that] does not unduly compromise the Act\u2019s purposes,\u201d considering that we approved just such a test for \u201ccontribution\u201d in <em>Orloski </em>795 F.2d at 165. Accordingly, we reject Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s argument that FECA precludes content-based standards under <em>Chevron </em>step one. And for the same reasons, we disagree with the district court\u2019s suggestion that any standard looking beyond collaboration to content would necessarily \u201ccreate an immense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>loophole,\u201d thus exceeding the range of permissible readings under <em>Chevron </em>step two, 337 F.Supp.2d at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In our view, the challenged regulation\u2019s fatal defect is not that the FEC drew distinctions based on content, time, and place, but rather that, contrary to the APA, the Commission offered no persuasive justification for the provisions challenged by Shays and Meehan, i.e., the 120-day time-frame and the weak restraints applying outside of it. As noted earlier, <em>McConnell </em>describes the express advocacy test, which before BCRA distinguished advocacy subject to FECA from unregulated \u201cissue\u201d ads, as \u201cfunctionally meaningless.\u201d 540 U.S. at 193, 124 S.Ct. 619. \u201cNot only can advertisers easily evade the line by eschewing use of magic words, but they would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the 1998 election cycle, just 4% of candidate advertisements used magic words; in 2000, that number was a mere 5%.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127 n. 18, 124 S.Ct. 619. Of course, express advocacy could hardly fail to count as expenditure; statements like \u201cvote for\u201d clearly aim to influence elections. Nor could the FEC permit redistribution of campaign material, since the statute unambiguously designates that activity as \u201cexpenditure\u201d for purposes of this provision. <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(7)(B)(iii). Yet the Commission took the further step of deeming these two categories adequate by themselves to capture the universe of electorally oriented communication outside the 120-day window. That action requires some cogent explanation, not least because by employing a \u201cfunctionally meaningless\u201d standard outside that period, the FEC has in effect allowed a coordinated communication free-for-all for much of each election cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We see nothing in the FEC\u2019s official explanation that satisfies APA standards. The Commission\u2019s source for the 120-day period was an unrelated BCRA provision requiring hard money financing for state party voter registration drives within 120 days of an election. <em>See </em>68 Fed.Reg. at 430 (describing the 120-day period for coordinated communication as \u201cbased on 2 U.S.C. 431(20)(A)(i),\u201d which defines such registration drives as \u201cFederal election activity\u201d); 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b) (restricting financing of \u201cFederal election activity\u201d). Drawing on this provision, the FEC explained that \u201cCongress has, in part, defined \u2018Federal election activity\u2019 in terms of a 120-day time frame, deeming that period of time before an election to be reasonably related to that election.\u201d 68 Fed.Reg. at 430. Yet this observation has no bearing on the issue before us absent evidence that registration activity and electoral advocacy occur on similar cycles. For all we know from this record, registration efforts may significantly influence elections only in the immediate run-up to the vote, whereas candidate-centered advertisements may affect voters even when broadcast more than 120 days before the race closes. In fact, in a companion provision to the voter registration rule, BCRA imposes even stricter financing restrictions \u2014 without temporal limitation \u2014 on \u201cpublic communication^] that refer[] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office ... and that pro-motet] or support[] a candidate for that office, or attackt ] or opposet ] a candidate for that office.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(20)(A)(iii). Although the FEC acknowledged that its 120-day content standard was \u201cmore conservative\u201d than this provision, <em>see </em>68 Fed. Reg. at 430, it never explained why the time-frame for voter registration was more relevant than BCRA\u2019s rule for \u201cpublic communications,\u201d seemingly a far more comparable subject-matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Besides citing the voter registration rule, the FEC listed two \u201cadvantages\u201d of the 120-day time-frame: \u201cFirst, it provides a \u2018bright-line\u2019 rule. Second, it focus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>es the regulation on activity reasonably close to an election, but not so distant from the election as to implicate political discussion at other times.\u201d 68 Fed.Reg. at 430. The first of these bromides provides no independent basis for the rule: a bright line can be drawn in the wrong place. The second does not so much answer the question as ask it. <em>Why </em>is 120 days \u201creasonably close\u201d but not \u201cso distant\u201d? Without further explanation, we have no assurance that 120 days reasonably defines the period before an election when non-express advocacy likely relates to purposes other than \u201cinfluencing\u201d a federal election \u2014 the line drawn by the statute\u2019s \u201cexpenditure\u201d definition, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Taking a new tack in its briefs, the FEC now argues that BCRA itself indicates that 120 days is reasonable because a statutory provision on \u201celectioneering communications\u201d \u2014 ads that automatically count as \u201ccontributions\u201d when coordinated with a candidate \u2014 includes a 30/60-day time-frame. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 434(f)(3), 441a(a)(7)(C). The \u201celectioneering communication\u201d concept, discussed at greater length below, covers radio and television advertisements that (1) clearly identify a candidate or party, (2) target the relevant electorate, and (3) appear within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 434(f)(3)(A); <em>infra </em>at 107 -108. Obviously similar to the content standard for the 120-day period, the \u201celectioneering communication\u201d definition differs principally in that it is limited to radio and television, whereas the content standard applies to other media as well. <em>See </em>68 Fed.Reg. at 429-30. Although in its explanation the FEC sought to distinguish the shorter time-frame for these communications rather than rely on it as justification for the 120-day rule, <em>see </em>68 Fed.Reg. at 430, the Commission now insists that if 30-60 days is reasonable for these ads, then \u201cthe Commission\u2019s drawing of a temporal line two to four times as far from the election for similar communications that are coordinated is surely permissible.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 32-33. Even assuming this \u201cpost hoc rationalization[ ] for agency action\u201d is properly before us, <em>see Secs. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., </em>468 U.S. 137, 143-44, 104 S.Ct. 2979, 82 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984), we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">For one thing, the proposition that 120 is twice 60 and four times 30, though arithmetically indisputable, is no reason to select that number over any other. Why not triple 60, or multiply 30 by one-and-a-half? Alternatively, if 30 to 60 days is too short, as the FEC indicated in its explanation, <em>see </em>68 Fed.Reg. at 430, why not go all the way and apply the standard at all times, as in the \u201cpublic communication\u201d provision discussed earlier? In any event, while \u201celectioneering\u201d ads are clearly one category of communications that may count as coordinated expenditures under BCRA, nothing in the statute suggests they represent the only \u2014 or even primary \u2014 such category. Acknowledging as much, the FEC\u2019s own rule rejects the electioneering definition\u2019s time limit (expanding it to 120 from 30/60), as well as its media limitations (including print advertising and other media besides radio and TV). By the same token, nothing should prevent the FEC from regulating other categories of non-electioneering speech \u2014 non-express advocacy, for example- \u2014 outside the 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Finally, the FEC points out that limiting its standard to express advocacy and campaign redistribution outside the 120 days preserves space for political activities unrelated to elections. True enough, but so would regulating nothing at all, and that would hardly comport with the statute. Notwithstanding its obligation to \u201cattempt to avoid unnecessarily infringing on First Amendment interests,\u201d <em>AFL-CIO, </em>333 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>F.3d at 179, the Commission must establish, consistent with APA standards, that its rule rationally separates election-related advocacy from other activity falling outside FECA\u2019s expenditure definition. <em>See State Farm, </em>463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856 (\u201c[T]he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The record before us, however, provides no assurance that the FEC\u2019s standard does not permit substantial coordinated expenditure, thus tossing out the proverbial baby (spending qualifying as contributions) with the bath water (political advocacy). <em>Cf. AFL-CIO, </em>333 F.3d at 179 (invalidating rule where FEC \u201cfail[ed] to undertake ... tailoring\u201d consistent with First Amendment interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">For their part, Shays and Meehan argue not only that the FEC has in fact failed to justify its standard, but also that doing so would be impossible. In support of this claim, they urge us to take judicial notice that substantial election-oriented advertising occurred beyond the 120-day window in recent presidential races, a fact that, if true, would undercut the Commission\u2019s view that it has drawn the line in the right place. That factual assertion, however, is better directed to the FEC\u2019s expertise, and indeed illustrates the sort of inquiry the Commission should have undertaken. Do candidates in fact limit campaign-related advocacy to the four months surrounding elections, or does substantial election-related communication occur outside that window? Do congressional, senatorial, and presidential races \u2014 all covered by this rule \u2014 occur on the same cycle, or should different rules apply to each? And, perhaps most important, to the extent election-related advocacy now occurs primarily within 120 days, would candidates and collaborators aiming to influence elections simply shift coordinated spending outside that period to avoid the challenged rules\u2019 restrictions? The FEC must carefully consider these questions, for if it draws the line in the wrong place, its action will permit exactly what BCRA aims to prevent: evasion of campaign finance restrictions through unregulated collaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In sum, while we accept the FEC\u2019s premise that time, place, and content may illuminate communicative purpose and thus distinguish FECA \u201cexpenditures\u201d from other communications, we detect no support in the record for the specific content-based standard the Commission has promulgated. Accordingly, finding the rule arbitrary and capricious under the APA, we shall affirm the district court\u2019s invalidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\n<em>\u201cSolicit\u201d and \u201cDirect\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">As noted earlier, one of BCRA\u2019s main objectives is to shut down the so-called \u201csoft money\u201d system whereby political parties employed funds outside FECA\u2019s controls to finance political activities related, to federal elections. The \u201ccornerstone\u201d of this effort, <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 133, 124 S.Ct. 619, a new prohibition on soft-money fundraising by national party organizations, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">A national committee of a political party (including a national congressional campaign committee of a political party) may not solicit, receive, or direct to another person a contribution, donation, or transfer of funds or any other thing of value, or spend any funds, that are not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(a)(l). The same prohibition extends to the national party committees\u2019 officers and agents, as well as subordinate entities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 441i(a)(2). In addition, federal candidates and officehold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ers may not \u201csolicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend\u201d soft money, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4411(e), nor may national, state, or local party organizations \u201csolicit\u201d or \u201cmake or direct\u201d contributions to certain tax-exempt groups, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 441i(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Shays and Meehan challenge FEC regulations interpreting \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d with respect to these provisions. In effect, the Commission has interpreted both terms to mean \u201cask.\u201d Under its new regulations, \u201cto solicit means to ask that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value,\u201d whether that gift is made \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cthrough a conduit or intermediary.\u201d 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.2(m). \u201c[T]o direct means to ask a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution, donation, or transfer of funds, or to provide anything of value, to make that contribution, donation, or transfer of funds, or to provide that thing of value, including through a conduit or intermediary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300.2(d). Thus, in the FEC\u2019s view, fundraisers \u201csolicit\u201d money when they ask for it (as in, \u201cplease give to the party\u201d) and they \u201cdirect\u201d contributions when they ask for them following an expression of interest, such as when a donor says, \u201cI\u2019ve got money to burn\u201d and the politician responds, \u201cwhy not give it to X?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Whether this interpretation is reasonable depends on the meaning of \u201cask.\u201d Shays and Meehan ai'gue that this term, as used in the regulations, requires \u201can outright, explicit request \u2014 \u2018please give\u2019 \u2014 that is contained in a single communication.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 28. The district court shared this view, finding it supported by the FEC\u2019s explanatory statement that \u201c[b]y using the term \u2018ask,\u2019 the Commission defined \u2018solicit\u2019 to require some affirmative verbalization or writing, thereby providing members of Congress, candidates and committees with an understandable standard,\u201d Contribution Limitations &amp; Prohibitions, 67 Fed.Reg. 69,928, 69,942 (Nov. 19, 2002). <em>See Shays, </em>337 F.Supp.2d at 78-79. Read this way, as the district court observed, the rule permits national parties, candidates, and officeholders \u201cto funnel nonfederal money into different organizations by simply not \u2018asking\u2019 the donors to do so, but using more nuanced forms of solicitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79. Shays and Meehan offer the following examples. Under the regulation, \u201ca Senator who told a group of party donors that \u2018it\u2019s important for our state party to receive at least $100,000 from each of you in this election\u2019 \u2014 with or without an accompanying wink \u2014 would not have \u2018asked\u2019 under the Commission\u2019s regulations,\u201d and thus would have neither \u201csolicited\u201d nor \u201cdirected\u201d funds in violation of BCRA. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 30. Likewise, statements like <em>\u201cX </em>is an effective state party organization; it needs to get as many $100,000 contributions as possible\u201d would again neither \u201csolicit\u201d nor \u201cdirect\u201d because they would not \u201cask.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In its briefs, the FEC questions this reading of the regulations, even calling it a \u201cstraw man.\u201d Reply Br. at 11. At oral argument, however, Commission counsel was unable to reassure us that the rules would cover \u201cnuanced\u201d situations like Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s hypotheticals. Indeed, though pressed to represent the FEC\u2019s views, counsel went no further than to call the Congressmen\u2019s hypotheticals \u201cgray area[s],\u201d stating that he \u201csimply can\u2019t predict how the Commission would vote on them.\u201d That response came as no surprise, for the FEC\u2019s official explanatory statement abundantly supports the narrow reading that the Congressmen, like the district court, find embodied in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">During the rulemaking, commenters called the FEC\u2019s definition \u201ctoo narrow.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>67 Fed.Reg. at 69,942. They advocated construing \u201csolicit\u201d to mean \u201crequest, suggest or recommend,\u201d as Commission staff had proposed. <em>Id. </em>Yet the Commission rejected this alternative, deeming it inconsistent with \u201cthe need for clear definitions to avoid ambiguity, vagueness and confusion as to what activities or conversations would constitute solicitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Explaining the distinction, the Commission observed that it objected to \u201cthe impressionistic or subjective aspects of the term \u2018suggest\u2019 and \u2018request.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hile the terms \u2018suggest\u2019 or \u2018request\u2019 ... encompass a wide array of activity, it is not clear that they would cover more direct verbalizations or writings captured by terms such as \u2018demand,\u2019 \u2018instruct,\u2019 or \u2018tell,\u2019 which the Commission believes are captured by the term \u2018ask.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">The Commission was unwilling to use the far more expansive term \u201csuggest,\u201d for concern that such a vague term could subject persons to investigation and prosecution based on highly subjective judgments about whether a particular remark or action constituted \u201csuggestion.\u201d The definition of \u201csolicit\u201d is intended to include a palpable communication intended to, and reasonably understood to, convey a request for some action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Although the FEC\u2019s explanation thus suggested that statements \u201creasonably understood\u201d as \u201casking\u201d could qualify as such, the Commission could not have intended thereby to suggest that its rule covered indirect requests, for that interpretation would overlook the distinction the FEC drew between \u201cask\u201d and \u201csuggest.\u201d According to the FEC, \u201cask\u201d covers \u201cdirect\u201d statements \u2014 expressions \u201ccaptured\u201d by verbs such as \u201cdemand\u201d and \u201ctell\u201d \u2014 whereas \u201csuggest\u201d does not. Thus, by lopping off \u201csuggest\u201d (as well as \u201crecommend\u201d) from the staff proposal and sticking just with \u201cask\u201d (which the Commission deemed \u201cessentially synonymous\u201d with \u201crequest,\u201d <em>id.), </em>the FEC eliminated the definition\u2019s indirect component. This produced a narrowing construction, one that \u201cmark[s] the boundary between permissible and impermissible solicitations,\u201d <em>id., </em>leaving unregulated a \u201cwide array of activity\u201d \u2014 like the conduct in Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s two hypotheticals \u2014 that the term \u201csolicit\u201d could plausibly cover. Whereas \u201csolicit\u201d might otherwise cover coded statements, not to mention winks and nods, the FEC, by limiting its rule to \u201caffirmative verbalization or writing,\u201d has spared itself any need to scrutinize such exchanges. Nor will the FEC have any need to delve into \u201csubjective\u201d meaning indicated by context. Under the rule, it may simply determine whether the fundraiser in question made an explicit request.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Reinforcing this view, we note that the FEC\u2019s construction of its regulations comports with the most natural meaning of \u201cask.\u201d Of course, we can imagine describing Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s hypothetical Senator as \u201casking\u201d for money by saying \u201cit\u2019s important that the party receive $100,000,\u201d just as we can imagine saying \u201cmy mother asked me to come home\u201d when what she said was \u201cI love it when you visit.\u201d But this is hardly the most natural use of the word \u201cask,\u201d which ordinarily means \u201cto call upon for an answer\u201d or \u201cto make a request\u201d \u2014 terms implying a direct question or demand, rather than a statement of fact or opinion. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>128 (1993). Moreover, using only \u201cask\u201d rather than a series of verbs would seem odd unless the FEC intended to narrow the statute\u2019s meaning to that word\u2019s principle definition \u2014 i.e., \u201ccalling for an answer\u201d as opposed to \u201csuggesting\u201d or \u201cindicating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Thus, in proceeding with our <em>Chevron </em>/APA inquiry, we assume the regulations mean what the FEC\u2019s official explanation says they do, i.e., that the FEC definitions require an explicit direct request for money \u2014 an interpretation FEC counsel refused to disavow at oral argument. Adopting this same view, the district court deemed the FEC\u2019s definitions unreasonable under <em>Chevron </em>step two. According to the court, although the terms \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d were not so clear as to preclude the regulations under <em>Chevron </em>step one, the rules\u2019 construction of these terms to cover only direct requests \u201c \u2018create[d] the potential for gross abuse,\u2019 \u201d thus defying Congress\u2019s evident purpose of \u201cdivorc[ing] national political parties, as well as candidates for federal office and federal officeholders, from the nonfederal money business.\u201d 337 F.Supp.2d at 74-76, 78-79 (quoting Orloski, 795 F.2d at 165). We agree, though we locate our holding under <em>Chevron </em>one, rather than two.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In undertaking our <em>Chevron </em>step one inquiry into \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\u201d we employ \u201cthe traditional tools of statutory construction,\u201d <em>see Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43 &amp; n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, including \u201cexamination of the statute\u2019s text, legislative history, and structure[,] as well as its purpose,\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Tel. Cos. v. FCC, </em>131 F.3d 1044, 1047 (D.C.Cir.1997) (citations omitted). As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \u201c[i]n determining whether Congress has specifically addressed the question at issue, a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation. The meaning \u2014 or ambiguity \u2014 of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d <em>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U.S. 120, 132, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Here, even setting context aside, we think \u201csolicit\u201d (if not also \u201cdirect\u201d) more naturally connotes an indirect request than does \u201cask,\u201d at least in the narrow sense of \u201casking\u201d that the FEC\u2019s rule employs. To give an example, a charity brochure on starving children might well \u201csolicit\u201d though it doesn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d in the sense of \u201ccalling for an answer.\u201d <em>Cf. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co., </em>505 U.S. 214, 223, 112 S.Ct. 2447, 120 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992) (considering it \u201cevident\u201d that the term \u201csolicitation of orders\u201d \u201cincludes, not just explicit verbal requests for orders, but also any speech or conduct that implicitly invites an order\u201d). But in any event, although \u201c \u2018[sjolicifi can, of course, mean a variety of things,\u201d <em>Martin Tractor Co. v. FEC, </em>627 F.2d 375, 383 (D.C.Cir.1980), in the context of this case we find the FEC\u2019s narrow interpretation of that term (as well as \u201cdirect\u201d) implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Reflecting \u201cCongress\u2019s effort to plug the soft-money loophole,\u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 133, 124 S.Ct. 619, BCRA marshals \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d as reinforcements for other, more straightforward prohibitions. Candidates may not \u201creceive\u201d or \u201cspend\u201d soft money, nor may they \u201csolicit ..., direct, [or] transfer\u201d it \u2014 for themselves or anyone else. <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(e)(1). The same restrictions \u2014 spending, receiving, transferring, soliciting, directing\u2014 likewise apply to national parties. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 441i(a). Further, BCRA surrounds these restrictions with yet more stopgaps, providing, for example, that even indirectly controlled entities count as \u201cparties\u201d for purposes of these restrictions, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(a)(2), and then \u201creinforcing],\u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 133, 124 S.Ct. 619, the soft-money rules by requiring that certain state-party activities receive federal (i.e., non-soft-money) funding, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b). Given this context, and considering Congress\u2019s intent to shut down the soft-money system, we think it obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>that \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d serve to reinforce BCRA\u2019s more direct prohibitions. Barred from spending and receiving unregulated funds, candidates and parties might switch to raising such money for friendly outsiders. So BCRA bans \u201csoliciting\u201d and \u201cdirecting\u201d as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The FEC\u2019s definitions fly in the face of this purpose because they reopen the very loophole the terms were designed to close. Under the Commission\u2019s interpretation, candidates and parties may not spend or receive soft money, but apart from that restriction, they need only avoid explicit direct requests. Instead, they must rely on winks, nods, and circumlocutions to channel money in favored directions \u2014 anything that makes their intention clear without overtly \u201casking\u201d for money. Simply stating these possibilities demonstrates the absurdity of the FEC\u2019s reading. Whereas BCRA aims to shut down the soft money system, the Commission\u2019s rules allow parties and politicians to perpetuate it, provided they avoid the most explicit forms of solicitation and direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Although this context alone satisfies us that the FEC\u2019s narrowing construction violates congressional intent, two further considerations reassure us that Congress intended broader meanings for \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect.\u201d The first is BCRA\u2019s repeal of the \u201cmagic words\u201d standard for issue advocacy. As noted earlier, whereas preBCRA law permitted unregulated financing of ads lacking \u201cexplicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate,\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 43, 96 S.Ct. 612, BCRA adopts more robust standards for communication oriented towards elections, <em>see infra </em>at 107 -108 \u2014a change understood to reflect Congress\u2019s judgment that the old standard was \u201cfunctionally meaningless,\u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 193, 124 S.Ct. 619. Yet as the district court observed, the FEC\u2019s interpretation of \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d is \u201cnot ... unlike that under pre-BCRA FECA, where the \u2018express advocacy\u2019 rule permitted labor unions and corporations to avoid regulation by simply avoiding Buckley\u2019s magic words, which effectively permitted such groups to sidestep FECA\u2019s prohibitions.\u201d 337 F.Supp.2d at 79. If imaginative advertisers are able to make their meaning clear without employing express terms like \u201cvote for\u201d and \u201cvote against,\u201d savvy politicians will surely be able to convey fund-raising desires without explicitly asking for money. We see little reason why Congress would have written BCRA to allow the latter practice while stamping out the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Second, as Shays and Meehan point out, the FEC has long construed \u201csolicit\u201d elsewhere in FECA as covering indirect requests. While allowing corporations and labor unions to create special accounts for political activity, FECA restricts \u201csolicitation\u201d of contributions to those accounts. <em>See 2 </em>U.S.C. 441b(b)(4). Interpreting this restriction, FEC advisory opinions have held that unions and companies may solicit funds merely by praising contributors, <em>see, e.g., </em>FEC Advisory Op.1979-13, or even just describing contribution procedures, <em>see, e.g., </em>FEC Advisory Op.1999-6. As the Commission\u2019s own campaign guide puts it, \u201csolicitations\u201d are not limited to \u201ca straightforward request for contributions.\u201d FEC Campaign Guide for Corporations and Labor Organizations at 24 (2001). Although the FEC could of course reconsider these advisory rulings, and while \u201csolicit\u201d could perhaps carry different meanings in different contexts, this background reinforces our sense that Congress anticipated a similarly broad construction of that term here. <em>Cf. Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 193-94, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) (\u201cCongress\u2019s repetition of a well-established term generally implies that Congress intended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">For all these reasons, we hold that Congress has clearly spoken to this issue and enacted a prohibition broader than the one the FEC adopted. In context, BCRA\u2019s terms \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d cover indirect requests. Because the FEC\u2019s rule, according to the Commission\u2019s own explanation, does not, we shall affirm its invalidation. In doing so, we express no view regarding a further argument presented by Shays and Meehan \u2014 that to avoid statutory redundancy, \u201cdirect\u201d must mean more than \u201cask in response,\u201d when \u201csolicit\u201d means \u201cask\u201d plain and simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>Electioneering Communication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s third challenge relates to the FEC\u2019s regulatory definition of \u201celectioneering communication\u201d\u2014 a new BCRA concept that replaces the old \u201cmagic words\u201d standard for issue ads. As noted earlier, in <em>Buckley </em>the Supreme Court, based on constitutional avoidance, construed key FECA provisions as applying only to \u201ccommunications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate,\u201d i.e., \u201cmagic words\u201d such as \u201cvote for\u201d and \u201cvote against.\u201d <em>See </em>424 U.S. at 43-44 &amp; n. 52, 80, 96 S.Ct. 612. This created a giant loophole. By simply avoiding express advocacy, corporations and labor unions, among others, could expend hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated funds on broadcasts that appeared \u201cfunctionally identical\u201d to ordinary campaign advertising. <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 126-27, 124 S.Ct. 619. Now, BCRA provisions upheld against constitutional challenge in <em>McConnell, see id. </em>at 189-95, 203-12, 124 S.Ct. 619, bar corporations and unions (though not their PACs) from financing ads meeting the statutory definition of \u201celectioneering communication,\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b(b)(2); <em>see also McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 204, 124 S.Ct. 619. Further, BCRA requires certain disclosures for electioneering communications, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(f)(1)-(2), and, as noted earlier, such communications automatically qualify as FECA \u201ccontributions\u201d when coordinated with a candidate, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 441a(a)(7)(C); <em>see also supra </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The key to these new restrictions is what counts as \u201celectioneering communication\u201d in the first place. As a general rule, the definition covers \u201cany broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\u201d that (1) \u201crefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office,\u201d (2) \u201cis made within\u201d 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary, and (3) \u201cis targeted to the relevant electorate.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(f)(3). Certain communications are then expressly exempted, among them news stories, commentary, and editorials (unless the broadcaster is controlled by a political party or candidate). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 434(f)(3)(B)\u00ae. In addition, BCRA authorizes the FEC to craft exemptions, subject to certain limitations described below. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 434(f)(3)(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In an exceedingly complex regulation, the FEC has laid out its interpretation of provisions defining \u201celectioneering communication.\u201d Although the district court invalidated other aspects of this rule, only one point remains disputed: the interpretation of \u201cmade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Recall that BCRA\u2019s definition applies only to communications \u201cmade within\u201d specified time periods (i.e., 30 or 60 days before an election). Construing this phrase, the FEC\u2019s regulation defines \u201cmade\u201d to mean \u201cpublicly distributed,\u201d 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.29(a)(2), and then defines \u201cpublicly distributed\u201d to mean \u201caired, broadcast, cablecast or otherwise disseminated <em>for a fee </em>through the facilities of a television station, radio station, cable television system, or satellite system,\u201d <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00a7 100.29(b)(3)\u00a9 (emphasis added). The italicized words are the rub. According to Shays and Meehan, nothing in the statute supports limiting \u201celectioneering communications\u201d to <em>purchased </em>transmissions. As the Congressmen see it, the statute applies equally to unpaid broadcasts, such as public service announcements. Indeed, they worry that sham PSAs could become the new sham issue ads \u2014 communications evading regulation though functionally indistinguishable from campaign ads. To give an example used by the FEC in the very rulemaking here, supporters could \u201cus[e] a PSA to associate a Federal candidate with a public-spirited endeavor\u201d \u2014 say, a blood drive or veterans\u2019 support effort\u2014 \u201cin an effort to promote or support that candidate.\u201d Electioneering Communications, 67 Fed.Reg. 65,190, 65,202 (Oct. 23, 2002). Indeed, given a friendly broadcaster willing to forgo its fee, supporters could even air unambiguous election aids, i.e., ads clearly identifying a federal candidate, targeting the relevant electorate, and appearing close to the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The district court found that the FEC\u2019s definition violated Congress\u2019s clearly expressed intent under <em>Chevron </em>step one. We agree. In effect, the Commission has taken the three parts of BCRA\u2019s standard \u2014 (1) candidate identification, (2) within 30 or 60 days, and (3) targeted at the electorate \u2014 and added a fourth: \u201cfor a fee.\u201d Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress contemplated such an element. Certainly, the word \u201cmade\u201d carries no such connotation. When one says, \u201cdinner is made,\u201d the implication is that dinner exists, not that someone paid for it. Likewise here, to say a \u201cbroadcast, cable, or satellite communication ... is made\u201d implies quite simply that the communication exists \u2014 i.e., that it was transmitted \u2014 not that someone paid a fee to make the transmission happen. Nor does the context add any ambiguity. To the contrary, BCRA says, \u201ccommunication ... made within\u201d a certain time-frame, i.e., 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary. Obviously, the temporal reference point \u2014 when the communication \u201cis made\u201d \u2014 is the date of transmission, for that is the point when the ad may influence the election. But given that focus, it makes no sense to say that the communication is \u201cmade\u201d only if someone paid a fee, an event that likely occurred earlier. The point, again, is simply that the transmission occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Attempting to concoct ambiguity, the FEC protests, \u201cThere is simply no mention of funding anywhere in the definition.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41-42. True, but so what? The already capacious U.S.Code would require even more volumes if Congress could be clear only by ruling out every possible limitation on statutory language. <em>See, e.g., Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Mediation Bd., </em>29 F.3d 655, 671 (D.C.Cir.1994) (en banc) (rejecting the claim \u201cthat <em>Chevron </em>step two is implicated any time a statute does not expressly <em>negate the </em>existence <em>of </em>a chimed administrative power (ie., when the statute is not written in \u2018thou shalt not\u2019 terms)\u201d). When Congress bans possession of a firearm or cocaine, we hardly scratch our heads and ask, \u201cGee, maybe th\u00e9y meant possession for a fee?\u201d By the same token, when BCRA says \u201cmade,\u201d we presume, absent compelling indication otherwise, that it means \u201cmade\u201d and not \u201cmade for a fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Of course, BCRA does permit FEC-crafted exemptions, and one might characterize this rule as such, given that it effectively excludes unpaid broadcasts from the definition. . To be sure, the FEC doesn\u2019t characterize its action this way. Instead, presumably because the district court held that the FEC\u2019s action exceeded the plain text of BCRA\u2019s exemption clause, see 337 F.Supp.2d at 128-29, the Commission in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>sists that its rule represents an interpretation of the statute. No matter. As the district court explained and as Shays and Meehan argue, the FEC\u2019s rule far exceeds any exemption BCRA would permit, for the statute specifically provides that \u201ca communication may not be exempted\u201d if it falls within another provision describing \u201cpublic communication[s] that refer[ ] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office ... and that promote[ ] or support[ ] a candidate for that office, or attack[ ] or oppose[ ] a candidate for that office.\u201d <em>See 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 434(f)(3)(B)(iv) (referencing <em>id. </em>\u00a7 431(20)(A)(iii)). Exempting all fee-free communications regardless of content, the FEC\u2019s rule makes no pretense of following this command. To the contrary, as noted earlier, it permits broadcasters to run ad after ad lambasting or applauding federal candidates, right up to election day, provided the broadcaster sacrifices its bottom line for its beliefs. Because BCRA\u2019s limitation on the exemption power forecloses exactly this possibility, the FEC\u2019s rule again conflicts with Congress\u2019s unambiguous intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Rather than focusing on these textual problems, the FEC\u2019s briefs emphasize the \u201crisk\u201d that without its limiting construction, BCRA\u2019s electioneering communication restrictions could chill \u201centertainment, educational, and documentary programs that mention or portray a federal candidate only incidentally,\u201d as well as PSAs featuring federal candidates and \u201cencouraging citizens to donate blood, for example.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41, 42-43, 44. Although this rationale is hardly apparent in the rulemaking record, <em>see </em>67 Fed.Reg. at 65,192-93 (\u201cbas[ing]\u201d the rule \u201con the legislative history of BCRA\u201d), and although in any event we need not consider it given our <em>Chevron </em>one holding, we nevertheless think it worth pointing out that avoiding chilling particular types of communication could hardly justify the FEC\u2019s broad exclusion of <em>all </em>unpaid broadcasts, regardless of content. Furthermore, because BCRA already includes an express exemption for \u201ccommunication[s] appearing in a news story, commentary, or editorial,\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(f)(3)(B)(i), no further exemption was necessary to avoid chilling those. As for PSAs, excluding federal candidates from broadcasts promoting blood drives and other worthy causes for 90 days out of every two years (30 days before the primary plus 60 days before the general election) would hardly seem unreasonable given that such broadcasts could \u201cassociate a Federal candidate with a public-spirited endeavor in an effort to promote or support that candidate\u201d \u2014 a risk the FEC itself acknowledged, in the very same rulemaking, in justifying its refusal to promulgate a general exemption for PSAs (whether paid or unpaid), <em>see </em>67 Fed.Reg. at 65,202.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">To sum up, as an interpretation of \u201celectioneering communication,\u201d the regulation contradicts BCRA\u2019s plain text and thus fails <em>Chevron </em>step one. Insofar as it instead constitutes an exemption, it rans roughshod over express limitations on the Commission\u2019s power, thus again flunking <em>Chevron </em>one. Accordingly, we shall affirm the district court\u2019s invalidation of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Salary Allocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Yet another new BCRA concept is \u201cfederal election activity\u201d (\u201cFEA\u201d for short). Central to Congress\u2019s effort to eliminate soft money influence, this concept identifies activities that state and local party organizations must finance with hard money. Among them, as mentioned previously, are voter registration drives within 120 days of an election, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(20)(A)(i), and \u201cpublic communications\u201d attacking or supporting identified federal candidates (whether or not state and local candidates are also \u201cmentioned or identified\u201d), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 431(20)(A)(iii). Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>course, even before BCRA, FECA\u2019s \u201cexpenditure\u201d definition covered spending \u201cfor the purpose of influencing\u201d federal elections, including spending by state and local parties. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 431(9)(A); <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 118-19, 124 S.Ct. 619. But as mentioned earlier, FEC regulations governing activities with combined state and federal implications \u2014 among them, voter registration drives and generic party advertising \u2014 allowed generous use of soft money by state and local parties. <em>See McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 123 &amp; n. 7, 124 S.Ct. 619; <em>see also supra </em>at 81. BCRA\u2019s FEA provisions supplant these regulations, making clear that the listed \u201cmixed purpose\u201d activities must be financed with federally regulated money. <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 4411(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The issue before us relates to one category of FEA: salaries for employees devoting more than 25% of their paid time to federal elections. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 431(20)(A)(iv). In any month during which a state or local party employee\u2019s work crosses the 25% threshold, the employee\u2019s <em>entire </em>salary counts as FEA, thus requiring the party to pay that salary exclusively with federally regulated funds. See id. <em>\u00a7\u00a7 </em>431(20)(A)(iv), 441i(b). In its regulations, the FEC faithfully implemented this restriction, declaring that such salaries \u201cmust be paid only with Federal funds.\u201d 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.33(c). But the FEC also drew an inference that Shays and Meehan dispute. With respect to all other salaries, i.e., those for employees devoting 25% of their time or less to federal activities, the FEC eliminated any allocation requirement, thus freeing state and local parties to pay such employees\u2019 salaries <em>entirely </em>with soft money. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 106.7(c)(1), (d)(1), 300.33(c)(2). Thus, under the Commission\u2019s rule, such parties may require every one of their employees to work as much as quarter time \u2014 a day a week or more \u2014 on federal elections without needing any federally regulated funds for those salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">As stated in the official explanation, the FEC views this rule on salaries <em>below </em>the 25% mark as an \u201cimplication\u201d of BCRA\u2019s standard for salaries <em>above </em>that threshold. <em>See </em>Prohibited &amp; Excessive Contributions: Non-Federal Funds or Soft Money, 67 Fed.Reg. 49,064, 49,078 (July 29, 2002). \u201cCongress appears to have concluded,\u201d the FEC wrote, \u201cthat salaries for employees spending 25% or less of then- time on activities in connection with a Federal election or on Federal election activities do not have to be paid from any mix of Federal funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Shays and Meehan disagree. Absent any change in FECA\u2019s \u201cexpenditure\u201d definition, they argue, spending \u201cfor the purpose of influencing\u201d federal elections, including state party salaries, must still be allocated. While holding that BCRA did not unambiguously foreclose the Commission\u2019s rule, the district court concluded that because state parties could simply spread federal work over multiple 25%-federal employees, exclusive use of unregulated funds for such salaries would \u201ccompromise the Act\u2019s purposes of preventing circumvention of its national party committee nonfederal money ban and stemming the flow of nonfederal money into activities that impact federal elections.\u201d 337 F.Supp.2d at 114. For this reason, the district court invalidated the rule under <em>Chevron </em>step two. Again, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">First, to the extent Shays and Meehan assert a BCRA violation under <em>Chevron </em>step one, we join the district court in rejecting their position. As the district court explained, the statute \u201cspeaks only to how state, district or local political party committees should fund the activities of then-employees who spend <em>more </em>than 25 percent of their paid time on Federal election activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. It says nothing at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>all about salaries below that threshold, much less anything unambiguous, as required by <em>Chevron </em>one. But for the very same reason- \u2014 i.e., because BCRA says nothing at all \u2014 the statute\u2019s 25% provision also does not carry the \u201cimplication\u201d the FEC attributes to it. In fact, far from suggesting that 25%-or-less salaries may be funded entirely with unregulated money, as the FEC believes, the statute, by singling out certain employees (i.e., those above the 25% level), suggests that others\u2019 salaries remain subject to preexisting law.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The statutory context confirms this reading. No exhaustive canvass of federally-oriented electoral costs, BCRA\u2019s FEA definition covers just four categories, all of which involve activities with combined state and federal implications that could thus be used to disguise federally-oriented activities as a state-related campaign. We have already mentioned three of the categories \u2014 above-25% salaries, voter registration within 120 days of an election, and ads attacking or supporting federal candidates in combination with state ones. <em>See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431(20)(A)(i), (iii), (iv). The fourth comprises \u201cvoter identification, get-out-the-vote activity, or generic campaign activity in connection with an election in which a candidate for Federal office appears on the ballot (regardless of whether a candidate for State or local office also appears on the ballot).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4Sl(20)(A)(ii); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 431(20)(B) (exempting certain expenditures such as costs for buttons, bumper-stickers, and local party conventions from all four categories of FEA). As a general rule, BCRA requires exclusive hard money financing for each of these four activities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 441i(b)(1). The only exception, applicable only to limited types of FEA and never to above-25% salaries, is the \u201cLevin Amendment\u201d \u2014 a provision (described below) that permits partial financing of certain generic campaign activity with funds raised subject to special controls. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 441i(b)(2); <em>see also McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 161-64, 124 S.Ct. 619; <em>infra </em>at 112-114.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The purpose of these restrictions, as <em>McConnell </em>says of the 25% rule, is \u201cprophylactic.\u201d <em>See </em>540 U.S. at 170-71, 124 S.Ct. 619. Before BCRA, donors could lavish soft money on generic state party advertising and pre-election voter registration drives, notwithstanding the obvious benefits such efforts would have for federal candidates. Now, outside the carefully circumscribed limits of the Levin Amendment, such activities must be financed entirely with federal money, even though they relate to state as well as federal elections. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 166, 124 S.Ct. 619 (describing the FEA provisions as \u201ccap-turfing] some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices\u201d). Likewise, before BCRA, under FEC allocation rules, <em>see supra </em>at 81, state parties could pay their workers largely with soft money. Now those above the 25% level must be paid entirely with hard funds \u2014 again, even though their activity benefits state as well as federal candidates. Given this prophylactic thrust \u2014 sweeping <em>state </em>activities into the federal orbit due to the risk of concealed federal purpose \u2014 nothing in the FEA definition\u2019s structure suggests congressional intention to deregulate <em>federal </em>activity. The FEA provisions supplement, not supplant, preexisting controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Indeed, the FEC\u2019s rules acknowledge as much. Despite categorically exempting 25%-or-less salaries from allocation, FEC regulations continue to require that \u201cadministrative costs\u201d be spread between hard and soft money accounts. <em>See </em>11 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.7(c)(2). As the Commission explained in the very same statement promulgating the 25%-or-less rule, \u201cnothing in BCRA or the legislative history suggests that Congress intended the Commission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>abandon its longstanding allocation requirement for these expenses.\u201d 67 Fed. Reg. at 49,078. Likewise subject to allocation are fundraising costs associated with joint state/local and federal campaigns, <em>see </em>11 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.7(c)(4), as well as expenses (apart from salaries and wages) for \u201cvoter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, and any other activities that urge the general public to register or vote, or that promote or oppose a political party ... that do not qualify as Federal election activities,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 106.7(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">These regulations clearly rest on the same BCRA interpretation that we have articulated' \u2014 -that while imposing additional constraints on FEA activities, BCRA makes no change to preexisting restrictions on non-FEA expenditures. But if \u201cnothing in BCRA\u201d evinces congressional intent to deregulate non-FEA expenses like administrative and fundraising overhead, then neither does BCRA support exclusion of non-FEA salaries, i.e., those for employees devoting up to 25% of their time to federal elections. <em>Cf. Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (describing \u201c[ajgency inconsistency\u201d as a possible \u201creason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the [APA]\u201d). Indeed, the salary rule appears particularly irrational given the FEC\u2019s recognition that costs for voter registration, get-out-the-vote drives, and generic party advertising \u2014 all matters, like salaries, that the FEA definition specifically addresses \u2014 may require allocation even when the activities \u201cdo not qualify\u201d as FEA. <em>See </em>11 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.7(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In sum, the FEC has construed a BCRA provision sweeping <em>state </em>activities within FECA as an excuse to punt <em>federal </em>activities outside it. Because this \u201cimplication\u201d from the statute makes no sense, and because the Commission gave no other justification for its rule, the regulation exempting 25%-or-less salaries from allocation is arbitrary and capricious. We shall therefore affirm the district court\u2019s invalidation of this rule as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">To be clear, because we thus rely on the APA rather than <em>Chevron, </em>nothing in our holding necessarily precludes the FEC from remedying deficiencies in its explanation and repromulgating this rule on remand, though we are skeptical that it may do so. Answering the district court\u2019s concerns about potential abuse, the FEC suggested in its briefs here that state and local parties may possess neither \u201can incentive\u201d nor \u201cthe necessary flexibility in their workloads and staffing\u201d to spread federal work among under-25%-federal employees. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 36 n. 9; <em>see also </em>Reply Br. at 18. But why so? Given the massive soft money sums infused into pre-BCRA elections (nearly half a billion dollars in 2000 alone), it strikes us as quite plausible that wealthy donors would swallow costs for increased state and local campaigning, were the result an army of workers devoting more than a day a week to federal elections. Should the FEC wish to adhere to its current view in future rule-making, it must summon more substantial support than the conclusory assertions presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\n<em>Levin Funds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s final challenge involves an exception to an exception. As noted in the last section, although \u201cfederal election activity,\u201d as defined in BCRA, generally requires hard money, the statute contains an exception \u2014 the \u201cLevin Amendment.\u201d See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b); <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 162-63, 124 S.Ct. 619. That provision allows state and local parties to finance certain types of FEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>with money, called \u201cLevin funds,\u201d subject to far less onerous controls than those for hard money. <em>See generally McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 162-63, 124 S.Ct. 619. The catch is that the party must \u201callocate\u201d these FEA costs between Levin funds and hard money. <em>See 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b)(2). But under a regulatory exception to this exception \u2014 one Shays and Meehan challenge \u2014 party organizations need not allocate if they spend no more than $5,000 total on allocable expenditures, an amount the Commission considers de minimis. <em>See </em>11 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.32(c)(4); 67 Fed.Reg. at 49,097.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">To understand the FEC\u2019s rationale and Shays\u2019s and Meehan\u2019s objection, yet more detail about this complex statute is (unfortunately) necessary. First, \u201cLevin funds\u201d are a sort of semi-soft money. Available to state and local party organizations in sums up to $10,000 per donor per year, Levin funds are exempted from federal disclosure requirements and restrictions (though not from state law). <em>See 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b)(2)(B)(iii); <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 162-63,124 S.Ct. 619. Party entities using Levin funds must raise them on their own, without help from national parties or even state and local affiliates. <em>See 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441i(a), (b)(2)(B)(iv), (e); <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 163-64, 124 S.Ct. 619. Furthermore, parties may use Levin funds only for certain types of FEA \u2014 specifically, generic party campaigning, get-out-the-vote activity, and voter identification and registration drives (activities covered by two of the four FEA categories), <em>see 2 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b)(2)(A) (referencing <em>id. </em>\u00a7 431(20)(A)(i)-(ii)) \u2014 and under no circumstances may Levin funds finance expenditures \u201crefer[ring] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office,\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441i(b)(2)(B)(i). <em>See generally McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 163, 124 S.Ct. 619. Nor may they bankroll any \u201cbroadcasting, cable, or satellite communication,\u201d save those that \u201crefer[ ] solely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Thus, a typical Levin Amendment activity might involve a generic effort by some state or local party organization to register voters and turn them out for an election where both state and federal offices are at issue. The party entity could finance that activity in part with money raised in $10,000 contributions. Usual hard money requirements would not apply, but, as noted earlier, the party would need to \u201callocate\u201d the vote drive\u2019s costs between hard money accounts and the \u201cLevin funds\u201d raised in these up-to-$10,000 donations.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">By what criteria do parties \u201callocate\u201d? Presumably the goal is to approximate the relative state and federal components of the activity (assigning Levin funds to the former and hard money to the latter), but much as with the \u201ccoordinated communication\u201d issue discussed earlier, BCRA leaves the question open. That is, rather than prescribing allocation rules itself, BCRA simply refers to \u201cregulations prescribed by the Commission.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b)(2)(A). So the Commission promulgated rules, and these rules, in addition to providing guidance on allocation, include the $5,000 \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Our cases recognize that agencies may promulgate de minimis exemptions to statutes they administer. <em>See, e.g., Ass\u2019n of Admin. Law Judges v. FLRA, </em>397 F.3d 957, 961-62 (D.C.Cir.2005); <em>Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA, </em>82 F.3d 451, 466 (D.C.Cir.1996); <em>Ala. Power Co. v. Costle, </em>636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C.Cir.1979). Predicated on the notion that \u201cthe Congress is always presumed to intend that pointless expenditures of effort be avoided,\u201d such authority \u201cis inherent in most statutory schemes, by implication.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of ALJ\u2019s, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>397 F.3d at 962 (internal quotation marks omitted). But there are limits. First, de minimis exemption power does not extend to \u201cextraordinarily rigid\u201d statutes. <em>See id. </em>at 962; <em>EDF, </em>82 F.3d at 466. By promulgating a rigid regime, Congress signals that the strict letter of its law applies in all circumstances, thus rebutting the presumption against \u201cpointless\u201d applications. Second, even absent rigidity, \u201c[t]he authority to create these exceptions does not extend to \u2018a situation where the regulatory function does provide benefits, in the sense of furthering regulatory objectives, but the agency concludes that the acknowledged benefits are exceeded by the costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Public Citizen v. FTC, </em>869 F.2d 1541, 1557 (D.C.Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Ala. Power, </em>636 F.2d at 360-61) (emphasis removed). Instead, situations covered by a de minimis exemption must be truly de minimis. That is, they must cover only situations where \u201cthe burdens of regulation yield a gain of trivial or no value,\u201d <em>EDF, </em>82 F.3d at 466 (internal quotation marks omitted), for otherwise the exemption reflects impermissible \u201csecond-guess[ing][of| Congress\u2019s calculations,\u201d <em>Public Citizen, </em>869 F.2d at 1557, as opposed to avoidance of \u201cabsurd or futile results,\u201d <em>EDF, </em>82 F.3d at 466 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Apparently attempting to satisfy these requirements, the FEC gave three reasons for its exemption here. First, the Commission attempted to show that the Levin allocation rule is not \u201cextraordinarily rigid.\u201d <em>See </em>67 Fed.Reg. at 49,097 (observing that \u201cthe reporting requirements for Federal election activity contain an exception for activity below $5,000 in the aggregate in a calendar year\u201d and therefore concluding that \u201cCongress did not take a rigid approach to low levels of Federal election activity\u201d) (citing 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(e)(2)(A)). We need not consider that argument, however, for even if the FEC is correct on this point, its remaining two rationales give no assurance that exempted spending \u2014 i.e., Levin expenditures totaling $5,000 or less in a given year for a given party organization \u2014 is in fact de minimis.</p>\n<p id=\"Ala\">In the first of the two remaining rationales, the FEC observed, \u201c[T]he Commission is particularly sensitive to the nature of the Federal election activity to which this provision applies: Grassroots activities for which references to Federal candidates are prohibited.\u201d 67 Fed.Reg. at 49,097. \u201cThere is a far weaker nexus,\u201d the Commission went on, \u201cbetween Federal candidates and this category of Federal election activity than other types of Federal election activity for which Levin funds are prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The FEC\u2019s point, we take it, is that the Levin Amendment includes only \u201cgrassroots\u201d FEA categories (e.g., voter registration drives and generic party campaigning), and that as such, the included FEA categories involve a \u201cweaker nexus\u201d with federal candidates than those that Congress excluded (e.g., over-25% salaries and public communications referring to specific candidates).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Although this distinction may explain the pattern of included and excluded FEA types \u2014 an issue we need not address\u2014 Congress\u2019s rationale for <em>including </em>activities in the Levin Amendment obviously affords no justification for <em>excluding </em>them from Levin allocation, the very form of regulation Congress chose. <em>See Public Citizen, </em>869 F.2d at 1557 (observing that de minimis exemptions may not \u201csecond-guess Congress\u2019s calculations\u201d). Yet that is precisely the effect of the FEC\u2019s exemption with respect to Levin spending totaling $5,000 or less in a given year for a given party entity. To put the same point somewhat differently, because the FEC\u2019s observations (that covered activities are \u201cgrassroots\u201d and bear a \u201cweaker nexus\u201d) relate to Levin FEA in general, these rationales would apply equally to $50,000 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>even $50,000,000 in Levin spending \u2014 sums Congress could hardly have deemed \u201ctrivial,\u201d <em>EDF, </em>82 F.3d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The FEC\u2019s final rationale fares no better. Observing that $5,000 is only half of $10,000, the amount each Levin contributor may \u201cdonate (subject to State law) to each and every State, district, and local party committee,\u201d the Commission declared: \u201c[Tjhere is no danger that allowing a committee to use entirely Levin funds for allocable Federal election activity that aggregates $5,000 or less in a calendar year will somehow lead to circumvention of the amount limitations set forth in [the statute].\u201d 67 Fed.Reg. at 49,097. This is certainly true. A party with only $5,000 total <em>expenditures </em>can hardly evade the $10,000 \u201camount limitation\u201d on <em>contributions. Id. </em>But the point of Levin allocation \u2014 the subject-matter of this exemption \u2014 is to restrict spending, not donations. Specifically, allocation requires state parties to raise hard money for the federal component of mixed-purpose activities, despite using Levin funds for the remainder. Thus, again, to establish that some level of FEA spending \u2014 whether $5,000, $50,000, or $500 \u2014 is de minimis, the FEC must demonstrate that efforts below that level have \u201ctrivial or no\u201d impact on federal elections. <em>See EDF, </em>82 F.3d at 466. The fact that donors could contribute more than that amount to the <em>state </em>component of such activities does nothing to reassure us that the <em>federal </em>component is thus insignificant. Nor does $5,000 strike us as an obviously trivial amount, considering that donors could give that amount to each and every state, district, and local party organization \u2014 an observation the FEC itself made, <em>see </em>67 Fed.Reg. at 49,097.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Thus, even assuming the Levin Amendment is flexible enough to permit de minimis exclusions, the record here presents no coherent justification for the specific exemption the FEC chose. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s action again falls short of APA standards, so again we shall affirm the district court\u2019s invalidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">As the Supreme Court (rather fatalistically) observed in <em>McConnell, </em>\u201cMoney, like water, will always find an outlet.\u201d 540 U.S. at 224, 124 S.Ct. 619. Offered there as a reason for \u201cno illusion that BCRA will be the last congressional statement on [campaign finance],\u201d <em>id., </em>this comment serves equally well here to illustrate the importance of faithfully implementing the statute Congress has passed. For if regulatory safe harbors permit what BCRA bans, we have no doubt that savvy campaign operators will exploit them to the hilt, reopening the very soft money floodgates BCRA aimed to close. Because the rules at issue in this appeal either fall short of Congress\u2019s mandate or lack record support showing otherwise, we affirm their invalidation by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b236-10\">KAREN LeCRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Av3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">I dissent from the majority opinion because I believe the appellees lack standing to bring this action under Article III of the United States Constitution. In <em>McConnell v. FEC, </em>540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), the United States Supreme Court iterated the \u201cthree requirements that constitute the \u2018irreducible constitutional minimum\u2019 of standing\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">First, a plaintiff must demonstrate an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d which is \u201cconcrete,\u201d \u201cdistinct and palpable,\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent.\u201d Second, a plaintiff must establish \u201ca causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of-. the injury has to be \u2018fairly trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>and not ... th[e] result [of] some third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d Third, a plaintiff must show the \u201c \u2018substantial likelihood\u2019 that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">540 U.S. at 225-26, 124 S.Ct. 619 (alteration original; internal citations omitted). The appellees have failed to make this minimum showing because they have not identified an actual or imminent, concrete injury-in-fact that is caused by the challenged regulations implementing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), Pub.L. No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81 (2002). Instead they speculate that they <em>may </em>suffer vaguely described injuries at some future time. <em>See </em>Decls, of Shays and Meehan \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, 8 (averring each appellee will be \u201cimpacted]\u201d \u201cas a candidate who runs in elections that <em>could be </em>affected\u201d by soft-money funding of \u201cstate and local activities that affect federal elections,\u201d each \u201cwill be <em>open to </em>attack ... by groups seeking to evade the contribution limits, source prohibitions, and disclosure requirements imposed by Congress\u201d and opponents \u201cwill be <em>able </em>to interact and coordinate .... in [unidentified] ways that evade the contribution limits, source prohibitions, and disclosure requirements of federal law\u201d) (emphases added). Or they complain of the subjective indignity of campaigning in a purportedly tainted electoral environment. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 5 (averring each \u201cwill be forced\u201d to run for reelection \u201cin a system that is widely perceived to be, and [he] believe[s] in many respects will be, significantly corrupted by the influence of special-interest money,\u201d each \u201cwill face the strong risk that unregulated soft money contributions will again be used in an attempt to influence federal elections in which [he is] a candidate\u201d and the soft-money contribution regulations \u201cwill affect the perception the public will form of me, my fellow office-holders, and fellow party members\u201d). Such wispish injury claims fall far short of the injury showing required for Article III standing. <em>See Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (to satisfy constitutional component of standing doctrine \u201cinjury alleged must be ... distinct and palpable, and not abstract or conjectural or hypothetical\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). The majority attempts to fill the gaps in the appellees\u2019 allegations by invoking two standing doctrines \u2014 conflated under the novel heading \u201cillegal structuring of a competitive environment,\u201d maj. op. 84, 85 \u2014 which neither the Supreme Court nor we have ever before applied in a similar context. In its eagerness to manufacture standing, the majority stretches both doctrines past their breaking points.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">First, the majority finds standing based on the \u201cprocedural rights\u201d cases. Under the procedural rights doctrine, courts have lowered the standing bar somewhat \u201cin cases in which a party \u2018has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests\u2019 \u201d before an agency so that \u201cthe primary focus of the standing inquiry is not the imminence or redressability of the injury to the plaintiff, but whether a plaintiff who has suffered personal and particularized injury has sued a defendant who has caused that injury.\u201d <em>Fla. Audubon Soc\u2019y v. Bentsen, </em>94 F.3d 658, 664 (D.C.Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 572 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). In <em>Electric Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. FERC, </em>391 F.3d 1255 (D.C.Cir.2004), on which the majority relies, we applied the procedural rights doctrine to conclude that the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA), a national trade association, and its members, which \u201croutinely appear before FERC in contested hearings,\u201d 391 F.3d at 1262, had standing to challenge a regulation creating an exception to the Sunshine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Act\u2019s statutory prohibition on <em>ex parte </em>communications in agency proceedings, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(d)(1)(A), (B). The court reasoned that to establish standing, the plaintiffs did not need to show any certainty of financial loss because, \u201c[a]s regular participants in contested FERC hearings, EPSA and its members have a right, protected by the Sunshine Act\u2019s proscription against <em>ex parte </em>communications, to \u2018fair decisionmaking\u2019 by the Commission.\u201d 391 F.3d at 1262 (quoting <em>Prof'l Air Traffic Controllers Org. v. FLRA, </em>685 F.2d 547, 563 (D.C.Cir.1982)). Similarly, in cases challenging an agency\u2019s refusal to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed federal project, we and other courts have found that a landowner whose property is threatened by the project has standing to challenge the agency\u2019s refusal based on the Congress\u2019s intent to protect the landowner\u2019s procedural right to an environmental impact statement from the agency. <em>See, e.g., Wyo. Outdoor Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>165 F.3d 43, 51 (D.C.Cir.1999); <em>see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 572 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (\u201c[U]nder our- case law, one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency\u2019s failure to prepare an environmental impact statement, even though he cannot establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered, and even though the dam will not be completed for many years.\u201d). The majority finds such cases \u201canalogous to\u201d this one. Maj. op. 84-85. The analogy does not hold up.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In <em>Electric Power, </em>EPSA had standing to challenge the regulation because it was \u201cseeking to enforce procedural requirements designed to protect [its] concrete interest in the outcome of hearings to which EPSA is a party.\u201d 391 F.3d at 1262. EPSA enjoyed a procedural right to an administrative proceeding free from <em>ex parte </em>communications because it was the beneficiary of one of the two interests underlying the Sunshine Act \u2014 to ensure disclosure \u201c \u2018as an instrument of fair decisionmaking,\u2019 \u201d for \u201c \u2018only if a- party knows the arguments presented to a decisionmaker can the party respond effectively and ensure that its position is fairly considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Prof'l Air Traffic Controllers Org., </em>685 F.2d at 563). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>\u201c \u2018procedural rights\u2019 are special: The person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.\u201d 504 U.S. at 573 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130. The appellees do not qualify for this special relaxation of the usual injury standard for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">First, in the procedural rights cases, the courts have found a party has standing to challenge an agency decision which deprives the challenger of a procedural right that the Congress intended to protect <em>in proceedings before the same agency. See Committee for Full Employment v. Blumenthal, </em>606 F.2d 1062, 1065 n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1979) (\u201cOn many occasions we have reviewed agency action or inaction at the request of a party who alleged that its procedural rights (as created either by the agency\u2019s own regulations, or the Administrative Procedure Act) had been violated.\u201d). In <em>Electric Power, </em>for example, we concluded that the EPSA and' its members had standing to seek review of the decision <em>by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </em>to permit <em>ex parte </em>communication <em>in its own proceedings </em>which the Congress had intended to prohibit in the Sunshine Act in order to protect the right of fair decisionmaking <em>in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. See Electric Power, </em>391 F.3d at 1262 (\u201cAs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>regular participants <em>in contested FERC hearings, </em>EPSA and its members have a right, protected by the Sunshine Act\u2019s proscription against <em>ex parte </em>communications, to \u2018fair decisionmaking\u2019 <em>by the Commission.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Similarly, in the cases challenging an agency\u2019s refusal to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed federal project, to which the Supreme Court alluded in <em>Defenders of Wildlife, see </em>maj. op. 91 - 92, courts have found that a landowner whose property is threatened by the project has standing to challenge the agency\u2019s refusal based on the Congress\u2019s intent to protect the landowner\u2019s procedural right to obtain an environmental impact statement <em>frvm the agency undertaking the project. </em>Here, there is no such connection between the FEC or its rulemaking proceeding and the \u201cprocedural right\u201d allegedly denied the appellees. The majority finds the appellee congressmen have standing to challenge the FEC\u2019s rulemaking procedure based not on a right to some guaranteed procedural protection before the Commission but rather on an \u201cinterest in \u2018fair\u2019 reelection fights\u201d in future public elections. <em>See </em>maj. op. 91. This unprecedented reliance on a right independent of any agency proceeding turns the procedural rights doctrine on its head and creates a wholly new and insupportable theory of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Second, even assuming candidates could have standing to challenge an agency proceeding based on a procedural right available and violable only in a future election campaign, BCRA accords no such special right to the appellees or to any other candidate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because BCRA\u2019s requirements were not designed to protect any interest, much less a concrete interest, belonging to a candidate in his capacity as candidate (as opposed to his capacity as voter). <em>See Fla. Audubon Soc\u2019y, </em>94 F.3d at 658 (\u201cAccording to <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>a plaintiff may have standing to challenge the failure of an agency to abide by a procedural requirement <em>only if </em>that requirement was \u2018designed to protect some threatened concrete interest\u2019 of the plaintiff.\u201d (quoting <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 2130; emphasis added)). In <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976), the Supreme Court determined that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which BCRA amends, was \u201c \u2018to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions,\u2019 \u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 120, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <em>Buck</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>ley, </em>424 U.S. at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612), by which \u201cthe integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined,\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. 612. The <em>Buckley </em>Court found, the <em>McConnell </em>Court noted, that FECA\u2019s substantive contribution limits \u201cserve[ ] an interest in protecting \u2018the integrity of our system of representative democracy.\u2019 \u201d 540 U.S. at 120, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. 612). Those BCRA provisions which may be considered \u201cprocedural\u201d \u2014 that is, the provisions governing disclosure, recordkeeping and reporting\u2014 \u201cvindicate[ ] three important interests: providing the electorate with relevant information about the candidates and their supporters; deterring actual corruption and discouraging the use of money for improper purposes; and facilitating enforcement of the prohibitions in the Act.\u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 121, 124 S.Ct. 619 (citing <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 66-68, 96 S.Ct. 612). None of these interests accrues to candidates <em>qua </em>candidates. The first two plainly benefit the general electorate; as the Court explained in <em>Buckley, </em>\u201c[a] public armed with information about a candidate\u2019s most generous supporters is better able to detect any post-election special favors that may be given in return.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. at 67, 96 S.Ct. 612. As for the third, \u201crecordkeeping, reporting and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations,\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 67-68, 96 S.Ct. 612, thereby serving FECA\u2019s primary \u2014 public\u2014interest in reducing corruption and its appearance by limiting contributions. Thus, BCRA\u2019s procedural provisions were designed to protect only the rights of voters generally to be informed about candidates and to exercise their franchise in an electoral system untainted (or less tainted) by corruption. They were not designed to benefit or protect candidates running for office. Because each congressman appellee is \u201cclaiming only harm to his and every citizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large,\u201d he \u201cdoes not state an Article III case or controversy.\u201d <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 573-74, 112 S.Ct. 2130. In short, he has no more standing than any other voter \u2014 which is to say none.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">To support a candidate\u2019s standing to challenge a campaign finance law violation under the procedural rights doctrine, the majority cites the example in <em>Defenders </em>of a landowner who has a procedural right to challenge an agency\u2019s failure to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed dam on land adjacent to his own. But there is a key distinction. The landowner has a concrete, particularized claim \u2014 beyond the general public\u2019s \u2014 to the interest which the environmental assessment requirements were designed to protect: his particular corner of the environment may be adversely affected by the dam because of its proximity. Thus, he has standing \u201ceven though he cannot establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered, and even though the dam will not be completed for many years.\u201d <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 573 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130. A candidate for public office, however, has no such special claim to the interest advanced by BCRA \u2014 namely, preserving the integrity of our system of government by eliminating corruption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>With regard to this interest, he is like one of those \u201cpersons who live (and propose to live) at the other end of the country from the dam\u201d and therefore \u201chave no concrete interests affected.\u201d <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 578 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Finally, to the extent that BCRA creates any procedural protections (and I would be reluctant to characterize BCRA\u2019s disclosure, recordkeeping and reporting requirements as \u201cprotections\u201d for candidates), it is not the regulations\u2019 procedural requirements that cause the appellees\u2019 alleged injuries but rather the purported relaxation of BCRA\u2019s substantive restrictions on contributions and expenditures. <em>See swpra </em>p. 116 (quoting from the appellees\u2019 declarations).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In addition to the procedural rights cases, the majority also finds standing based on a line of cases establishing \u201cthe rule ... that when [a] particular statutory provision invoked [ ] reflect[s] a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest, the injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.\u201d <em>Hardin v. Ky. Utils. Co., </em>390 U.S. 1, 6, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968) (citations omitted). The majority\u2019s competitive standing theory also suffers from three fatal defects.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">First, as I just explained, BCRA does not \u201creflect a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest\u201d of the appellees; for the provisions the appellees seek to enforce are \u201cin no way concerned with protecting against competitive injury.\u201d <em>Hardin, </em>390 U.S. at 6, 88 S.Ct. 651 (explaining cases in which court found no standing notwithstanding existence of competitive economic injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Second, the Commission\u2019s regulations have not caused the appellees a competitive injury. In <em>Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), cited at maj. op. 86, the Supreme Court found sufficient injury-in-fact under Article III because the petitioners experienced increased competition for their customers as a result of the challenged government ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held that the petitioners, data processing service providers, had standing to challenge a ruling by the Comptroller of the Currency that authorized national banks to provide data processing services to other banks and to bank customers because the petitioner \u201cnot only allege[d] that competition by national banks in the business of providing data processing services might entail some future loss of profits for the petitioners, they also allege[d] that respondent American National Bank &amp; Trust Company was performing or preparing to perform such services for two customers for whom petitioner Data Systems, Inc., had previously agreed or negotiated to perform such services.\u201d 397 U.S. at 152, 90 S.Ct. 827. As the majority acknowledges, however, the appellees have suffered no increased competition as a result of the Commission\u2019s regulations which \u201ccreate neither more nor different rival candidates.\u201d Maj. op. 86. The majority also concedes that the regulations offer no \u201cspecial benefits\u201d to the appellees\u2019 rivals so as to implicate the other basis for competitive standing: creating marketplace advantage for competitors. <em>Id.; see, e.g., DIRECTV, Inc. v. FCC, </em>110 F.3d 816, 830 (D.C.Cir.1997) (holding prospective auction bidder had standing to challenge rule that put it at \u201ca substantial competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other bidders\u201d). As in <em>McConnell, </em>because the challenged action neither confers a competitive benefit on competing candidates nor subjects the appellees to any competitive disadvantage, the appellees lack Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In <em>McConnell, </em>the \u201cAdams plaintiffs\u201d alleged their candidates suffered a \u201ccompetitive injury\u201d from section 307 of BCRA which increased the ceiling on certain individual contributions, unconstitutionally in their view. As injury they alleged that under section 307 their candidates would be at a \u201c \u2018fundraising disadvantage\u2019 \u201d given that they \u201c \u2018d[id] not wish to solicit or accept large campaign contributions as permitted by BCRA\u2019 because \u2018[t]hey believe such contributions create the appearance of unequal access and influence.\u2019 \u201d 540 U.S. at 228, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting Adams plaintiffs\u2019 complaint). The Court rejected this argument because the candidates\u2019 \u2019\u2019alleged inability to compete stems not from the operation of \u00a7 307, but from their own personal \u2018wish\u2019 not to solicit or accept large contributions, <em>i.e., </em>their personal choice.\u201d 540 U.S. at 228, 124 S.Ct. 619. Here too, any competitive injury the appellees may suffer stems not from the FEC\u2019s regulations but from their own refusal to take advantage of them. Under the Commission\u2019s regulations, the appellees are authorized to employ the same campaign tactics in the same manner as any other federal candidate. The majority attempts to distinguish the Adams plaintiffs\u2019 plight by claiming that \u201cbecause being put to the choice of either violating BCRA or suffering disadvantage in their campaign is itself a predicament the statute spares them, having to make that choice constitutes Article III injury.\u201d Maj. op 89. But this is the same \u201cpredicament\u201d the Adams plaintiffs asserted: they would be outspent unless they chose to accept the higher hard money contributions authorized by BCRA, which, they maintained, violated the United States Constitution. They faced their Hobson\u2019s choice only because, in their view, BCRA \u201cpermit[s] what [the Fifth Amendment] forbids.\u201d <em>See </em>maj. op. 93. In short, the two appellees have identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>no competitive injury they will suffer as a consequence of the challenged regulations; if the FEC \u201calter[ed] the competitive environment\u2019s overall rules,\u201d maj. op. 86, it did so for <em>all </em>candidates, including the appellees, thereby maintaining a level playing field. Lacking a competitive injury, the appellees\u2019 only complaint is of injury to their generalized, abstract interests in enforcing BCRA as they believe it was meant to be implemented and in preventing the appearance or occurrence of corruption. Neither interest supports standing. <em>See Common Cause v. FEC, </em>108 F.3d 413, 418 (D.C.Cir.1997) (stating court cannot \u201crecogniz[e] a justiciable interest in the enforcement of the law\u201d and noting \u201cCongress cannot, consistent with Article III, create standing by conferring \u2018upon <em>all </em>persons ... an abstract, self-contained, noninstrumental \u201cright\u201d to have the Executive observe the procedures required by law,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 573, 112 S.Ct. 2130) (emphasis original); <em>Rainbow/PUSH Coalition v. FCC, </em>396 F.3d 1235, 1241 (D.C.Cir.2005) (finding injury from discrimination at local public radio station was insufficient for standing because it was \u201csimply a setback to [an] abstract social interest\u2019 in advancing racial equity\u201d (quoting <em>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982))).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In the absence of either of the two established bases for competitive standing\u2014 increased competition and competitive advantage/disadvantage \u2014 the only competitive \u201cinjury\u201d the majority identifies is the vague, hypothetical and novel <em>\u201cintensified </em>competition\u201d injury, maj. op. 86 (emphasis original). Specifically, the majority cites regulations permitting unrestricted coordinated expenditures to be made more than 120 days before an election and relieving non-federal political party committees from allocating expenses for employees devoting less than 25% of their time to federal election activity between federal and non-federal expenditures. These regulations do not, as the majority states, require the appellees to \u201crespond to a <em>broader range </em>of competitive tactics\u201d or to \u201caccount for <em>additional </em>practices.\u201d Maj. op. 86 (emphases added). Even under the appellees\u2019 interpretation, BCRA indisputably permits both soft-money-funded coordinated expenditures and use of non-federal committee employees for federal election activity; the regulations simply permit more of these same activities than the appellees believe BCRA authorizes. How these regulations \u201cintensify\u201d the appellees\u2019 competition, whether and to what extent rival candidates may avail themselves of the so-called \u201csafe harbors\u201d or their increased use of them will affect the outcome of the appellees\u2019 reelection campaigns, is anyone\u2019s guess. Notably, neither the appellees nor the majority cites any instance when the safe harbors were exploited to a candidate\u2019s detriment in the 2004 election campaigns. In short, the majority\u2019s \u201cintensified competition\u201d is precisely the sort of vague and speculative injury that Article Ill\u2019s case or controversy requirement forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Third, the majority\u2019s competitive standing theory fails because, as the district court noted, the appellees did not allege a specific competitive injury in their declarations or elsewhere. See <em>Shays v. FEC, </em>337 F.Supp.2d 28, 45 n. 12 (2004); <em>Sierra Club v. EPA, </em>292 F.3d 895, 899 (D.C.Cir.2002) (burden is on party asserting standing to \u201cidentify in th[e] record evidence sufficient to support its standing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Finally, the majority is simply wrong if it means to suggest that the two congressmen have standing solely because they are \u201cdirectly regulated parties,\u201d maj. op. 94. The appellees claim injury not from any regulation of their activities under BCRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>or the FEC\u2019s regulations but rather from the way that other candidates will be regulated (or not). It is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McConnell </em>that injury does not arise automatically from the simple fact of being subject to regulation under a particular regime. As a senator raising funds to run for reelection, McConnell was plainly \u201cdirectly regulated\u201d by BCRA. Yet the Supreme Court found he lacked standing to challenge section 305 of BCRA because he failed to carry his burden to \u201cdemonstrate an \u2018injury in fact,\u2019 which is \u2018concrete,\u2019 \u2018distinct and palpable,\u2019 and \u2018actual or imminent.\u2019 \u201d <em>McConnell, </em>540 U.S. at 225, 124 S.Ct. 619. The defect noted in McConnell\u2019s case was the temporal remoteness of his claimed injury, which related to an election then 6 years off \u2014 an unlikely stumbling block for congressmen such as the appellees who are elected biennially. Nonetheless, the treatment of McConnell is relevant here because the Court refused to assume his standing simply because he is \u201cdirectly regulated\u201d by BCRA. He was still required to point to some specific injury that satisfied all of the standing requirements. The appellee congressmen here are likewise required to identify some specific injury arising from the regulations in order to satisfy Article Ill\u2019s requirements. Because they failed to do so, I would vacate the district court\u2019s decision and dismiss this action for lack of standing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\">. I know of no authority to support the majority\u2019s suggestion, maj. op. 88-89, that if the appellees come within BCRA's \"zone of interests\u201d for prudential standing under the APA\u2014 a requirement the majority acknowledges is \" '[n]ever especially demanding,\u2019 \u201d maj. op. 83 (quoting <em>Amgen, Inc. v.

In <em>Gottlieb, </em>on which the majority relies, maj. op. 87, the court rejected the competitive standing claim of a political action committee challenging a candidate\u2019s receipt of federal matching funds, citing our decision in <em>Fulani, </em>in which we had similarly rejected a third party candidate's challenge to the tax exempt status of a presidential debate sponsor. The <em>Gottlieb </em>court noted that in <em>Fulani </em>\u2018\u2018[w]e <em>speculated </em>that \u2018[a]rguably' Fulani would have had standing \u2018if the IRS were depriving Fulani of a benefit that it afforded to others similarly placed.\u2019 \" 143 F.3d at 621 (quoting <em>Fulani, </em>935 F.2d at 1328) (emphases added).
