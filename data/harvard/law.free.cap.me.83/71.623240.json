He offered proof to substantiate his objections ; which having been heard and considered by the court, were overruled, and the report being accepted, he took exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">The ease appears in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-11\"><em>Geo.

E. Ins. Co. </em>63 Maine, 502; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>62 Maine, 443. The result is the same when, by the terms of the rule, the referee is \"to decide the action on legal principles ;\u201d for the referee is under no obligations,\u2014 even if requested, \u2014 to report the facts and submit questions of law for the consideration of the court. <em>Sweeny </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>34 Maine, 388; <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>65 Maine, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">This meets and disposes of the first, second, fourth and fifth objections urged against the acceptance of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Some of the evidence before the referee consisted of sixteen printed pages of letters in the French language which the defendant requested the referee to cause to be translated into English; and in consequence of his omission to do so, the objection is made that he failed to understand, comprehend and consider their contents which were material to the issue. The answer is twofold: (1,) It was no part of the duty of the referee to cause the letters to be translated; and (2) the referee testifies that, with the aid of his grammar and dictionary, he refreshed his collegiate knowledge of the language and qnderstood the purport of the letters ; and hence this objection is not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The only bias or prejudice apparent in the case on the part of the referee is that his decision was against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-9\">Peters, C.
