The district court found the defendant negligent, but that plaintiff\u2019s damages of $7,000 should be reduced by thirty percent because of his contributory negligence. On appeal plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, that the court erred in refusing to grant a directed verdict, that the award was inadequate and that the court\u2019s finding of contributory negligence was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">After a careful review of the record, the briefs and the findings of the district court, as stated orally from the bench, we are of the opinion that there was no reversible error. The judgment of the district court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
