Appellant indicated she felt no need for an attorney and discussed the discrepancies freely. She admitted that she handled the money at her window, made the entries in the passbooks involved, and made out the smaller-in-amount deposit slips, but denied that she took any money for her own use. She was not placed under arrest or taken into custody at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">Seeking to bring this case under Miranda v. State of Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, appellant argues that she had a constitutional right to have counsel present at the time of interrogation and that because she never knowingly and intelligently waived that right it was error to admit the testimony of one of the agents concerning the above conversation with appellant. We reject her attempt to apply <em>Miranda </em>to this factual setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">The <em>Miranda </em>safeguards are applicable only in instances of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d which the Court defines as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-18\">\u201c * * * questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-21\">Appellant here had not been taken into custody nor is there the slightest indication that she was deprived of her freedom of action in any way. She acted voluntarily in her dealings with the agents and none of the compulsive factors adverted to in <em>Miranda </em>are present. Under the circumstances of this case we decline to extend the <em>Miranda </em>arena. Cf. Pennewell v. United States, D.C.Cir., 1965, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 353 F.2d 870; United States v. Davis, U.S.D.C.Mass., 1966, 259 F.Supp. 496. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>cf. People v. Allen, 1966, 272 N.Y.S.2d 249, 50 Misc.2d 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing to determine whether her \u201cconfession\u201d to the agents was voluntary. Jackson v. Denno, 1964, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908. Suffice it to say that voluntariness was never put in issue. Not only was there no objection but there was no way the trial court could have been aware that the voluntariness of her oral statements to the agents was questioned. See 378 U.S. at 374, 84 S.Ct. 1774. There must be a limit to the clairvoyance we require the trial courts to possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\">. It is not clear where the FBI agents questioned appellant, but it is clear that the questioning was not done in a building housing law enforcement personnel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-19\">\"4. This is what we meant in <em>Escobedo </em>when we spoke of an investigation which had focused on an accused.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
