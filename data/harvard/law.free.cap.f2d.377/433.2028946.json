Plaintiffs appeal from the decision of the district court holding that Negro citizens may be barred on account of their race and color from buying and eating barbecue at certain drive-in restaurants in South Carolina. We disagree and reverse.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">The facts as found by the district court are not in dispute. Briefly stated,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc. (L. Maurice Bessinger is the principal stockholder and general manager) owns and operates five eating establishments specializing in southern style barbecue, all of which are located on or near interstate highways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">All of Piggie Park\u2019s eating places are of the drive-in type. In order to be served, a customer drives upon the premises in his automobile and places his order through an intercom. When he pushes a button, his order is taken by an employee inside the building who is usually out of sight of the customer. A curb attendant delivers the food or beverage to the customer\u2019s car and collects for the same. Orders are served in disposable paper plates and cups. The food is served in such a way that it is ready for consumption. Half the customers eat it in their automobiles while parked on the premises. There are no tables, chairs, counters, bars, or stools at any of the drive-ins sufficient to accommodate any appreciable number of patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">Although Piggie Park and Bessinger denied in their Answer and two amended Answers that plaintiffs had been denied service at one or more of Piggie Park\u2019s drive-ins, it was uncontested at the trial that Piggie Park denied full and equal service to Negroes because of their race at all of its eating places.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">The district court erroneously concluded that Piggie Park\u2019s drive-ins were not covered by the federal public ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>commodations law contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.4 The court reasoned that the statute would not apply to a drive-in eating place unless a majority of the prepared food sold was actually consumed by the customers on the premises. It found from the testimony of Mr. Bessinger that fifty percent of his food volume was consumed on the premises and fifty percent off the premises, and from that finding of fact concluded that the drive-ins were <em>not </em>facilities \u201cprincipally engaged in selling food for consumption on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Such a construction, we think, finds no support in congressional history. The Congress did not intend coverage of the Act to depend upon a head count of how many people eat on the premises or a computation of poundage or volume of food eaten. If it had so intended, it would have been a simple matter to change the questioned phrase \u201cfor consumption on the premises\u201d to read \u201cactually consumed on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">During the House hearings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Attorney General said \u201cthe areas of coverage should be clear to both the proprietors and the public.\u201d If the \u201ccommerce\u201d tests<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are the principal criteria, and we think they are, clarity of coverage is promoted. A traveler can then intelligently assume that an eating place on an <em>interstate </em>highway is covered. Under the district court\u2019s fifty percent test of actual consumption on the premises, prospective Negro customers would have no idea whether or not they might be served and would continue to occupy the intolerable position \u2014 at least with respect to drive-ins \u2014 in which they found themselves prior to passage of the Act with respect to interstate travel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a mobile society, the ready availability of prepared, ready-to-eat food is a practical necessity \u2014 not a luxury.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">In our view, the emphasis in the phrase \u201cprincipally engaged in selling <em>food </em>for consumption on the premises\u201d is properly on the word \u201cfood\u201d. The term \u201cprincipally\u201d did not appear in the bill as introduced. It was added by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>House Judiciary Committee and retained in the same form when the House version of the coverage provisions was ultimately adopted in the Senate. Its inclusion was not intended to have any bearing upon the percentage of food consumed on the premises, but was intended only to exclude from coverage places where food service was incidental to some other business, e. g., bars and \u201cMrs. Murphy\u201d tourist homes serving breakfast as a matter of convenience to overnight lodgers. Given the intention \u25a0of Congress to eliminate bars,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the meaning of \u201cprincipally\u201d comes into clear focus. Nothing in the 1964 Act as introduced or in any revision made before its \u2022enactment except for the addition of the word \u201cprincipally\u201d would exclude bars (and other places such as bowling alleys .and pool rooms) serving food as an incident to other business.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The words in the statute \u201cfor consumption on the premises\u201d modify the prior word \u201cfood\u201d and describe the <em>kind </em>\u2022of food sold by other facilities that are covered similar to restaurants, cafeferias, lunchrooms, lunch counters, and .soda fountains. The Congress clearly meant to extend its power beyond the \u2022ordinary sit-down restaurant and just as clearly did not undertake to legislate with respect to grocery type food stores which would have been covered but for the modifying phrase \u201cfor consumption \u25a0on the premises.\u201d Thus, food stores are <em>not </em>covered, but stores (or facilities) that sell food of a <em>particular type, </em>i. e., ready for consumption on the premises, <em>\u25a0are </em>covered. What the customers actually <em>do </em>with the ready-to-eat food was not the concern of the Congress \u2014 whether they eat it then and there or subsequently and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The sense of this plan of coverage is apparent. Retail stores, food markets, and the like were excluded from the Act for the policy reason that there was little, if any, discrimination in the operation of them. Negroes have long been welcomed as customers in such stores. See 110 Cong.Rec. 6533 (1954) (remarks of Senator Humphrey).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> Discrimination with respect to ready-to-eat food service facilities <em>was </em>a problem. When a substantial minority of American citizens are denied restaurant facilities \u2014 whether sit-down or drive-in \u2014 that are open to the public, unquestionably interstate commerce is burdened. Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 6, 13 L.Ed.2d 15 (1964). It was this evil the Congress sought to eliminate to the end that <em>all </em>citizens might freely and not inconveniently travel between the states. We think the Congress plainly meant to include within the coverage of the Act all restaurants, cafeterias, lunchrooms, lunch counters, soda fountains, and <em>all other facilities </em>similarly engaged as a main part of their business in selling food ready for consumption on the premises. We are further of the opinion that the statutory language accomplished that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">COUNSEL FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Title II as a whole demonstrates that the Congress intended to assure rapid and effective compliance with its terms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C.A. Section 2000a-3(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>authorizes the court in its discretion, to allow the prevailing party (other than the United States) a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs. By reason of our reversal of the district court, the plaintiffs now become the \u201cprevailing party\u201d, and on remand we instruct the district court to consider the allowance of counsel fees, whether in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In exercising its discretion, the district court may properly consider whether any of the numerous defenses interposed by defendants were presented for purposes of delay and not in good faith. But the test should be a subjective one, for no litigant ought to be punished under the guise of an award of counsel fees (or in any other manner) from taking a position in court in which he honestly believes \u2014 however lacking in merit that position may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The court may also consider whether the defendants acted in good faith in denying discrimination against Negroes and thus requiring proof of what was subsequently conceded to be true. A litigant who increases the burden upon opposing counsel by such tactics ought ordinarily bear the cost of unnecessary trial preparation. The so-called \u201cgeneral denial\u201d is not countenanced by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Reversed and remanded for consideration of the award of counsel fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\"> Judge J.

I agree also that the case should be remanded for consideration of an award of counsel fees, but I conclude that good faith, standing alone, should not always immunize a defendant from an award against him. Specifically, in this case, defendants are not entitled to the defense of good faith in regard to the major portion of their defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u25a0 The district judge is told that in exercising his discretion he should \u201cconsider whether any of the numerous defenses interposed by defendants were presented for purposes of delay and not in good faith\u201d because no defendant ought to. be punished for \u201ctaking a position in court in which he honestly believes\u2014 <em>however lacking in merit that position may be.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) In this case, defendants interposed defenses patently frivolous, and I would not permit them to avoid the costs of overcoming such defenses on a purely subjective test of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">In providing for counsel fees, the manifest purposes of the Act are to discourage violations, to encourage complaints, by those subjected to discrimination and to provide a speedy and efficient remedy for those discriminated against. If counsel fees are withheld or grudgingly granted, violators feel no sanctions, victims are frustrated and instances of unquestionably illegal discrimination may well go without effective remedy. To. immunize defendants from an award of counsel fees, honest beliefs should bear some reasonable relation to reality; never should frivolity go unrecognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">While the threat of an award of counsel fees ought not to be used to discourage non-frivolous defenses asserted in good faith, the district court should be instructed to make an allowance in regard to some of defendants\u2019 defenses, and, in its discretion, to consider an allowance for the remainder of defendants\u2019 defenses depending upon its determination of defendants\u2019 good faith and honest belief. Those clearly compensable are defendants\u2019 assertion that, their \u201cLittle Joe\u2019s Sandwich Shop,\u201d a sit-down facility shown overwhelmingly by the proof to be a place where service, was refused to Negro citizens, was not. subject to the Act. The fact that the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>defendants had discriminated both at Piggie Park\u2019s drive-ins and at Little Joe\u2019s Sandwich Shop was of course known to them, yet they denied the fact and made it necessary for the plaintiffs to offer proof, and the defendants could not and did not undertake at the trial to support their denials. Includable in the same category are defendants\u2019 contention, twice pleaded after the decision in Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 6 (1964), that the Act was unconstitutional on the very grounds foreclosed by <em>McClung; </em>and defendants\u2019 contention that the Act was invalid because it \u201ccontravenes the will of God\u201d and constitutes an interference with the \u201cfree exercise of the Defendant\u2019s religion.\u201d The district judge should be told that, in awarding counsel fees, he should include an amount which fully compensates plaintiffs for the time, effort and expenses of counsel in overcoming these elements of expense needlessly imposed on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Only as to the remaining defenses do I think that defendants\u2019 good faith is the issue. If good faith is found not to have existed as to them, an additional award of counsel fees on a like basis should be made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
