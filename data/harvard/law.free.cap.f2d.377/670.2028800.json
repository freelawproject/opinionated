Morgan v. United States, 1936, 298 U.S. 468, 481, 56 S.Ct.. 906, 80 L.Ed. 1288; NLRB v. Clausen, 3 Cir., 188 F.2d 439, 444, cert. den. 342 U.S. 868, 72 S.Ct. 108, 96 L.Ed. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">With respect to the Regional Director\u2019s refusal to permit petitioner to* take depositions the company failed to-file due exception as required by \u00a7 10(e) of the Act. It therefore cannot raise the-point now. NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 1953, 344 U.S. 344, 350, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377; NLRB v.
