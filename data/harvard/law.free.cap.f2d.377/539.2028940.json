Counsel certainly could have approached the bench with his opponent and held a quiet colloquy with the judge. Also, a special instruction could have been requested. Neither was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">Appellant suggests the judge became an advocate. The record contradicts this. The trial was eminently fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-20\">Counsel for appellant has done as best he could with very little to go on. He is not to be censured. Oft-times in criminal appeals counsel is required to attempt to jump over an eight foot high bar from a standing start.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
