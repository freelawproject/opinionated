Appellee\u2019s dungarees on the other hand, are not made of, nor do they contain leather.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">Appellant contends that NUHIDE is the phonetic equivalent of either \u201cnew hide\u201d or \u201cgnu hide,\u201d a gnu being a type \u25a0of antelope, and that, as applied to dungarees, the mark sought to be registered by appellee is deceptive and/or deceptively misdescriptive of the goods under sections 2(a) and 2(e) (1) of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(a), (e) (1), since the term NUHIDE would indicate to purchasers thereof that the goods contain, or are made of, leather or hide, whereas such is not in fact the case. In support of these contentions appellant cites the decisions of this court in R. Neumann &amp; Co. v. Bon-Ton Auto Upholstery, Inc., 326 F.2d 799, 51 CCPA 934 (1964) and R. Neumann &amp; Co. v. Overseas Shipments, Inc., 326 F.2d 786, 51 CCPA 946 (1964).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-17\">The former case involved the term VYNAHYDE for non-leather plastic film which could be made to simulate leather, and for plastic film made into furniture slip covers used to cover various types of upholstery, including leather. The latter case involved the term DURA-HYDE for plastic material of leatherlike appearance made into shoes, the uppers thereof being made to simulate both the grain appearance and the color of tanned leather. With regard to these and other precedents relied upon by appellant-opposer, we think the board correctly and appropriately stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-18\">In each of the cases relied upon by opposer, however, the goods in question were either leather substitutes or products made of leather substitutes, whereas such is not the case with respect to the goods of the instant applicant; and none of the cited cases otherwise stand for the proposition advanced by opposer, i. e. the use of leather terms for any and all non-leather products is per se deceptive and deceptively misdescriptive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-19\">We likewise agree with the following analysis by the board of the particular facts and circumstances of the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-20\">It thus appears, and it is a matter of common knowledge, that dungarees are a particular type of garment made exclusively from a particular type of cotton fabric, as it likewise is that chaps are a distinctly different type of garment made exclusively of leather. Under these circumstances, it is our opinion that the purchasing public is not at all likely to be deceived, misled or induced by applicant\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>\u201cNUHIDE\u201d into buying applicant\u2019s dungarees in the mistaken belief that they are made in whole or in part of leather or into buying applicant\u2019s dungarees in the mistaken belief that they are chaps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Appellant\u2019s arguments are largely based on the fact that dungarees, e. g. blue jeans, are one type of work pants, a class of goods which might also include cowboys\u2019 chaps. Therefore, according to appellant, the goods of the parties are competing. This argument seems to ignore the fact that chaps, which have no seat, would only be worn in conjunction with regular work pants, such as dungarees. Thus the parties\u2019 goods are not competing. Also, the description of goods in appellee\u2019s application is limited to \u201cdungarees,\u201d not work pants broadly, and the specimen label for the goods describes them as <em>\u201cA COMPLETELY WASHABLE </em>Western Dungaree.\u201d While the label also apparently misdescribes the dungarees as \u201cCHAPS,\u201d as noted by the board, we do not consider this to be <em>deceptively </em>misdescriptive under the circumstances of this case, especially since seatless chaps may be worn in conjunction with, but not as a substitute for, dungarees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Having found no reversible error in the decision of the board dismissing appellant\u2019s opposition, we affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">WORLEY, C. J., did not participate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1059-14\">. Serial No. 164,988, filed March 19, 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1059-15\"><em>. </em>These two <em>Neumann </em>cases are also heavily relied upon by the appellant in a companion case heard and decided concurrently herewith. W. D. Byron &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Stein Bros. Mfg. Co., 377 F.2d 1001, 54 CCPA -.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1060-8\">KIRKPATRICK, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">As noted by the majority, this court in R. Neumann &amp; Co. v. Bon-Ton Auto Upholstery, Inc., 326 F.2d 799, 51 CCPA 934, held that \u201cVYNAHYDE\u201d was both deceptive and deceptively misdescriptive of plastic films and plastic films made into furniture slipcovers, because it gave the erroneous impression that they were made of leather. In the present case the majority holds that \u201cNUHIDE\u201d is not deceptive or deceptively misdescriptive when applied to a type of pants known as dungarees. The fact that dungarees are made from a certain type of cloth does not in my view prevent a purchaser from assuming that the same style of pants is made from a different material, the word \u201cdungarees\u201d being regarded as a style designation. Under these circumstances I think that the word \u201cNUHIDE\u201d would convey to the prospective purchaser that he would be obtaining a pair of leather pants styled as blue jeans or dungarees are now styled. It seems to me that the majority\u2019s reasoning might lead to a conclusion that a trademark such as \u201cLEATHER DUNGAREES\u201d would not be deceptive or deceptively misdescriptive, presumably because no one ought to believe the statement. It is also of some significance that the specimen label misdescribes the goods in question as chaps which are normally made of leather.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">I would, therefore, reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
