The District Court denied relief upon the ground that appellant had given consent to the examination of his records.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-25\">Appellant contends that his constitutional right to counsel was violated under Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), in that the investigation had reached the accusatory stage (a Special Agent having participated in the investigation), and he was not advised of his rights. This court has ruled against appellant\u2019s contention in Kohatsu v. United States, 351 F.2d 898 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1011, 86 S.Ct. 1915, 16 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1966). Appellant seeks to distinguish that case. We find no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>for distinction and regard the decision as controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Appellant challenges the court\u2019s finding of a voluntary consent. In our judgment the finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Appellant contends that the court\u2019s finding of consent was not sufficient to support a conclusion that constitutional rights had not been violated. In our judgment the finding was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-17\">. See Hoffritz v. United States, 240 F.2d 109 (9th Cir. 1956); Rodgers v. United States, 158 F.Supp. 670 (S.D.Cal.1958). This is an appealable final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1964) per Goodman v. United States, 309 F.2d 166 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
