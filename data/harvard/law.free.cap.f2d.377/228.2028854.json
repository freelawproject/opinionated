The district court granted the appeal since our decision may advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. We granted leave to file the appeal and have heard oral arguments from the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">Plaintiffs, Mrs. Nona Mae George and her minor son, Roy Lee Lewis, are Negro citizens who reside in Gould, Lincoln County, Arkansas. The complainants seek relief under the Civil Rights Statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983. The suit was brought as a class action for all persons similarly situated pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) (3). An interlocutory and permanent injunction under Tit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4) is sought against the respective Board of Managers of the Arkansas Training School for Boys at Wrightsville and at Pine Bluff from the maintenance of a separate \u201ctraining\u201d school for white and Negro juveniles. Similarly, an injunction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>sought against Lincoln County, Juvenile Court Judge, E. G. Brockman and all other \u201cjuvenile court\u201d judges similarly situated from assigning or sentencing minor Negro juveniles to the Training School at Wrightsville on the basis of race or color.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The two training schools, Wrightsville, known as the Negro Boys Industrial School, and Pine Bluff, known as the White Boys School, are set up and operated pursuant to \u00a7 46-301-360 of the Arkansas Statutes Annotated. Relevant portions of the Arkansas Statutes <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Section 301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\"><em>\u201cNames of training schools. </em>\u2014 Hereafter, (a) the Arkansas Boys\u2019 Training School shall be known as the \u2018Arkansas Training School for Boys at Pine Bluff,\u2019 (b) the Negro Boys\u2019 Industrial School shall be known as the \u201cArkansas Training Schools for Boys at Wrightsville,\u2019 * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Section 305:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\"><em>\u201cNature of institution. </em>\u2014 It is hereby declared to be the purpose of this Act [\u00a7\u00a7 46-305 \u2014 46-318] that hereafter the Boys\u2019 Industrial School of the 'State of Arkansas [Arkansas Training School for Boys at Pine Bluff] be \u25a0deemed a training and educational institution, and shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of any other accredited educational institution of this state. It is further the purpose of this Act to declare that the Boys\u2019 Industrial School [Arkansas Training School for Boys at Pine Bluff] is not, and shall not be a part of the penal system of this State, nor shall it be construed as a penal institution.\u201d Section 306:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\"><em>\u201cCommitment of delinquent </em>boys.\u2014 Any white male child under 18 years of age who has or shall be legally adjudged to be a delinquent or neglected juvenile as defined by law may be committed to the Boys\u2019 Industrial School [Arkansas Training School for Boys at Pine Bluff] by any juvenile or circuit court having jurisdiction over said juvenile. The order of commitment shall be for an indefinite period but in no case shall a child be retained in the School after he reaches majority.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Section 321:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\"><em>\u201cNature of institution. </em>\u2014 It is hereby declared to be the purpose of this Act [\u00a7\u00a7 46-321, 46-326 \u2014 46-329] that hereafter the Negro Boys\u2019 Industrial School of the State of Arkansas [Arkansas Training School for Boys at Wrightsville] be deemed a training and educational institution, and shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of any other accredited educational institution of this State. It is further the purpose of this act to declare that the Negro Boys\u2019 Industrial School [Arkansas Training School for Boys at Wrightsville] is not, and shall not be a part of the penal system of this State, nor shall it be construed as a penal institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">Section 330:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\"><em>\u201cCommitment by juvenile or circuit court. </em>\u2014 Any colored male child under eighteen (18) years of age who has or! shall be legally adjudged to be a delinquent or dependent juvenile as defined by law may be committed to the Negro Boys\u2019 Industrial School [Arkansas Training School for Boys at Wrightsville] by any juvenile or circuit court having jurisdiction over said juvenile. The order of commitment shall be for an indefinite period but in no case shall a child be retained at the School after he reaches majority. However, only such dependent children may be committed to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>School as in the opinion of the court cannot be placed in a good home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFEE\">Commitment to one school or another is limited to adjudication of a juvenile being \u201cdependent or delinquent.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that Roy Lee Lewis was adjudged by Judge Brockman to be delinquent and was sent to the \u201cNegro Boys School.\u201d The commitment was pursuant to \u201cthe state law\u201d above set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">It is alleged that plaintiffs have been d\u00e9prived of their equal right to equal treatment, privileges and opportunities by the State of Arkansas solely because of their race or color; it is alleged these rights are in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Appellants assert that the statutes of Arkansas cannot be properly attacked in the present proceeding since (1) they are not pleaded or specifically attacked in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and (2) they cannot be declared unconstitutional without involving a three-judge court under Tit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Rule 8(f) Fed.R.Civ.P. requires us to construe \u201c[a] 11 pleadings * * * to do substantial justice.\u201d The complaint alleges that the Arkansas juvenile judges have acted pursuant to \u201cstate law.\u201d The complaint thus necessarily incorporates the statutes by reference. Likewise, the motion to dismiss raises the validity of the statutes since appellants rely on the statutes in their brief to support their motion. Cf. Bynum v. Schiro, E.D.La., 219 F.Supp. 204. It would clearly be a \u201ccontradiction of reason\u201d to attempt to enjoin the state from enforcement of a statute and at the same time not pass upon the constitutionality of the statute. Cf. United States ex rel. McNeill v. Tarumianz, 3 Cir., 242 F.2d 191. Moreover it is not necessary to attack statutes by specific pleading which on their face are unconstitutional. Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 82 S.Ct. 805, 7 L.Ed.2d 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">We are also mindful that the present appeal comes to us on a motion to dismiss with a limited record. Appellant has not even filed its answer. We adhere to the proposition that it would be improper to consider \u201cgrave constitutional questions\u201d where there exists \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that further proceedings could help clarify the issues. Borden\u2019s Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, 293 U.S. 194, at 213, 55 S.Ct. 187, 79 L. Ed. 281. However, in the present proceeding no further pleadings or evidence is necessary for \u201crefinement or clarification of issues.\u201d United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 91 L.Ed. 1877; United States v. Fabro, Inc., M. D.Ga., 206 F.Supp. 523. And we should dispose of all controversies \u201cas expeditiously as is consistent with proper judicial administration.\u201d Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 82 S.Ct. 805, 7 L.Ed.2d 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Section 2281 requiring a three-judge court is not mandatory where the statute invokes clear governmental discrimination. Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 549, 7 L.Ed.2d 512. Segregation of public institutions or facilities is no longer a substantial constitutional question. United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, see n. 6 at 754, 86 S. Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239; Johnson v. State of Virginia, 373 U.S. 61, 83 S.Ct. 1053, 10 L.Ed.2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">However, it is initially urged that appellees have not stated a claim for relief since the Arkansas training schools are not \u201ceducational\u201d but \u201cpenal\u201d institutions, and therefore the \u201cpolicy\u201d of fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>eral court non-interference with \u201cpenal\u201d institutions should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"> Although we do not base our decision upon a determination that these training schools are educational institutions, we only comment that it is the legislative declaration of the Arkansas people that these schools are not to be considered as \u201cpenal\u201d in nature. Ark.Stats. Anno. \u00a7\u00a7 46-305, 46-321.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By legislative fiat these schools are an integral part of the educational system in the State of Arkansas. Their responsibilities are equal to any other public institutions of learning in educating young people to assume useful roles in society. \u201c * * * [I] n the field of public education the doctrine of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\u201d Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, at 495, 74 S.Ct. 686, at 692, 98 L.Ed. 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">However, to adopt the appellants\u2019 pernicious brand that these institutions are \u201cpenal\u201d in nature leads nowhere. Penal institutions are public institutions and are not exempt from constitutional limitations. Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030. Our holdings in Lee v. Tahash, 8 Cir., 352 F.2d 970, and Harris v. Settle, 8 Cir., 322 F.2d 908, do not authorize discrimination in violation of constitutional prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">Wholesale and arbitrary discrimination by state statutes is far removed from disciplinary administrative matters by prison officials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As was stated in the recent decision of Washington v. Lee, M.D.Ala., 263 F.Supp. 327, at 331:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-14\">\u201c * * * In this regard, this Court can conceive of no consideration of prison security or discipline which will sustain the constitutionality of state statutes that on their face require complete and permanent segregation of the races in all the Alabama penal facilities. We recognize that there is merit in the contention that in some isolated instances prison security and discipline necessitates segregation of the races for a limited period. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>recognition of such instances does nothing to bolster the statutes or the general practice that requires or permits prison or jail officials to separate the races arbitrarily. Such statutes and practices must be declared unconstitutional in light of the clear principles controlling.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">See, also, Singleton v. Board of Comms. of State Institutions, 5 Cir., 356 F.2d 771; Bolden v. Pegelow, 4 Cir., 329 F.2d 95; Dixon v. Duncan, E.D.Va., 218 F.Supp. 157; Ferguson v. Buchanan, S.D.Fla., 10 R.R.L.R. 795 (1965). See also, Edwards v. Sard, D.D.C., 250 F.Supp. 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">To the extent that \u00a7\u00a7 46-301-46-360 of the Arkansas statutes require segregation of juveniles to white schools or colored schools, based solely upon the race of the individual involved, the statutes are clearly unconstitutional; to the extent that the statutes require commitment to segregated facilities, they are clearly unconstitutional; to the extent that the statutes require maintenance of segregated facilities they are clearly unconstitutional. No injunction need issue to an individual judge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> board manager or any person in light of our holding at the present time. The statutes are not void in their entirety and commitment of juveniles for dependency and delinquency may still be enforced thereunder. However, under no circumstance should race become a determinative factor in assignment. All children, white or colored, must be assigned to either school- <em>in accordance with any approved plan of desegregation. </em>The Board of Managers shall prepare a plan for desegregation of the facilities and present it to the district court for approval. Such plan should be filed within a reasonable time as set by the district court and should set forth a reasonable time within which said institutions will become completely desegregated. The trial court shall retain jurisdiction until the desegregation plans have been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">Judgment is affirmed, the c\u00e1se is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">. Arkansas likewise maintains a similar segregated system of training schools for girls, one known as the Training School for Girls at Alexander for white girls, and the other is Fargo Training School for Negro girls. Ark.Stats.Anno. \u00a7\u00a7 46-366 to 46-385. Although we have no jurisdiction over the girls\u2019 facilities under \u00a7\u00a7 46-366 to 46-385, it is similarly obvious that these provisions do not conform to constitutional standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. Plaintiffs likewise allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">\u201cThe Arkansas Boy\u2019s Training School at Pine Bluff operated for white delinquent or dependent juveniles offers and afford grossly superior facilities, rehabilitation programs, opportunities, etc., to those offered and afforded at the Negro Boys\u2019 Training School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">\u201cThe Arkansas Legislature appropriates far greater amounts of money, on a per pupil basis, for the operation of the white Boy\u2019s Training School than it does for the Negro Boy\u2019s Training School.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">.
