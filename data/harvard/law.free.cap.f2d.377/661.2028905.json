The four claims on appeal, relating generally to a therapeutic composition, appear to stand or fall together. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-23\">1. A therapeutic composition comprising hydrocortisone free alcohol and neomycin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-24\">2. A topical therapeutic composition comprising hydrocortisone free alcohol and neomycin dispersed in a vehicle suitable for topical application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-25\">16. A therapeutic composition comprising hydrocortisone free alcohol and neomycin sulfate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-26\">17. A therapeutic composition comprising sodium hydrocortisone hemisuccinate and neomycin sulfate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-27\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-28\">The disclosures relied upon to support the rejection are found in the following references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-29\">Reichstein 2,183,589 Dec. 19, 1939<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lepri, \u201cStudies on Cortisone in Ophthalmology\u201d, 35 Am.J.Ophthalmology 935-946 (1952);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-30\">Modern Drugs 293 (Jan. 1953); Boland, \u201cHydrocortisone,\u201d 13 J.Am. Ph.Assn. 540-544 (1952);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-31\">Gordon, \u201cStatus of Corticotropin, Cortisone and Hydrocortisone * * <em>*,r </em>Brit.J.Opthalmology 85-98 (Feb. 1953);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-32\">Merck, \u201cCortone and Hydrocortone\u201d, (Apr. 1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-33\">The composition covered by the claims; contains two active ingredients: 1) \u201chydrocortisone free alcohol\u201d or \u201csodium hydrocortisone hemisuccinate,\u201d and 2) neomycin. Appellant\u2019s specification points out that the word \u201chydrocortisone\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>used to mean 17 a-hydroxycortieosterone and its therapeutically active derivatives, such as the 21-esters including the acetate, the cyclopentylproprionate and others, and the 9 a-halo derivatives, especially 9 a-fluorohydroeortisone and 9 a-chlorohydrocortisone, and the therapeutically active derivatives, e. g., esters, thereof. It also includes the water soluble derivatives of these compounds, such as the hemisuccinates, e. g., sodium hydrocortisone hemisuccinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The word \u201cneomycin\u201d is also disclosed as meaning the antibiotic more fully described in Waksman, Neomycin (Rutgers University Press, 1953). It includes the various forms of neomycin (such as the B and C forms) aftd their therapeutically active derivatives (such as the sulfate and hydrochloride salts).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The composition claimed is prepared by mixing the two active ingredients. Generally the mixture is prepared in a vehicle suitable for the particular use to which the composition is to be put. When the composition is to be used topically it is generally prepared in an ointment base. It can also be prepared as a lotion or jelly for topical use. It is generally prepared in a sterile vehicle when the use intended is ophthalmic or requires parenteral injection. It is prepared in an aerosol type vehicle when intended for use as a nasal spray. It can be prepared in the form of a powder or tablet for vaginal and similar uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The solicitor\u2019s position, as stated in his brief, is that the prior art references are pertinent to the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(1) The Reichstein et al. patent * * * disclosed suparenal cortical hormones containing at least one group which is convertible to a hydroxyl group and cortisone actetate (claims 7 and 16 * * *). Example 6 of the reference refers to the preparation of cortisone hemisuccinate * * *. Appellant agrees that Reichstein suggests the hemisuccinate of hydrocortisone * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">(2) The Lepri article discloses an <em>in vitro </em>study to determine whether cortisone (cortisone acetate was actually utilized) interferes with the action of such antibiotics as neomycin, penicillin, terramycin, and three other antibiotics * * *. The conclusion from the <em>in vitro </em>study was that \u201ccortisone does not have any influence on the action of antibiotics on microorganisms\u201d * * *. An <em>in vivo </em>study was performed to confirm this conclusion * * *. Experiments were performed to find out whether cortisone had any effect on the antibacterial efficacy of the antibiotic penicillin and terramycin * * *. The results of the experiments led to the conclusion that * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-17\">\u201cThe simultaneous administration of cortisone with penicillin and terramycin, which by themselves possess a considerable antibacterial activity in the experimental infection of the rabbit, seems to exert a favorable influence on the course of the infection by shortening its duration and causing an attenuation of the inflammatory signs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-18\">Lepri finally concluded from his studies that * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-19\">\u201cThe combined cortisone-antibiotic treatment, on the one hand, reduces considerably the symptoms due to the allergic exudative component of the infection and, on the other hand, acts directly on the infecting agent. This, theoretically at least, seems to be the therapy of preference for the infections of the anterior segment of the eye.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-20\">(3) The article by Boland * * * reports the effects of hydrocortisone given orally to patients with rheumatoid arthritis * * *. The free alcohol of hydrocortisone was found to have an antirheumatic potency \u201cmilligram for milligram, at least 50 per cent greater than that of cortisone acetate * * *. Also, the free alcohol was found to be \u201capproximately twice as effective\u201d as hydrocortisone acetate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-21\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-22\">(4) The \u201cNeosone\u201d advertisement * * * is directed to an ophthalmic ointment containing \u201ccortisone for in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>flammation\u201d and \u201cneomycin for infection.\u201d The active ingredients are listed as cortisone acetate and neomycin sulfate. [Published in \u201cModern Drugs.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">(5) The Gordon article * * * discloses that hydrocortisone has been employed in a series' of sixty cases \u201cmuch in the same manner and in the same dosages as cortisone\u201d * * *. The results with hydrocortisone are reported to be * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201cSystemically it appears to be more effective than cortisone in lesser concentrations (Alpert, 1952). Topically, its analgesic effect is the same or greater than that of cortisone. Administered subcon junetivally, it provokes less local reaction than cortisone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">(6) The Merck article * * * reports that hydrocortisone \u201cappears to be the steroid with the most marked anti-inflammatory action at the tissue level\u201d * * *. Except for the comment regarding hydrocortisone, the article appears to be directed to the use of hydrocortisone acetate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Such are the facts of record offered by the Patent Office in support of the rejection. Appellant\u2019s position does not differ seriously from the solicitor\u2019s summary statement quoted above as to what the prior art discloses. However, appellant disagrees with the conclusion that such disclosures make the claimed invention obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. In support of this position appellant has submitted factual evidence to which we will now turn. Appellant relies on other teachings in the prior art from which it is concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">It is submitted that not only is the acetate ester of hydrocortisone the logical substitute for the acetate ester of cortisone insofar as structural chemical relationships are concerned, but that the above-quoted teachings of the art in reference to enhanced biological properties clearly say that the hydro-cortisone acetate will provide more prolonged and enhanced effects. Surely, then, the principles of investigation in this art point the way for investigators to refrain from using the more soluble free alcohol and sodium hemisuccinate forms. This teaching of the art is clearly at odds with the position of the Examiner expressed throughout the prosecution, in his final rejection and in his answer. He contends that the more soluble forms of hydrocortisone are obvious choices in preparation of combination products, since such forms are the ones most likely to give enhanced beneficial biological properties, whether these properties be antibacterial or anti-inflammatory * * *. His contention is not supported, rather it is negatived by the publications of those skilled in the art. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">Appellant also has submitted affidavits as factual evidence which we shall now consider. Basically these affidavits are relied upon to establish what appellant refers to as \u201cevidence of unexpected antibacterial properties.\u201d Appellant in his brief refers to the \u201csummary and conclusions\u201d of the affidavit of one Wilkins as support for this position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">\n<em>Summary and Conclusions</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">(1) Hydrocortisone free alcohol and an ester, hydrocortisone 21-hemi-succinate sodium salt, significantly increased the antibacterial effectiveness of neomycin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-15\">(2) The combination of hydrocortisone and neomycin was approximately fifteen times more effective than neomycin alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-16\">(3) The free alcohol and 21-hemisuc-cinate sodium salt of prednisolone were equally effective as. potentiating agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-17\">(4) The potentiation has been observed in two different media, in either agar or broth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-18\">(5) The potentiation was entirely unexpected in view of the known properties of the individual ingredients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">In addition to the Wilkins affidavit, two Dale affidavits were introduced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The first affidavit of Dale is directed to the preparation of an ointment containing hydrocortisone and neomycin in which the affiant alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">That, he is informed and believes that the ointment thus-prepared was sent to responsible and qualified investigators for clinical testing on humans and that he has seen the reports of the clinicians indicating that the ointment thus-prepared was clinically effective in the treatment of various skin disorders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We will state at this point that the affidavit does not disclose the actual \u201creports of the clinicians\u201d or allege any unexpected results in the treatment of skin disorders. The conclusion stated therein is what we think would be expected from the teachings of the prior art. For example, the statement is made in Merck that hydrocortisone appears to be the steroid with the most marked anti-inflammatory action at the tissue level.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The second affidavit of Dale shows the combination of hydrocortisone succinate and neomycin to be more effective than neomycin alone in reducing the bacteria count in the kidneys of white mice. The affidavit also reports the results of <em>in vitro </em>experiments showing the antibacterial activity of hydrocortisone with neomycin to be greater than the'combination of cortisone acetate with neomycin.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">After reviewing the affidavits, we find ourselves unable to agree with appellant that this evidence \u201cclearly rebuts\u201d the position of the Patent Office as to obviousness. Both Lepri and Modern Drugs disclose compositions containing neomycin and cortisone acetate. The latter teaches, \u201ccortisone for inflammation, neomycin for infection * * * [a] OPHTHALMIC OINTMENT.\u201d Boland, Gordon, Merck and Reichstein disclose the equivalency of use of hydrocortisone and cortisone. And Boland, Gordon and Merck indicate the advantages of hydro-cortisone over cortisone, including cortisone acetate. The fact which the references establish is that hydrocortisone is more potent than cortisone acetate.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Appellant argues that the prior art in this case does not teach that a class of anti-inflammatory steroids is \u201cuseful with or would potentiate the antibacterial action of neomycin.\u201d This argument is inconsistent with the disclosures in Modem Drugs which show that a combination of the anti-inflammatory steroid cortisone acetate with neomycin sulfate was placed on the market. We find nothing in the record to suggest that it would have been unobvious to Lepri, as a person of ordinary skill in this art, to use hydro-cortisone instead of cortisone acetate in the Neosone preparation. The greater potency of the hydrocortisone was recognized by Boland who teaches that hydrocortisone is twice as potent as cortisone acetate. We think it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art to make the proper substitution of the more potent hydrocortisone free alcohol for the cortisone acetate in Neosone.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">We conclude, therefore, that it would have been obvious under the conditions stated in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 for one of ordinary skill in this art to substitute hydro-cortisone for cortisone in the Neosone preparation. We do not think the present record establishes an unexpected \u201cpotentiation effect\u201d flowing from the use of hydrocortisone.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Since affirmance of this ground of rejection is dispositive of this appeal, we do not find it necessary to consider an additional ground of rejection based on the claims of two copending applications of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">WORLEY, C.
