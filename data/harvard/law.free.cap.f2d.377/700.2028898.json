Hitchcock, brought an action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a) (1) in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York for a refund of a federal estate tax and assessed interest collected from the estate in the amount of $19,800.75, plus statutory interest from the date of collection. Taxpayer claims that the District Director of Internal Revenue erroneously collected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the tax because a charitable deduction in the amount of $106,425.45 had been improperly disallowed. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment, the Government cross-moved, plaintiff\u2019s motion was denied, and the Government\u2019s cross-motion was granted. The opinion and decision below is reported at 256 F.Supp. 30 (1966). Taypayer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Ora S. Hitchcock died on December 5, 1961, and her will was admitted to probate on February 7, 1962. The residue of her estate, after certain specific bequests, was governed by Article Third of her will which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">All the rest, residue and remainder of the property which I may own at the time of my death, both real and personal, of every kind and nature and wherever situated, including any lapsed legacies, I give, devise and bequeath to Samuel H. Salisbury and Genesee Valley Union Trust Company of Rochester, New York, as Trustees, in trust, nevertheless, to hold, manage, invest and reinvest, collect the income and profit therefrom and distribute the same for the following uses and purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">(a) to distribute to my cousin, Samuel H. Salisbury, or expend on his behalf, the net income derived therefrom in quarterly or other convenient installments so long as he shall live.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">(b) My disinterested Trustee is authorized in its sole and absolute discretion at any time and from time to time to distribute to my said cousin, Samuel H. Salisbury, or on his behalf, from the principal of this trust such amount or amounts as it may deem advisable to provide adequately for his maintenance, support and medical expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\"><em>If, </em>in the opinion of my disinterested Trustee, <em>my said cousin, </em>Samuel H. Salisbury, <em>is incapacitated through illness, age or other cause, my disinterested Trustee may in its sole and absolute discretion, </em>from time to time, <em>while it believes such incapacity continues, apply all or part of the principal of this trust toward the support, care and benefit of my said cousin, </em>in such amount or amounts and in such manner as it may determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">(c) Upon the death of my said cousin, (or upon my death if he shall not survive me) my surviving Trustee shall distribute the entire then remaining balance to The Commission on Ecumenical Mission and Relations of the Presbyterian Church located in New York, New York, for use in its foreign mission work. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">The federal estate tax return which was timely filed on January 22, 1963 revealed a gross estate of $180,428.-70, undisputed deductions in the amount of $17,370.77, and a claimed deduction of $106,425.45 representing the present value of the remainder interest granted to charity by subparagraph (c) of Article Third. The value of the charitable remainder was determined on the basis of the life expectancy of the life beneficiary as of the date of testator\u2019s death and under the assumption, verified by an affidavit filed with the return, that the trust principal would never be invaded as authorized by subparagraph (b) of Article Third inasmuch as the private beneficiary\u2019s financial resources were substantially in excess of his anticipated future needs. The district judge upheld the government position that the deduction was not authorized by \u00a7 2055 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tee\u2019s discretionary authority in the second sentence of subparagraph (b) to invade corpus for the \u201csupport, care and benefit\u201d of the income beneficiary during an incapacitation through \u201cillness, age or other cause\u201d prevented the charitable interest from being \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d within the purview of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 20.2055-2(a) (1958).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree, and as there are undetermined factual questions relative to the remoteness of the possibility that the charitable interest will not become effective within the meaning of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 20.2055-2 (b) (1958)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and relative to the amount of any deduction, we remand for a determination thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">As we have stated, the sole question on this appeal is whether the charitable remainder interest is \u201cpresently ascertainable.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The answer must be in the affirmative when the power of the life tenant to invade corpus is limited by an objective standard fixed by the terms of the will that is capable of being stated in terms of money. Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151, 154, 49 S.Ct. 291, 73 L.Ed. 647 (1929). Absent a measurable standard limiting the power of invasion, the charitable deduction is disallowed, however remote or tenuous the possibility of invasion might be.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Henslee v. Union Planters Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 335 U.S. 595, 599, 69 S.Ct. 290, 93 L.Ed. 259 (1949); Berry v. Kuhl, 174 F.2d 565, 567 (7 Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\"> The standards provided by a will are sufficiently fixed, objective, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>measurable, when, and only when, the purposes for which corpus may be invaded are subject to \u201creliable prediction,\u201d Merchants National Bank of Boston v. CIR, 320 U.S. 256, 262, 64 S.Ct. 108, 88 L.Ed. 35 (1943), rather than to mere \u201cspeculation.\u201d 320 U.S. at 263, 64 S.Ct. 108. Thus the deduction is allowed when the life benefieiary\u2019s power of invasion is made referable to his standard of living as of testator\u2019s death, either expressly, as in <em>Ithaca Trust Co., </em>supra, or by implication from \u201csuch words as \u2018comfort and support\u2019 * * * <em>if such interpretation </em>is consistent with applicable local law, and other terminology in the will or instrument does not require some different interpretation,\u201d Rev.Rul. 54-285, 1954-2 Cum.Bull. 302. The standards in the will also qualify as presently ascertainable if the occasions for invasion of principal are limited to physical and economic emergencies, see Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. McGowan, 217 F.2d 287, 289 (2 Cir. 1954), C. I. R. v. Wells Fargo Bank &amp; Union Trust Co., 145 F.2d 130 (9 Cir. 1944), unless the objectivity of the standard is diminished by additional directions favoring the life beneficiary, as by insulating invasions of corpus from review or question, see DeCastro\u2019s Estate v. CIR, 155 F.2d 254, 255 (2 Cir. 1946). Absent such provisions, language authorizing invasion when necessary to meet such emergencies limits the extent of invasion to a maintenance of the life beneficiary\u2019s standard of living. See Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. McGowan, supra, 217 F.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Here, in the first sentence of subparagraph (b) the Hitchcock will expressly provides for Salisbury\u2019s \u201cmaintenance, support, and medical expenses\u201d \u201cat any time,\u201d while the second sentence deals specifically with any period of his incapacitation. As the trustee is authorized to invade corpus, not when strictly necessary to meet the exigencies of incapacitation within the established linguistic rubric, but for the beneficiary\u2019s \u201ccare, support and benefit\u201d during such incapacitation, we must determine whether such phrasing also implies that the extent of permissible invasion is limited to maintenance of the beneficiary\u2019s \u201cstation in life.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">As we have already indicated, a phrase such as \u201ccomfort and support\u201d connotes the objective station in life standard. Clearly, this interpretation is not limited to only those instances where these very words are used. 4 Mertens, Federal Gift &amp; Estate Taxation, \u00a7 28.38, p. 407 (1959). Other language, such as \u201ctreatment, support and maintenance,\u201d Berry v. Kuhl, supra; \u201cproper care, support and maintenance,\u201d Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. CIR, 181 F.2d 424 (2 Cir. 1950); \u201ccomfortable maintenance and support,\u201d Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. v. Eaton, 36 F.2d 710 (2 Cir. 1929), have been deemed referable to a fixed standard of living, and even terminology containing words which, in other contexts, import a subjective, rather than an objective standard, have also been so interpreted, as <em>e. g., </em>\u201ccomfort and welfare,\u201d Blodget v. Delaney, 201 F.2d 589 (1 Cir. 1953); \u201ccomfort or convenience,\u201d see Seubert v. Shaughnessy, 233 F.2d 134, 137 (2 Cir. 1956); \u201ccomfort and well-being,\u201d see Union Trust Co. v. Tomlinson, 355 F.2d 40, 42 (5 Cir. 1966); \u201csupport, maintenance, comfort and general well-being,\u201d Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 252 F.Supp. 191 (D.Md.1966); \u201csupport, maintenance, welfare and comfort,\u201d Estate of Mary Cotton Wood, 39 T.C. 919, appeal dismissed per stipulation (2 Cir. 1963); and see, for identical language, Zentmayer\u2019s Estate v. CIR, 336 F.2d 488, 490 (3 Cir. 1964), \u201csupport, maintenance and comfort, including luxuries,\u201d see Vaccaro v. United States, 224 F.Supp. 307, 309 (D.Mass. 1963), and \u201cmaintenance, welfare, comfort and happiness,\u201d United States v. Powell, 307 F.2d 821 (10 Cir. 1962). Of course, when general or subjective words stand alone, as, <em>e. g., </em>\u201cuse and benefit,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Newton Trust Co. v. CIR, 160 F.2d 175 (1 Cir. 1947), \u201cbest interest,\u201d Estate of Helen Thompson, 17 CCH Tax Ct. Mem. 510 (1958),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,1 or are used in conjunction with accompanying words which may be subjective or objective depending upon context, as, e. <em>g., \u201cpleasure, </em>comfort and welfare,\u201d Henslee v. Union Planters National Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra (emphasis supplied), they are generally interpreted so as not to restrict the use of trust principal to maintenance of the benficiary\u2019s standard of living. A similar interpretation prevails when language usually associated with the station in life standard is modified by more expansive terminology as, <em>e. g., </em>\u201cfor any purpose which may add to her [the beneficiary\u2019s] comfort or convenience,\u201d Seubert v. Shaughnessy, supra (emphasis supplied), or as \u201cto provide proper maintenance and support to the same <em>generous </em>extent that I, if living, could do,\u201d Kline v. United States, 202 F.Supp. 849 (N.D.W.Va.1962), aff\u2019d per curiam, 313 F.2d 633 ( 4 Cir. 1963) (emphasis supplied), or is supplemented by a clause which permits the invasion of corpus for an additional, less restrictive purpose, as, e. <em>g., </em>\u201cand for any other purpose which my trustees shall deem expedient, necessary or desirable for the benefit or use of my said sister,\u201d Zentmayer\u2019s Estate v. CIR, 336 F.2d 488 (3 Cir. 1964); or as \u201cand for any other reasonable requirement,\u201d State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 313 F.2d 29 (1 Cir. 1962); <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or as \u201cor will be for her best interests to receive,\u201d Vaccaro v. United States, supra, or as \u201cor for any purpose whatsoever, whether included in the foregoing classification or not,\u201d Title Insurance &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 249 F.Supp. 386 (S.D.Cal.1965), or is supplemented by additional explanatory instructions to the trustee to favor the life beneficiary\u2019s interest in corpus at the expense of the charitable remainderman, as <em>e. g., </em>\u201cmy said Trustee shall exerise its discretion with liberality to my said wife, and consider her welfare, comfort and happiness prior to claims of residuary beneficiaries,\u201d Merchants National Bank of Boston v. CIR, supra, or as \u201cthe first object to be accomplished * * * is to take care of and provide for my mother in such manner as she may desire,\u201d Henslee v. Union Planters National Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra. Moreover, even language expressly articulating the station in life standard, as in Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, supra, may not establish an objective standard when the testator gives additional inconsistent instructions, as, e. <em>g., </em>\u201cmy Trustee shall give sympathetic consideration to any requests that my wife may make * * * and * * * be generous in the exercise of this discretion even though there may be considerable depletion of the Trust Estate,\u201d Union Trust Co. v. Tomlinson, 355 F.2d 40 (5 Cir. 1966); or as \u201cMy said Trustee shall liberally provide for my beloved wife * * * and * * * may use such reasonable sums from the principal as it, in its sole discretion may deem necessary,\u201d National Bank of Commerce of San Antonio v. Scofield, 169 F.2d 145 (5 Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 335 U.S. 907, 69 S.Ct. 410, 93 L.Ed. 441 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\"> Turnihg to the present case, we find no general or subjective words standing alone in the Hitchcock will; nor do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>we find expansive modifying language or additional permissive purposes or instructions to detract from the \u201csupport, care and benefit\u201d guideline. This being so, the Government urges us to focus on the word \u201cbenefit,\u201d which, in a different context, has been held to provide no presently ascertainable standard, see Newton Trust Co. v. CIR, supra, and to totally disregard the preceding words, which concededly provide such a standard, cf. Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. CIR, supra. However, it is elementary that the key words of an instrument must be interpreted in light of their context, 4 Mertens, op. cit. supra, \u00a7 28.38, p. 407. The decisions of the Supreme Court in Merchants National Bank, supra, and Henslee v. Union Planters National Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, upon which the Government heavily relies, did not rest <em>exclusively upon </em>the subjective implications of \u201chappiness\u201d when preceded by \u201ccomfort, support, maintenance * * * \u201d in the former, or on those of \u201cpleasure\u201d preceding \u201ccomfort and welfare\u201d in the latter. See Merchants, supra, 320 U.S. at 263, 64 S.Ct. 108, 88 L.Ed. 35; Union Planters, supra, 335 U.S. at 598, 69 S.Ct. 290, 93 L. Ed.2d 259. Rather the Court was at least equally influenced by the presence of additional instructions which directed the trustee to ignore his otherwise primary duty to protect the interests of the remaindermen as well as those of the life beneficiary, see Blodget v. \u00a3)elaney, supra, 201 F.2d at 593-594, in favor of the life beneficiary\u2019s \u201chappiness\u201d or \u201cdesires.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. McGowan, supra, 217 F.2d at 291-292; Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. CIR, supra, 181 F.2d at 425; Blodget v. Delaney, supra at 592, and especially see United States v. Powell, supra, at 827-828, distinguishing <em>Merchants </em>and <em>Union Planters </em>solely on the ground of the additional instructions present therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Thus our inquiry is reduced to deciding whether a provision for \u201csupport, care and benefit,\u201d taken as a whole, is distinguishable in meaning from phrases providing for \u201csupport, maintenance, comfort and general well-being,\u201d \u201csupport, maintenance, welfare and comfort\u201d or \u201ccomfort and welfare\u201d which, as we have seen, establish presently ascertainable standards. Inasmuch as \u201cbenefit\u201d is commonly understood to be a synonym of \u201cwelfare,\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged ed. 1966), we think that it would constitute verbal hairsplitting of the most offensive variety<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to attribute such a subtle distinction in the use of words to the testatrix, whose intent of course is controlling, see Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. McGowan, supra, 217 F.2d at 290; Union Trust Co. v. Tomlinson, supra, 355 F.2d at 42. Moreover, as if to confirm our view as to the ordinary, hence presumptively intended, meaning of \u201csupport, care and benefit,\u201d the Second Circuit has characterized the only reported case<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> dealing with these very words as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>a case which dealt with a provision for \u201csupport and maintenance,\u201d see CIR v. Irving Trust Co., 147 F.2d 946, 949 (2 Cir. 1945), certainly an acceptable standard, cf. Berry v. Kuhl, supra; Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. CIR, supra; Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. v. Eaton, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Our interpretation is also consistent with the applicable state law<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which, in view of its power over the trustee\u2019s invasion of corpus, is highly persuasive in matters of will construction under \u00a7 2055 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, see Rev.Rul. 54-285, 1954-2 Cum.Bull. 302, quoted supra; Lincoln Rochester v. CIR, 181 F.2d 424, 426 (2 Cir. 1950); Blodget v. Delaney, 201 F.2d 589, 592 (1 Cir. 1953). In New York, the state in which the testatrix was domiciled at the time of her death, the station in life standard has been deemed implicit in will provisions for \u201ccare, support and comfort,\u201d In Re Martin\u2019s Will, 269 N.Y. 305, 199 N.E. 491 (1936), \u201cproper care, comfort and maintenance,\u201d Holden v. Strong, 116 N.Y. 471, 22 N.E. 960 (1889), \u201cwelfare,\u201d In Re Buell\u2019s Estate, 198 Misc. 358, 66 N.Y.S.2d 180 (Surr. 1946), and even \u201ccomfort and happiness,\u201d In Re Elmendorf\u2019s Estate, 205 Misc. 543, 129 N.Y.S.2d 370 (Surr.1954). It is noteworthy that in <em>Elmendorf\u2019s Estate, </em>supra, the court used the terms \u201ccomfort and support\u201d interchangeably with \u201ccomfort and happiness,\u201d see 129 N.Y.S.2d at 373, and, in view of its citation, without discussion, of <em>Merchants National Bank, </em>supra (\u201ccomfort, support, maintenance and/or happiness\u201d), see 129 N.Y.S.2d at 373, the court apparently considered the result in <em>Merchants </em>to have been primarily based on the additional instruction to favor the life beneficiary. As we have noted earlier in this opinion, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Powell, 307 F.2d 821, 827 (1962), adopted the same interpretation of <em>Merchants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">In view of our previous discussion of federal authorities, we find that the cases relied on by the Government which construe \u201cbenefit\u201d in a different context, e. g., In Re Rachlin\u2019s Will, 133 N.Y.S.2d 151 (Surr.1954) (\u201cbenefit\u201d alone); In Re Emmons\u2019 Will, 165 Misc. 192, 300 N.Y.S. 580 (Surr.1937) (\u201cuse and benefit\u201d) ; as well as cases based primarily on the existence of additional instructions, e. g., In Re Caro\u2019s Estate, 47 Misc.2d 217, 262 N.Y.S.2d 45 (Surr.1965), distinguished on this ground in In Re Meyer\u2019s Estate, 51 Misc.2d 397, 273 N.Y.S.2d 285, 288 (Surr.1966), are clearly inapposite. In sum, it is unlikely that the New York courts would interpret the trustee\u2019s power here to invade corpus by construing \u201cbenefit\u201d out of context and performing the verbal gymnastics required to distinguish \u201csupport, care and benefit\u201d from \u201cwelfare\u201d or \u201ccomfort and. happiness,\u201d see In Re Buell\u2019s Estate, supra, and In Re Elmendorf\u2019s Estate, supra. Cf. Application of Miller, 235 N.Y.S.2d 125, 128-129 (Sup.Ct.1962), interpreting the phrase \u201csupport, maintenance, education and benefit\u201d in N.Y. Personal Property Law, McKinney\u2019s Con-sol.Laws, c. 41, \u00a7 266(2) (McKinney 1959) so as to exclude \u201cextraneous purposes\u201d for the beneficiary\u2019s \u201cuse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>benefit\u201d such as the financing of a trip to Europe for both social and educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that \u201cbenefit\u201d were not so limited by its present context, the Government\u2019s contention that the beneficiary could, in the event of his incapacity, utilize corpus to spend his remaining days in regal luxury far beyond his previous standard of living, must fail. The testatrix restricted such use of trust principal to the duration of incapacity, which restriction anticipates eventual recovery. This suggests that resorts to principal may be had for the purposes of curing his incapacity and maintaining his standard of living should his independent means of maintenance prove inadequate, see In Re Downey\u2019s Will, 277 App.Div. 921, 98 N.Y.S.2d 439, 440 (3d Dep't 1950); Berry v. Kuhl, 174 F.2d 565, 568 (7 Cir. 1949), by reason of incapacitating circumstances. Indeed, if such unrestrained erosion of corpus were permitted for a first temporary incapacity there might be none left for subsequent incapacities, which eventuality is certainly not foreclosed by the language of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the Government\u2019s makeweight alternative argument that the provision for invasion of corpus for the beneficiary\u2019s \u201csupport, care and benefit\u201d if he should become incapacitated through \u201cillness, age or other cause\u201d is so broad as to permit the beneficiary to enjoy corpus by merely choosing to incapacitate himself. The phrase \u201cother cause\u201d would ordinarily refer only to extrinsic causative factors such as illness or old age, and is defined and limited further by its subsequent context, see Berry v. Kuhl, supra, at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Having concluded that the authorized invasion of corpus is limited by a \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d standard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\u201c * * * it becomes necessary to examine the remoteness of invasion, or the extent of possible invasion, in terms of the standard, to determine the likelihood that the charity will take and the value of what it will receive.\u201d Newton Trust Co. v.

The pertinent portions of \u00a7 2055 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">\u00a7 2055. Transfers for public, charitable, and religious uses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">(a) In general. \u2014 For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate the amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers (including the interest which falls into any such bequest, legacy, devise, or transfer as a result of an irrevocable disclaimer of a bequest, legacy, devise, transfer, or power,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>if the disclaimer is made before the date prescribed for the filing of the estate tax return)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">(2) to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, including the encouragement of art and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual, and no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">(3) to a trustee or trustees, or a fraternal society, order, or association operating under the lodge system, but only if such contributions or gifts are to be used by such trustee or trustees, or by such fraternal society, order, or association, exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, and no substantial part of the activities of such trustee or trustees, or of such fraternal society, order, or association, is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation; or ******</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\"><em>. </em>Section 20.2055-2 (a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi\">(a) <em>Remainder and similar interests. </em>If a trust is created or property is transferred for both a charitable and a private purpose, deduction may be taken of the value of the charitable beneficial interest only insofar as that interest is <em>presently ascertainable, </em>and hence severable from the non-charitable interest. The present value of a remainder or other deferred payment to be made for a charitable purpose is to be determined in accordance with the rules stated in See. 20.2031-7. * * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-20\">. Section 20.2055-2 (b) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-21\">(b) <em>Transfers subject to a condition or a power. </em>If, as of the date of a decedent\u2019s death, a transfer for charitable purposes is dependent upon the performance of some act or the happening of a precedent event in order that it might become effective, no deduction is allowable <em>unless the possibility that the charitable transfer will not become effective </em>is <em>so remote as to be negligible * </em>* *. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-22\">. The Government does not question that the trustee\u2019s discretion under the first, sentence of subparagraph (b) to invade-principal whenever \u201cadvisable * * *' for his [the beneficiary\u2019s] maintenance,, support and medical expenses\u201d is limited' by a fixed standard. So our consideration is limited to the power granted by the second sentence of subparagraph (b)..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b757-25\">. Thus, extrinsic facts such as the financial circumstances of the life beneficiary, though relevant to the remoteness of invasion, are irrelevant to whether the charitable interest is \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d. Seubert v. Shaughnessy, 233 F.2d 134, 137 (2 Cir. 1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">. The phrase \u201cstation in life\u201d was equated with a standard of living as early as 1929 by Judge Learned Hand in Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. v. Eaton, 36 F.2d 710, 711 (2 Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b759-5\">. The Fourth Circuit, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in Henslee v. Union Planters Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, had approved the \u201cbest interests\u201d phraseology as establishing a presently ascertainable standard in CIR v. Robertson\u2019s Estate, 141 F.2d 855 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\">. As the First Circuit stated, 313 F.2d at 31, these words appearing in the instrument there being interpreted \u201cpresumably import additional meaning.\u201d However, the application of such a rule of construction to language which specifies an additional permissible purpose authorizing the invasion of corpus when that language appears in a separate clause does not automatically compel a similar application when the language used is, as here, integrated into a single phrase rather than a separate clause. Indeed, so interpreting such integrated language would be inconsistent with the contextual approach followed in most of the above cases. See, e. g., Mercantile Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. Powell, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b760-4\">. Nor are the decisions finding no presently ascertainable standard attributable to provisions granting the trustees sole or absolute discretion to invade corpus. The Supreme Court in Henslee v. Union Planters, supra, made no reference to thp trustees\u2019 power to \u201cexpend in their discretion,\u201d 335 U.S. at 595, 598-599. To the contrary, a grant of sole and absolute discretion to expend is not fatal to a claim for a charitable deduction if there also is an objective standard to guide trustees in the exercise of their discretion. See, e. g., Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. McGowan, supra; Blodget v. Delaney, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\">. The frequency of such \u201chairsplitting\u201d has led jurists and commentators to seek more equitable alternatives to the \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d test of deductibility. See, e. g., Seubert v. Shaughnessy, 233 F.2d 134, 138 (2 Cir. 1956) (Clark, Ch. J\u201e concurring); Blodget v. Delaney, 201 F.2d 589, 594-595 (1 Cir. 1953) (Magruder, Ch. J., concurring) ; Taggart, Charitable Deductions for Transfers of Remainder Interests Subject to Invasion, 21 Tax.L. Rev. 535, 562 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b760-12\">. This case, Blunt v. Kelly, 131 F.2d 632 (3 Cir. 1942), held that a transfer of securities in trust (income and principal to' be distributed when \u201cnecessary\u201d for the settlor\u2019s \u201csupport, care or benefit,\u201d with remainder over) was intended to take effect at death within the purview of \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>302(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1926 notwithstanding that the remainder-man was one of the trustees who were to determine the occasion, if any, for invasion of principal because the trustees\u2019 discretion was held limited by their good faith evaluation of the necessity for invasion and was subject to review by a court of equity. That such language does not confer upon the trustees an uncontrolled discretion does not, however, guarantee the existence of a \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\">. This consistency is not surprising as New York has by statute instructed its courts to apply federal law in state estate tax proceedings dealing with charitable deductions in which identical problems of will construction are presented. N.Y.Tax law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 60, \u00a7 955 (McKinney 1962); In Re Caro\u2019s Estate, 47 Misc.2d 217, 262 N.Y.S.2d 45, 47 (Surr.1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b762-12\">LUMBARD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ash\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">I agree with the majority that New York case law ought to be considered as \u201chighly persuasive\u201d in determining the content of the phrase \u201csupport, care and benefit,\u201d since it is that state\u2019s law which would ultimately determine the extent of the limitation, if any, upon the power of the trustee to invade corpus. \u201cSupport\u201d and \u201ccare\u201d are among the words used in clauses of limitation which have long been viewed as capable of providing an objective standard in New York, e. g., In re Martin\u2019s Will, 269 N.Y. 305, 199 N.E. 491 (1936), as elsewhere. On the other hand, the New York courts have appeared to define the word \u201cbenefit\u201d in broad terms, without other limits than those attendant the typical fiduciary relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> E. g., In re Rachlin\u2019s Will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>133 N.Y.S.2d 151, 152 (Surr.Ct.1954); In re Emmons\u2019 Will, 165 Misc. 192, 300 N.Y.S. 580 (Surr.Ct.1937). Compare Zentmayer\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 336 F.2d 488, 490-491 (3 Cir. 1964); Newton Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 160 F.2d 175, 179-180 (1 Cir. 1947). Particularly in drafting of wills and trusts \u201cadditional words presumably import additional meaning,\u201d State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 313 F.2d 29, 31 (1 Cir. 1963), and we cannot consider that the choice of wording here was inadvertent. Inasmuch as the disinterested trustee could in good faith under the New York decisions deplete the corpus when in the trustee's \u201copinion\u201d the life beneficiary \u201cis incapacitated through illness, age or other cause * * I do not see how it is possible to determine with any degree of certainty the extent of such invasion of principal. Compare DeCastro\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 155 F.2d 254 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 727, 67 S.Ct. 82, 91 L.Ed. 630 (1946); Commerce Trust Co. v. United States, 167 F.Supp. 643 (W.D.Mo.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Further, while the majority goes to great length to demonstrate the importance of viewing the critical words of the will in their proper context, and attempts to distinguish the major cases on the grounds that additional broadening instructions appeared in the instrument, no consideration has been given to the fact that the trustee in the instant case in construing his own power to invade has been given \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d to apply all or part of the principal to the life beneficiary as long as the trustee believes such incapacity to continue. Compare, e. g., Henslee v. Union Planters Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 335 U.S. 595, 69 S.Ct. 290, 93 L.Ed. 259 (1949). I cannot agree with the opinion of the court which holds that the value of the remainder to be paid over to charity is capable of present ascertainment. I would therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\">. \u201cThe word \u2018benefit\u2019 is more comprehensive than the word \u2018support\u2019 and is \u2018anything that works to the advantage or gain of the recipient.\u2019 * * * If petitioner [trustee] determines that the payment of the principal sum will be for the widow\u2019s benefit she has the discretionary power to do so. Such action must be motivated by a proper purpose and not by either the whim of the trustee or her personal convenience. It should be exercised only after full consideration of the impelling circumstances and not from caprice, careless good nature or to obtain relief from further fiduciary duties. * * * In making her determination pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>titioner need not take into consideration or account the personal income of the beneficiary from any other source.\u201d In re Rachlin\u2019s Will, 133 N.Y.S.2d 151, 152 (Surr.Ct.1954) (citations omitted),</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
