All have remained illegally in this country after their respective .ships have departed. Although the individual circumstances vary somewhat, the essential jurisdictional facts are the same in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-27\">After hearings under Section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b), orders of deportation, followed by letters of depor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>tation, were issued. Petitioners have not \u2022appealed and apparently are not in a position to appeal the deportation orders. Instead they seek in this Court to stay the hand of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which now moves to dismiss the appeal from the District Director\u2019s denial of stays of the deportations for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to dissolve the judicial stays. The basis for the petitioners\u2019 jurisdictional claim is that \"the requested stays have merged with the final orders of deportation issued under Section 242(b) of the Act and \"therefore fall within the scope of Section 106(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue here is whether the \u2022denial of the stays is an inextricable part \u2022of the proceedings under Section 242(b) \u25a0of the Act and consequently falls within the category of a final order reviewable in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">After a review of the authorities this Court held in Tai Mui v. Esperdy, 371 F.2d 772, 775-777 (2 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1017, 87 S.Ct. 1372, 18 L.Ed.2d 454 (April 24, 1967), that a \u25a0denial of a stay of deportation sought after deportation has been ordered is not a \u201cfinal orders of deportation * * * pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 242(b) of [the Immigration and Nationality Act]\u201d made reviewable in a Court of Appeals by section 106(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a(a): Petitioners here do not dispute this reading of <em>Tai Mui, </em>but contend that contrary holdings of the Seventh Circuit (see e. g. Melone v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 355 F.2d 533 (7 Cir. 1966)) should be followed instead, and that uncertainty as to the holdings of other circuits should lead us to retain jurisdiction at least temporarily. It is a sufficient answer that this Court has ruled on the matter, and certiorari has been denied by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">From a history of these and similar petitions it becomes apparent that their purpose is to secure delay of deportations by means of fruitless jurisdictional disputes. Therefore, in order to effectuate the congressional intent of expedition as evinced by Section 1105a\u2019(a), we have concluded to examine the merits of the petitions to obviate any further delay in the event that we are in error. The only reasons advanced by petitioners for staying their deportations, the lack of precise notice as to means of deportation and the speculative possibility of finding certifiable work in the United States (\u00a7 203(a) (6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153(a) (6)), certainly do not show that the District Director\u2019s decisions \u201cwere made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis such as an invidious discrimination against a particular race or group * * Wong Wing Hang v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., 360 F.2d 715, 719 (2 Cir. 1966). These clearly justified orders of deportation have been stayed too long already; there seems to be no reason not to decide the merits of these petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">We uphold the District Director\u2019s denial of stays of deportation. Our mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-19\">.
