This Court has jurisdiction (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482). The Tax Court held the Petitioners\u2019 transfer of a parcel of realty and the contemporaneous acquisition of another parcel of realty was not a tax-free exchange within the purview of \u00a7 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">The findings of the Tax Court are fully supported by the record. We have carefully considered Petitioners\u2019 specifications of error and arguments and find them without merit. We affirm the well-reasoned opinion of the Tax Court. Petitioners argue to this Court that in the event this Court affirms the Tax Court\u2019s holding that the transaction was not a tax-free exchange, \u00a7 1031 of the 1954 Code applies to a simultaneous sale and purchase where an exchange was intended by the parties and where the transaction had the net effect of an exchange. We need not reach this question, because the evidence does not support Petitioners\u2019 contention that both parties intended an exchange and that the transaction had the net effect of an exchange.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
