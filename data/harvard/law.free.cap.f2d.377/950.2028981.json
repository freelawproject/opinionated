We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">In August 1960 in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, the petitioner, Nathaniel Brown, was charged in two indictments with the offense of robbery by firearms. The offense carries a possible death penalty. Vernon\u2019s Penal Code, Art. 1408. The court appointed counsel to represent Brown. Brown went to trial in No. 1768, was found guilty by the jury, and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Several weeks later, in the other case, No. 1767, the state moved to strike the firearms count of the indictment so that Brown was then charged only with robbery by assault, an offense carrying a term of five years to life imprisonment. He pleaded guilty. The court imposed a sentence of thirty-five years on this charge to run concurrently with the other sentence of twenty-five years. Brown took no appeal from either of the convictions or sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">In August 1965 Brown filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The district court appointed Mr. Alvin R. Owsley, Jr., as counsel to represent Brown. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Brown\u2019s testimony in regard to his confession was incredible; that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel; and that the plea of guilty was voluntarily entered. The court denied the petition. The district judge thanked Mr. Owsley for his services to the prisoner and to the court and relieved him of any further obligation except that of filing a notice of appeal. Brown, in proper person, appeals in forma pauperis from the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">The petitioner\u2019s two-page handwritten brief on appeal does not clearly articulate the basis for his attack on the two convictions. To understand his contentions, therefore, we turn to the transcript of the hearings. His attorney, in his opening statement to the court attacked both convictions on the following grounds: (1) Brown was convicted twice as a result of a coerced confession; (2) had no counsel at the time the confession was allegedly extorted; and (3) did not have the effective assistance of counsel. The third contention is subdivided into (a) the lack of effective assistance of counsel during his trial in Cause No. 1768 and (b) the lack of effective assistance of counsel during his guilty plea. Neither Brown nor his attorney specifically contended that the guilty plea was the result of bargaining but it is apparent that this contention was at the heart of the argument that the plea was not voluntary. The Assistant Attorney General representing the state at the habeas hearing brought the issue into the open:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-15\">\u201cI think that we can safely assume, Your Honor that Nathaniel Brown, who was charged with two indictments of robbery by firearms, which carries the death penalty, knew that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>get the death penalty. He was tried once by a jury, and the jury gave him 25 years. He must have known that if he was tried again he could receive the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\">\u201cI do believe that the Court can assume from that, from the guilty plea, that he thought it best to cop out and not take a chance with the jury again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The sentence of thirty-five years imposed in Cause No. 1767 runs concurrently with the sentence of twenty-five years in No. 1768. As the law now stands, if the Court should determine that the thirty-five year sentence is constitutionally valid, it would be premature for the Court to determine questions involving the lawfulness of the prisoner\u2019s detention in No. 1768. The Supreme Court stated the controlling principle in McNally v. Hill, 1934, 293 U.S. 131, 137, 55 S.Ct. 24, 27, 79 L.Ed. 238:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-7\">\u201cThere is no warrant in either the statute or the writ for its use to invoke judicial determination of questions which could not affect the lawfulness of the custody and detention and no suggestion of such a use has been found in the commentaries on the English common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The Ninth Circuit said in Wilson v. Gray, 1965, 345 F.2d 282, 284: \u201cIt is well settled that a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus to set aside an invalid judgment and commitment where the petitioner is also held in custody under a lawful judgment and commitment. * * * In short, the writ of habeas corpus is only available in situations where discharge from custody will result from the granting of relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">In Lee v. Swope, 9 Cir. 1955, 225 F.2d 674, the court held that the prisoner in custody under two unexpired sentences was not entitled to habeas corpus to challange only one, since if either is valid he would not be entitled to immediate relief. The court cited Ex parte Melendez, 9 Cir. 1938, 98 F.2d 791; McNealy v. Johnston, 9 Cir. 1938, 100 F.2d 280; Dunlap v. Swope, 9 Cir. 1939, 103 F.2d 19; Demaurez v. Squier, 9 Cir. 1941, 121 F.2d 960; Graham v. Squier, 9 Cir. 1944, 145 F.2d 348; McDonald v. Johnston, 9 Cir. 1945, 149 F.2d 768; Oddo v. Swope, 9 Cir. 1951, 193 F.2d 492; Woollomes v. Heinze, 9 Cir. 1952, 198 F.2d 577. See also Wells v. People of the State of California, 9 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 439. There a prisoner was convicted of possessing a weapon in prison. The term was fixed at life. While serving this sentence he was convicted of assaulting a guard. Under the California Penal Code, because he was under a life commitment, the death penalty was assessed (later commuted to life). He attacked the validity of the first conviction, possession of a dangerous weapon. The court would not consider the issues raised in the habeas petition. \u201cThe mandate of the United States Supreme Court is clear and forceful, \u2014 the writ of habeas corpus may not be used in the federal courts as a means of securing the judicial decision of a question which, even if determined in the prisoner\u2019s favor, could not result in his immediate release.\u201d 352 F.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">The facts in <em>Wells </em>and in the instant case are analogous to the situation in which a prisoner is convicted of the crime of escape while serving an allegedly invalid sentence. He is not entitled to release on a habeas petition. \u201cThis sentence (for escape) was not affected by the validity of the sentences being served at the time of the escape, and it had not been served at the time this petition was submitted. Habeas corpus is available only when the prisoner is entitled to immediate release.\u201d Crawford v. Taylor, 10 Cir. 1961, 290 F.2d 197, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">In Hendrick v. Beto, S.D.Tex. 1965, 253 F.Supp. 994, the prisoner was in custody in six separate causes. He pleaded guilty to the charge of burglary in Cause No. 91265. After trial, he was found guilty as charged, and was sentenced to life imprisonment as an habitual criminal. He pleaded guilty in the other five causes and in each case was sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>fenced to confinement for not more than ten years. The prisoner (1) attacked the conviction for burglary and as an habitual criminal in Cause No. 91526 on a number of constitutional grounds and (2) made one allegation attacking, jointly, all the convictions in the five causes in which he had pleaded guilty. The district court, citing Lee v. Swope, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">\u201c[Tjhere is one allegation which attacks, jointly, all the convictions in the five causes in which there was a plea of guilty. If, as the respondent urges, the allegation attacking this group of five convictions is not sustained, then the petition would have to be dismissed as being premature.\u201d 253 F.Supp. 994, 995.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">The court held that there was no constitutional basis for the attack on the five sentences. In these circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8q\">\u201c[T]he petitioner is being held under five sentences which are not subject to constitutional attack, and the court will not inquire into the validity of petitioner\u2019s detention under the remaining sentence. This in no way vitiates petitioner\u2019s right to present constitutional questions concerning the remaining sentence when the time is such that, if the petition for the writ of habeas corpus were granted, petitioner could be released from custody. At the present time petitioner is being held on constitutionally valid sentences. The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is well taken.\u201d 253 F.Supp. 994 at 996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtdS\">This Court affirmed the district court in a per curiam opinion. 360 F.2d 618 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">We hold, therefore, that if a prisoner is serving two or more sentences, and if the court should determine that one of these is valid, the court should dismiss as premature a habeas attack on any of the other sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The district court in <em>Hendrick, </em>using Occam\u2019s razor, decided only one issue: a defendant\u2019s right under Texas law to require the state to introduce evidence corroborating a guilty plea \u201cdoes not rise to Constitutional stature\u201d. Similarly, we elect to consider first the validity of the prisoner\u2019s conviction upon his plea of guilty in Cause No. 1767 because the issues are fewer and less complex than those in No. 1768. In addition, there is something to be said for first considering the validity of the longer sentence since, if that sentence is valid, a habeas attack on the shorter sentence will never mature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">No federal court has held that a guilty plea induced by a <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>promise for that reason alone is involuntary. In Machibroda v. United States, 1962, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473, the Supreme Court said that a \u201cguilty plea, if induced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a <em>voluntary act </em>is void.\u201d But in <em>Machibroda </em>the defendant alleged that the United States Attorney had promised the defendant a more lenient sentence than the court imposed and had cautioned the defendant not to tell his attorney of their plea arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">\u201cMuch of the current uncertainty about the legal status of plea discussions and plea agreements is attributable to the case of Shelton v. United States\u201d, 5 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 101, rev\u2019d on rehearing, 246 F.2d 571 (en banc), rev\u2019d 356 U.S. 26, 78 S.Ct. 563, 2 L.Ed.2d 579 (1958) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shelton pleaded guilty to transporting a stolen vehicle and received a one year prison term. He moved to vacate the conviction on the ground that his plea was not voluntary, having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>induced by the promise of a one year sentence. The district court denied the motion on the finding that Shelton pleaded with full understanding of the commitments made to him, and that all prosecution promises were kept. This Court (Judges Rives, Tuttle, and Brown) vacated the sentence. 242 F.2d 101. Judge Rives wrote for the Court; Judge Tuttle dissented. On rehearing en banc, the court held that the plea was voluntary. 246 F.2d 571. Judge Tuttle wrote for the Court; Judges Rives and Brown dissented. The majority formulated the following test of voluntariness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-4\">\u201c[A] plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including \u2022unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), \u2022or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper as having no proper relationship to the prosecutor\u2019s business (e. g. bribes).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">On certiorari, the Solicitor General entered a confession of error and the Supreme Court reversed in a memorandum opinion stating: \u201cUpon the consideration of the entire record and confession of error by the Solicitor General that the plea of guilty may have been improperly obtained, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.\u201d 356 U.S. 26, 78 S.Ct. 563, 2 L.Ed.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s action in <em>Shelton </em>\u2022does not mean that it approved this Court\u2019s majority opinion, but neither does it mean that the dissenting opinion expressed the law \u201cor that the law expressed by this Court was erroneous\u201d. So the Court held when it again faced the plea agreement problem. Martin v. United States, 5 Cir. 1950, 256 F.2d 345, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 921, 79 S.Ct. 294, 3 L.Ed.2d 240, 1958. Judge Tuttle, for the Court (Judges Hutcheson and Cameron concurring) stated the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgX7\">\u201cThe crucial issue appears to be whether, with all of the facts before him, including the advice of competent counsel, the plea was truly voluntary. The Supreme Court lays down no other test. The fact findings of the trial court as to the voluntariness should be reviewed on this issue on the clearly erroneous test.\u201d 256 F.2d at 349.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">Later decisions of this Court have followed Martin: Sorrenti v. United States, 1962, 5 Cir., 306 F.2d 236, cert. denied 373 U.S. 916, 83 S.Ct. 1306 (1963); Busby v. Holman, 1966, 5 Cir., 356 F.2d 75; Cooper v. Holman, 1966, 5 Cir., 356 F.2d 82; Williams v. Beto, 1965, 5 Cir., 354 F.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">In Busby v. Holman, as in the instant case, the appellant argued that \u201chis confession was illegally obtained because it was coerced and because he was not accorded the assistance of counsel at the time it was given. * * * that by reason of these alleged violations of his constitutional rights his subsequent conviction on his plea of guilty was invalid.\u201d 356 F.2d at 77. In an opinion by Judge Maris, sitting by designation, the Court pointed out that there was no merit to the contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-10\">\u201cFor the confession was not offered in evidence in view of the fact that the appellant pleaded guilty and the question of its legality is relevant in the present proceedings only to the extent that it may have affected the voluntary character of the appellant\u2019s plea. It is settled by a host of authorities that a judgment on a plea of guilty which has been entered voluntarily on advice of counsel is not rendered invalid because the defendant had previously made a confession under circumstances which might have rendered it inadmissible in evidence if the defendant had pleaded not guilty and had gone to trial. This is so because the plea, if voluntarily and understandingly made, is conclusive as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, admitting all the facts charged and waiving all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>non-jurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings against him. The judgment and sentence which follow a plea of guilty are based solely upon the plea and not upon any evidence which may have been acquired improperly by the prosecutor. Accordingly, a confession in the possession of the prosecutor which has been illegally obtained cannot be made the basis for a collateral attack upon a judgment of conviction entered upon a plea of guilty voluntarily and understandably made.\u201d 356 F.2d at 77.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">In <em>Busby, </em>as also in this case (giving Brown the benefit of the doubt) the appellant contended that his plea of guilty was influenced by his knowledge of the fact that he had made a confession which he mistakenly assumed could be used against him at the trial, and that his decision to plead guilty was, therefore, involuntary. The appellant had the advice of competent counsel in making his plea of guilty. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-5\">\u201c[T]he district court was not called upon to try the merits of the advice given by counsel to the appellant but merely to determine that counsel was not so completely inept and incompetent as to render the proceedings a farce. The district court found that the appellant was afforded the assistance of competent counsel. We are satisfied that the record amply supports that finding. Indeed the fact that the appellant is alive today may well be a testimonial to it.\u201d 356 F.2d at 80.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al2\">Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides a general standard for accepting a guilty plea binding, of course, in the federal courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>defendant may plead * * * guilty or, with the consent of the court, <em>nolo contendere. </em>The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept the plea without first determining that the plea is made <em>voluntarily </em>with <em>understanding </em>of the nature of the charge.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">The state trial judge took great pains in questioning Brown to assure himself that Brown\u2019s plea was made \u201cvoluntarily with understanding\u201d of the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You plead guilty because you are guilty or because of some hope of reward or promise of parole ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-12\">DEFENDANT: \u2019Cause I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-13\">THE COURT: Now, I can\u2019t take it if you just say you \u2018guess\u2019 you can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-14\">DEFENDANT: \u2019Cause I am, yes, sir, \u2019Cause I am guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-15\">THE COURT: I know, but you didn\u2019t talk like that. Are you guilty or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-16\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-17\">THE COURT: I can\u2019t take a plea of guilty from a man that says, T may be guilty,\u2019 or something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-18\">DEFENDANT: Well, I\u2019m guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-19\">THE COURT: You do this of your own free will? Anybody forced you to, threatened you in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-20\">DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-21\">THE COURT: Made you promises of any kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-22\">DEFENDANT: No promises, no</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-23\">promises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-24\">THE COURT: You understand the Court must find you guilty and assess your punishment at not less than five years, nor more than life in the penitentiary? You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-25\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-26\">THE COURT: All right, Court accepts your plea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-27\">After interrogation by the Court the attorneys read into the record stipulated testimony agreed to by the attorneys \u201cand by the defendant himself in open court\u201d. This included a recital of the facts relating to the robbery to which the state\u2019s witnesses would testify if present in court, the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to be confronted by the witnesses \u201cboth for and against him\u201d, and the defendant\u2019s admission that he \u201cmade a voluntary statement\u201d (confession) after having been warned that \u201che did not need to make any statement at all, that any statement that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>make would be used against him as evidence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">After the State rested, the proceeding was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: What says the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-6\">MR. CROWELL (Attorney for the defendant): So stipulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-7\">THE COURT: Come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-8\">MR. CROWELL: The defendant has \u25a0 been advised of his rights, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-9\">THE COURT: Hold up your right hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-10\">NATHANIEL BROWN the defendant after being duly sworn testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-11\">THE COURT: Let him confirm his guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-12\">DIRECT EXAMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-13\">\n<em>BY MR. CROWELL:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-14\">Q. You have heard the testimony by the District Attorney here. Are you guilty of that offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-15\">A. Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-16\">Q. And you did what the statement says you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-17\">A. What the statement said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-18\">Q. Well, what the testimony was, did you sign a voluntary statement in this case? Are you guilty of this offense ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-19\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-23\">Q. And are you pleading guilty of your own free will ? Were you offered any promise of reward or any threats ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-24\">A. No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-25\">Q. You plead guilty because you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-26\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-27\">As we interpret the record, Brown received no promise from the prosecutor that the trial judge would impose a lighter sentence in No. 1767. The inducement was the prosecutor\u2019s promise to reduce the charged offense to robbery by assault, thereby eliminating the possibility of the death penalty and giving the accused some hope that the two sentences would run concurrently or that the sentence in No. 1767 would be no heavier than the sentence in No. 1768.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-28\">Properly safeguarded plea discussions and plea agreements between an accused and a <em>prosecutor </em>are consistent with the fair administration of justice. They are a \u201cpervasive practice. The great majority of criminal cases are disposed of by pleas of guilty, and a substantial number of these pleas are the result of prior dealings between the prosecutor and the defendant or his attorney\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The suggested standards relating to pleas of guilty recently recommended by the Advisory Committee on the Criminal Trial to the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice recognize \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>propriety of plea discussions and plea agreements\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">These standards distinguish between the role of the trial judge and that of the prosecutor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe trial judge should not participate in plea discussions.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A plea agreement by the trial judge and the defendant may carry the connotation of an unseemly bargain between a malefactor and Justice. The judge, almost all-powerful in his sentencing capacity, has the duty of protecting an accused\u2019s constitutional rights as well as the duty of protecting society\u2019s interest in law enforcement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prosecuting attorneys, however, traditionally have had broad authority to institute criminal charges and to evaluate the charges in terms of society\u2019s interest in individual eases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the prosecutor and the accused enter into an agreement their conflicting interests merge. And, with the aid of both counsel and judge, an accused is protected from improvident or involuntary agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Nathaniel Brown admitted his guilt without reservation. He acted on the advice of a competent attorney. His answers to the trial judge\u2019s questions show that he acted voluntarily and with understanding of the nature of the charge and the extent of the possible punishment. If, as appears, the inducement was a reduction in the offense charged, the prosecutor fulfilled his promise. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the inducement was the prosecutor\u2019s representation that the trial court would impose the same or lesser sentence than imposed in the case that was tried, No. 1768. We cannot infer such a promise. The petitioner made a deliberate and measured choice: he traded his defenses for a lighter charge in the hope of a lighter sentence. And the trial judge satisfied himself, after a careful examination, that Brown understood his plea of guilty and pleaded guilty of his own free will. Brown is bound by his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">A large part of the transcript of the habeas hearing relates to the general competency of the attorney appointed to represent Brown in the two state cases. \u201cThe actual standard of incompeteney applied by the overwhelming majority of courts is stated as follows: Incompetency of counsel such as a denial of due process and effective representation by counsel must be such as to make the trial a farce, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>sham, or mockery of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court has defined \u201ceffective counsel\u201d in terms of a \u201creasonable counsel\u201d standard : \u201cWe interpret the right to counsel as the right to effective counsel.

As pointed out in a recent case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-16\">The unequal positions of the judge and the accused, one with the power to commit to prison and the other deeply concerned to avoid prison, at once raise a question of fundamental fairness. When a judge becomes a participant in plea bargaining he brings to bear the full force and majesty of his office. His awesome power to impose a substantially longer or even maximum sentence in excess of that proposed is present whether referred to or not. A defendant needs no reminder that if he reject the proposal, stands upon his right to trial and is convicted, he faces a significantly longer sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">United States ex rel.

The jury found him guilty and assessed his punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for twenty-five years. He was represented by counsel appointed some eleven days before his trial. The district court, after a full hearing, held that Brown had the effective assistance of counsel. That finding is not, I think, clearly erroneous. Brown has failed to carry his burden of showing that his twenty-five year sentence in No. 1768 is constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">I do not agree that it was premature for the district court to determine that question or that it is not necessary for this Court to review that determination. Such a review would not be necessary if Brown's subsequent thirty-five year sentence under his plea of guilty in Case No. 1767 were sustained and if the earlier twenty-five year sentence did not operate as an inducing cause to the later thirty-five year sentence. Realistically considered, however, the two sentences were closely related. Before the district court Brown testified to the following occurrences just after the first sentence was imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-12\">\u201cA. After the D. A. turned and walked away, five or ten minutes later he came back and my lawyer came back and he said, \u2018You have 25 years already and why not cop out for this ease\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. By \u2018cop out\u2019, you took that to mean plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-15\">\u201cQ. Trade out with the State for some sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-17\">\u201cQ. What inducement did he suggest to you? Why did he think that was such a keen idea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-18\">\u201cA. He said, \u2018You already have 25 years, why take a chance on your life?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-19\">\u201cQ. What were you to get if you copped out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-20\">\u201cA. Thirty-five years, which was 10' years more than I already had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-21\">The only other witness to testify orally before the district court was Arthur Crowell, counsel who had represented Brown by appointment in both cases. Mr. Crowell neither confirmed nor denied the correctness of the quoted part of Brown\u2019s testimony, but only testified that it was possible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-22\">\u201cQ. Is it possible that you advised Brown that he had received a 25-year sentence on his jury trial case and therefore that it would be perhaps in his interest to consider pleading guilty to the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>charge and try to get a 25-year sentence to run concurrently with the first one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-5\">\u201cA. It is possible. I do not recall whether I discussed it in those terms or not. I am sure in discussing a plea of guilty that is one of the considerations that would have been discussed, but I do not recall exactly what transpired with regard to that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The evidence is thus without substantial conflict that the earlier twenty-five year sentence in No. 1768 was a real inducement to Brown to plead guilty and accept a thirty-five year sentence in No. 1767. I do not understand the reluctance of my brothers to pass on the constitutional validity of the earlier sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record before this Court fails, in my opinion, to show any constitutional invalidity of the twenty-five year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Nor do I see any occasion in this case to again discuss the conflict of views as to what precautions must be exercised before accepting a plea of guilty induced by a prosecutor\u2019s promise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> My views are still the same as those which Judge Brown and I entertained in Shelton v. United States, 5 Cir.1957, 242 F.2d 101, on en banc rehearing, 246 F.2d 571, reversed per curiam on the Solicitor General\u2019s confession of error, 1958, 356 U.S. 26, 78 S.Ct. 563, 2 L.Ed.2d 579. Among other views which we expressed, as the majority on original hearing (242 F.2d 113) and as dissenters on en banc rehearing (246 F.2d 578), is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-8\">\u201cIf a plea of guilty is made upon any understanding or agreement as to the punishment to be recommended, it is essential, we think, that, before accepting such plea, the district court should make certain that the plea is in fact made voluntarily. Otherwise, the plea is subject to impeachment as having been induced by a promise of recommended leniency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\"><em>Shelton </em>centered about the requirements of Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. That rule was amended February 28, 1966, effective July 1,1966, so as to require the court to address the defendant personally to determine whether the plea of guilty is made voluntarily and with understanding of the nature of the charge. A new sentence was also added at the end of the rule that, \u201cThe court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Of course, Rule 11 may go beyond the constitutional duty resting on a state court in a criminal case. Assuming however, that the constitutional duty is as exacting as that imposed by Rule 11, the-state trial judge in this case exercised every possible precaution and the proceedings before him, as quoted in the majority opinion, may well serve as a model for other courts. The judge questioned the defendant person\u00e1lly to determine-that his plea of guilty was made because he was guilty and not because of any hope of reward or leniency. He advised, the defendant that the ultimate decision: as to the punishment to be imposed rested with the Judge. The judge then inquired into the factual basis for the plea. After a full recital of the facts relating to the robbery and of the defendant\u2019s confession, the state trial judge again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>examined the defendant as to whether he heard the statement of facts, did what the statement said, whether his confession was voluntary, and whether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">To repeat, there is no need to discuss the conflict of views as to precautions to be exercised before accepting a plea of guilty made upon an understanding as to punishment, because the state trial judge wisely exercised every conceivable precaution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">I therefore concur specially.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">. Under the circumstances of this case, if the twenty-five year sentence was held constitutionally invalid, I would vote to remand for further consideration of the validity of the later thirty-five year sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">. Admittedly I would welcome a Gideon-like trumpet call from the Supreme Court to transfer so much of the practical administration of criminal justice from the bargaining table to the courtroom. I recognize, however, the widespread prevalence of plea bargaining. In discussing \u201cThe Negotiated Plea of Guilty,\u201d the recent monumental report of the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice begins (p. 134): \u201cMost defendants who are convicted \u2014 as many as 90 percent in some jurisdictions \u2014 are not tried. They plead guilty, often as the result of negotiations about the charge or the sentence.\u201d The most that can be accomplished at the lower court level is to improve the present practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
