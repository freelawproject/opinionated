They are that on October 20, 1965, Smith sought to purchase a new Cadillac from Hoff Cadillac-Oldsmobile in Norfolk. The purchase was financed by GMAC through use of a conditional sales agreement. The conditional sales contract and an application for a Virginia certificate of title showing a lien in favor of GMAC were signed by Smith on October 20, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The application form recites that Smith, for the purpose of obtaining the certificate of title, stated under oath the facts set out therein. The district court found that the facts in the application were all correctly stated, but that Smith did not \u201ccertify\u201d the application for a certificate of title before a person authorized to administer oaths, as reauired by Section 46.1-51 of the Virginia Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A notary public employed by Hoff Cadillac-Oldsmobile completed and signed the notarial certificate in the application on October 25, five days after Smith had subscribed to the application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smith was not then present.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The application, apparently valid on its face, was forwarded along with the required fee and other necessary papers to the Division of Motor Vehicles in Richmond. It was received in the mail room of the Division on October 27, 1965, and was approved for issuance by a clerk in the title section on November 1. On November 17 a certificate of title was issued in the name of Beverly C. Smith showing a lien in favor of GMAC in the amount of $6,073.92.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">Smith was adjudicated bankrupt on October 29, nine days after he acquired the Cadillac and two days after the application for title (showing lien) was received by the Division of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">In determining the priority of liens at bankruptcy the trustee is deemed a lien creditor as to all property on \u201cwhich a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the date of bankruptcy * * *.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issue with which the district court dealt in this controversy, therefore, was whether GMAC acquired a lien valid as against subsequent lien creditors prior to October 29, when the trustee\u2019s lien was deemed to attach to the bankrupt\u2019s property. This determination, of course, is to be made according to state law. E. g., McKay v. Trusco Finance Co., 198 F.2d 431 (5th Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">Virginia law provides that when issued a certificate of title showing a lien is adequate notice to all creditors and purchasers, without further recordation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>that a lien against the motor vehicle exists.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, since no certificate of title had been issued on October 29, the date of the adjudication of bankruptcy, GMAC must rely on the Virginia grace period statute, Va.Code \u00a7 46.1-72. This statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cIf application for the registration or recordation of a lien or encumbrance to be placed upon a motor vehicle, * * <em>be filed </em>in the office of the Division in * * * Richmond, Virginia, within ten days from the date of such applicant\u2019s purchase of such motor vehicle, * * * it shall be valid as to all persons, whomsoever, including the Commonwealth, as if such registration had been done on the day such lien or encumbrance was acquired.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The district court held that the statutory phrase <em>\u201cbe filed </em>in the office of the Division in * * * Richmond\u201d refers to the date on which an application in proper form is received in the Division\u2019s Richmond office accompanied by the required fee. We agree with this interpretation of the statute for the reasons advanced by the district judge. See In re Smith, supra, 256 F.Supp. at 847-849.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The district court ruled, therefore, that since the application in the present case was \u201cfiled\u201d before the adjudication of bankruptcy, the GMAC lien would prevail over the trustee\u2019s rights in the Cadillac \u2014 but for the failure of the bankrupt to \u201ccertify\u201d before the notary his application, proper in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">We question the importance accorded by the district court to the failure of the bankrupt to \u201cswear\u201d personally before the notary. There is here no suggestion of fraud or false information furnished the Division of Motor Vehicles. Nor is there any doubt as to the authenticity of the purchaser\u2019s signature or the signature of the notary.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The district court noted that \u201cautomobile dealers throughout Virginia have been lax in their duties with respect to acknowledgement of signatures on title certificates and applications for lien.\u201d In re Smith, supra, 256 F.Supp. at 851. We have no reason to question this finding \u2014 if it be assumed that the duty of compliance is upon dealers. But the dealer is not the officer charged with the duty of taking the acknowledgement. It is the notary. Yet, as indicated by the district court, it is general knowledge that notaries are commonly employed by dealers and businessmen and are usually subordinate clerical employees. In the business world an automobile dealer who actually insisted that every car purchaser raise his right (or left) hand and swear an oath would be somewhat unusual. We doubt that even the most conscientious notary in Virginia does more than require signature of the purchaser in his actual presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">We are concerned that if the district court\u2019s decision is permitted to stand it might unsettle thousands of motor vehicle titles and security interests in Virginia. Cf. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 227 F.Supp. 958, 965, 966 (W.D.Va.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">In arriving at its conclusion favorable to the trustee the district court reasoned that there was an effective transfer of title from the Cadillac dealer to Smith\u2014 despite Smith\u2019s failure to swear an oath before the notary. Perhaps so. Then the district court reasoned that the lien, shown on the same instrument, was not effective as against the trustee because of the same defect held not fatal to transfer of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The different results were thought compelled by different theories: that ownership could pass to the buyer without regard to the instrument of title but that the lien was dependent for its maintenance upon the certificate. But this is not altogether clear. As Judge Dobie stated in In re Lowry, 40 F.2d 321, 322 (4th Cir. 1930), \u201c[t]he question * * * arises that if the certificate was sufficient for the one purpose why then is it not sufficient for the purpose of maintaining the lien?\u201d <em>If </em>the personal ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>knowledgement of the application was mandatory for the effective maintenance of the lien, we conclude that under Virginia law it was also required for the transfer of title \u2014 in fact, for the transfer of any interest to the bankrupt which could be subjected to a lien. See Sauls v. Thomas Andrews &amp; Co., 163 Va. 407, 175 S.E. 760 (1934).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Indeed it has been strongly suggested that there are good reasons for'exacting strict compliance with <em>title </em>registration requirements that do <em>not </em>pertain to <em>lien </em>interests. In Janney v. Bell, Judge Dobie, speaking for this court, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoS\">\u201cWe believe a clear distinction can properly be made between sales of motor vehicles when title (or ownership or general property) is supposed to pass between the parties to the transaction, and other claims or liens less than title or ownership. It might well be that these recordation provisions are mandatory as to sales of motor vehicles in that they are designed for three definite purposes: (1) to suppress automobile thefts; (2) to provide the state with a convenient record for tax purposes; (3) to provide a convenient and accessible method of identifying the ownership of an automobile for police purposes in connection with operation of the highways of the state. These three reasons for attaching hard deterrent results to any failure to comply with recordation statutes in connection with automobiles do not exist as to liens or other claims less than title.\u201d 111 F.2d 103,107 (4th Cir. 1940).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Because we may not speak authoritatively on state law, we attempt to do no more than to decide this case on its facts. Rationale and adoption of theory we leave to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">We hold on the facts of this case that the trustee has the inferior interest in the Cadillac. To hold otherwise would unjustly enrich the trustee and general creditors, none of whom were misled by the conduct of GMAC. Cf. Staunton Ind. Loan Corp. v. Wilson, 190 F.2d 706, 709 (4th Cir. 1951). In a bankruptcy proceeding it is especially appropriate to consider equitable principles and to disregard technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">We put our decision on alternative grounds. If the failure to personally \u201cacknowledge\u201d the title application was fatal to the maintenance of the GMAC lien, it was also fatal to the transfer to Smith of any ownership interest which would have vested in the trustee at the date of bankruptcy. Conversely, if the defective \u201cacknowledgment\u201d did not prevent effective transfer of ownership, then likewise it was not fatal to the effective maintenance of the lien recorded on the face of the same instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">On remand the district court will require the trustee to surrender the Cadillac to GMAC since its value is now less than the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">. The opinion of the district court is reported at In re Smith, 256 F.Supp. 844 (E.D.Va.1966). Since this controversy arose, the statutes involved have been amended in impertinent respects. Citations in this opinon, as in the opinion of the district court are to the prior statutory language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">.

A careful reading of the pertinent case law supports, the conclusion that failure to comply with a \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement of the Virginia statutes providing for transfer of automobile titles will prevent the passage not only of legal title but of any interest upon which a lien may be perfected. In Sauls v. Thomas Andrews &amp; Co., the Supreme Court of Appeals held that where there was not a proper assignment of title the \u201cpurchaser\u201d had no \u201clegal or equitable\u201d title to the car and his creditors could not \u201cseize\u201d it. See also Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Storm, 200 Va. 526, 106 S.E.2d 588 (1959) (vendor remained owner for purpose of insurance coverage); Holt Motors, Inc. v. Casto, 136 W.Va. 284, 67 S.E.2d 432 (1951) (vendor retained title and right to possession as owner); Thomas v. Mullins, 153 Va. 383, 149 S.E. 494 (1929) (vendor remained owner for purpose of sustaining fire loss); United States v. One Hudson Hornet Sedan, 110 F.Supp. 41 (W.D.Va.1953) (title remained in vendor for purpose of remission of forfeiture); Note, The Protection of Financing Agencies, Automobile Liens, 45 Va.L.Rev. 754, 756-757 (1959) ; compare Silvey v. Johnston, 193 Va. 677, 70 S.E.2d 280 (1952) (vendor\u2019s retention of title was basis for breach of warranty action). But cf. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 227 F.Supp. 958 (W.D.Va.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
