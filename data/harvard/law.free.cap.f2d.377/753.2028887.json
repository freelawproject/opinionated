All of the .above became involved in a drinking spree during a three-day period resulting in break-ins of a cafe, drive-in, and a filing station in Pine Ridge, netting the group some potato chips, potato salad, pop, candy bars, a bubble gum machine, :some cigarettes and, at the filling station, six guns and approximately twelve dollars in cash. The evidence is clear that during this spree the defendant performed the merciless act of shooting a watchdog at the drive-in. This lawless \u2022experience brought criminal indictments under federal law for burglary, based upon Tit. 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 where \u201c * * * the offense of burglary shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">Ramona, Lester Duane, Albert, and Delbert all pleaded guilty to the charges. All were placed on probation with the exception of Lester, who was sentenced to the Federal Correction Institution at Englewood, Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-19\">Warfield Goings pleaded not guilty and through appointed counsel requested a jury trial. Upon a jury verdict of guilty on three counts of an indictment, the district court sentenced him to the penitentiary for consecutive terms of three years on each count, or a total of nine years.<footnotemark>1(a)</footnotemark> Defendant brings this in forma pauperis appeal claiming two grounds for reversal: first, that the court erred in his instructions on the defense of intoxication, and secondly, that prejudicial error occurred by reason of improper interrogation of the government witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-20\">We find no merit in the first ground, but reverse and remand the proceedings for a new trial on the latter contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The defendant testified that he was \u201cdrunk\u201d throughout an eight day period of time, including August 20 to August 22 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and could not remember any events that took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Defendant argues that he did not have the requisite intent to commit the burglaries. Intoxication is not a defense in South Dakota, but sufficient evidence of it could vitiate the specific intent required to commit certain crimes. The trial court submitted this defense in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cYou are also instructed that as you ponder the question of guilt or innocence of this defendant, you must keep in mind that intoxication under the law is not a defense, unless from the record as a whole on that question there is enough to create a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he was sober enough to form the required intent to commit the crime charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Defendant claims that the same is misleading in that it could be construed that the defendant had the burden of proof in showing \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d Defendant did not make specific exception to the instruction on this ground. Nevertheless we feel, when read with all other instructions, it is not misleading as to burden of proof. Secondly, it is argued that the instruction does not unequivocally state that defendant is entitled to an acquittal under circumstances where he does not have the intent. It would appear the court was generally instructing in conformance with the South Dakota statute. State v. Kapelino, 20 S.D. 591, 108 N.W. 335. See also People v. Odell, 1 Dak. 197, 46 N.W. 601 and State v. Ford, 16 S.D. 228, 92 N.W. 18. This was permissible and although not as specific as defendant\u2019s request or as other approved instructions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in this area, we think it meets the minimum standards, of the law and is not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">We now come to the government\u2019s examination of Delbert Wayne Ghost Bear.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was on probation by reason of the events of August 20-22, 1964 and was called to testify on behalf of the government. The witness was asked and he answered these questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-15\">\u201cQ. Now, during August of 1964, where were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-16\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t remember too well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-17\">\u201cQ. To refresh your memory, were you at Pine Ridge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-18\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\u201cQ. Now on Thursday evening of August 20, 1964, where were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cQ. Well, to refresh your recollection did you, previous to coming to court here, give a statement to Mr. Moore, Criminal Investigator, and also Mr. McCarty, Special Agent of the F.B.I.? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">\u201cQ. Do you remember giving them a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u201cQ. And before coming into court, Delbert, weren\u2019t you furnished a copy of that statement to re-read?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">\u201cQ. And did you re-read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I forgot to read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-12\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t I ask you whether or not you had looked it over, and didn\u2019t you say you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-13\">\u201cA. I said I forgot to read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">\u201cQ. Can you read?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-15\">\u201cA. Not very good. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">The witness stated he had a twelfth grade education. The government then, out of the presence of the jury, claimed \u201csurprise\u201d and moved to have the court declare the witness \u201chostile\u201d on the grounds that the witness had told the government he had read the statement before coming to court and inferred that since talking to the defendant the witness had conveniently lost his memory. The court thereupon declared that the witness was \u201chostile\u201d and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-17\">\u201cThis is not impeachment, this is statements elicited by reason of the fact that he is hostile \u2014 a hostile witness. * * * <em>I think it\u2019s substantive evidence because he refuses to testify, </em>and he is a hostile witness, and for that reason, as to any statements he made in there, you can ask leading questions.\u201d (The defendant objected to the examination on the ground that it was improper impeachment and that the statement was not made under oath, not subject to cross examination.) (Our emphasis) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2T\">Thereafter, each sentence of the statement was read to the witness and asked if that was a correct statement. Because of the significance we have set out in the Appendix the text of that portion of Ghost Bear\u2019s examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-20\">In addition, the trial court instructed the jury as to his testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApQ\">\u201cThe Court, after hearing certain preliminary testimony of one Delbert Wayne Ghost Bear and in conjunction therewith a statement from the witness that he \u2018couldn\u2019t read so good\u2019, even as he admitted being a high school graduate, held him to be a hostile witness, and leading questions by the prosecution for that reason permitted. This testimony is to be treated as a part of the affirmative proof by the government, but you are instructed that it, as well as all other testimony, is to be scanned against the background of credibility heretofore submitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-21\">Exception was taken to this instruction on the ground that it allowed the jury to consider the statement as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">As indicated, the trial court did not consider Ghost Bear\u2019s statement as impeachment. Even assuming a witness\u2019s inability to remember can be specifically contradicted by ex parte statements (compare, Troublefield v. United States, D.C.Cir., decided December 12, 1966, 372 F.2d 912), the government did not attempt to pursue any further foundation for impeachment. The only question asked, \u201cWhere were you on the night of August 20, 1964?\u201d and the an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>$wer, \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d can not provide foundation to impeach with the statement relating details of events occurring that evening as well as August 21 and August 22. But the overwhelming weight of authority holds that impeachment of one\u2019s own witness must be established on the predicate of both \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cdamage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In Randazzo v. United States, 8 Cir., 300 F. 794, at 797-798, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201c * * * In its simplest statement it is that, when a party calls a witness and is surprised by affirmative evidence given by the witness, which actually aids the adversary party, the party calling the witness may cross-examine him, and show statements made by him which are contrary to the testimony given by him on the witness stand. * * * But when the witness merely fails, when called, to testify in favor of the party calling him, as he was expected to do, but says nothing which tends to aid the case of the adversary party, he cannot be cross-examined or impeached by the party who calls him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cThe situation as to the witness Ray is somewhat different on the facts. This witness, when on the stand, failed to testify as counsel for the government confidently expected he would.. As the basis for this expectation, the government relied on an alleged statement made by the witness, to the assistant district attorney, which, it was intimated, was had in a conversation with counsel for the government and later embodied in an affidavit. But Ray gave no evidence in any way helpful to the defendants, nor did he aid the case of the government. In short, his testimony was wholly colorless and negative in probative effect. In such case, any showing of any former statements of the witness, in which he said things hurtful to defendants was inadmissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">See also Kuhn v. United States, 9 Cir., 24 F.2d 910, 913; Mitchell v. Swift &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 151 F.2d 770; Bushaw v. United States, 9 Cir., 353 F.2d 477, at 481.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">However, in conjunction with the court\u2019s ruling the government sought specifically to utilize the statement not as impeaching evidence but through leading questions to refresh the witness\u2019s recollection with it. Refreshing a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ness\u2019s recollection by memorandum or prior testimony is perfectly proper trial procedure and control of the same lies largely in the trial court\u2019s discretion. However, if a party can offer a previously given statement to substitute for a witness\u2019s testimony under the guise of \u201crefreshing recollection,\u201d the whole adversary system of trial must be revised.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>The evil of this practice hardly merits discussion. The evil is no less when an attorney can read the statement in the presence of the jury and thereby substitute his spoken word for the written document. </em>See United States v. Block, 2 Cir., 88 F.2d 618. \u201c * * * the contents of the statements are not to be put in evidence before the jury.\u201d Young v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 214 F.2d 232, at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In Rosenthal v. United States, 8 Cir., 248 F. 684 at 686, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">\u201cAnother error committed was the admission of the testimony of Lipsehitz, the main witness for the government, without whose testimony there was practically no evidence to justify a verdict of guilty. While, in view of his testimony, as given before the referee, <em>it was proper to permit him to be examined as a hostile witness, and as one whose testimony at the trial was a surprise to the government, it was improper to read to him all of his testimony before the referee, </em>by way of cross-examination, and ask him as every question and answer was read before the jury, \u2018Did you not on the former occasion testify as follows?\u2019 <em>This was not for the purpose of refreshing his memory, but was in fact introducing his testimony, </em>in an examination before the referee under section 21 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp.St.1916, \u00a7 9605). This was error. Commonwealth v. Jeffs, 132 Mass. 5; Chamberlayne on the Modern Law of Ev. \u00a7 3507.\u201d (Our emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">See also United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, at 234, 60 S.Ct. 811, at 849, 84 L.Ed. 1129, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-12\">\u201c * * * there would be error where under the pretext of refreshing a witness\u2019 recollection, the prior testimony was introduced as evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">Cf. National Dairy Products Corp. v. United States, 8 Cir., 350 F.2d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">Proper foundation requires the witness\u2019s recollection to be exhausted, and that the time, place and person to whom the statement was given be identified. When the court is satisfied that the memorandum on its face reflects the witness\u2019s statement or one the witness acknowledges, and in his discretion the court is further satisfied that it may be of help in refreshing the person\u2019s memory,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the witness should be allowed to refer to the document.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It then becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>proper to have the witness, if it is a fact, to say that his memory is refreshed and, independent of the exhibit, testify what <em>his present recollection is. </em>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, 310 U.S. at 232, 60 S.Ct. 811.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But to read the statement aloud for refreshing recollection to the witness, hostile or not, is patent error.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The trial court ruled that the witness was hostile and therefore the statement may be admitted as substantive evidence. Hostility of an <em>adverse witness </em>may allow the use of leading questions to refresh recollection or to contradict the \u201csurprise\u201d testimony. We know of no rule of law where hostility of a witness transforms hearsay statements of the witness into admissible substantive proof. The trial court may have confused the rule concerning the examination of <em>adverse parties </em>under Rule 43(b), which necessarily allows cross examination of adverse parties as distinguished from adverse witnesses to seek admissions. See discussion of this distinction in Degelos v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 5 Cir., 313 F.2d 809, 814-815. See also Ellis v. United States, 8 Cir., 138 F.2d 612, at 617, and Judge Gibson\u2019s recent discussion of Rule 43(b)' in Skogen v. Dow Chemical, 8 Cir., decided March 30, 1967, 375 F.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"AOhy\">Appellee urges, however, that the witness Ghost Bear affirmed that the statements were correct and therefore were adopted by the witness. We view this argument with extreme difficulty because of the witness\u2019s expressed uncertainty (see Appendix) in responding to questions on both his direct and cross examination. However, even if the witness adopts the prior statement as true, the error is not cured. It is still a hearsay statement suggested to the witness rather than his own statement given under oath in court. The procedure utilized cannot be sanctioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>to fill in memory gaps of any witness who is called to testify. Rosenthal v. United States, supra. And as previously demonstrated, <em>this was not evidence contradicting prior testimony of fact and, subsequently adopted by the witness. </em>See Finnegan v. United States, 8 Cir., 204 F.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">No attempt was made to have the witness review the statement <em>in court </em>to properly refresh his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The witness stated he could not read <em>very well. </em>The prosecution and the court viewed this remark as one of hostility in light of his twelfth grade education. Nevertheless, the witness was not requested to review his statement at that time under oath to refresh his recollection. Perhaps the government considered it a futile gesture, but at this point, <em>where the witness had not damaged the government\u2019s case, </em>it was their only alternative course. The only motive the .\u2022government had in reading the statement in front of the jury was an attempt to inject hearsay evidence into the case as substantive proof. If this procedure is \u2022approved, then ex parte statements may be substituted for courtroom testimony as long as the witness, friendly or hostile, is present to be cross examined by the other side. In principle, this same theory was urged, and refuted, in United States v. Rainwater, 8 Cir., 283 F.2d 386.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\"> The rule requiring the witness to independently refresh his recollection without reading it aloud to the jury or having the statement itself offered into evidence assures that the witness is testifying in his own words.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">We in no way retreat from the recognition that the greatest latitude should be allowed in the examination of witnesses by the trial judge. See Mitchell v. United States, 8 Cir., 208 F.2d 854. The propriety of declaring a witness \u201chostile\u201d or finding \u201csurprise\u201d must necessarily remain in the trial court\u2019s discretion. The liberality of cross-examination, the propriety of a document to be used for refreshing recollection, the use of leading questions, as well as flexible means to impeach one\u2019s own witness, must always be within the trial judge\u2019s control. The trial judge should exercise his discretion with wide latitude to assure an atmosphere in which a witness will feel at ease in telling the truth. Ritualistic formality in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>presenting evidence should not deter untrained witnesses from telling their story-in their own words. We hold here, it is only when evidence which is traditionally considered unworthy or unreliable, assumes the stature of undue significance that we must recognize error.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In recognizing the error in the examination of Ghost Bear, we still are faced with the question whether the error assumes the magnitude of prejudice, requiring a new trial. Mr. Justice Rutledge\u2019s observations, in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557, guide our determination. There is no doubt of the defendant\u2019s participation in the break-ins and the drinking spree. This is not denied. Appellant\u2019s only defense is that he was so \u201cdrunk\u201d he was not aware of all of the events that took place on the nights in question. On the basis of the evidence presented, however, the jury found that the defendant had the requisite intent to commit the crime. Ghost Bear similarly professed to be intoxicated. Yet as part of the government\u2019s evidence was Ghost Bear\u2019s precise, detailed statement of fact reflecting a person fully aware of the events that ensued. It is impossible to say that this accurate recording of events could not reasonably influence a jury to believe that if Ghost Bear knew of these details, as reflected in such a thorough narrative, the defendant similarly had presence of mind to have sufficient intent to commit the crimes. The instruction by the trial court that the jury should consider the evidence as \u201caffirmative proof\u201d because the witness was \u201chostile\u201d adds to the prejudicial use of the statement itself. See Brooks v. United States, 10 Cir., 309 F.2d 580. For these reasons we feel the error pervades the record. We reverse and remand the proceeding for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Judgment reversed and remanded in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\n<em>Appendix</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">\u201cQ.

Sierra suggested we break into Jack\u2019s Texaco Station in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. I don\u2019t know why he suggested this, but I agreed to it.\u2019 Is that a correct statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">\u201cA. I guess so.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">\u201cQ. Is it or isn\u2019t it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b817-20\">\u201cA. I guess it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-21\">\u201cQ. Is it a correct statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b817-22\">\u201cA. I think it is, I am not too sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201cQ.

Then going on: \u2018We went to the Texaco Station where Sierra got into the building through a window he opened. He then opened the front door and let Goings in. I stayed outside to watch out for the police. I did not go into the station.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">\u201cQ. \u2018After about twenty minutes Sierra and Goings came out with some guns.

Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">\u201cQ. \u2018We then went to Annie Bissonette\u2019s house.

M. on August 21, 1964, Warfield Goings, Albert Whiting, Babe Sierra, Ramona Two Two and I were all drinking wine and beer which I had bought. We were drinking at Annie Bissonette\u2019s house.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\u201cQ. \u2018Someone, I can\u2019t recall who, suggested we break into the Red Wing Cafe, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">\u201cQ. \u2018We went to the cafe where Sierra crawled into the building through a back window which Goings broke out. Whiting and Goings also climbed in through the window. Ramona and I stayed outside to watch for the police.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">\u201cQ. \u2018About ten minutes after they went in Sierra and Whiting came out of the cafe with Whiting carrying a gum machine.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">\u201cQ. \u2018We all went back to Bissonette\u2019s. I do not know what happened to the machine.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">\u201cQ.

Now, going to the statement itself, and to this particular paragraph : \u2018Around midnight on August 21 or 22nd, 1964, I, Warfield Goings, Albert Whiting, Ramona Two Two and Babe Sierra were together. We had been drinking. Goings suggested we break into Jack &amp; Jean\u2019s Drive-in in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. We all agreed to this.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-21\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-22\">\u201cQ. \u2018We went to the drive-in, Sierra opened a window and crawled inside. He then came back out and said there was a dog inside.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-23\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-24\">\u201cQ. \u2018Goings had a 22 rifle with him and he broke a window out and shot the dog.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-25\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not sure, but I guess it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201cQ. \u2018Sierra, Goings, and possibly Whiting, crawled inside, then I don\u2019t know for sure if Whiting did or not, Ramona and I were outside watching for the police.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\u201cQ. \u2018Then someone, I\u2019m not sure who, handed some food out the window to me. I did not hear any shots inside the building. After we got out the food, candy and potato chips, we left and went to Annie Bissonette\u2019s home and ate it.\u2019 That\u2019s a correct statement, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">\u201cQ. Delbert, you pled guilty to this same matter, didn\u2019t you ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">\u201cQ. And are you presently on probation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Then followed the cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">\u201cQ. Do you remember the time on August 20th when you and War-field caught a ride to Gordon for purpose of buying some beer and wine?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">\u201cQ. And do you remember that you went down there and you bought I believe it was two cases of beer and a gallon of wine, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">\u201cQ. On the way back from Gordon to Pine Ridge you drank some beer, you drank about a six pack of it at that time ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-17\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-18\">\u201cQ. Then when you got back to Goings\u2019 house, you and Warfield and I believe Lester Sierra was there, isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-19\">\u201cA. I guess so.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-20\">\u201cQ. The three of you sat around Goings\u2019 house drinking the beer and wine, isn\u2019t that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-21\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-22\">\u201cQ. During that time wasn\u2019t there a time when you picked up some more wine, some half pints ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-23\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-24\">\u201cQ. That was while you were still at Goings\u2019 house ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-25\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-26\">\u201cQ. You drank there how long would you say ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-27\">\u201cA. I can't be too sure, but I think it was about three or four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-28\">\u201cQ. Then where did you go ? Did you go to Mrs. Bissonette\u2019s house at that time after you left Goings\u2019 house ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-29\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t be too sure because I was pretty drunk then.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-30\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t remember at that point ?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-31\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-32\">\u201cQ. Do you remember seeing Ramona Two Two that night, wasn\u2019t she at Bissonette\u2019s house?</p>\n<p id=\"b820-33\">\u201cA. I guess so, I\u2019m not too sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>\u201cQ. Did you keep drinking all night long as far as you can remember?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\u201cA. As far as I can remember, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\u201cQ. You think you were drunk that night, do you ?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201cA. Yes. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">\u201cQ. The fact is, when you testified the first time you got on the stand you couldn\u2019t remember where you were on August 20th, the fact is you can\u2019t remember where you were on August 20th because you were too drunk, isn\u2019t that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">\u201cQ. Now, Delbert, there\u2019s one other thing I want to ask you about, at this time in August, 1964, do you remember the practice that the boys had down there of sniffing glue, or was it gasoline?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">\u201cA. I guess so, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">\u201cQ. Was it glue or gasoline that you were sniffing?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">\u201cA. Who, me?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">\u201cQ. All of you?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t remember too well.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">\u201cQ. Do you remember sniffing something that made you feel funny in the head ?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-17\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-18\">\u201cQ. And you were sniffing it that night, too, weren\u2019t you ?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-19\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-20\">\u201cQ. And that\u2019s another reason why you can\u2019t remember what happened that night, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-21\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-22\">\u201cQ. And you were all doing it, too, that night \u2014 everybody that was there ?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\">\u201cA. I was taking the stuff, but I don\u2019t know about the other guys.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">\u201cQ.

That being its only function, there must, in order to permit them to be shown, be some prior evidence to neutralize. Where a witness states no evidence against the party calling him, or where he gives only favorable testimony, there is nothing to counteract. The testimony to be neutralized must therefore be prejudicial, detrimental; otherwise the previous statements shown would stand out before the jury, not as offsetting some proof already given, but as substantive evidence of a fact, and to permit this to be done would be to turn to a dangerous purpose * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-17\">\u201cWhen the witness Carney in the case at bar stated that he did not remember that the defendant made an admission of the crime on the next morning, he stated no fact prejudicial or detrimental to the state; he simply failed to prove a fact which the state wanted to show. The failure to so remember was no evidence to be neutralized; after attempted neutralization, that is, after the statements were shown, the case would in legal effect stand the same as it was before, namely that he did not remember. Hence the only purpose that could be subserved by reading into the record the previous statements made, and the only effect that this could have, would be to cause these statements, which were hearsay, to appear to the jury as substantive evidence, the highly prejudicial effect of which is clear.
