Briefly, the petitioner, a union steward, maintains that he was discharged for vigorous, but proper, performance of his stewardship, and not, as the Board found, for cause. Admittedly there was substantial evidence supporting the petitioner\u2019s position. In rejecting it the Board placed principal reliance upon a statement made by Machaby himself. Petitioner argues that \u201cat best\u201d this statement was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">We disagree. Machaby\u2019s testimony was ambiguous \u201cat worst.\u201d His position is initially based upon his own assumption that his admission in the midafternoon of Monday as to instructions he had given the employees related to Sunday, (when, assertedly, they might have been proper) although, concededly, he had just been talking to the employees a few minutes before and his admission in no way placed this remark back to Sunday. Our review of the events makes Monday appear the more logical. Certainly the Board did not have to choose Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\">Nor can we agree that the Board \u201cdistorted\u201d Machaby\u2019s testimony. When a steward tells the employees that if asked to work in a particular location under the \u201crules\u201d they were not to \u201crefuse,\u201d but that they should \u201cask to see your steward,\u201d namely, himself, and adds the advice that the location was unsafe and they did not have to work there, the Board was clearly warranted in its ultimate finding that the employees had received an instruction not to work. This was an improper instruction,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and adequate cause for discharge. The Board\u2019s rejection of the general counsel\u2019s claim that the employer\u2019s given reason for the discharge was a pretext is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-18\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\"> Although the decision was by a majority, the panel was unanimous that this was not a dangerous location within the meaning of section 502 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 143, which might have permitted Machaby to take this position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
