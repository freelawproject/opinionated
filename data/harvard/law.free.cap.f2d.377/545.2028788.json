As we read the opinion of the district court, it applied the standard of Brady v. Southern R. R., 320 U.S. 476, 479-480, 64 S.Ct. 232, 88 L.Ed. 239 (1943), that \u201cWhen the evidence is such that without weighing the credibility of the witnesses there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict, the court should determine the proceeding * * * by judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d We have examined the record and agree that the uncontradicted evidence requires the conclusion that \u201cthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art\u201d. 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
