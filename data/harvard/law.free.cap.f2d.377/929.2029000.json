Not being a member of the Local, however, he was required to have a permit from the Local to continue the employment here involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Renewal of such a permit was refused by the Local\u2019s Business Agent, thus, because of an understanding between the Local and the employer, causing his discharge. This would not have occurred as it did had Reinero been a member of or held an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>apprentice\u2019s permit issued by the Local. The evidence justified, as we have said, findings to the above effect, and it was within the Board\u2019s competence to conclude that in this manner the section of the Act referred to was violated by the Local. Moreover, the remedy prescribed by the Board is appropriate to the nature of the violation found.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The Local contends the Board erred in rejecting the Local\u2019s contention before the Board that it was deprived of a full and fair hearing. The contention rests upon the failure of the Trial Examiner to apprise the Business Agent of the nature of the proceedings, the possible result, and the probable need for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The complaint apprised the Local of the nature of the proceedings. There is nothing whatever to indicate the Local was not aware of their nature and possible consequences, or of its right to be represented by counsel as provided in the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations. Series 8, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.38. At the opening of the hearing the Trial Examiner asked counsel and \u201cother representatives for the parties\u201d to state their names. For the Local, its Business Agent answered, \u201cWe have none.\u201d The Trial Examiner asked, \u201cYou have no counsel?\u201d The Business Agent responded, \u201cRight, we do not have counsel.\u201d Then the Trial Examiner inquired: \u201cAnd you, sir, are the representative?\u201d The Business Agent answered, <em>\u201cI </em>am.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">There was no denial of the right to counsel, rather a choice of the Local to be represented by its Business Agent, as was also its right. Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 6(a), 60 Stat. 240, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a); Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, Series 8, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.38. Counsel for the Local cites us no civil or administrative case in support of his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">We think the case \u00abraises no tenable issue of due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">The petition of the Local is denied and the order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-13\">. 61 Stat. 146, as amended, 29 U.S.O. \u00a7 160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-14\">. Reinero came to Local Union No. 742 in Decatur, Illinois, as a member of Local Union No. 1235, Modesto, California.
