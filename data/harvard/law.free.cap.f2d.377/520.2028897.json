We pretermit a discussion of whether, considering the relevant facts and circumstances, there was a border search (19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 482, 1581, 1582); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>for we agree with the trial court that Galanos, the arresting officer, had before him facts and circumstances within his knowledge sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense had been or was being committed; and thus there was probable cause.
