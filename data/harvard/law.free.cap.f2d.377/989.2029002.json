No objection was made to the confession at the time of the trial on the grounds of involuntariness and appellant\u2019s counsel declined the court\u2019s invitation to inquire into the question of voluntariness out of the jury\u2019s presence. At the conclusion of the testimony, the court instructed the jurors to disregard the confession if they found it to be involuntary, and the record amply supports the conclusion that the confession could properly be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
