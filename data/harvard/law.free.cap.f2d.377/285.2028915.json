His appeal is grounded on the contentions that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence and that the trial judge should have declared a mistrial because the government attorney improperly questioned defendant\u2019s witness concerning the use of narcotics by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">With regard to the first contention, we find that the conviction is adequately supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">The colloquy to which the second contention refers is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">Q. Who did you sell narcotics to? A. Well, I\u2019m not on trial for any of my past deeds. Your Honor, would it be necessary for me to answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think so. Not unless you can show that it is pertinent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-18\">MR. WILSON [defense counsel]: I will instruct him to answer, if Your Honor please, but it would be very embarrassing, I think, if he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-19\">MR. SHRIVER: Do you know whether Mr. Fisher is an addict or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-21\">A. No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-22\">Q. You don\u2019t know? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-23\">Q. Do you suspect he is? A. No* I never had any reason to suspect it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-24\">MR. WILSON: We object to that suspicions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-25\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-26\"> The introduction in a criminal case of testimony concerning unrelated criminal activities of a defendant is so-likely to have a prejudicial effect on the jury that it is generally held to be inadmissible, with exceptions made for purposes of impeachment and of proving such matters as the design, intent, or motive of the defendant. 1 Wigmore, Evidence (3d. ed. 1940), \u00a7\u00a7 193, 215. Unless the government was prepared to-substantiate its suggestion concerning defendant\u2019s addiction and to show that the matter fell within an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility, the-inquiry was highly objectionable. There-is some indication in the record that the trial judge, although initially critical of the questioning, later became satisfied that there was a factual basis for the inquiry and that the issue of addiction may have been admissible. In any event, defense counsel neither objected to the-questioning nor moved for a mistrial at. the time the questions were asked, and indeed stated that he would instruct the witness to answer. Hence, even if we assume that the questioning by the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>eminent was improper, the acquiescence of defense counsel would preclude reversal except in a case where manifest injustice would result. United States v. Grosso, 358 F.2d 154 (3rd Cir. 1966); United States v. Agueci, 310 F.2d 817, 99. A.L.R.2d 478 (2d Cir. 1962). See United States v. Pearson, 344 F.2d 430 (6th Cir. 1965). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
