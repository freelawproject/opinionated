The Commission found that appellants willfully violated the anti-fraud provisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and aided and abetted willful violations of the anti-manipulative provisions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the federal securities laws; it revoked the broker-dealer registration of the partnership and barred the individual appellants from employment in the industry except as employees of a \u201cbroker-dealer in a non-managerial capacity upon a showing that they will be adequately supervised.\u201d F. S. Johns &amp; Co., SEC Sec. Exch. Act Release No. 7972 (Oct. 10, 1966) (4-1).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">This court considered practically the same points raised on this appeal in affirming the same decision and order of the Commission as to two other appellants in Dlugash v. SEC, 373 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1967). Appellants\u2019 first argu'ment here is that there was insufficient evidence to support the Commission\u2019s findings and order, particularly the finding of willfulness. However, under the definition of \u201cwillful\u201d approved by this court in <em>Dlugash, </em>this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Petitioners, a small over-the-counter partnership, also claim that the sanction imposed upon them was unduly harsh and deliberately discriminatory; they point to the much lighter penalty of a sixty-day suspension from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. accorded co-defendant Reuben Rose &amp; Co., Inc., a large firm dealing primarily in listed stocks. The claim that other parties \u201c \u2018got off easier\u2019 \u201d was also made in <em>Dlugash-, </em>it was denied with the observation that the sanctions imposed \u201cwere well within the Commission\u2019s discretion.\u201d We would let the matter rest there save for one observation. Agency bias against a small firm, or for that matter for or against anyone, is a serious thing, and this court will be watchful against it. But petitioners have failed to demonstrate discrimination in this case. Reuben Rose employs about one hundred persons; Winkler, Chase consisted solely of the two appellants. Both appellants were directly involved in the violations found, whereas only one individual at Reuben Rose had directly participated in or had knowledge of the illegal activities. Reuben Rose was penalized for lack of supervision over this employee. Moreover, the latter, whose conduct implicated Reuben Rose, was given a more severe sanction . than either appellant, having been barred \u2014 as appellants were not\u2014 from any future association with a broker-dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">The Commission\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">.
