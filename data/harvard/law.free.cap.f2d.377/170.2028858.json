Appellant brought this habeas corpus action, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was not dangerous within the meaning of the release provisions of D.C. Code \u00a7 24-301(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that he was not receiving treatment for his mental condition. He appealed from the District Court\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">Dr. Platkin, Chief of Service at John Howard Pavilion, where appellant was confined, testified at the habeas corpus hearing that appellant \u201cshows a very serious character disorder and defect,\u201d and that there had been no \u201csignificant degree of improvement; and I don\u2019t see any great prospects for the future.\u201d It was also shown that appellant\u2019s two prior conditional releases had been revoked at least in part because he had incurred heavy debts which he could not repay in order to purchase items he did not need. This behavior was, according to the psychiatrists, a symptom of appellant\u2019s mental illness, and it was the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>their conclusion that he was dangerous and thus ineligible for release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Nevertheless, after this appeal was argued, submitted, ana pending our decision, the Hospital requested the Court of General Sessions to release appellant unconditionally. The release was granted. The Government and appellant now seek to dismiss the instant petition as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Although this appeal raises substantial questions concerning the scope of mandatory commitment and its relation to the 1964 Hospitalization of the Mentally 111 Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we agree that the appeal should be dismissed, since this may well be in appellant\u2019s best interests. <em>Cf. </em>Henderson v. United States, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 380, 387, 360 F.2d 514, 521 (1966) (concurring opinion).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-16\">.

Unconditional release, under Subsection (e) , requires a certificate of the superintendent of the mental hospital \u201c(1) that such person has recovered his sanity, (2) <em>that, in the opinion of the superintendent, such person will not in the reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others, </em>and (3) in the opinion of the superintendent, the person is entitled to his unconditional release from the hospital * * D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (e) (1961).
