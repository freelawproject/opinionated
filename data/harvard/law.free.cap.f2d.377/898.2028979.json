Vanater that he had been wrongfully \u201cinduced\u201d to plead guilty to a third felony upon which the recidivist conviction rested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******Denied post-conviction relief in the West Virginia Supreme Court, Vanater filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, and that court, after a plenary hearing, dismissed the petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">\n<em>Whether The Plea Was Voluntary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhA\">At the beginning of the exhaustive hearing in the district court, it was agreed that Vanater\u2019s \u201cmain contention\u201d was that his plea of guilty was \u201cinduced,\u201d i. e., involuntary. We have carefully examined the transcript of 120 pages of testimony taken before the district judge. It is one of sharply conflicting testimony. Although Vanater testified at one point that \u201cI\u2019m not claiming that there was any deal made,\u201d both prior and subsequent thereto, he told in great detail that the prosecuting attorney had promised him that if he pleaded guilty the maximum punishment, would be ten years, and impliedly, that, no proceeding based on the recidivism statute would be instituted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Vanater\u2019s story was flatly contradicted by the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>sistant prosecuting attorney accused of making the promise, another assistant, and an officer who was present during the conversations. According to all of them, the conversations related to a planned jail break and nothing whatsoever was said about whether Vanater would be charged as a recidivist \u2014 regardless of what his plea might be to the substantive offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">There would be no doubt about the district judge\u2019s resolution of this strictly factual controversy except that Vanater\u2019s story is afforded some degree of plausibility by the testimony of his lawyer. Edward W. Hiserman represented Vanater, Elwood McClure, and another codefendant charged with breaking and entering in eleven indictments. In another habeas corpus proceeding initiated by McClure, Hiserman testified with respect to why McClure pleaded guilty: \u201cThe reason for this was twofold: First, that in talking to the prosecutor that handled the case I was informed that it was unlikely that, so far as the other defendant, Mickey Vanater, was concerned, because Mickey had cooperated with the State in some respects that the State didn\u2019t feel that it wanted to or would likely file an information, and if it didn\u2019t in the Vanater case it wouldn\u2019t in the McClure case.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">In Vanater\u2019s hearing below, Hiserman affirmed his prior testimony but stopped short of testifying that Vanater was misled into pleading guilty by a false promise of the prosecuting attorney. Instead, he explained Vanater\u2019s decision to plead guilty on the ground that he and Vanater both knew <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that if he stood trial (pleaded not guilty) an information charging him with recidivism probably would be filed against him, and that if he pleaded guilty there was a good chance that no such proceeding would be begun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The testimony of the prosecuting attorney that he exercised discretion as to whether or not to file an information charging recidivism supports this explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">The burden of proof rested upon petitioner Vanater to establish that his guilty plea was involuntary. That burden must be sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. Bates v. Meadows, 358 F.2d 674, 675 (6th Cir. 1966), and cases cited therein. The district court-concluded that petitioner\u2019s testimony was not convincing. It found as a fact that he entered his plea freely and voluntarily, and failed and refused to find that the prosecuting attorney had induced his plea by false promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">This court is bound by the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous. Fed. R.Civ.P. 52; Root v. Cunningham, 344 F.2d 1, 2 (4th Cir. 1965). The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule applies to habeas corpus proceedings. Barber v. Gladden, 327 F.2d 101, 103-104 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\"> Disappointed hope or expectation of leniency \u2014 so long as it is not wrongfully induced by the government\u2014 does not justify withdrawal of a guilty plea nor afford occasion for invalidating it. United States v. Taylor, 303 F.2d 165, 168 (4th Cir. 1962). The conclusion that the plea of guilty was voluntary is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">\n<em>Whether The Right To Counsel Was Denied</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">Admittedly competent counsel representing Vanater suggested to the district court a \u201cminor issue,\u201d i. e., the contention that Vanater was effectively denied the right to counsel because the attorney he and his brother selected and employed for him also represented two codefendants. The changing concept of right to counsel is not the same as it was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>1958. Even now, it is certainly permissible to infer that Vanater himself, with a full comprehension of the significant facts, may have waived his right to counsel unhampered by representation of possible conflicting interests. Cf. Case v. State of North Carolina, 315 F.2d 743 (4th Cir. 1964). Edward W. Hiserman was not appointed to represent Vanater, but was employed by Vanater and/or his brother,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Vanater knew that Hiserman represented two of the three codefendants. But it is unnecessary to determine this right to counsel question.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">Since Vanater contends that he was led to plead guilty by the prosecutor\u2019s <em>direct </em>promise to him and it is clear that Hiserman\u2019s representation of other codefendants did not enter into Vanater\u2019s decision to plead guilty, the conflict of interest contention is swallowed up in the guilty plea and waived. Kagen v. United States, 360 F.2d 30 (10th Cir. 1966); Gilmore v. People of State of California, 364 F.2d 916 (9th Cir. 1966); United States ex rel. Pizarro v. Fay, 353 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1965); United States ex rel. Martin v. Fay, 352 F.2d 418 (2d Cir. 1965); Edwards v. United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 256 F.2d 707, cert. denied 358 U.S. 847, 79 S.Ct. 74, 3 L.Ed.2d 82 (1958). \u201c[T]he plea of guilty, in the absence of a showing of prejudice to the accused, was a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects.\u201d Lattin v. Cox, 355 F.2d 397, 398 (10th Cir. 1966). As Judge Tuttle said, writing for the Fifth Circuit in a case wherein the same contention was made (conflict of interest due to representation of multiple defendants): \u201c[Sjince the Court has found the guilty plea was voluntary the appellant must be said to have waived the conflict of interest theory.\u201d Martin v. United States, 256 F.2d 345, 349 (5th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">If it be assumed that Vanater\u2019s right to counsel was infringed, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not thereby prejudiced, and the error, if any, was harmless. See Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Turner v. State of Maryland, 318 F.2d 852, 854 (4th Cir. 1963); ef. Whitaker v. Warden, 362 F.2d 838 (4th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-13\">. Although a motion was made in April 1958 to quash the information charging Vanater with being an habitual criminal, the grounds set forth did not mention wrongful inducement, nor was there any contention at that time that his guilty plea to the third felony was involuntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-24\">. Vanater was convicted in 1948 of breaking and entering, and again in 1950 of a burglary type offense. His plea of guilty to breaking and entering in February 1958 constituted the third offense, which under West Virginia\u2019s recidivist statute made him subject to imprisonment for life as an habitual criminal. W.Va.Code \u00a7 61-11-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b954-6\">. See McClure v.

The source of knowledge was said to be experience in the criminal courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b954-10\">. Hiserman also suggested perhaps the best possible reason for a guilty plea: that Vanater surely would have been convicted anyway. It should be noted that Vanater apparently got some advantage out of his guilty plea: ten additional breaking and entering indictments were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b955-7\">.
