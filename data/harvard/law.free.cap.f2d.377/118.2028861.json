We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">Appellant Thomas was arrested by Bobby Woodham, a Secret Service agent, on January 8, 1965. In making the arrest without a warrant, Woodham relied on the following information. He had been told by one Charles Porter, a co-defendant in the trial below who does not appeal, that Porter had used his car to drive appellant, two women, and another man to a liquor store for the purpose of cashing a check. The two women went inside the store while the men waited in the car. After the check was cashed, Porter said he received $5 and a fifth of whiskey for his transportation services, and the other parties split up the money obtained from the check. In addition, Woodham was acquainted with appellant whom he had investigated in 1963, also for forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">Upon making the arrest, Woodham advised appellant that he had a right to remain silent, that anything he said could later be used against him, and that he had a right to counsel. Appellant indicated he was well aware of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">Shortly thereafter appellant was taken to appear before a United States commissioner. While waiting in the anteroom of the commissioner\u2019s courtroom prior to the hearing, he was served with a warrant based on Woodham\u2019s complaint. After again being advised by Woodham as explained above, appellant stated to the agent that he knew a lot about the forgery and wished to make a complete confession which would involve many people. Woodham did not inquire as to the content of such a statement but instead replied that appellant could come by Woodham\u2019s office after the hearing if he wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">In the hearing appellant was properly advised of the charge against him, his right to counsel, and his right to a preliminary hearing. Afterwards he was released on a personal recognizance bond. He proceeded, apparently directly, to Woodham\u2019s office. After once more being advised of his right to counsel and to remain silent, appellant confessed. At trial Woodham was permitted to testify, over objection, to the substance of the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">The principal ground urged for reversal is that appellant\u2019s arrest was illegal, because it was made without either a warrant or probable cause, and that this illegality tainted the confession so as to render it inadmissible. We do not pass upon the legality of the arrest, for assuming, without deciding, that the arrest was unlawful, we hold that under the facts of this case any taint arising from the arrest had dissipated before the confession was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), is the leading ease on the question whether, where evidence is obtained following an illegal arrest, intervening circumstances have occurred which sufficiently remove the taint, attributable to the arrest, from the evidence so as to permit its introduction at trial. This Court has construed <em>Wong Sun </em>in Rogers v. United States, 330 F.2d 535 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 916, 85 S.Ct. 265, 13 L.Ed. 2d 186 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">\u201cThe arrests in Wong Sun were found to be without probable cause. A statement made by defendant Blackie Toy contemporaneous with the arrest which followed a forced entry into the Toy residence was found to be so intimately bound up with the conditions and circumstances of the arrest as not to be an act of a wholly free will. The contention that Toy\u2019s statement was freely given was said to take</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJe\">\u2018insufficient account of the <em>circumstances. </em>Six or seven officers had broken the door and followed on Toy\u2019s heels into the bedroom where his wife and child were sleeping. He had been almost immediately handcuffed and arrested. <em>Under such </em>[oppressive] <em>circumstances </em>it is unreasonable to infer that Toy\u2019s response was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.\u2019 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416, 9 L.Ed.2d 441. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">On the other hand, Wong Sun following his illegal arrest was released on his own recognizance. He returned to the police a few days later to make a statement the admissibility of which was being contested. The connection between the arrest and the evidence \u2018had become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint. Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307.\u2019 371 U.S. at 491, 83 S.Ct. at 419, 9 L.Ed.2d 441.\u201d 330 F.2d 540-541.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">This Court said further that the Supreme Court had indicated in <em>Wong Sun </em>\u201cthe necessity for the intervention of a clear act of free will on the part of the defendant in order to purge the evidence of its stigma.\u201d 330 F.2d 541. In holding that there was a sufficient evidence of freedom of mind to support a conclusion that any illegality involved in Rogers\u2019 arrest could not have infected his later statements, we took into account several factors: the lack of \u201coppressive circumstances\u201d, of which <em>Wong Sun </em>speaks,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> surrounding the arrest of the defendant; a three hour delay between arrest and statement; a noncontinuous interrogation; and the defendant\u2019s intervening refusal to confess. 330 F.2d 542. We think that the- evidence of freedom of mind is clearer here than in <em>Rogers. </em>The appellant likewise was not arrested under oppressive circumstances; he was not interrogated; and the delay between arrest and confession was approximately the same as in <em>Rogers. </em>But in addition, prior to confessing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant had a hearing before a commissioner who advised him of his right to counsel, and significantly was released on his own personal recognizance, as was Wong Sun. It was thereafter that appellant went to Woodham\u2019s office to confess. We conclude that under these circumstances appellant\u2019s confession was an act of free will and untainted by the arrest. See Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ex rel. Craig v. Maroney, 348 F.2d 22, 29-30 (3d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1019, 86 S.Ct. 1966, 16 L.Ed.2d 1042 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Because appellant\u2019s confession was admissible even assuming he was arrested unlawfully, there was no error in denying the motion to suppress. The judgment accordingly is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. See 371 U.S. at 486, n. 12, 83 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. The statements made to Woodham prior to the hearing merely indicated that appellant desired to confess, but the details of the confession were not revealed until after the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
