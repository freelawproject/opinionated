Plaintiff is a citizen of Nebraska. Defendant is incorporated in Iowa. The jurisdictional amount is present. Plaintiff alleged defendant\u2019s principal place of business is in a state other than Nebraska. Defendant in its motion to dismiss asserts its \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d as such term is used in 28 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(c) is in Nebraska. Evidence was introduced in the form of affidavits and answers to interrogatories. The dispositive issue is whether the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s principal place of business is in Nebraska is clearly erroneous. See Janzen v. Goos, 8 Cir., 302 F.2d 421, 423, 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">We hold that the judgment is entitled to be affirmed on the basis of the trial court\u2019s opinion reported at D.C., 258 F.Supp. 500. The pertinent facts are fairly set out in Judge Robinson\u2019s well reasoned opinion. The proper legal standards are stated and when such principles are applied to the established facts, substantial evidentiary support exists for the determination that Nebraska is defendant\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-23\">Plaintiff makes the additional contention, not considered in the trial court\u2019s opinion, that defendant is estopped from denying jurisdiction. We have held that jurisdiction cannot be established by consent of the parties or by waiver. Pacific Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Transport Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 341 F.2d 514, 516; Rock Island Millwork Co. v. Hedges-Gough Lbr. Co., 8 Cir., 337 F.2d 24, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">It is equally well established that jurisdiction cannot be acquired by estoppel. Poole v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., 5 Cir., 273 F.2d 423; Silvers v. Maryland Cas. Co., 3 Cir., 239 F.2d 865, 868; In Re Federal Facilities Realty Trust, 7 Cir., 227 F.2d 651, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">Since it is clear that jurisdiction cannot be established by estoppel, no purpose will be served in determining whether the record here would support an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">The order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
