In Wright v. Minnesota Mut. Life Ins. Co., 195 F.Supp. 524, 525-526 (1961), affirmed 312 F.2d 655 (8th Cir. 1963), the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota construed the same policy as the trial court in this case construed it. \u201cThe district court\u2019s considered view as to the law of the state in which it sits is entitled to great weight, and will be accepted on review unless shown to be clearly wrong.\u201d Bellon v. Heinzig, 347 F.2d 4, 6 n. 3 (9th Cir. 1965). Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the view of Minnesota law stated by the District Court of the District of Minnesota was \u201cclearly wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">Appellant also challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that appellee was unable to fit himself for any occupation which would allow him to earn an income rising to the dignity of a livelihood. Taking the record as a whole we cannot say this finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
