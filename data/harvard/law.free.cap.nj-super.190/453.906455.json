DeLaney, Jr. (DeLaney), guardian <em>ad litem </em>of Claire C. Conroy (Conroy), appeals from a judgment of the Chancery Division entered following a plenary trial, which declared that Thomas C. Whittemore (Whittemore) as guardian of Claire C. Conroy had \u201cthe right to cause the removal of the nasogastric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tube presently inserted in Claire C. Conroy.\u201d <em>In re Conroy, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 532 (Ch.Div.1983). Conroy at the time the order was entered was 84 years old and suffered from severe organic brain syndrome and a myriad of other physical problems. Unable to swallow sufficient amounts of food and water for her own sustenance, she was being nourished through a nasogastric feeding tube. The judgment under review was stayed by this court pending appeal; Conroy died of natural causes while the appeal was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not in substantial dispute. From her teens until her retirement at age 62 or 63, Conroy was employed by a cosmetics company. She never married, but was devoted to her three sisters and her several cats. The last of her sisters died in 1975, leaving her nephew Whittemore as her only living relative. According to Whitte-more, Conroy began to show signs of confusion some time before 1979. In 1979 he petitioned for and was granted guardianship of Conroy, whom he then placed in the Parklane Nursing Home (Parklane). According to Dr. Ahmed Kazemi, Conroy\u2019s physician at Parklane, Conroy was ambulatory upon her admission but was somewhat confused as the result of organic brain syndrome.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the passage of time, this condition became progressively more severe and her ability to walk, reason and feed herself deteriorated. In 1982 she developed necrotic ulcers on her left foot as a complication of diabetes. At this time, she was unable to maintain a conversation because of her extreme confusion, but was aware of and could respond to commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On July 23, 1982, after observing that Conroy was not eating, Dr. Kazemi placed her on a nasogastric tube, which is a simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>flexible plastic tube that is run through the patient\u2019s nose into the stomach and through which liquid nutrients are passed. Except for a two-week period in October and November 1982, during which time she was fed pureed food but with poor results, this tube remained in place until her death. Conroy was unable to swallow sufficient quantities of food and water to live without the help of the nasogastric tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Dr. Kazemi further testified at trial that Conroy was not brain dead,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> not comatose, and not in a chronic vegetative state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Bernard Davidoff, who testified for the guardian ad <em>litem </em>DeLaney, described Conroy\u2019s mental state as \u201cseverely demented.\u201d Severe contractions of her lower legs kept her in a semi-fetal position. Although Conroy did not respond to verbal stimuli, she followed movements with her eyes, used her hands to scratch herself, and was able to move her head, neck, arms and hands voluntarily. Catherine Rittel, an administrator-nurse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>at Parklane, testified that Conroy smiled when she was massaged or her hair was combed and moaned when she was fed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Neither physician could determine whether Conroy could feel pain. They speculated that although her gangrene and ulcers did not seem to be a source of pain, the leg contractions probably were. According to the physicians\u2019 testimony, if the nasogastric tube were to have been removed, Conroy would have died of dehydration and starvation in about a week. Dr. Kazemi described this as a painful death. Moreover, the trial judge recognized that \u201cthe removal of the tube will lead to suffering and death,\u201d and ordered the guardian and health care personnel \u201cto take reasonable steps to minimize [Conroy\u2019s] discomfort . . . during her passage from life.\u201d 188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The physicians agreed there was no chance of an improvement in Conroy\u2019s mental condition. Dr. Davidoff observed, however, that none of Conroy\u2019s medical conditions was fatal and therefore that it could not be predicted when or from what cause Conroy would die.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">THE ISSUE OF MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">We first address the guardian <em>ad </em>litem\u2019s contention (withdrawn at oral argument) that this appeal should be dismissed because it has become moot. It is true, of course, that Conroy\u2019s death has rendered the issues that underlie this appeal moot. There no longer is a threat that the State will compel the continued treatment of Conroy against the exercise of her right to privacy or that the nasogastric tube will be removed contrary either to her best interests or to the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life. Therefore, the conflict between the parties has become merely hypothetical. Nevertheless, we conclude that the importance of the issues presented by this appeal requires their resolution notwithstanding their mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Although New Jersey\u2019s courts are not bound by the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement that <em>U.S. Const., </em>Art. III, \u00a7 2 imposes on federal courts, <em>see Salorio v. Glaser, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>482, 490-491 appeal dismissed and <em>cert. </em>den. 449 <em>U.S. </em>804, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>49, 66 L.Ed.2d 7 (1980); <em>Crescent Pk. Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Realty Eq. Corp. of N.Y., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>98,107-108 (1971), our courts ordinarily will refuse to review questions that have become academic prior to judicial scrutiny out of reluctance to render a legal decision in the abstract and a desire to conserve judicial resources. <em>See, e.g., Oxfeld v. New Jersey State Board of Education, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>301, 303-304 (1975); <em>Sente v. Clifton, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>204, 205 (1974); <em>Handabaka v. Division of Consumer Affairs, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 14 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Nevertheless, our courts will decide a moot case that presents issues of great public importance or is based upon a controversy capable of repetition, yet evading review because of the short duration of any single plaintiff\u2019s interest. <em>See e.g., Guttenberg Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>617, 622-623 (1981); <em>Dunellen Educ.

This appeal offers an opportunity to provide guidance to family members, guardians, physicians and hospitals, the need for which extends far beyond the facts of this case. Moreover, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>is the type of case that is capable of repetition, yet which evades review because the patients involved often die during the course of litigation. <em>Cf. Roe v. Wade, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>113, 125, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>705, 712-13, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). For these reasons, courts have consistently agreed to decide the rights of terminally ill patients to refuse life-sustaining treatment even after the patients have died or recovered. <em>See John F. Kennedy Mem. Hosp. v. Heston, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 579; <em>State </em>v. <em>Perricone, supra, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 469; <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 <em>Mass. </em>629, 405 N.E.2d 115 (1980); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 <em>Mass. </em>728, 370 N.E.2d 417 (1977); <em>Matter of Storar, </em>52 N.Y.2d 363, 438 N.Y.S.2d 266, 268-69, 420 N.E.2d 64, 66-67 (Ct.App.), <em>cert. </em>den. 454 <em>U.S. </em>858, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>309, 70 L.Ed.2d 153 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">CONROY\u2019S RIGHT TO PRIVACY</p>\n<p id=\"A2u\">We turn, then, to the merits of this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The basic issue before us is whether the judgment here entered represents a legally permissible application of the principles of <em>In re Quinlan, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>10, <em>cert. </em>den. 429 <em>U.S. </em>922, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>319, 50 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 289 (1976). The decision in <em>Quinlan </em>was based upon the patient\u2019s right of privacy which was deemed, under the circumstances there, to outweigh the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life. The question then is whether under the circumstances here there was also a right of privacy which outweighed that paramount state interest and which therefore could justify the withdrawal of life-sustaining nourishment from this patient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>If the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life outweighs the patient\u2019s right of privacy, such withdrawal would be an act of euthanasia, constituting homicide. It is only if the right of privacy could be reasonably deemed to prevail that withdrawal would be legally permissible under the <em>Quinlan </em>doctrine. We reverse the judgment here entered because in our view we regard it as the authorization of euthanasia.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The right to privacy is recognized under the United States Constitution as a \u201cpenumbra\u201d derived from several more specific constitutional guarantees. <em>See Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 <em>U.S. </em>479, 484, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1678, 1681, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>510 (1965). This right is also protected by <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 1. <em>In re Grady, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>235, 249 (1981); <em>State v. Saunders, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>200, 210-217 (1977). The right to privacy is not absolute, however; it must yield to important state interests in areas protected by that right. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>at 155, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 727-28. In <em>In re Quinlan, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey applied the right to privacy balance to a comatose patient\u2019s petition to discontinue extraordinary life-sustaining treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">When the <em>Quinlan </em>case was decided, its subject\u2014Karen Ann Quinlan\u2014was a 22-year-old woman in an irreversible coma, a symptom of severe brain damage caused by prolonged anoxia. Karen was in a \u201cchronic vegetative state,\u201d in which she retained neurological control over her blood pressure, heart rate, chewing, swallowing, sleeping and waking, but lost all more sophisticated brain stem and higher neurological functions. Thus, although she reacted to light, sound and noxious stimuli on a primitive reflex level, she was not consciously aware of her surroundings: she had no cognitive function. No existing medical technique could have been expected to restore her to cognitive or sapient life.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">One of the brain stem functions Karen Quinlan was believed to have lost was the ability to breathe unassisted. Therefore she was connected to a respirator, described by the <em>Quinlan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>court as \u201ca sophisticated machine which delivers a given volume of air at a certain rate and periodically provides a \u2018sigh\u2019 volume, a relatively large measured volume of air designed to purge the lungs of excretions.\u201d 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 25. Karen was fed by nasogas-tric tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Karen\u2019s father, Joseph Quinlan, sought an adjudication that his daughter was incompetent and a declaration that he be her guardian with the power to authorize discontinuance of \u201call extraordinary medical procedures now allegedly sustaining Karen\u2019s vital processes and hence her life.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court reversed the Chancery Division\u2019s judgment and granted the father\u2019s request. The <em>Quinlan </em>court saw the right to privacy as requiring a balancing of the State\u2019s interest in preserving life and the patient\u2019s interest in freedom from the burden of continued treatment. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">The claimed interests of the State in this case are essentially the preservation and sanctity of human life and defense of the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his best judgment. In this case the doctors say that removing Karen from the respirator will conflict with their professional judgment. The plaintiff answers that Karen\u2019s present treatment serves only a maintenance function; that the respirator cannot cure or improve her condition but at best can only prolong her inevitable slow deterioration and death; and that the interests of the patient, as seen by her surrogate, the guardian, must be evaluated by the court as predominant, even in the face of an opinion <em>contra </em>by the present attending physicians. Plaintiff\u2019s distinction is significant. The nature of Karen\u2019s care and the realistic chances of her recovery are quite unlike those of the patients discussed in many of the cases where treatments were ordered. In many of those cases the medical procedure required (usually a transfusion) constituted a minimal bodily invasion and the chances of recovery and return to functioning life were very good. We think that the State\u2019s interest <em>contra </em>weakens and the individual\u2019s right to privacy grows as the degree of bodily invasion increases and the prognosis dims. Ultimately there comes a point at which the individual\u2019s rights overcome the State interest. It is for that reason that we believe Karen\u2019s choice, if she were competent to make it, would be vindicated by the law. Her prognosis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>extremely poor,\u2014she will never resume cognitive life. And the bodily invasion is very great,\u2014she requires 24 hour intensive nursing care, antibiotics, the assistance of a respirator, a catheter and feeding tube. [70 <em>N.J. </em>at 40-41.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">A similar legal analysis has been employed by other jurisdictions in this type of case. <em>See In re Severns, </em>425 A.2d 156, 158-159 (Del.Ch.1980); <em>Satz v. </em>Perlmutter, 362 <em>So.2d </em>160, 162-163 (Fla.App.1978), aff\u2019d o.b. 379 So.2d 359 (Fla.Sup.Ct.1980); <em>Matter of Spring, supra, </em>380 Mass at 639-42, 405 N.E.2d at 122-123; <em>Superintendent of Belchertown v. Saikewicz, supra, </em>373 <em>Mass, </em>at 740-45, 370 N.E.2d at 425-427; <em>Leach v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., </em>68 <em>Ohio Misc. </em>1, 426 N.E.2d 809, 814-815 (Ct. Common Pleas 1980); <em>Matter of Welfare of Colyer, </em>99 Wash.2d 114, 660 P.2d 738, 741-744 (1983). The New York Court of Appeals, though it based its decision on nonconstitutional grounds, has adopted a similar balance of interests standard in resolving this type of case. <em>Matter of Storar, </em>52 <em>N.</em>Y.2d 363, 438 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>266, 275-276, 420 N.E.2d 64, 73-74, <em>cert. </em>den. 454 <em>U.S. </em>858, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>309, 70 L.Ed.2d 153 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Application of the <em>Quinlan </em>right to privacy standard requries an examination of the relative interests of the State and the patient in the continuation or withdrawal of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\n<em>The Patient\u2019s Prognosis as Determining the State\u2019s Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The State\u2019s interest in preserving a patient\u2019s life is small with regard to the hopelessly ill or irreversibly comatose patient, but great with regard to the patient whose condition will substantially improve as the result of continued treatment. This distinction is borne our by the case law. In <em>John F. Kennedy Mem. Hosp. v. Heston, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 581-585, our Supreme Court ordered blood transfusions for a young woman who required surgery to save her life, despite her mother\u2019s objections on religious grounds. The court emphasized the State\u2019s interest in preserving the life of a patient who, if treated, may enjoy long life and good health:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Appellant suggests there is a difference between passively submitting to death and actively seeking it. The distinction may be merely verbal, as it would be if an adult sought death by starvation instead of a drug. If the State may interrupt one mode of self-destruction, it may with equal authority interfere with the other. It is arguably different when an individual, overtaken by illness, decides to let it run a fatal course. But unless the medical option itself is laden with the risk of death or of serious infirmity, the State\u2019s interest in sustaining life in such circumstances is hardly distinguishable from its interest in the case of suicide. [58 <em>N.J. </em>at 581-582.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em>See also Raleigh Fitkin-Paul Morgan Mem. Hosp. v. Anderson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>421, 423, <em>cert. </em>den. 377 <em>U.S. </em>985, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1894,12 L.Ed.2d 1032 (1964); <em>State v. Perricone, supra, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>at 475-477.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">This distinction has been recognized by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. In <em>Superintendent of Belchertown v. Saikewicz, supra, </em>that court granted an application to discontinue chemotherapy in the case of a 67-year-old man suffering from terminal and incurable leukemia. However, the opposite result was reached in <em>Commissioner of Correction v. Myers, </em>379 <em>Mass. </em>255, 399 N.E.2d 452 (1979). The patient in that case was a 24-year-old prisoner who suffered from a chronic kidney condition. Dialysis would have allowed him to lead a relatively normal and healthy life; without the dialysis, he would have died within ten to fifteen days. The court found that the balance of interests tipped toward the State. It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVT\">In contrast, the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life is directly implicated here. Characterized as \u201cthe most significant of the asserted State interests,\u201d <em>id. </em>[373 Mass.] at [741], 370 N.E.2d at 425, this particular concern was outweighed in <em>Saikewicz </em>by the crucial fact that the patient\u2019s leukemia was incurable and would soon cause death regardless of any medical treatment. As we observed, \u201c[t]here is a substantial distinction in the State\u2019s insistence that human life be saved where the affliction is curable, as opposed to the State interest where . . . the issue is not whether, but when, for how long, and at what cost to the individual that life may be briefly extended.\u201d <em>id. </em>at [742], 370 N.E.2d at 425-426.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">Myers\u2019 prognosis contrasts sharply with that of Saikewicz. Although Myers\u2019 kidney disease prior to the transplant could be technically classified as \u201cincurable,\u201d it clearly was not life-threatening in the sense that his \u201clife [would] soon, and inevitably, be extinguished\u201d regardless of the treatment he received. <em>Id. </em>at [742], 370 N.E.2d at 425. On the contrary, continued dialysis and medication permitted Myers to live an otherwise normal and healthy life, and following the kidney transplant, daily medication presently provides the possibility of complete cure. Therefore, compelling Myers to take his medication, cr, in the regrettable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>event that his body rejects the transplanted kidney, compelling him to submit to dialysis does not involve a situation where \u201cheavy physical and emotional burdens\u201d would be imposed \u201cto effect a brief and uncertain delay in the natural process of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at [744], 370 N.E.2d at 427. Consequently, the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life is \u201cquite strong\u201d in this instance. See <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>[375] <em>Mass. </em>[733], [755] n. 12, 379 N.E.2d 1053 (1978). [399 N.E.2d at 456,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">By contrast, courts have been far more ready to allow an irreversibly comatose or incurably terminally ill person to refuse treatment. <em>See, e.g., In re Severns, supra </em>(comatose chronic vegetative patient); <em>Satz v. Perlmutter, supra </em>(patient suffering from incurable terminal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); <em>Matter of Spring, supra </em>(comatose chronic vegetative patient); <em>Leach v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., supra </em>(semi-comatose, vegetative patient suffering from terminal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); <em>Matter of Welfare of Colyer, supra </em>(comatose chronic vegetative patient). <em>See also In re Quackenbush, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 288-290 (Cty.Ct.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We conclude that Conroy\u2019s prognosis supports a significantly greater state interest in continued treatment than in the cases cited above. At the time of trial, Conroy was unable to move from a fetal position and had a severely limited ability to respond to her surroundings. However, she was not in a chronic vegetative state; she was simply very confused. Dr. Kazemi testified that because Conroy was aware of some external stimuli and responded to them, she was neither vegetative nor comatose. This testimony draws a very different picture from that drawn in the <em>Quinlan </em>case. It seems to describe a woman who, like an infant less than a year old, experienced and responded to her surroundings but lacked the intellectual capacity to understand most of them. By comparison, Karen Quinlan was unaware of her environment and had only the most reflexive reactions to outside stimuli:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">The further medical consensus was that Karen in addition to being comatose is in a chronic and persistent \u201cvegetative\u201d state, having no awareness of anything or anyone around her and existing at a primitive reflex level. Although she does have some brain stem function (ineffective for respiration) and has other reactions one normally associates with being alive, such as moving, reacting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>light, sound and noxious stimuli, blinking her eyes, and the like, the quality of her feeling impulses is unknown. She grimaces, makes sterotyped cries and sounds and has chewing motions. Her blood pressure is normal. [70 <em>N.J. </em>at 25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The distinction between an \u201cawake\u201d but confused patient like Conroy and an \u201casleep,\u201d vegetative patient like Karen Quinlan is material and is determinative in this case. The <em>Quinlan </em>court held that the State\u2019s interest in preserving a patient\u2019s life depends on whether the patient ever will return to cognitive, sapient life. 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 41. Thus, it is plain that <em>Quinlan </em>applies only to noncognitive, vegetative patients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Quinlan </em>court evidently was of the opinion that the State\u2019s interest in preserving life outweighs the patient\u2019s right to privacy when the patient retains the capacity to relate to the outside world. In the present case, Conroy was sapient, but lacked the intellectual capacity to understand what she observed. Under the principles of the <em>Quinlan </em>case, the State had a substantial and overriding interest in preserving her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We are also troubled by the trial judge\u2019s framing of the issue as whether the patient will return \u201cto some meaningful level of intellectual functioning.\u201d Put simply, to allow a physician or family member to discontinue life-sustaining treatment to a person solely because that person\u2019s lack of intellectual capacity precludes him from enjoying a meaningful quality of life would establish a dangerous precedent that logically could be extended far beyond the facts of the case now before us. In our view, the right to terminate life-sustaining treatment based on a guardian\u2019s substituted judgment should be limited to incurable and terminally ill patients who are brain dead, irreversibly comatose or vegetative and who would gain no medical benefit from continued treatment. <em>A fortiori, </em>there can be no justification for withholding nourishment, which is really not \u201ctreatment\u201d at all (see \u00a7 IIB below), from a patient who does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>meet these criteria. Any further extension of the <em>Quinlan </em>rule would place into the hands of physicians, family members and judges the determination of whose quality of life is so slight that he should not be kept alive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>The Nature of Treatment as Defining the Patient\u2019s Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASk\">\u201c[T]he individual\u2019s right to privacy grows as the degree of bodily invasion increases.\u201d <em>In re Quinlan, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 41. In our view, \u201cbodily invasion\u201d means not only the degree of physical discomfort, incapacitation or debilitation a given treatment will cause a patient, but also the feelings of helplessness, dependence and loss of dignity the treatment will engender. Thus, the patient\u2019s interest in privacy is greater when his medical condition requires 24-hour care, dependence on machines to carry on bodily functions, or regular exposure and handling of his body. See <em>ibid. </em>The courts seem to have accepted this rule, in that they have been far more willing to allow patients to refuse complex, highly intrusive treatments like respirators <em>(In re Severns, supra; In re Quinlan, supra; Leach </em>v. <em>Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., supra; Matter of Colyer, </em>supra), hemodialysis <em>(In re Spring, supra), </em>chemotherapy <em>(Superintendent of Belchertown v. Saikewicz, supra) </em>or amputation <em>(In re Quackenbush, supra) </em>than to refuse a simple and routine treatment like a blood transfusion (see <em>John F. Kennedy Mem. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Heston, supra; State v. Perricone, supra). </em>As the court explained in <em>In re Quackenbush,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The <em>Quinlan </em>decision distinguished <em>Heston, </em>noting that a blood transfusion is a minimal bodily invasion and that the woman had a potential for vibrant health and long life. That distinction is viable in this case. Mr. Quackenbush is confronted with a significant bodily invasion and does not have the long life and vibrant health potential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">The extent of the bodily invasion required to overcome the State\u2019s interest is not defined in <em>Quinlan. </em>Further, there is a suggestion of a need for a combination of significant bodily invasion and a dim prognosis before the individual\u2019s right of privacy overcomes the State\u2019s interest in preservation of life. Under the circumstances of this case, I hold that the extensive bodily invasion involved here\u2014the amputation of both legs above the knee and possibly the amputation of both legs entirely\u2014is sufficient to make the State\u2019s interest in the preservation of life give way to Robert Quackenbush\u2019s right of privacy to decide his own future regardless of the absence of a dim prognosis. [156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 288-289.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In this light, the treatment given to Conroy differs significantly from that given Karen Quinlan. The bodily invasion necessary to treat Karen Quinlan was \u201cvery great.\u201d 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 41. It included 24-hour intensive nursing care, antibiotics and the assistance of a respirator, a catheter and a feeding tube. As a result, her personal dignity was taken from her and she was placed in a position of helplessness and dependence. In contrast, Conroy was in the less restrictive environment of a nursing home, was not subject to intensive nursing care, and had none of her bodily functions replaced by a machine. The nasogastric tube was no more than a simple device which was part of Conroy\u2019s routine nursing care. It was not really \u201cmedical treatment\u201d at all. In truth, Conroy was little different from the many other ill, senile or mentally disabled persons who are bedridden and cared for in nursing homes. Consequently, the bodily invasion she suffered as the result of her treatment was small, and should not be held to outweigh the State\u2019s interest in preserving her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">No reported case has considered whether an artificial means of feeding may be withdrawn from an irreversibly ill or comatose patient. However, similar considerations were before the New York Court of Appeals in <em>In re Storar, supra, </em>438 N.Y.S.2d at 275-276, 420 N.E.2d at 73-74. The patient in that case was a 52-year-old profoundly retarded man who was diagnosed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>having terminal and incurable cancer of the bladder. Storar would die within six months. To maintain his health until then, he required blood transfusions every eight to fifteen days. Storar disliked the transfusions and was frightened by them and the blood in his urine they caused. Without them, he would die within weeks. The trial judge denied the hospital\u2019s petition to continue the transfusions over the patient\u2019s mother\u2019s objections. The Court of Appeals reversed, in language highly relevant to the present appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">In the <em>Storar </em>ease there is the additional complication of two threats to his life. There was cancer of the bladder which was incurable and would in all probability claim his life. There was also the related loss of blood which posed the risk of an earlier death, but which, at least at the time of the hearing, could be replaced by transfusions. Thus, as one of the experts noted, the transfusions were analogous to food\u2014they would not cure the cancer, but they could eliminate the risk of death from another treatable cause. Of course, John Storar did not like them, as might be expected of one with an infant\u2019s mentality. But the evidence convincingly shows that the transfusions did not involve excessive pain and that without them his mental and physical abilities would not be maintained at the usual level. With the transfusions on the other hand, he was essentially the same as he was before except of course he had a fatal illness which would ultimately claim his life. Thus, on the record, we have concluded that the application for permission to continue the transfusions should have been granted. Although we understand and respect his mother\u2019s despair, as we respect the beliefs of those who oppose transfusions on religious grounds, a court should not in the circumstances of this case allow an incompetent patient to bleed to death because someone, even someone as close as a parent or sibling, feels that this is best for one with an incurable disease. [438 N.Y.S.2d at 275-276, 420 N.E.2d at 73-74.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The same reasoning applies to the withdrawal of <em>food </em>and water from a patient. Nourishment does not itself cure disease. Neither is it an artificial life-sustaining device. Rather it is a basic necessity of life whose withdrawal causes death and whose provision permits life to continue until the patient dies of his illness or injury. Whether nourishment may <em>ever </em>be withdrawn from a patient whose medical condition is unlikely to improve is not the issue here. We hold only that when nutrition will continue the life of a patient who is not comatose, brain dead or vegetative, and whose death is not irreversibly immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>nent, its discontinuance cannot be permitted on the theory of the patient\u2019s right to privacy or, indeed, on any other basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">THE ETHICAL QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">While we are satisfied that the proper balance between the preservation of life and the patient\u2019s right to privacy requires the result we have here reached, we are also persuaded that this result is dictated by ethical concerns as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The ethical question implicit in the decision whether to discontinue life-sustaining measures has traditionally been expressed by the distinction between \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d treatment. The standard definition of these terms is given as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">Ordinary means are all medicines, treatments, and operations which offer a reasonable hope of benefit and which can be obtained and used without excessive expense, pain, or other inconvenience. Extraordinary means are all medicines, treatments, and operations which cannot be obtained or used without excessive expense, pain, or other inconvenience, or if used, would not offer a reasonable hope of benefit. [G. <em>Kelly, Medico-Moral Problems </em>129 (1958).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">An alternative formulation is proposed in Lewis, \u201cMachine Medicine and its Relation to the Fatally Ill,\u201d 206 <em>J.A.M.A. </em>387, 390 (1968), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">Ordinary measures of patient care are recognized as elements of essential care. They represent obligatory, proven, and justified therapies and procedures. . . . They further represent measures which [the patient] can reasonably undergo with only minimal or moderate danger and maximal effectiveness. Such measures are also not an impossible or excessive burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-12\">Extraordinary measures . . . are complicated methods. They are impossible for the patient to use or apply by himself and present a costly and difficult burden.... [T]hey represent a high level of danger, and the results expected are not predictable, i.e., the effectiveness is minimal or moderate while the dangers are maximal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Thus, the definition of \u201cextraordinary treatment\u201d is fluid, and depends on both the nature of the treatment and the patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>prognosis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court said in <em>Quinlan,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\"><em>. . . </em>[o]ne would have to think that the use of the same respirator or like support could be considered \u201cordinary\u201d in the context of the possibly curable patient but \u201cextraordinary\u201d in the context of the forcpd sustaining by cardio-respiratory processes of an irreversibly doomed patient. [70 <em>N.J. </em>at 48.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">There is substantial disagreement' among ethicists whether the provision of food and water should ever be considered extraordinary treatment. It is in fact recognized that the terms \u201cextraordinary treatment\u201d and \u201cordinary treatment\u201d elude certain definition. To some, the natural and ordinary quality of feeding dictates that it should never be withdrawn. <em>See Healy, Medical Ethics </em>61-77 (1960); <em>McFadden, Medical Ethics </em>227-247 (1961); <em>O\u2019Donnell, Morals in Medicine </em>57, 66-68 (1959). A code of treatment for severely ill children, drafted by the Nassau (N.Y.) Pediatric Society Committee on Ethics and Survival, provides that \u201cordinary measures are food, fluids, oxygen, antibiotics and pain killers.\u201d Waldman, \u201cMedical Ethics and the Hopelessly 111 Child,\u201d 88 <em>J.Ped. </em>890, 892 (1976). This position recently was summed up by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop as follows: \u201cWithholding fluids or nourishment at any time is an immoral act.\u201d <em>Time, </em>April 11, 1983, at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Nevertheless, several scholars are of the opinion that if the patient is beyond all hope of recovery, the burden of continued feeding is disproportionate to the benefit it will effect. <em>See Wilson, Death by Decision </em>70-71 (1975); Ramsey, \u201cProlonged Dying: Not Medically Indicated,\u201d 6 <em>Hastings Ctr. </em>Rep.__14 (1976). The American Medical Association Judicial Council, in Opinion 2.11 (Jan. 10, 1981), reprinted at 45 <em>Conn.Med. </em>721 (1981), concludes that when a patient is irreversibly comatose or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>in a permanent vegetative state, <em>\u201call </em>means of life support may be discontinued.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similar is this passage from the report of the President\u2019s Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Most patients with permanent unconsciousness cannot be sustained for long without an array of increasingly artificial feeding interventions\u2014nasogastric tubes, gastrotomy tubes, or intravenous nutrition. Since unconscious patients are not aware of nutrition, the only benefit of such increasingly burdensome interventions is the remote possibility of recovery. The sensitivities of the family and the care-giving professionals ought to determine whether such steps are undertaken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The present appeal is not the proper vehicle by which to resolve this issue, and we expressly decline to do so. Even those ethicists who advocate the withdrawal of nourishment do so only when nourishment would offer no benefit to the patient, as when the patient is irreversibly comatose or permanently vegetative. In the words of <em>Ramsey, supra, </em>6 <em>Hastings Ctr. Rep. </em>at 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">I suggest that in a proper understanding of [the terms \u201cordinary means\u201d and \u201cextraordinary means\u201d] (which are objectively relative to the patient\u2019s condition) the IV is as aimless as the respirator. It, too, is only prolonging Karen\u2019s dying. Surely it is not hunger that Karen feels now. To be on the safe side, perhaps we should say that she might experience dehydration. That is now the purpose of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>glucose drip: to give the comfort of a cup of cool water to a patient who has entered upon her own particular dying. If a glucose drip prolongs this patient\u2019s dying, it is not given for that purpose, or as means in a continuing useless effort to save her life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">If, as here, the patient is not comatose and does not face imminent and inevitable death, nourishment accomplishes the substantial benefit of sustaining life until the illness takes its natural course. Under such circumstances nourishment always will be an essential element of ordinary care which physicians are ethically obligated to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">There are involved here, moreover, ethical considerations which far transcend the ordinary-extraordinary dichotomy and its implications. In <em>Quinlan </em>the court reaffirmed the concept of the nondelegable judicial responsibility to determine issues involving the underlying and competing human values and rights here implicated. It also acknowledged that these determinations \u201cmust, in the ultimate, be responsive not only to the concepts of medicine but also to the common moral judgment of the community at large.\u201d 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 44. Thus, <em>Quinlan </em>made clear that when the medical issue is no longer \u201ccuring the ill but contorting and easing the dying\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 47), the medical judgment is entitled to deference by the courts and society only in those cases in which, because of the condition of the patient and the nature of the life support system, the issue of sustaining life is not readily amenable to judicial resolution but is a matter for medical consensus based upon prevailing standards of practice and ethics. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48. <em>Quinlan, </em>involving an irreversibly comatose patient sustained by sophisticated and complex devices, presented just such a situation. This case does not. In our view, withdrawal of a nasogastric tube from a noncomatose patient not facing imminent death is not a method of \u201ccomforting and easing the dying\u201d which either the courts or society can tolerate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">We are further convinced that the withdrawal of the feeding tube here would also violate medical ethics. It is clear that the physician\u2019s primary obligation is <em>primum non nocere: </em>First do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>no harm. The Hippocratic Oath provides in part: \u201cI will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 74 (1980). As an extension of these maxims, medical ethicists have long distinguished between killing and letting die. Hyland and Baime frame the distinction as one between euthanasia (\u201cthe deliberate easing into death of a patient suffering from a painful and fatal disease\u201d) and antidysthanasia (\u201cthe failure to take positive action to prolong the life of an incurable patient\u201d). Hyland &amp; Baime, <em>\u201cIn re Quinlan: </em>A Synthesis of Law and Medical Technology,\u201d 8 <em>Rut.-Cam.L.J. </em>37, 52 (1976). While the latter has gained acceptance in the medical community, the former always has been considered unethical. <em>See </em>Kary, \u201cA Moral Distinction Between Killing and Letting Die,\u201d 5 <em>J. Med. &amp; Phil. </em>326 (1980); Dinello, \u201cOn Killing and Letting Die,\u201d 31 <em>Analysis </em>83 (1971); <em>but see </em>Bennett, \u201cWhatever the Consequences,\u201d 26 <em>Analysis </em>83 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Thus, the American Medical Association Judicial Council has recommended that the following standard be adopted by courts and legislatures faced with issues of euthanasia or terminal illness:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The intentional termination of the life of one human being by another\u2014mercy killing or euthanasia\u2014is contrary to public policy, medical tradition, and the most fundamental measures of human value and worth. <em>[Judicial Council, American Medical Association, Opinions and Reports </em>para. 5.17 (1979).]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Similarly, the Judicial Council\u2019s Opinion 2.11, quoted above, states, \u201cFor humane reasons, with informed consent a physician may do what is medically necessary to alleviate severe pain, <em>but he should not intentionally cause death </em>\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The trial judge in the present case in effect authorized euthanasia rather than antidysthanasia. At the time of trial, Conroy, unlike the patients permitted to discontinue treatment in the other reported cases, was neither terminally ill nor critically injured and kept alive only by artificial means. She suffered from no specific life-threatening illness or injury, and she was not, apparently, suffering any pain. Her treatment consisted basically of providing the comforts of routine nursing care. If the trial judge\u2019s order had been enforced, Conroy would not have died as the result of an existing medical condition, but rather she would have died, and painfully so, as the result of a new and independent condition: dehydration and starvation. Thus, she would have been actively killed by independent means rather than allowed to die of existing illness or injury. Instead of easing her passage from life, the result of the judge\u2019s order would have been to inflict new suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Such a result has frightening implications. When a patient, guardian or physician is permitted to decide that a nonterminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>patient\u2019s life is worthless and should be terminated rather than merely to decide that an artificially extended life should be allowed to expire naturally, the decision necessarily involves a judgment of the patient\u2019s quality of life. Such a precedent could be applied with equal force to circumstances much different from and less compelling than those present here. Therefore, we reject the extension of <em>Quinlan </em>to the active euthanasia of a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In sum, the trial judge erred in holding that a non-comatose, non-brain-dead patient not facing imminent death, not maintained by any life-support machine, and not able to speak for herself should be painfully put to death by dehydration and starvation. Accordingly, the judgment so ordering is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cOrganic brain syndrome\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] syndrome resulting from diffuse or local impairment of brain tissue function, manifested by alteration of orientation, memory, comprehension, and judgment.\u201d <em>Dox, Melloni &amp; Eisner, Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>347 (1979).

In determining whether it is in the best interest of a terminally ill incompetent patient to administer potentially life-prolonging medical treatment, the physician should consider what the possibility is for extending life under humane and comfortable conditions and what are the wishes and attitudes of the family or those who have responsibility for the custody of the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">Where a terminally ill patient\u2019s coma is beyond doubt irreversible and there are adequate safeguards to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis, all means of life support may be discontinued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">The Council believes that these guidelines should apply as well, to the care of the patient in a permanent \u201cvegetative\u201d state.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The entire relevant portion of para. 5.17 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">Although the AMA cannot prevent courts or legislatures from considering issues of euthanasia or terminal illness, recent experience indicates that these governmental bodies may not provide the best forums for such discussions. Even so, this cannot stop such discussions from taking place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">Accordingly, if a court or legislature is faced with this issue in the future, the Judicial Council recommends that the following statement be authorized or enacted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">(1) The intentional termination of the life of one human being by another\u2014mercy killing or euthanasia\u2014is contrary to public policy, medical tradition, and the most fundamental measures of human value and worth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(2) The cessation of the employment of extraordinary means to prolong the life of the body when there is irrefutable evidence that biological death is imminent is the decision of the patient and/or his immediate family and/or his lawful representative, acting in the patient\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">(3) The advice and judgment of the physician or physicians involved should be readily available to the patient and/or his immediate family and/or his lawful representative in all such situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">(4) No physician, other licensed health care providers, or hospital should be civilly or criminally liable for taking any action pursuant to these guidelines, nor should there be any criminal or civil penalties of any sort imposed for conduct pursuant to these guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">(5) Except as stated above, all matters not in the public domain relating to a patient\u2019s terminal illness are the private right of the patient and are protected from public scrutiny by the privacy and confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
