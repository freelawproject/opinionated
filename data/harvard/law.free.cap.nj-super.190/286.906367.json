The case is governed by the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 as they existed before this section of the \u201cno fault\u201d law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 <em>et seq., </em>was amended in January 1982 by L.1981, c. 533.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge ruled that, although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 provided basic benefits to the named insured and members of his family residing in the same household, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 provided additional coverage for the named insured only, as defined in the policy. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g), discussed below. Since the policy in question designated the named insured, plaintiff\u2019s father, and his spouse if resident of the same household, as the only persons insured for additional PIP coverage, the trial judge ruled that additional benefits were not available to plaintiff. In doing so the trial judge relied on <em>DeSimone v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376 (Law Div.1977). We now overrule the holding in <em>DeSimone </em>and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident in August 1978. Alleging that he was a resident of his father\u2019s household, plaintiff brought this action for PIP benefits under an insurance policy issued to his father by defendant. Defendant paid plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses but disputed plaintiff\u2019s right to income continuation benefits because of his unemployment status, <em>see Gambino v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>100 (1981), and also disputed plaintiff\u2019s right to additional benefits afforded pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 as it then existed (section 10, L.1972, c. 70). Plaintiff contends that he was covered for section 10 benefits for various reasons. The only contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that merits consideration<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is that section 4 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A- 4) and section 10 should be read <em>in pari materia </em>and, therefore, the additional PIP benefits endorsement provided by defendant conflicted with section 10 by describing a more limited class of persons entitled to additional benefits than intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The problem may be stated simply. Section 4 provides \u201cbasic\u201d benefits (medical expense, income continuation, essential services, survivor and funeral expense) without regard to liability or fault for, among others, \u201cthe named insured and members of his family residing in his household.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g) defines \u201cNamed insured\u201d as \u201cthe person or persons identified as the insured in the policy and, if an individual, his or her spouse.\u201d Before its amendment in 1982, section 10 required insurers to <em>\u201cmake available to the named insured </em>covered under section 4, suitable additional first-party coverage for income continuation benefits, essential service benefits, survivor benefits and funeral expense benefits. Income continuation [benefits] in excess of that provided for in section 4 must be provided ... by insurers <em>to persons </em>for disabilities ... up to an income level of.... \u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>section 10, \u201cshall make available [additional coverage] to the named insured,\u201d meant that the only persons to be covered for additional PIP benefits were those who were defined by the act and regulations adopted thereunder as within the term \u201cnamed insured.\u201d This position was adopted in <em>DeSimone, supra. </em>The court in <em>DeSimone </em>held that \u201cthe terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 restrict the additional coverage to the \u2018named insured covered under section 4.\u2019 \u201d 149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 379. One reason advanced was that the Legislature could easily have used different terms in section 10 if it intended to benefit all \u201cpersons covered in section 4.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The question is whether the Legislature intended by section 10 to restrict benefits to the \u201cnamed insured\u201d or merely intended to require that <em>the option </em>to obtain additional coverage <em>should be given to the named insured, </em>with whom the insurer has dealings, without changing the category of persons intended to be covered for such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">We have this case because the Legislature did not clearly express itself. Our objective is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">To start with we note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g) includes a spouse of the person or persons identified as \u201cthe insured\u201d in the policy, although this definition section does not speak of the spouse\u2019s residence in the same household. (By contrast, the policy in question defines the named insured as the individual named in item 1 of the declarations and also that person\u2019s spouse if a resident of the same household. It further defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as a person or organization described under the policy section entitled \u201cPersons Insured.\u201d) Section 4 mandates benefits for (a) \u201cthe named insured\u201d and members of his family residing in his household who sustain injury in <em>an </em>automobile accident, (b) other persons occupying <em>the </em>automobile of the named insured or using it with his permission, and (c) pedestri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ans injured by the named insured\u2019s automobile. Section 10 requires insurers to make certain additional benefits \u201cavailable to the named insured covered under section 4.\u201d However, in setting limits for income continuation benefits it refers to the persons entitled to those benefits not as the named insured but as \u201cpersons\u201d who become disabled by injuries suffered in the motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In our view the first sentence of section 10 did not intend to limit the additional benefits to the named insured. It required the insurer to make the additional coverage available as an option to the named insured because this is the only person with whom the insurer has dealings. The intent to expand benefits for those persons covered in section 4 is found in the second sentence of section 10 dealing with income continuation benefits in which the beneficiaries were referred to as \u201cpersons\u201d with disabilities. That sentence required insurers to provide an option for income continuation benefits \u201cin excess of that provided for in section 4 ... to persons for disabilities.\u201d By not limiting these additional benefits \u201cto the named insured\u201d who is disabled and by referring to the beneficiaries as <em>persons </em>who are disabled, the Legislature apparently contemplated the same category of covered persons as in section 4. We can discern no good reason why the Legislature would require insurers to make available for purchase additional coverage for the policyholder and his or her spouse without assuring the right to obtain added protection for members of the policyholder\u2019s household as well as guest passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The issue cannot be decided by the terms of the policy furnished by defendant. The \u201cadditional\u201d PIP endorsement designated as \u201ca Person Insured\u201d for additional PIP coverage the \u201cnamed insured and his spouse if a resident of the same household.\u201d (As noted above, this is narrower than the literal definition of named insured in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A -2(g) because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>added residence in the same household as a condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) The insurance policy left a little space so that other persons could be named, but it was unlikely that a layman would know in advance of receiving the endorsement that other names should be added to secure benefits of the same nature afforded to family household members automatically covered by section 4. Nor is it clear why the endorsement left room for naming additional insureds. Perhaps the ambiguity in section 10 was perceived by the policy draftsman and this was the means used to deal with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Nor do we think that the persons to be covered can be determined by regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d). Section 10 authorized the Commissioner to establish by regulation the \u201camounts and terms of income continuation insurance to be provided pursuant to this section.\u201d However, the category of persons covered is a matter of statutory definition and intent. The Commissioner was expressly authorized by section 10 to deal with income continuation benefits, in amounts and terms, but section 10 enlarged other benefits as well. Thus, the last sentence could not have intended that the Commissioner should decide by regulation who would be entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Regulations were adopted dealing with <em>additional </em>PIP benefits. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:3-7.7(a)(3). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.3 was quoted in full in Justice Schrieber\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Muschette </em>v. <em>The Gateway Ins. Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>560, 568 (1978). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.7 contained Appendix A which prescribed the minimum schedule of additional PIP benefits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>must be made available. It contained five options for different levels of benefits. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>ll:3-7.3(d) also required benefits in excess of those in Appendix A to be \u201cmade available at the option of the named insured. . .. \u201d <em>See Muschette v. The Gateway Ins. Co., supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, where the court speaks of additional coverage to be made available to policyholders. This is consistent with our view that the first sentence in section 10 did not restrict the persons to be benefited but simply required insurers to give the policyholder an option to purchase additional benefits. It is in this sense that section 10 required additional coverage to be \u201cmade available to the named insured.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the provision in Notes to Table, following Appendix A, which stated that the above schedules are \u201capplicable to named insured as defined,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> could not limit the categories of beneficiaries within the intended scope of section 10. The statutory intent will prevail over any inconsistent policy provision and regulation, <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 286 (1974), although the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute deserves consideration. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Before the remand to us by the Supreme Court, which we discuss below, the parties furnished us no legislative history on the issue. Our own examination of the public hearings and the N.J. Automobile Insurance Study Commission Report<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> leading to the adoption of the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, the no-fault law, L.1972, c. 70, revealed no explicit statement as to the categories of persons intended to be covered by section 10. The statement appended to 1972 Assembly Bill No. 667, which became L.1972, c. 70, mentioned the basic PIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>benefits and stated: \u201cThe insured may purchase additional coverage if desired.\u201d The <em>Report </em>of the Study Commission<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contained a summary of the Commission\u2019s recommendations. The summary referred to the basic PIP benefits to be provided and made no mention of optional additional benefits. The persons covered were described as the named insured and members of his household, authorized drivers and guest passengers in the insured\u2019s car and pedestrians struck by the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In hearings before the Study Commission, Professor Robert E. Keeton supplemented his testimony with a written statement in which he described guidelines recommended in the United States Department of Transportation Study which allowed insurers to offer additional coverage above basic limits for accident victims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other references to the purchase of additional coverage were made at the Study Commission\u2019s hearings. The availability of \u201cincreased limits (over Basic Protection)\u201d was recommended in a report of the auto study committee of the Independent Mutual Insurance Agents (N.Y., N.J. and Conn.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statement of R.C. Chilcott, Vice President, Family Insurance, Nationwide Insurance Companies, included a proposed plan with basic compulsory coverage and higher limits \u201cfor extended disability income and for survivors\u2019 benefits\u201d to be \u201cmade available for those who desire to purchase it.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No distinction was made as to the class of persons to be covered. In his testimony Chilcott made it clear that the limits on basic benefits were designed to keep costs down, but that additional protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>should be made available at an extra cost.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a report submitted by the South Jersey Claims Men\u2019s Association, \u201cdrastic changes\u201d in the existing system were opposed. Instead, it was recommended that the then available first-party coverage for loss of income to the named insured should be increased in limits, with coverage at a reduced level for an injured and disabled spouse of the named insured.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since this proposal was rejected and was not directed to the issue before us we can infer that this recommendation did not influence the choice of language in section 10. Our conclusion is that the history of this legislation discloses no intention to limit additional coverage under section 10 to the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Mario A. Iavicoli, who was counsel to the Automobile Insurance Study Commission, has criticized the restrictive coverage offered by insurers under section 10, saying the limitation of coverage to the named insured and family members in his household contravenes the intent of the Legislature. Iavicoli, <em>No Fault &amp; Comparative Negligence in New Jersey, </em>\u00a7 5 at 29-30 (1973).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">Insurance carriers have been writing their Additional Personal Injury Protection Endorsement to cover only the named insured and members of his family residing in his household, thereby excluding all other occupants and pedestrians from <em>additional </em>personal injury coverage. Such was not the intent of the legislation, nor does the Act permit the insurance companies to exclude such occupants and pedestrians from the additional coverage. The Act provides that insurers shall make available to the named insured suitable additional personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>injury protection coverage. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10]. The insurance carriers interpret that to mean that they need only insured the named insured and relatives within the household with additional personal injury protection coverage. The Act indicates that the additional coverage shall be made available to the named insured because one cannot realistically compel that such additional first party coverage be made available for purchase to occupants and pedestrians. The \u2018make available\u2019 language mandates the availability of such coverage for voluntary purchase by the named insured; it is not intended to restrict coverage so as to deny occupants and pedestrians such additional coverage. Those categories of people who are to be covered by personal injury protection coverage are clearly specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. The additional personal injury protection coverage language found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 was intended only to compel insurers to make available for purchase additional personal injury protection coverage which would increase the limits of the basic coverage insuring the same categories of people specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. [Ibid]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Iavicoli\u2019s comments reinforce the conclusion we have reached in examining the language of the act, its legislative history and the purpose of the legislation. - This conclusion is consistent with the legislative intent to afford a remedy \u201cto <em>all </em>injured for <em>all </em>of their losses.\u201d <em>Gambino v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 107. The act must be \u201cliberally construed\u201d to effectuate its purposes. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16; <em>Gambino v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., supra, </em>86 <em>N.J.. </em>at 108. As noted in <em>Amiano v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>85, 90 (1981), \u201cPIP coverage should be given the broadest application consistent with the statutory language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The foregoing analysis does not take into account the amendment to section 10 enacted by L.1981, c. 533 on January 12,1982. The pendency of this legislation was not called to our attention when we first considered this appeal, and it was not discovered in our own search for legislative history. However, the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and summarily remanded the case to us for reconsideration in the light of L.1981, e. 533.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The parties submitted supplemental briefs, and new counsel for plaintiff was substituted. Our reconsideration of the matter with the benefit of the amendatory legislation and its legislative history leads us to the same conclusion, namely, that the catego-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>r\u00edes of covered persons contemplated by section 10 in its original form were the same as those designated by section 4 who were entitled to PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The amendatory legislation requires insurers to give the named insured the \u201coption\u201d to obtain additional first party coverage (for income continuation benefits, essential services benefits, death benefits<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and funeral expense benefits) for \u201cresident relatives\u201d in his household as well as himself. The statement attached to the bill, A-1853, noted in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">While section 4 benefits are applicable to the named insured and the members of his family, <em>the statutory language of section 10 is unclear </em>with respect to the applicability of the section 10 benefits to members of the household as well as the named insured.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The effect of L.1981, c. 533 is to make clear that the additional coverage under section 10 applies not only to the named insured but also to relatives in his household at his option. The amendment is consistent with the original legislative intent as we view it, that the expanded coverage provided by section 10 was not limited to the named insured, but included other persons specified by section 4. While the new legislation does not include unrelated occupants of, and pedestrians injured by, the named insured\u2019s automobile, it is consistent with our view that section 10 in its original form intended to benefit other persons as well as the named insured. This interpretation comports with appropriate canons of statutory construction. It reflects the internal sense of the law as we perceive it, considering the nature of the subject matter and pertinent sections viewed <em>in pari materia. See Loboda v. Clark Tp., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>424, 435 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Defendant argues that the amendment makes clear that the class covered in section 10 was always narrower than the section 4 class. We disagree. The new law follows our interpretation that section 10 was intended to require insurance companies to make additional coverage \u201cavailable\u201d as an option and that, since the option could only be offered to the named insured, that term did not describe the class of covered persons. The amendment uses the term \u201cat his option\u201d in relation to coverage for \u201cresident relatives in the household of the named insured.\u201d But the additional coverage to be \u201cmade available\u201d to the named insured himself was always meant to be optional coverage. Now the Legislature seems to have added the right of the named insured to elect to cover himself alone or himself and family members of his household. This is consistent with our view that the Legislature never meant to limit coverage to the named insured alone. On the other hand, excluding from additional coverage pedestrians and occupants of the vehicle other than relatives residing in the named insured\u2019s household does narrow the class and is inconsistent with section 4. Thus, we conclude, the Legislature did more than clarify the law. Section 10 no longer borrows the entire class of beneficiaries from section 4, nor does it limit coverage to named insureds only, as defendant contends section 10 originally intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Defendant insurer points out that additional coverage increases the cost to the insured. This supports our interpretation, since it should be left to the insured to purchase additional insurance if he wants it. The purpose of section 10, then and now, is to compel insurers to make that coverage available. We do not suggest that a policyholder should not have to pay extra for additional coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">But, defendant argues, the Legislature never intended to make additional first-party coverage available for guest occupants and pedestrians because, defendant\u2019s brief says, \u201cit is apparent that a purchaser of a policy would have no interest in obtaining additional benefits for strangers,\u201d but only for \u201cresidents of his household.\u201d This is an untenable argument at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>variance with the legislative scheme. It was answered by the Legislature in section 4 where the class entitled to PIP benefits includes pedestrians injured by the insured vehicle as well as occupants and authorized operators of the named insured\u2019s vehicle. We have no doubt that some policyholders would want additional coverage for friends and relatives who ride in the insured automobile but are not household members. Nor are pedestrians injured by policyholders\u2019 vehicles beyond the likely range of their concern. Unfortunately, the statement attached to A 1853 was misleading. It referred to the class covered by section 4 as the \u201cnamed insured and members of his family\u201d and then explained that the new law was intended to clarify section 10 by making sure that the additional benefits would be extended to the same class. Pedestrians and other occupants of the vehicle were not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, it was not apparent from the statement that some members of the class designated in section 4 would be excluded from optional additional coverage. This may have been an oversight, and we respectfully suggest that the Legislature consider this issue again. In our opinion the original intent of section 10 was to embrace within the scope of additional coverage the entire class of persons covered by section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We recognize that section 10 refers to the additional optional insurance as \u201cfirst party coverage.\u201d Section 11 also refers to section 10 benefits as \u201cfirst party coverage.\u201d This term normally signifies \u201ca promise by the insurance company to pay its own insured ... like collision, comprehensive, medical payments or personal injury protection, and not \u2018third party coverage\u2019 [a promise to its insured to pay some third party] such as personal injury or property damage liability insurance.\u201d <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>285 <em>Md. </em>548, 552, 403 A.2d 1229, 1231-1232 (Ct.App.1979); <em>see Garden State Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 304-305 (App.Div.1980). To the extent that PIP coverage is commonly regarded as first party coverage it has broadened the sense of the term to include the right of occupants of the insured\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>vehicle, injured pedestrians, and resident members of the insured\u2019s household, as well as the named insured, to make a direct claim for payment against the named insured\u2019s carrier, regardless of fault. <em>See Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 449 (App.Div.), certif. den. 88 <em>N.J. </em>489 (1981). Thus, because of the broad meaning given to the term \u201cfirst party coverage\u201d in reference to PIP benefits under the no-fault law, the use of that term in connection with section 10 benefits is not inconsistent with our holding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">This disposition makes it unnecessary to consider other contentions advanced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Section 3 of L.1981, c. 533 provided that the amendment was to apply prospectively to all policies issued, delivered or renewed on or after 90 days from the date on which the Commissioner of Insurance prescribes a form pertaining to the offer of additional coverage.
