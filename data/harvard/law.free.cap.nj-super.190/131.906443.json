We affirm the judgment of the Tax Court substantially for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>reasons stated by Judge Evers in Ms written opinion published at 4 <em>N.J.Tax </em>294 (Tax Ct.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11t the State Treasurer and the spill fund director are authorized to adopt such rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act as they may deem necessary to accomplish their purposes and responsibilities under the Spill Fund Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(a)(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act requires the agency to give 30 days public notice prior to the adoption, amendment or repeal of any rule. Subsection (3) requires the agency to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAj\">Afford all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in writing. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">On January 4, 1982 the Department of Treasury published its proposed regulations governing expenditures under the Act in the New Jersey Register, 14 <em>N.J.R. </em>36, inviting interested parties to submit their comments on or before February 13, 1982. Plaintiffs hand delivered their written comments on February 11, 1982, but the department erroneously determined that they were \u201cuntimely and need not be considered,\u201d and on March 15, 1982 published a Notice of Adoption of the Regulations in the New Jersey Register, 14 <em>N.J.R. </em>285. On March 29, 1982 plaintiffs submitted their written request that the department correct its error by rescinding its regulations and re-proposing them with provision for a \u201cmeaningful comment period.\u201d Their request was denied by letter from the Assistant State Treasurer dated April 7, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The State\u2019s position with respect to this issue is that the omission was only \u201ca technical error which does not justify the invalidation of the regulations.\u201d It points out that although plaintiffs\u2019 comments were treated as untimely received for purposes of entitlement to consideration before adoption of the regulations the Department had nevertheless \u201cbecome familiar\u201d with plaintiffs\u2019 position before proposing the regulations. Relying upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(d), it maintains that the validity of the regulations should be sustained on the basis of its \u201csubstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tial compliance\u201d with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The explanations offered by the State fail to justify its non-compliance with the clearly stated requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. Although its disregard of the Act is not as complete as that considered in <em>Glaser v. Downes, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10 (App.Div.1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>573 (1974), the denial of due process of law resulting to plaintiffs is no less. Substantial compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act cannot be found where the prescribed system of notice and written comments, called \u201cthe mainstay of modern rulemaking procedure,\u201d <em>Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, </em>at 169 (1976), has been sidestepped.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We conclude that the regulations under review adopted by notice published March 15, 1982 are invalid and without force and effect. c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\"> 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 9614(c)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b162-7\">MATTHEWS, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"asc-dedup-0\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">I agree with the conclusion reached by Judge Evers in the Tax Court which we now affirm. I also agree that plaintiffs were denied due process of law in the rule-making process. I am constrained to file this concurring opinion, however, because there appears to be a general assumption in the majority opinion that the Congress could preempt New Jersey\u2019s taxation provision if it so intended. I think that such an assumption is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof .. . shall be the supreme Law of the Land .... [I/.S. <em>Const., </em>Art. VI, cl. 2]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">I question whether a statute passed by Congress which denies to the states the right to tax for the purposes of the Spill Fund is \u201cmade in Pursuance\u201d of the Constitution. A state may not tax imports or exports, federal property, or interstate commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>discriminatorily, or in any fashion that could obstruct a legitimate exercise of Congressional power. Beyond those limitations, the states have broad powers to structure revenue raising taxes as they see fit. As Judge Evers found, \u201cplaintiffs neither raised nor attempted to support any argument that the taxing provisions of spill fund were violative of any other constitutional rights.\u201d 4 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 316. He also noted that \u201cplaintiffs do not suggest that there is an actual conflict between the limited purposes of super fund and the overall policy enunciated by New Jersey in spill fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs do not contest these statements on appeal. Thus, the underlying premise of both plaintiffs\u2019 argument here and of Judge Evers\u2019 opinion is that if Congress implicitly or explicitly intended to preclude the states from taxing for any purpose which is otherwise constitutional it has the power to do so under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The most basic premise of our constitutional form of government is that in the Constitution the sovereign states relinquished certain of their sovereign powers to the federal government for its exclusive exercise. <em>See Goldstein </em>v. <em>California, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>546, 552, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2303, 2307, 37 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>163, reh. den. 414 <em>U.S. </em>883, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>27, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>131 (1973). \u201cBut ... the State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, <em>exclusively </em>delegated to the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>at 552-553, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2308, quoting from Number 32 of <em>The Federalist </em>by Alexander Hamilton (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hamilton went on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to specify the three instances when state sovereignty would be deemed alienated: \u201c... where the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to the Union, and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority, and where it granted an authority to the Union, <em>to </em>which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally <em>contradictory </em>and <em>repugnant.\u201d Id.; </em>emphasis in original.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">As in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>519, 524-525, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1305, 1309, 51 L.Ed.2d 604, reh. den. 431 <em>U.S. </em>925, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2201, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>240 (1977), this case \u201ccontains no claim that the Constitution alone denies [New Jersey] power to enact the challenged provisions.\u201d In fact \u201cthe breadth of concurrent taxing powers of state and nation\u201d have long been recognized. <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 <em>U.S. </em>52, 68, n. 21, 61 <em>S.Ct. </em>399, 404, n. 21, 85 <em>L.Ed. </em>581 (1940), citing No. 32, <em>The Federalist. </em>Over one hundred years ago the Court found \u201cnothing in the Constitution which contemplates or authorizes any direct abridgement of [the concurrent powers to tax] by national legislation.\u201d <em>Lane County v. Oregon, </em>7 <em>Wall. </em>71, 74 <em>U.S. </em>71, 77, 19 <em>L.Ed. </em>101, 105 (1868). \u201cThe extent to which [a State\u2019s power to tax] shall be exercised, the subjects upon which it shall be exercised, and the mode in which it shall be exercised, are all equally within the discretion of the Legislatures to which the States commit the exercise of the power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The only limits to a State\u2019s power to tax outside of those explicitly stated in the Constitution is that a tax \u201cmust not be used as to burden or embarrass the operations of the National Government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The idea that a state has \u201cthe freedom of a sovereign both as to objects and methods\u201d of taxation has been frequently repeated. <em>Shaffer v. Carter, </em>252 <em>U.S. </em>37, 51-52, 40 <em>S.Ct. </em>221, 225, 64 <em>L.Ed. </em>445 (1919), quoting <em>Michigan C.R. Co. v. Powers, </em>201 <em>U.S. </em>245, 292, 26 <em>S.Ct. </em>459, 462, 50 <em>L.Ed. </em>744 (1906). This freedom extends without interference \u201ceven if the effect ... is akin to double taxation . .. since it is settled that nothing in [the Federal Constitution] or in the 14th [sic] Amendment prevents the states from imposing double taxation.\u201d 252 <em>U.S. </em>at 58, 40 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 227. As long as there is \u201csome adequate or reasonable basis\u201d for the taxation classifications double taxation is not forbidden. <em>Swiss Oil Corp. v. Shanks, </em>273 <em>U.S. </em>407, 413, 47 <em>S.Ct. </em>393, 395, 71 <em>L.Ed. </em>709 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Close federal supervision of states\u2019 taxing power would be \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201chostile to the basic principles of our Government .... \u201d <em>Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, </em>358 <em>U.S. </em>522, 527, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>437, 441, 3 L.Ed.2d 480 (1959), quoting <em>Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, </em>281 <em>U.S.146, </em>159, 50 <em>S.Ct. </em>310, 314, 74 <em>L.Ed. </em>775 (1929). Some limits to a state\u2019s power to tax are found in the Equal Protection Clause, but \u201cthat clause imposes no iron rule of equality,\u201d 358 <em>U.S. </em>at 526, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 440. The tax must have a rational basis and may not be \u201cpalpably arbitrary.\u201d Id. at 527, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 441. It is also well established that the Supremacy Clause prohibits states from taxing the United States or its property directly. <em>Washington v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, -, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1344, 1348, 75 L.Ed.2d 264, 268 (1983). But even that prohibition has been very narrowly construed and \u201cthe States\u2019 power to tax can be denied only under \u2018the clearest constitutional mandate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1351, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 273, quoting <em>Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>276, 293, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>535, 544, 46 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976), as cited in <em>United States v. New Mexico, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>720, 737-738, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1373, 1384, 71 L.Ed.2d 580 (1982). State taxes which affect interstate commerce must have a reasonable nexus between the taxing state and activities being taxed and must not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>merce or unduly infringe upon Congress\u2019 right to regulate interstate commerce. <em>See </em>generally, <em>Tribe, American Constitutional Law, </em>\u00a7 6-14, 15. The Constitution explicitly prohibits states from laying \u201cany Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports .... \u201d <em>U.S. Const., </em>Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 2. <em>See also Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, supra, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>276, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>535, 46 L.Ed.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Plaintiffs in this case make no allegations that the State has transgressed any of these limits on its spill fund tax. Their argument is based on an interpretation that \u00a7 114(c) of the Superfund precludes states from taxing for the same purpose as the Superfund. In light of the strong history of the states\u2019 freedom as to the \u201cmodes and subjects\u201d of their taxation schemes, and the Supreme Court\u2019s approval of double taxation, there must be some demonstration that New Jersey\u2019s tax somehow stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of any of the permissible goals of the Superfund. I know of no authority which would permit Congress to prohibit a state from imposing an otherwise constitutional tax simply because it had determined that the taxpayer should not be taxed by both the federal and state governments. Presumably Congress could impose such a prohibition if it determined the state tax unduly interfered with its regulation of interstate commerce but, again, no such allegations have been presented here. The Supreme Court has admonished and repeated \u201c[w]e must also be careful to distinguish those situations in which the concurrent exercise of a power by the Federal Government and the States or by the States alone <em>may possibly </em>lead to conflicts and those situations where conflicts <em>will necessarily </em>arise.\u201d <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>California, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>at 554, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2309. No allegation of any conflict has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Supreme Court has stated in numerous cases that when the federal government has not been given exclusive control over a given matter \u201c[cjonsideration under the Supremacy Clause starts with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>725, 746, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2114, 2129, 68 L.Ed.2d 576 (1981). Certainly there should be no finding that congressional action precludes the states from exercising their powers to tax without some clear indication that Congress has a constitutional basis for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We should bear in mind that private parties have chosen to litigate this issue. This case does not represent a direct conflict between state and federal authorities. Perhaps the issue would be better framed as \u201cDoes New Jersey have the power to impose the Spill Fund Tax on these plaintiffs?\u201d Such a reformulation recognizes that this case clearly is one arising under the state law. It also emphasizes that this is a matter between the private plaintiffs and the State of New Jersey. As Exxon has attempted to structure its arguments, it is attempting to assert a power of the federal government which that government may or may not even believe it possesses.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"><em> E.g., </em>the first paragraph of <em>The Federalist </em>32 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Although I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the State governments from a power in the Union to control them in the levies of money, because I am persuaded that the sense of the people, the extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the State governments, and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations for local purposes, would be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power; yet I am willing here to allow, in its full extent, the justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual States should possess an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the supply of their own wants. And making this concession, I affirm that (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports) they would, under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of it, would be a violent assumption of power, unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
