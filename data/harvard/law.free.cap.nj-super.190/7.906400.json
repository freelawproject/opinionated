Lisovicz, </em>on the joint brief).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b36-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b36-13\">FURMAN, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">On appeal from a jury verdict of no cause for action and from denial of his motion for a new trial in a products liability case, the single issue raised by plaintiff is that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the issue of strict tort liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>defendants\u2019 failure to warn of the hazard of a post-collision fire and burn injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Plaintiff was operating a motorcycle owned by him and manufactured and distributed by defendants when he crossed the center line of a roadway and collided head-on at a speed of about 40 miles per hour into the front of van. Vaporized or liquid gasoline sprayed on him from the fuel tank and ignited his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">After a trial of several weeks, the trial court submitted the case to the jury on the issue of strict liability in manufacture and design and refused plaintiff\u2019s request for a charge that the jury might return a verdict in favor of plaintiff if it determined that defendant \u201cdid not provide full and adequate warnings concerning the risk of post-collision fires.\u201d The jury answered a special interrogatory in the affirmative that plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle, as designed and distributed, was reasonably fit, suitable and safe for its reasonably intended and anticipated use.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The feature of defendants\u2019 motorcycle which plaintiff alleged was unreasonably dangerous was the fuel system, in particular the pressure-relief mechanism in the cap of the fuel tank, which was designed to release a small quantity of vaporized or liquid gasoline by venting when pressure built up within the fuel tank upon a heavy impact in a high-speed collision or otherwise. According to undisputed expert testimony on behalf of defendants, the pressure-relief mechanism was a safety device to minimize the danger of an explosion of the fuel tank as the consequence of a crash of the motorcycle. Defendant\u2019s expert graphically stated: \u201cThe fuel puff has to be there. You have to have some means of relieving the tank at a relatively low pressure; otherwise, you wind up with a bomb. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">On appeal, as we have noted, plaintiff does not challenge the jury determination that there was no design defect in the fuel system or fuel tank. Rather, he contends that he was entitled to a jury instruction that defendants might be found liable for breach of a duty to provide a warning of the hazard of ignition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of gasoline spraying onto the clothing of the motorcycle operator in the event of a collision. Plaintiff does not specify a proximate cause relationship between the lack of a warning and the burns suffered by him. Nor was any such relationship established in our view. The trial record is barren of any evidence that a warning would have made the fuel system safer or enabled plaintiff to do anything to prevent his burns other than to avoid a high-speed crash, a mishap involving grave danger of which he had knowledge without a warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Judicial authorities relied on by plaintiff thus are inapposite. All of them recognize liability of the manufacturer or distributor of a product for failure to provide a warning only if the warning would have enabled the user of the product to make it reasonably safe in ordinary use or otherwise to protect himself, <em>Michalko </em>v. <em>Cooke Color &amp; Chem Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>386 (1982); <em>Beshada </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>191 (1982); <em>Freund v. Cellofilm Properties, Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>229 (1981); <em>Martinez v. Atlas Bolt &amp; Screw Co., </em>636 P.2d 1287 (Colo.App.1981); <em>see also Torsiello </em>v. <em>Whitehall Laboratories, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311 (App.Div.1979), certif. den. 81 <em>N.J. </em>50 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Under the developing law in this field, failure to provide an adequate warning may amount to a design defect subjecting the manufacturer or distributor of a product to strict tort liability. But the manufacturer or distributor has been exempted from strict tort liability for failure to provide a warning of a danger within common knowledge and understanding, 2 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 402A, Comment (j) at 353 (1965); 2 <em>Hursh and Bailey, American Law of Products Liability </em>(2 ed. 1974), \u00a7\u00a7 8.14 and 8.15. For example, strict liability has been rejected for failure of a manufacturer to provide a warning that a motor vehicle may skid on a slippery road surface in low gear or upon braking. <em>Zidek </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>66 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>982, 23 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>715, 384 N.E.2d 509 (Ill.App.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Assuming a jury determination that the fuel tank of a motor vehicle was reasonably fit, suitable and safe, we do not understand strict products liability law to have imposed an obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>on the manufacturer to provide a warning that the fuel tank might explode in a high-speed crash. <em>See in accord Shumard </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>270 <em>F.Supp. </em>311 (S.D.Ohio 1967). On this appeal <em>a fortiori </em>the undisputed scientific testimony at trial was that the risk of a fuel tank explosion was substantially reduced by the pressure-relief mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
