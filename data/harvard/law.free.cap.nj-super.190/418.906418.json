Hill, a Camden Police Officer who was also in the National Guard, for a four-week period while he voluntarily attended courses at a United States Army Intelligence School.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Appellant requested a leave of absence with pay to attend six weeks of courses at the Army Intelligence School in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina during the summer of 1981. The courses of instruction had been offered through a military circular to all personnel who were qualified and wished to attend. Appellant\u2019s attendance was voluntary, although he contended that the leave was incidental to his duties in the National Guard and was essential for maintaining his proficiency as an Intelligence Analyst. Appellant\u2019s leave of absence was granted after an initial dispute, but the Chief of Police advised appellant that he would not be paid by the municipality while he was on leave. Appellant later reduced his leave of absence to the period of June 21 through July 17, 1981. He said he did not attend the \u201clast two weeks of school\u201d because they duplicated \u201cthe Intelligence Analyst Course which I have just completed.\u201d Another reason given for shortening his absence was that the lack of pay created a financial and mental strain on himself and his family.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Appellant appealed to the New Jersey Civil Service Commission seeking full pay for his period of absence. Appellant relied in part on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:4 4 which provides generally that public employees who are members of the organized militia shall be entitled to leave of absence \u201cwithout loss of pay or time\u201d on all days during which they shall be engaged \u201cin active duty, active duty for training or other duty ordered by the Governor; provided, however, that the leaves of absence for active duty or active duty for training shall not exceed 90 days in the aggregate in any one year.\u201d Subsection (b) provides that leave of absence for such military duty shall be in addition to regular vacation allowed to public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The issue in the case is whether the statute mandates leave with pay for \u201cactive duty for training\u201d when the National Guardsman is not required or mandated to perform that duty at any given time. Appellant contends that the duty is designated full time training duty (FTTD) performed under orders of the State of New Jersey, Department of Defense. Orders were forwarded to appellant after his application to attend the courses was approved. However, subsection (k) of the additional instructions contained in the orders recites, \u201cYou are ordered to FTTD with your consent and the consent of the Governor.\u201d Separate orders were issued for each course and were designated \u201cBy order of the Governor,\u201d but these were signed by the chief of staff in the New Jersey Department of Defense. The fact that orders were entered did not make appellant\u2019s performance of training duty required or compulsory duty within the meaning of the law being discussed. \u201cOrdered by the Governor\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:4-4 undoubtedly refers to the Governor\u2019s power to order the State militia to \u201cactive duty\u201d in case of insurrection, breach of the peace, natural disaster or imminent danger to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">A number of statutes deal with military leaves of absence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:24A-2 provides for leave with pay for a period of field training which a public employee is \u201crequired to undergo.\u201d Identical language is contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:14-1 which applies to State employees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:23-1 provides for leave of absence with pay for members of the organized military reserves when \u201cengaged in field training.\u201d In <em>Lynch v. Edgewater Bor., </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>279, 290 (1951), our Supreme Court held that the phrase \u201con all days on which he shall be engaged in field training\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:23-1 probably reflected the Legislature\u2019s view that mandatory payment of civilian compensation was justified for such training as the law \u201crequired\u201d a member of the National Guard or other reserve forces to undergo. The court opined that the Legislature did not consider payment of civilian compensation justified \u201cin cases where individuals could select active duty training for extended periods of time,\u201d although that duty also served a public purpose. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In deciding <em>Lynch, supra, </em>the Supreme Court referred to <em>R.S. </em>38:3-38, which derived from L.1937, c. 49. That section provided that members of the inactive National Guard \u201cmay be required to attend field training,\u201d but the court noted that it provided for no other compulsory military service. 8 <em>N.J. </em>at 288. The opinion in <em>Lynch </em>then referred to <em>R.S. </em>38:12-4, which also derived from L.1937, <em>c. </em>49, and was the predecessor of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:4-4. <em>R.S. </em>38:12-4 was referred to in <em>Lynch </em>because it provided for leaves of absence with pay for state and municipal employees who are members of the National Guard while \u201cengaged in field training or other duty ordered by the Governor.\u201d The court in <em>Lynch </em>emphasized the compulsory nature of field training and other ordered duty as a justification for leaves of absence with pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:4-4 was enacted by L.1963, c. 109. The phrase \u201cfield training or other active duty ordered by the Governor\u201d contained in <em>R.S. </em>38:12-4 was replaced by \u201cactive duty, active duty for training or other duty ordered by the Governor.\u201d As noted, the former statute had been construed by <em>Lynch </em>in <em>dictum </em>to refer to compulsory military training. While the terms \u201cactive duty\u201d and \u201cactive duty for training\u201d are broader than \u201cfield training,\u201d this change in language may simply represent more appropriate terminology for the military training of today. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:1-1 <em>et seq. </em>no longer use the phrase, \u201cfield training.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:1-1 defines active duty and other pertinent terms, but the term \u201cfield training\u201d does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Considering the construction put on this law in 1951 by our Supreme Court in <em>Lynch, supra, </em>we conclude that by the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38A:4-4 the Legislature did not intend to give members of the National Guard the added benefit of compulsory civilian pay while on non-required, voluntary training duty. Had the Legislature intended to change the prior interpretation of these laws a more specific expression of intent should have been used. We note, incidentally, that the language of the corresponding civil service statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:24A-2, adopted by L.1939, c. 232, has not been changed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:24A-2 still provides that leave of absence with pay is mandated for National Guard members \u201cfor the period of field training\u201d only if they are \u201crequired to undergo field training\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Much of the material that has been cited in this appeal is not helpful in deciding this issue. Appellant refers to the Veteran Reemployment Rights Act, 38 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2021-2026. However, that law is concerned only with the right of reemployment after military service, not with payment during military leave. <em>Monroe v. Standard Oil Co., </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>549, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2510, 69 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>226 (1981). Nor do we find the regulations adopted by the Civil Service Commission dispositive of this issue. We note, nevertheless, that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4.1\u201417.3(d) of the Civil Service Rules provides for leave of absence with pay for National Guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>members and reservists who are \u201crequired to undergo annual field training or annual active duty for training.\u201d The Civil Service Personnel Manual explains in a note attached to subpart 17-3.102(d) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">The key factor to be considered is whether the employee is being ordered to the type of duty specified and defined in the regulation [N.J.A.C. 4.1-17.3(d)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The facts in this case demonstrate that appellant Robert Hill retained considerable discretion as to the time he wished to spend in training and what courses he wished to attend. Municipalities would be greatly burdened financially if they were required to pay civilian compensation to National Guard members who elect to spend approximately three months per year in classroom training in addition to their regular vacation time and sick leave time. We conclude that the Legislature did not intend to provide such extensive benefits for someone whose principal occupation is full-time municipal employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Appellant had requested permission to attend four courses. The first two were from June 21 to July 3 and July 5 to July 17. These were described as \u201cIntelligence Analyst 96B, Phase I and Phase II.\u201d The third course that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sought to attend ran from July 19 to July 31 and was entitled \u201cS-2 Combat Operations.\u201d The fourth course, scheduled to be given at Ft. Bragg from August 9 to August 21, was entitled \u201cOpposing Forces Europe, Operations and Intelligence.\u201d Apparently, his request to attend the fourth course was not approved. There is also nothing in the record before us to show that the third course, entitled \u201cS~2 Combat Operations,\u201d was a duplication of the Intelligence Analyst course which appellant, on the form filed with the Camden Police Department, said he had \u201cjust completed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
