At issue on appeal is the validity of defendant warehouseman\u2019s sale of plaintiffs\u2019 household belongings conducted in substantial but not literal compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">In June 1976 plaintiffs stored their household goods, insured in the amount of $12,150, with defendant\u2019s business predecessor. Defendant sent plaintiffs the following letter dated April 3, 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Per your phone conversation with Ansel Spada [defendant\u2019s executive vice president] on this date we will be expecting payment of $5,500.00 on April 8, 1980 or your household goods will be placed for sale on April 12, 1980. Please be advised that your current storage bill is now $6,316.88.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The expected payment was not made and defendant sold the goods on April 12 for about $5,200. Prior to sale, defendant ran a newspaper display advertisement on April 6 and 11 announcing that it would be selling home furnishings at a warehouseman\u2019s lien sale on April 12 at defendant\u2019s address in Parsippany. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:7 -210(2) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">(2) A warehouseman\u2019s lien on goods other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business may be enforced only as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">(a) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">(b) The notification must be delivered in person or sent by registered letter to the last known address of any person to be notified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">(c) The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">(d) The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">(e) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the goods are held or stored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">(f) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to bo held. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account they are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least fifteen days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement roust be posted at least ten days before the sale in not less than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">The notice to plaintiffs and the newspaper advertisement fell far short of literal compliance with the statutory requirements but the trial judge found that there was substantial compliance because \u201cin every respect the plaintiff was fully and completely aware of what was to occur and what his rights were with respect to the avoidance of that sale.\u201d The judge made reference to the numerous times defendant had been indulgent in forebearing enforcement of the debt including the last-minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cancellation of a sale that had been scheduled for January 12, 1980 at defendant\u2019s Freehold premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Courts generally insist on literal compliance with the statutory requirements of a warehouseman\u2019s lien sale. In <em>Montesano v. Liberty Warehouse Co., </em>121 <em>N.J.L. </em>124, 128 (E. &amp; A.1938), the court invalidated a sale conducted under the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act because contrary to the provisions of that act the advertisement appeared in a newspaper not published in the \u201cplace of sale\u201d though circulated there. There is no New Jersey case since adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, but strict compliance has been the rule elsewhere in light of \u00a7 7-210(2)\u2019s mandatory language that the lien \u201cmay be enforced only as follows.... \u201d <em>Flores v. Didear Van &amp; Storage Company, Inc., </em>489 <em>S.</em>W.2d 406, 408 (Tex.Civ.App.1972); <em>Kellenberger v. Bob Meyers Moving &amp; Storage, </em>595 P.2d 1229, 1231 (Okl.Ct.App.1979); <em>Poole v. Christian, </em>64 <em>Ohio Misc. </em>32, 411 <em>N.E.</em>2d 513 (Ham.Cty.Mun.Ct.1980); and <em>Scott v. Hurd-Corrigan Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>103 <em>Mich.App. </em>322, 331, 302 N.W.2d 867, 871, 873 (Mich.Ct.App.1981). \u201c... [Njonvariable rules prevent storers ... from overreaching their customers and from discriminating between them.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The judge\u2019s finding that plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the inadequate notice to them is not relevant. In <em>Flores, supra, </em>the court invalidated a sale because the notice gave the bailors less than 10 days to pay even though a proper notice would have been futile because they were out of the country. <em>See also Rubin v. City Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>81 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>1020,1024, 37 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>391, 393, 402 <em>N.E.2d </em>281, 283 (Ill.App.Ct.1980). Furthermore, the judge did not consider that defendant\u2019s first advertisement ran only six days before the sale contrary to the statutory requirement of \u201cat least 15 days.\u201d The statutory requirements are intended not only to insure the bailor a full opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>redeem but also to insure a fair sale price by giving adequate notice to interested purchasers. <em>See Bradford v. Muinzer, </em>498 <em>F.Supp. </em>1384, 1388 (N.D.Ill.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Defendant contends that the April sale was a continuation of the January sale. Assuming that the January sale was in compliance, there is no evidence of an announcement at the January sale in Freehold that plaintiffs\u2019 goods, withdrawn from that sale, would be sold in Parsippany on April 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Reversed and remanded for trial to determine value of goods at time of sale and for entry of an appropriate judgment after applying that amount to defendant\u2019s lien. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:7-210(9).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Defendant failed to comply literally with the statute on that occasion by running its advertisements before plaintiffs\u2019 time for payment had expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
