At the time, Dr. Ellmers was driving a leased car insured by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty). By operation of law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g), he was also a named insured under the Federal Insurance Company (Federal) policy covering a car owned by his wife. The main issue on this appeal is whether Federal has the primary obligation for PIP benefits owed to Dr. Ellmers under the no-fault law <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 et seq.), or whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-11 requires that the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>be shared between Federal and Liberty. On cross-motions for summary judgment brought by the third-party plaintiff and third-party defendant, the trial judge held that the PIP coverage provided under the Federal policy was \u201cprimary coverage\u201d and that the PIP coverage under the Liberty policy was \u201csecondary coverage.\u201d This appeal followed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. On January 8, 1978, Dr. Ellmers was driving a car which he had leased from Mullane Ford (Mullane) of Bergenfield, New Jersey. The car was covered by Liberty\u2019s insurance policy issued to The Ford Motor Company and other insureds, probably including the lessor, Mullane. The record is unclear as to the other named insureds on the Liberty policy but the case was decided on the premise that Dr. Ellmers was not a named insured on that policy. The Liberty policy did contain the \u201cbasic\u201d New Jersey PIP endorsement. Dr. Ellmers was a named insured on Federal\u2019s policy issued to his wife. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g) defines the term \u201cnamed insured\u201d to include the person identified in the policy as the insured and \u201cif an individual, his or her spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">After the accident, Federal paid Dr. Ellmers approximately $23,000 in PIP benefits and then discontinued payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Ellmers sued Federal for unpaid benefits which he claimed were due him, and Federal asserted a claim against third-party defendant Liberty. By amended complaint, plaintiff made claim against both insurance companies. The Federal policy contained optional additional PIP coverage made available pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10. The Liberty policy did not contain such expanded coverage, but as noted above, it did contain the \u201cbasic\u201d coverage required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. The effect of the decision below was that Federal\u2019s coverage would have to be exhausted before Liberty became obligated to pay any additional unpaid PIP benefits to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4, every automobile liability insurance policy issued in this state for liability arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of an automobile must provide for payment of PIP benefits without regard to fault. Coverage is afforded to the named insured and family members residing in his household who are injured in an accident involving <em>any </em>automobile. Also covered are other persons who are injured while occupying or using the named insured\u2019s automobile with his permission as well as pedestrians injured by the named insured\u2019s automobile or struck by an object propelled by or from that automobile. Thus, under the no-fault law, as the driver of the rented car which was registered in New Jersey, Dr. Ellmers was covered for PIP benefits by Liberty. As a named insured he was also covered by the Federal policy. Nothing in the no-fault law expresses a priority in the order of payment from one insurer or another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the contrary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-11 (section 11) provides for a sharing of the obligation for PIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>benefits among \u201ctwo or more insurers who are liable to pay\u201d such benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A 11 provides in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aai\">39:6A-11. Contribution among insurers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">If two or more insurers are liable to pay benefits under sections 4 and 10 of this act for the same bodily injury, or death, of any one person, the maximum amount payable shall be as specified in sections 4 and 10 if additional first party coverage applies and any insurer paying the benefits shall be entitled to recover from each of the other insurers, only by inter-company arbitration or inter-company agreement, an equitable pro-rata share of the benefits paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">This statute has previously been interpreted by this court in <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 449 (App.Div.1981), certif. den. 88 <em>N.J. </em>489 (1981). There we said that the statute was \u201cclear on its face\u201d and contained \u201cno provisions ... for relegating one insurer to a classification as the primary insurer and another as a secondary insurer.\u201d 179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 449. The opinion in <em>Selected Risks </em>reasoned that the Legislature must have known that individuals with their own insurance would be living in family households in which other members had separate automobile insurance, creating multiple coverage for all household family members. As our later discussion will show, such coverage may be referred to as first-party coverage in the traditional sense. The court in <em>Selected Risks </em>concluded that, in the face of such multiple coverage, rather than establish priorities in liability for PIP benefits, the Legislature in section 11 provided for a sharing of losses on \u201can equitable pro-rata\u201d basis by inter-company agreement or arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The holding in <em>Selected Risks </em>is quite persuasive. Before discussing the rationale for a different conclusion, we should note that in <em>Selected Risks </em>one insurer paid PIP benefits to its own injured insured and sought a 50% contribution by arbitration from the company whose insurance policy covered the mother of the injured insured who resided with him. This is a typical case of first-party coverage, since the coverage for the</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>injured insured afforded by his mother\u2019s policy had nothing to do with any possible liability that the mother would have for such injuries. First-party coverage is said to be coverage for an insured\u2019s own loss or injury, including medical expense or property damage, in contrast to third-party coverage which insures against liability of the insured for injury to a third party or his property. <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>285 <em>Md. </em>548, 551-552, 403 A.2d 1229, 1231-1232 (Ct.App.1979). PIP coverage is generally referred to as first-party coverage. <em>Garden State Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 304-306 (App.Div.1980) (holding that a carrier providing excess liability coverage without provision for paying \u201cfirst-party PIP benefits\u201d was not liable to the injured person\u2019s \u201cprimary carrier\u201d who paid PIP benefits). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 and -11 which use the term \u201cfirst-party coverage\u201d in connection with additional limits of PIP benefits which are available on an optional basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">There is some evidence that conflicts with the view that section 11 intended a sharing of PIP benefits paid to all classes of claimants among all carriers that might be liable. Pursuant to the authority of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-19, the Commissioner of Insurance issued a regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4, not discussed in <em>Selected Risks, supra, </em>which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">The policy form or endorsement providing the personal injury protection benefits shall provide that Section 4 benefits shall be afforded by the insurer of the injured person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">This regulation is not clear, since the \u201cinsurer of the injured person\u201d could be any carrier liable for PIP benefits. At most the regulation implies that the insured\u2019s own insurer is the primary obligor. Nevertheless, the regulation has been interpreted to mean that the primary obligation for PIP benefits falls upon the carrier issuing a policy in which the injured person is a named insured or a family member of his household, since such persons are covered regardless of the vehicle causing their injury. Mario A. Iavieoli, formerly counsel to the Automobile Insurance Study Commission <em>(Cirelli </em>v. <em>The Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>380, 387, n. 4 (1977)), writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>An insurer\u2019s obligation to make benefit payments on a primary basis or secondary basis has been the subject of regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance. The Commissioner has promulgated regulations which provide that in the event multiple insurance policies extend coverage to an injured individual, the primary coverage will be extended to such injured individual by that insurer whose policy identifies the injured individual in question as the named insured (or his relative) within such insurer\u2019s policy [citing <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4]. Other insurance policies which extend coverage to the injured individual are secondary coverage whenever the injured individualis not a named insured (or his relative) within such other insurance policies. Whenever the injured individual is not a named insured (or his relative) in any of the insurance policies which extend coverage to such injured individual, then in such event such policies extending insurance to such injured individual are primary coverage. <em>[Iavicoli, No Fault &amp; Comparative Negligence in New Jersey, </em>\u00a7 10 at 38-39 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Referring apparently to endorsements submitted by insurers which have not been disapproved by the Commissioner of Insurance, Mr. Iavicoli goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">The Commissioner of Insurance has approved the following language which is to be inserted in basic personal injury protection coverage endorsements in order to determine primary or secondary coverage: \u2018This insurance applies on a primary basis to bodily injury to the named insured and his relative[s] and on a secondary basis to all other eligible injured persons.\u2019 <em>[Id. </em>at 39]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">We know that the Liberty policy in the case at hand has the identical language in its PIP endorsement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, this approach appears to be inconsistent with the plain meaning of section 11. Also, section 11 appears to depart from the recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>mended uniform law which was approved in 1972 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. (Our no-fault law was adopted in June 1972 to take effect on January 1,1973. L.1972, c. 70, \u00a7 19.) Thus, it is difficult to say that the Legislature intended to make distinctions between classes of covered persons for the purpose of sharing PIP losses among carriers. Section 11 bears no hint of that intention. Yet it was adopted in its present form in the face of a known problem and known proposals for a different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Still, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4, as apparently interpreted and applied in practice, suggests a. contrary approach. There appears to be a common understanding that a person injured in an accident receives his PIP benefits from his own insurer, although he may be injured in a motor vehicle owned by someone else, as in the case at hand. See the <em>Garden State Fire </em>case, <em>supra, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 305 (\u201c.. . PIP coverage is first-party coverage. The intent of the No-Fault Law is that each automobile insurer should pay the medical expenses of its insured. It is the primary coverage.\u201d) <em>See also Cirelli v. The Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., supra, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>at 386 (the rationale of the no-fault law \u201cinvolves a plan by which each insurance carrier undertakes the payment of P.I.P. benefits to its assured regardless of fault and, as of January 1, 1975, without the cumbersome and uneconomic shifting of dollars from one insurance company to another through the means of subrogation,\u201d referring to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9). Similarly, after referring to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4, the judge in <em>McKenna v. Wiskowski, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 487 (Ch.Div.1981), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">Under this [regulation], first party coverage is mandated in that each insured collects PIP benefits from his own insurer even if the insured is injured while a pedestrian. The insurer of an injured individual provides primary coverage and the insurer of an automobile provides secondary coverage. <em>See Iavicoli, No </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Fault &amp; Comparative Negligence in New Jersey, </em>118 -119 (1973). Therefore, PIP coverage provides first-party coverage\u2014that is, each party primarily collects PIP benefits from his own insurer. <em>See Cirelli v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>380, 386 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Except for the endorsement in the Liberty policy, the record contains no information about the practices in the insurance industry since the no-fault law went into effect on January 1, 1973. Apart from the holding in <em>Selected Risks, supra, </em>the cases describing the law\u2019s general concept have not confronted the provisions of section 11. This section was not mentioned by the trial judge in ruling on the summary judgment motions in this case, nor has it been mentioned in Federal\u2019s brief on this appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Saying that a named insured or his relatives living in his household should seek benefits first from the named insured\u2019s carrier does not deal with that carrier\u2019s right to contribution from other insurers who are liable on the risk, although dictum concerning primary and secondary coverage implies a different result than we reach here. Although Iavicoli refers to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-11 in Section 51 of his text, <em>No Fault &amp; Comparative Negligence in New Jersey, supra, </em>at 120-121, he interprets <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4 as establishing a named insured\u2019s policy as primary for PIP payments to himself and family members of his household, saying that such persons can recover \u201conly from the insurance company providing insurance coverage for their own personal automobile.\u201d Such a provision and provisions for priority in payments were included in section 10 of one version of the legislation, Assembly Bill No. 675,1972, but this section was not incorporated in the final version that was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Section 11 establishes no priorities among insurers having a common liability for PIP coverage to an injured person. The use of the term \u201cfirst-party coverage\u201d in the act in sections 10 and 11 may suggest a more direct responsibility to a carrier\u2019s own insured, but other classes of claimants (drivers, occupants and pedestrians) designated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 are afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>what is in effect first party coverage by the carrier covering the automobile which causes their injury, regardless of the liability of the owner or driver of that vehicle. A system of priorities would have to consider many variations. Spouses are \u201cnamed insureds\u201d under policies separately issued on their respective cars. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g); <em>Matland v. United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499 (Law Div.1980). If a married person receives benefits from his own carrier, is that carrier entitled to contribution from another carrier covering his spouse\u2019s vehicle? As a named insured under both policies it is difficult to say that one company has only secondary liability. A distinction is more easily made when a pedestrian or the occupant of a vehicle unrelated to the vehicle\u2019s owner is a named insured under his own policy covering a different vehicle. But section 11 makes none of those distinctions. It merely provides that <em>any </em>insurer shall be entitled to contribution from another insurer by inter-company agreement or arbitration, whenever \u201ctwo or more insurers are liable to pay benefits\u201d for the same injury to any one person. The statute ignores all differences in categories of insurers and claimants. Thus, we conclude, as did the court in <em>Selected Risks, supra, </em>dealing with insurers of family members residing in the same household, that Federal is entitled to contribution from Liberty in this case, even though Dr. Ellmers was not a named insured of the Liberty policy but was a named insured under the Federal policy. To the extent that the regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-7.4, and the provisions of the Liberty policy conflict with this result, n. 5 <em>supra, </em>those provisions are invalidated. <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 286 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">We reject Federal\u2019s second contention that the Liberty policy must be construed as if it afforded additional benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10 (section 10), supplementing the \u201cbasic\u201d benefits required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. Federal argues that, as a long-term lessee of the Mullane vehicle, Dr. Ellmers should be deemed the \u201cnamed insured\u201d within the meaning of section 10 to whom additional insurance must be offered. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>conflicts with the definition of the term \u201cnamed insured.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g). We are not privileged to redefine the term according to our own sense of what is right, equitable and just. The renter of a vehicle can ask to be listed as a named insured in the policy covering the vehicle, at which time he will have all the statutory rights of a named insured. Any change in the definition will have to come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Liberty argues that Dr. Ellmers\u2019 claim was out of time under its policy conditions and that Federal has brought its claim in an improper forum, since section 11 provides for contribution only by inter-company arbitration or agreement. We do not pass on these issues. They were not considered below and do not appear to have been raised below. In any case, our grant of leave to appeal is intended solely for the purpose of dealing with the issue decided in the trial court by summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to resolve issues not determined on this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We note that no judgment has been entered on the claim asserted by Dr. Ellmers against both defendants. Technically, this appeal is interlocutory. Leave to appeal was not sought as required by <em>R. </em>2:5\u20146(a), and this appeal could be dismissed. <em>Rybeck v. Rybeck, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>151, 155 (App.Div.), certif. den. 75 <em>N.J. </em>30 (1977). However, since the effect of the decision below resolves much of plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the subject matter is of general interest, we grant leave to appeal pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:4-4(b)(2) and will consider the merits of the case. Moreover, the state of the case is such that delaying the appeal on the issues presented until after plaintiffs claims are resolved would unnecessarily postpone the ultimate resolution of the dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The record suggests that these payments were largely for income continuation benefits and that some medical expenses were unpaid at the time suit was commenced. Federal asserts in its brief that payments were discontinued when an examining doctor reported that Dr. Ellmers was able to return to work, but the record before us does not support this statement. Plaintiffs complaint sought benefits for income loss, medical expenses and essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>services benefits which are part of the PIP benefits specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">This contrasts with \u00a7 4 of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, 14 <em>U.L.A. </em>61-62 (1972).
