The bond and mortgage contain provisions permitting the mortgagor to transfer the property with prior approval of the mortgagee which \u201cshall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld.\u201d The mortgagee refused to consent to the sale of the property without an additional agreement for an increase in the mortgage interest rate. When the sale took place without consent, plaintiff, the mortgagee, instituted suit to foreclose the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Pursuant to an opinion published at 183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303 (Ch.Div.1981), summary judgment was granted for the mortgagor and its transferee. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the mortgagor\u2019s failure to accede to the demand for a higher interest rate does not justify the mortgagee\u2019s refusal to consent to the sale where such consent may not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld. We need not and do not pass upon the theory espoused in the trial court opinion that, in this state, an unconditional \u201cdue-on-sale\u201d provision cannot be enforced except to prevent \u201cimpairment of the lender\u2019s security.\u201d Thus, we affirm but not for the primary reason articulated by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The facts are not in dispute. Defendant S.S.R. Realty Associates (\u201cSSR\u201d) purchased real property in Atlantic City. It was financed in part by a purchase money mortgage of $224,000 with interest at nine percent per annum. The bond contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Mortgagor may assign, deed, or otherwise transfer the mortgaged premises without causing an acceleration of the installments due hereunder; provided, however, that the transferee assumes the obligations contained herein and in the Mortgage secured hereby. Mortgagor, however, shall not assign, deed or otherwise transfer the mortgaged premises without obtaining the prior approval of mortgagees, which approval shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The mortgage included a substantially similar clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Sometime later SSR sought consent for sale of the property to defendant Boardwalk Regency Corporation (\u201cBRC\u201d). Plaintiff, the mortgagee, refused to consent without agreement for an increase in the mortgage interest rate. SSR, convinced that plaintiffs position was unreasonable and a breach of the mortgage terms, refused to agree to increase the interest rate and transferred title to BRC which assumed the mortgage according to its original terms. Plaintiff declared the sale a breach of the mortgage and instituted this action for foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Plaintiff conceded that his security would not be impaired by the transfer but insisted then, as he does now, that his demand for increased interest was not arbitrary or unreasonable in the circumstances. He produced evidence that the prevailing mortgage interest rate was, at the time of the transfer, approximately 2IV2 percent per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The trial judge, relying upon the decision of the Appellate Division in <em>Fidelity Land Div. Corp. v. Rieder &amp; Sons, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502 (App.Div.1977), concluded \u201cthat the \u2018automatic enforcement\u2019 of a \u2018due-on-sale\u2019 clause is not justified and that an impairment of security is the only basis considered reasonable.\u201d <em>Fogel </em>v. <em>S.S.R. Realty Associates, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 307. He commented, in further support of that conclusion, that \u201c[t]he case [Rieder] has been so interpreted. <em>See </em>29 <em>NJ.Practice (Cunningham &amp; Tischler, Mortgages), </em>\u00a7 26 at 22 (Supp.1981); <em>see also Investors Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Ganz, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 362 (Ch.Div.1980).\u201d <em>Fogel, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">We note that <em>Ganz </em>referred to the <em>Rieder </em>opinion even though <em>Ganz </em>did not involve a due-on-sale clause. Rather, in <em>Ganz </em>the mortgagee successfully enforced a mortgage provision accelerat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ing the principal when the mortgagor no longer occupied the home as the mortgage contract required. <em>Ganz, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 359, 362-363. Furthermore, we note that the comment in the <em>New Jersey Practice </em>series referred to in the foregoing quote of the trial judge has been modified in the 1982 pocket part to incorporate language questioning the use of <em>Rieder </em>as authority in a due-on-transfer case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">. .. Although the decision was ... based on the court\u2019s interpretation of the language of the due-on-transfer clause, the opinion also <em>seemingly </em>indicates that the court did not accept the \u201cmaintenance of return on mortgage portfolio\u201d rationale for exercise of the due-on-transfer clause adopted in <em>[Century Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Van Glahn, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48 (Ch.Div.1976) ]. Instead, the Appellate Division panel <em>seemingly </em>adopted the view that the only proper purpose of a due-on-transfer clause is \u201cthe protection of a lender\u2019s security for an obligation and his need to have a borrower known to him to be conscientious, experienced and able.. .. \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">. .. The <em>Rieder </em>case ... contains language which can, <em>at most, </em>be considered obiter dictum <em>suggesting </em>that enforcement of due-on-transfer clauses should be restricted to cases where transfer of mortgage[d] land will endanger the mortgagee\u2019s security interest; <em>Rieder </em>clearly does not so hold .... [29 <em>N.J.Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 26A at 34, 38 (Supp.1982); emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">We agree that the suggestion in <em>Rieder </em>that a due-on-sale clause may not be enforced unless the mortgagee\u2019s security is thereby impaired is, at most, dictum. Our Supreme Court considers the question of automatic enforceability one which it has not yet resolved. <em>Barry M. Dechtman, Inc. v. Sidpaul Corp., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>547, 555 (1982). We are satisfied that the question is yet unresolved by our appellate courts. We find it unnecessary to resolve it here in light of the contractual provisions of the bond and mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">This was not an automatic due-on-sale clause. Here, the bond and mortgage permitted transfer of the property \u201cwithout causing an acceleration\u201d provided \u201cthat the transferee assumes the obligations contained herein .... \u201d The transferee is thus required to assume all of the obligations set forth in the mortgage. One of those specific obligations is the payment by the mortgagor of nine percent interest. Thus, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>trial judge that the clause in question \u201cdoes not reflect an intention to condition the assumability of the mortgage on ... a higher rate of interest.\u201d 183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 309. Accordingly, the demand for an increase in the interest rate was not a \u201creasonable\u201d basis for withholding approval of a sale to a financially secure purchaser. <em>See, e.g., Egner v. Egner, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 330-331 (Ch.Div.), aff\u2019d o.b. 185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.1982). If the parties intended the right of transfer to be subject to disapproval unless the purchaser agreed to modify one of the specific terms to be assumed, viz, the interest rate, the ordinary rules of contract require that they should have so provided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We conclude that the parties, as evidenced by the provisions of the bond and mortgage, cannot be held to have intended to confer upon the mortgagee the right to an increase in interest as a condition for its consent to the transfer. The sole \u201cpresumed intention\u201d which can be imputed to the parties is that the lender retained the right to withhold consent to a transfer if his security was threatened by lack of adequate financial capacity of the prospective purchaser. Since it is conceded that the purchaser is \u201cof impeccable financial standing\u201d appellant\u2019s refusal to consent was arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In supplemental briefs our attention is directed to a new federal statute, the Gam-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (the \u201cGarn Act\u201d), which was effective October 15, 1982 (P.L.97-320). The Gam Act defines the term \u201cdue-on-sale\u201d to mean the right of a lender to declare all sums secured by a lien on real property due and payable if the property \u201cis sold or transferred without the lender\u2019s prior written consent.\u201d It requires such a provision to be governed exclusively \u201cby the terms of the loan contract, and all rights and remedies of the lender and the borrower ... [to] be fixed and governed by the contract.\u201d Since our determination is based upon the contractual provision requiring that the lender not unreasonably withhold his consent to a sale, the requirements of the Garn Act would be satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
