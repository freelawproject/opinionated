Ordewald appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits. We must uphold the decision to deny benefits if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and the correct law was applied. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 589 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, Ordewald\u2019s sole argument is that, in his hypothetical to the vocational expert, the Administrative Law Judge failed to incorporate Ordewald\u2019s anticipated absenteeism, a limitation to Ordewald\u2019s residual functional capacity noted by the medical expert. Because this claim was not raised in the district court, Ordewald may not raise it now on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally waived absent exceptional circumstances). To the extent that Ordewald raises a general challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
