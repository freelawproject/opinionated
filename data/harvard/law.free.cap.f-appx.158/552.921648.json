For the first time on appeal, Aguilar argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. Because Aguilar did not raise this issue below, we review it for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-18\">Aguilar argues that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines was plainly erroneous because the error was structural and because prejudice should otherwise be presumed. This court has rejected these arguments. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 194, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-22\">Aguilar additionally asserts that he would have received a lesser sentence under an advisory application of the guidelines because the district court sentenced him at the low end of the guidelines range. The fact that Aguilar received the minimum guidelines sentence is not sufficient to show plain error. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 264, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). Aguilar \u201cpoints to no remarks made by the sentencing judge that raise a reasonable prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ability that the judge would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory scheme,\u201d and we have not identified any such remarks in the record. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Gonzalez, </em>405 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 202, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). Accordingly, Aguilar has not shown that the district court committed reversible plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Aguilar\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Aguilar contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). Aguilar properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
