Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Kamgang fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Kamgang cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardozo-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). In addition, we uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Kamgang failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Finally, in light of the above conclusions, we reject Kamgang\u2019s claim that the Board violated immigration regulations in using the affirmance without opinion procedure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
