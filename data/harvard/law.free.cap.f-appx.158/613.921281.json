The district court denied his motion and denied Kizzee a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Kizzee filed a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion, which argued that the district court applied the wrong standard of review in denying his COA motion. Kizzee appeals the denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. We review the district court\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Carter v. Fenner, </em>136 F.3d 1000, 1005 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">The district court recited the correct legal standards in its order denying Kizzee\u2019s COA motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). The district court\u2019s statement that Kizzee\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith indicates that the district court concluded Kizzee had not made the required showing to obtain a COA. Moreover, the district court stated that it did in fact consider the COA standard when denying Kizzee\u2019s COA motion. As Kizzee has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion was an abuse of discretion, the judgment is AFFIRMED. Kizzee\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. <em>See Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
