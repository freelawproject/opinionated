He appeals, claiming that the maximum statutory period of supervised release had elapsed before his violations occurred and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to return him to prison for two more years.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Appellant\u2019s entire claim rests on an erroneous belief as to the end date of the supervised release period. Appellant was subject to the maximum three year supervised release period, which was originally scheduled to end on April 22, 2001. J.A. 17. But because appellant was incarcerated in state prison for a period of 51 months and 22 days \u2014 from December 9, 1999, to January 16, 2004, and from February 23, 2004, to May 8, 2004, J.A. 17 \u2014 the supervised release period was tolled for that amount of time pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e). 51 months and 22 days after April 22, 2001, is August 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Appellant has relied on the probation officer\u2019s erroneous calculation that, after tolling, the supervised release period was scheduled to end on September 13, 2004. J.A. 35-36. This reliance has caused appellant to argue mistakenly that his violations of the supervised release conditions occurred after his supervised release period had ended. The violations, which occurred on September 28, 2004, and January 15, 2005, J.A. 113-14, plainly occurred before August 14, 2005. The district court therefore clearly had jurisdiction to revoke appellant\u2019s supervised release and sentence him to two years in prison. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
