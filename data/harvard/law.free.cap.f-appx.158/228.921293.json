Vicente asserts that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>trict court erroneously believed it lacked the authority under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 (2003) to impose a federal sentence concurrent with his state sentence and that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court erred in failing to consider all of his proffered mitigating factors as well as other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We find no error and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Vicente entered a plea of guilty to an indictment charging him with violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported in connection with an aggravated felony conviction. His presence in the United States had been discovered when he was arrested by the Georgia Sheriffs Office and charged with forgery when he was found in possession of a false social security card. Vicente was convicted of forgery and sentenced on 4 August 2004 to three years in custody upon service of 60 days in jail, with the remainder to be served on probation. The state sentence was completed on 3 October 2004. Because Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents had been notified immediately upon his arrest, however, and because their investigation revealed that Vicente had previously been deported in November 2003 after a conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, he has been held in custody since his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The base offense level for unlawful reentry into the United States, pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines is 8. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (2003). Vicente\u2019s previous conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, because the sentence imposed was thirteen months or less, increased the offense level by 12. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). Vicente also got a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. This left him with a total offense level of 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Vicente began with four criminal history points but, because the instant offense was committed while he was still on probation for his cocaine conviction, the Guidelines required an addition of two points. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). The Guidelines also required an additional point because Vicente reentered the United States less than two years following his release from custody on the cocaine conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e). All this resulted in a criminal history category of IV, and a guideline imprisonment range of 37 to 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Vicente\u2019s objection to the criminal history points added for his still being on probation for the controlled substance violation when he re-entered the country. The court explained that the sentence had been suspended only \u201cupon deportation and [Vicente\u2019s] remaining outside\u201d the United States \u2014 conditions Vicente broke upon re-entry. R3 at 5. Arguing that he had, \u201cin essence, lost three months worth of time,\u201d Vicente asked the district court to consider a lower sentence because he had been in custody from 25 May to 4 August when he was sentenced to 60 days (to run until October 3) for his forgery conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Explaining that because the sentencing court had designated that the sentence begin to run on 4 August, \u201cthat\u2019s what [it had] intended,\u201d the court also overruled this objection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Vicente also offered numerous grounds for mitigation of his sentence including that his criminal history score overstated his true criminal history and that he had re-entered the country to work and send money home to his mother. He asked the court to consider a concurrent sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, without reference to any specific subsection of that guideline. He argued that the forgery and re-entry were \u201call sort of wrapped up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Finally, Vicente asked the court, \u201cfor any number of the reasons ... cited,\u201d to impose a sentence below that of the advisory guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The district court found that \u00a7 5G1.3 did not apply to his case because the state forgery conviction and the illegal re-entry were \u201cseparate and distinct crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. The court sentenced Vicente to 30 months imprisonment \u2014 seven months below the low end of the guidelines range, explaining that Vicente\u2019s \u201ccriminal record was not one that was so egregious,\u201d and that the sentence imposed was \u201cwithin the range of sentences normally imposed in this district for these types of offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. The court further explained that the two most important sentencing considerations in cases such as Vicente\u2019s were sufficiency of punishment and deterrence and found that 30 months would serve to satisfy both.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Vicente makes two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court erroneously believed it did not have the authority to impose a federal sentence concurrent to his state sentence for forgery under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. Second, he argues that the court erred by failing to consider all possible mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A80\">A. <em>Concurrent Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">We review the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 <em>de novo. United States v. Bid-well, </em>393 F.3d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1956, 161 L.Ed.2d 789 (2005). U.S.S.G \u00a7 5G1.3 governs sentences for defendants who are convicted of a crime while serving an undischarged sentence for a prior conviction. Subsection (a) mandates consecutive sentences if the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment. If subsection (a) does not apply, subsection (b) provides that if a term of imprisonment \u201cresulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction\u201d and \u201cwas the basis for an increase in the offense level,\u201d then \u201cthe court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons\u201d and that \u201cthe sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3 (b). When neither subsection (a) nor (b) of \u00a7 5G1.3(b) applies, \u201cthe district court has discretion to impose a consecutive sentence to achieve a reasonable punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Neither \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.3(a) nor (b) applies; Vicente did not commit his re-entry offense while serving a term of imprisonment and his state forgery conviction was not relevant conduct to his illegal re-entry offense. Further, Vicente\u2019s offense level was not increased by the forgery conviction. Since neither of the first subsections applies, the court had discretion under \u00a7 5G1.3(c) to impose a federal sentence concurrent with Vicente\u2019s state sentence, but was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">Vicente argues that the district court\u2019s comment that his state forgery conviction and federal illegal re-entry conviction were \u201cseparate and distinct crimes\u201d shows that it thought it lacked the authority to impose a concurrent sentence. This argument is without merit. At sentencing, neither Vicente nor the court explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>identified which subsection of \u00a7 5G1.3 they were discussing. The comments only make sense, however, in reference to subsection (b). As discussed and as conceded by Vicente in his brief, subsection (b) does not apply to this case. That the court did in fact recognize its authority to impose a lesser or concurrent sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) is borne out by the court\u2019s express statement that the fact that Vicente had been in custody since 25 May \u201cwas one of the factors that [it] considered in imposing the sentence at the level that [it] did.\u201d R3 at 14. The court exercised this discretionary authority in imposing a sentence seven months below the applicable guideline range. Accordingly, we find no error in the court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">B. <em>3553(a) Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Vicente also argues that, under <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guidelines, the district court erred in failing to consider all the mitigating evidence proffered by him in relation to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a district court has accurately calculated the guideline range, it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005) (citing Booker). We review such a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the court should be guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66; <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. To establish the reasonableness of a sentence, however, a district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005). An indication that the court \u201cadequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the advisory Guidelines range\u201d in conjunction with the sentence will be sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The district court imposed a sentence that was seven months below the low end of the guideline range based, in part, on the fact that Vicente\u2019s criminal history was not \u201cso egregious.\u201d R3 at 14. Thus, first, the court did consider Vicente\u2019s proffered mitigating factor that his criminal history overstated the seriousness of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Second, the court observed that the Vicente\u2019s sentence was consistent with other sentences for crimes of this nature in this district. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6). Third, the court expressly considered the factors of punishment and deterrence, and proceeded to discuss how it thought this particular sentence would serve those purposes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(B). Finally, the court imposed a sentence considerably lower than both the 46-month high end of the Guideline range and the statutory maximum of 20 years. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum). Based on these considerations, we find the sentence imposed by the district court to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Vicente\u2019s appeal of his sentence, which fell below the Guidelines range for his conceded offense level and criminal history category, on the grounds that the court misunderstood its authority under U.S.S.G. 5G1.3 and fail\u00e9d to consider all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>factors listed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) lacks merit. First, the court considered Vicente\u2019s state sentence in fashioning his federal sentence, thereby demonstrating that it did not believe it lacked authority to impose a concurrent sentence under \u00a7 5G1.3. Second, the court did consider several relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing Vicente\u2019s sentence, and the sentence was reasonable in light of those factors. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">. To the extent that Vicente is arguing that the court did not depart enough from the Guidelines, a district court's discretionary decision to depart downward from the applicable Guideline range cannot be reviewed for its sufficiency, even after <em>Booker. See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
