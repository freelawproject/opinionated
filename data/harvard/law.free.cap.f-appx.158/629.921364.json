Bunton, Texas inmate # 620942, appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment for Defendant Kreuzer based on qualified immunity in his pro se civil rights action, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Bunton alleged that Kreuzer\u2019s budget constraints resulted in a policy of hiring inadequate medical staff at the Chambers County Jail where Bunton was incarcerated as a pretrial detainee. Kreuzer\u2019s summary judgment evidence showed that officials at the jail gave Bun-ton medication that was prescribed for him and otherwise tended to his medical needs. Bunton has failed to show that Kreuzer was \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d in fading to hire adequate medical personnel or that the purported inadequate hiring caused Bunton\u2019s injury. <em>See Conner v. Travis County, </em>209 F.3d 794, 796 (5th Cir.2000). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Kreuzer on this claim. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc). Judgment for Kreuzer on this claim is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Kreuzer, however, produced no summary judgment evidence to refute Bun-ton\u2019s claim that his placement in solitary confinement, as a pretrial detainee, violated his constitutional rights. Absent evidence to refute this claim, Kreuzer failed to meet his burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding this claim. <em>See Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1075. Consequently, the district court erred when it granted summary judgment on this claim. Judgment for Kreuzer on this claim is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no view on the ultimate merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
