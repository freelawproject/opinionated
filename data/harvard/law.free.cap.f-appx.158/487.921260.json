We affirm for the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum opinion. <em>See Daggy v. Staunton City Schs., </em>No. CA-04-23-5 (W.D.Va. Dec. 14, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
