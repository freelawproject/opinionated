Todd, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 248 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). Following our judgment, Todd filed a petition for certiorari, in which he challenged for the first time the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines as applied to him. The Supreme Court granted Todd\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Todd\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">Appellant concedes that he raised a <em>Booker/Blakely </em>objection for the first time in his certiorari application. Because Todd did not raise any Booker-related challenges to his sentence until his petition for certiorari, we will not review his claim absent extraordinary circumstances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Our cases make it clear that an argument not raised in appellant\u2019s original brief as required by Fed. R.App. P. 28 is waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant argues that under a plain error standard, he can show that the district court would have imposed a lighter sentence had the Judge known the guidelines were advisory. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005). Even if appellant can make this showing and satisfy the plain error test, he has not met the even more exacting test required to show the presence of extraordinary circumstances, which requires appellant to show a \u201cpossibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules.\u201d <em>McGee v. Estelle, </em>722 F.2d 1206, 1213 (5th Cir.1984) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Todd also argues that application of Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>would strip him of his constitutional protections against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. He explains that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) gave him the right to a jury trial on all facts essential to his sentence and Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>stripped that right away. In <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-76 (5th Cir.2005), we rejected that argument and held that <em>Booker </em>required us to apply both Justice Stevens\u2019 merits opinion and Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>to all cases such as this one on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">For the reasons stated above, our prior disposition remains in effect, and we REINSTATE OUR EARLIER JUDGMENT affirming Todd\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\"> Pursuant to 5th <em>Cir. </em>R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
