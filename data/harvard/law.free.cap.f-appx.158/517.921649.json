Counsel for both Appellants have filed a consolidated brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that they find no meritorious grounds for appeal, but challenging the district court\u2019s denial of Phillips\u2019 motion for a sentence reduction based on minimal role. The Government has filed an answering brief. Phillips has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Phillips asserts that because he only sold .83 grams of cocaine base, the district court\u2019s finding that he was responsible for more than 5 grams of cocaine base amounts to an impermissible judicial enhancement, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal sentencing guidelines\u2019 mandatory scheme, which provides for sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court, violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). This remedial scheme applies to any sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines, regardless of whether the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Because Phillips did not raise this claim in the district court, his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48. If a defendant establishes these requirements, the court\u2019s \u201cdis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>cretion is appropriately exercised only when failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We conclude that Phillips suffered no Sixth Amendment violation. Phillips\u2019 plea agreement clearly and unequivocally stipulates to his involvement in the distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base. Moreover, at his change of plea hearing, Phillips assured the court that he was pleading guilty to distributing .83 grams of cocaine base as named in the indictment, and that he was involved with an additional 4.17 grams of cocaine base throughout the course of the conspiracy. (J.A. at 97-98). Thus, because Phillips expressly admitted to the amount of drugs attributed to him, we find that he suffered no Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Phillips\u2019 counsel asserts that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a one-level reduction because he was only a minor participant in the conspiracy. However, a careful review of the sentencing transcript reveals that counsel did not move for a role reduction pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2004) during sentencing. Instead, while arguing the factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), counsel asserted that Phillips was the \u201cmost minor participant\u201d in the conspiracy, and urged the court to sentence Phillips below the applicable guidelines range. The district court ultimately rejected this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> We hold that Ziegler suffered no Sixth Amendment violation as she clearly admitted to the drugs attributed to her, and received no sentencing enhancements. Moreover, we find that because the district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guidelines range and below the statutory maximum for the offense, Ziegler\u2019s sentence was also reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Cf Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767) (noting after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts should determine the sentencing range under the guidelines, consider the other factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm both Phillips\u2019 and Ziegler\u2019s convictions and sentences. This court requires that counsel inform their respective clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If either client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> The statutory maximum for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000) is five to forty years in prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
