Wilson\u2019s complaint sought the return of personal property and compensation for damages. Wilson argues that the district court erred in concluding his claim was barred. We review de novo. <em>See Alexander v. Ieyoub, </em>62 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-19\">\u201cUnder the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, a state actor\u2019s random and unauthorized deprivation of a plaintiffs property does not result in a violation of procedural due process rights if the state provides an adequate postdeprivation remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted); <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541 \u2014 14, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part not relevant here, Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Texas has an adequate postdeprivation remedy for Wilson\u2019s asserted loss; thus, Wilson\u2019s claim was not properly raised in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Murphy v. Collins, 26 </em>F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">Wilson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). As the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wilson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
