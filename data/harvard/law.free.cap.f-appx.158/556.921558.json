For the first time on appeal, Caballero argues that the district court erred by requiring him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample from him as a condition of his supervised release. In <em>United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-1102 (5th Cir.2005), a similar challenge was held to be not ripe for review. Accordingly, this portion of Caballero\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-22\">Also for the first time on appeal, Caballero asserts that the federal drug importation statutes, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, are facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, Caballero did not waive this issue because neither his plea agreement nor his unconditional guilty plea waived a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes under which he was convicted. <em>See United States v. Knowles, </em>29 F.3d 947, 952 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 62-63 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975)). Nevertheless, as Caballero concedes, his argument is foreclosed on its merits by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-23\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
