We decline to address Lopez\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, without prejudice to Lopez\u2019s right to assert such claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
