The BIA ruled that the Immigration Judge\u2019s in abstentia order of removal was not in error. Gomez asserts that the Immigration Judge should have granted his motion for change of venue and that the BIA should have found that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying the motion. Gomez does not argue against the in abstentia removal order or the denial of the motion to reopen. All of his arguments focus on the change of venue issue only. He has failed to brief any issue from the BIA\u2019s decision. As such, Gomez has abandoned all of his claims on appeal. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir. 1986). Accordingly, Gomez\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
