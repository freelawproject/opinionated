Following discovery, the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and it ruled that Wilks was not financially eligible to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Wilks has moved this court for permission to proceed IFP on appeal. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the financial information submitted by Wilks establishes that she is able to pay the costs of her appeal without undue hardship or deprivation of life\u2019s necessities. <em>See Adkins v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339-40, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Because Wilks\u2019s appellate arguments do not address the district court\u2019s reason for entering summary judgment, she has failed to establish a nonfrivolous ground for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). The motion to proceed IFP motion is denied. As the appeal contains no nonfrivolous issues, it is dismissed. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
