On appeal, Sevilla challenges for the first time the admission of testimony of a Government witness, Gloria Madrid, claiming her testimony was improper evidence of prior bad acts under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and was unduly prejudicial under Fed.R.Evid. 403. We have reviewed the record and find no plain error in the admission of Madrid\u2019s testimony, which was elicited on cross-examination by Sevilla\u2019s co-defendant for purposes of challenging Madrid\u2019s credibility. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Accordingly, we affirm Sevilla\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
