Pena-Garza\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Pena-Garza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014(2005). Pena-Garza properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-27\">Pena-Garza also argues that the district court erred by requiring, as a condition of supervised release, that he cooperate in the collection of his DNA as directed by his probation officer. Pena-Garza\u2019s complaint is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-1102 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 761-62 (5th Cir. 2003). The appeal of this claim is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-28\">Pena-Garza has not established error with respect to his conviction and sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-29\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
