After the district court denied his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction and sentence on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), appellant moved the court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), contending that the court, in fashioning his sentence, should not have classified him as a career offender, which subjected him to the 30 years\u2019 prison sentence the court imposed. Instead, the court should have sentenced him to a maximum of 20 years in prison. He also contended that Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual required the court to reduce his sentence because the amendment \u201cwas intended to emphasize that the sentencing court must apply the base offense level that coincides with the offense of conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The Government, responding, said that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because appellant was simply reiterating the <em>Apprendi </em>argument he had made in support of his motion for \u00a7 2255 relief. The court agreed with the Government and denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction. Appellant now appeals its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Appellant contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for lack of jurisdiction because Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines applies retroactively to reduce his offense level and sentence. He also contends that his base offense level was set after a judicial finding of drug quantity in viblation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finally, he raises a point not presented to the district court \u2014 that the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), provided the district court jurisdiction to remedy what he submits is an error of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c), a district court may only modify a defendant\u2019s terms of imprisonment in limited circumstances: (1) upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, which clearly is inapplicable here, or (2) upon motion of ... the defendant if, and only if, the Sentencing Commission, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), lowers the sentencing range, and reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence is consistent with the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C., \u00a7 3582(c)(l)-(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, \u201c[wjhere a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in subsection (c) below, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d Amendment 591 is listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">The All Writs Act provides that the \u201cSupreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). The Supreme Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">The All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling. Although that Act empowers federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. U.S. Marshals Service, </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 361, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Moreover, such a remedy is an \u201cextraordinary\u201d remedy, issued in the discretion of the court, and should not issue unless the person seeking the writ has no other adequate means of seeking the relief he desires. <em>See Kerr v. U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402-03, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2123-24, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We conclude that Amendment 591 only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of a base offense level within the applicable offense guideline, and, therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219-1220 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201cAmendment 591 only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of a base offense level within the applicable offense guideline.\u201d). We conclude further that <em>Booker </em>is not an amendment to the Guidelines as contemplated by the Sentencing Commission; hence, it affords appellant no relief under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>Id. </em>Finally, the All Writs Act affords him no relief because the relief he seeks is adequately covered by statute in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. As his claims lack merit under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), he is not entitled to the \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d of relief under the All Writs Act. <em>See United States v. Swindall, </em>107 F.3d 831, 834 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that a defendant was not entitled to a writ of <em>error coram nobis </em>under the All Writs Act where his claim was barred under the retroactivity doctrine in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) and he had not suffered \u201ccompelling injustice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. We note that \u00a7 3582(c) motions are continuations of criminal proceedings and not post-conviction civil actions. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
