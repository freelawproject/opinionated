John has appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the method used by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) to compute the good time credit against his sentence authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">John contends that the BOP formula reduces his sentence by only 47 days of good time credit for each year served, rather than the 54 days of credit specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b). John argues that, although he is statutorily entitled to 810 days of credit against his sentence for good behavior, he will receive only 682 days of sentence credit under the BOP formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">Regardless whether John\u2019s sentence is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) or his own, John\u2019s release is not imminent. In light of the \u201ctemporally distant and speculative nature of [John\u2019s] claim,\u201d he has failed to establish an \u201cimmediate injury\u201d that would be redressed by the relief that he seeks. <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>conclude that John\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is not ripe for review and dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
