We affirmed his sentence. <em>United, States v. Coates, </em>113 Fed. Appx. 520 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court granted Coates\u2019 petition for certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded his case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Coates was sentenced before the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts not admitted by him or found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-60 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">Coates now contends that the district court plainly erred under <em>Booker </em>in making certain sentencing enhancements based on facts he did not admit and that his sentence thus violated the Sixth Amendment. Coates\u2019 base offense level was 27, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2A3.1(a) (2003). The district court added four levels because the offense was carried out by use of a threat or a weapon (Coates used a knife), \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(l); four levels because the victim was under the age of twelve, \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(2); four levels because the victim was abducted, \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(5); and two levels because Coates misrepresented his identity, \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(6). Coates unsuccessfully challenged the enhancements for use of a knife and abduction. With a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the final offense level was 38. Coates was in criminal history category III, which gave him a guideline range of 292-365 months. Coates contested the four-level enhancements for use of a threat or knife and for abducting the victim, but the district court found that both enhancements applied. The court imposed a sentence of 300 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">Without the challenged enhancements, Coates\u2019 offense level would have been 33. For purposes of determining <em>Booker </em>error, this court uses the guideline range based on the facts the defendant admitted before the range is adjusted for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005). Because Coates was in criminal history category III, the guideline range under this calculation would have been 168-210 months. The 300-month sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the maximum authorized based on the facts Coates admitted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Sixth Amendment. The sentence thus meets the standard for plain error that must be corrected as set out in Hughes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court. Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-12\">. We need not decide here whether Coates\u2019 failure to contest the two-level enhancement for Coates\u2019 misrepresentation of his identity constitutes an admission of that fact because the issue is not dispositive. Without the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>hancement, the guideline range would have been 135-168 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Coates' sentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \u201cthe law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
