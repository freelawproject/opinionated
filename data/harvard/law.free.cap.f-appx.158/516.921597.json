We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Spears v. Betsy Johnson Health Care Sys., Inc., </em>No. CA-01-962-5-BO (E.D.N.C. Feb. 3 <em>&amp; </em>Apr. 11, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
