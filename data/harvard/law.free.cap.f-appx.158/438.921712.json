He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court granted Hopper\u2019s motion on October 28, 2005. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Hopper\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
