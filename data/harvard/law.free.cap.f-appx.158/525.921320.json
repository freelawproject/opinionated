The Ahmads contend that the immigration judge (IJ) abused his discretion in denying a motion for a continuance because the Ahmads established that their visa application should have been approved, rendering visas \u201cimmediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>available\u201d to them as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">As an initial matter, the respondent asserts that we do not have jurisdiction over the Ahmads\u2019 petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). This argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinions in <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 302-03 (5th Cir.2005), and <em>Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 466-70 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Lam v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 F.2d 1136, 1141 \u2014 42 (5th Cir.1984). The Ahmads have not met this standard. An alien is entitled to an adjustment of status at the Attorney General\u2019s discretion \u201cif (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigration visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to [the alien] at the time his application is filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Even if it is assumed that the Ahmads\u2019 visa application was approved, rendering them eligible to receive visas, they have not established that immigrant visas are immediately available to them as third preference visa holders. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(3). <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(1). The IJ therefore did not abuse his discretion in denying a motion for continuance, because the Ahmads have not shown good cause. <em>See Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Diarra v. Gonzales, </em>137 F. App\u2019x. 627, 632 n. 5 (5th Cir. June 2, 2005) (No. 04-60097) (unpublished). Consequently, the Ahmads\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
