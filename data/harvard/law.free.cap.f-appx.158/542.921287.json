Summerall is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">Summerall\u2019s assertion that he did not receive the order denying him IFP which contained the <em>Baugh </em>certification is not supported by the record, which contains two signed acknowledgments by Summerall that he received the district court\u2019s orders dated May 25, 2005, which included the IFP denial and certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">By failing to direct his motion solely to the district court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision, Summerall has effectively abandoned the only issue that is properly before this court. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Summerall\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Summerall is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
