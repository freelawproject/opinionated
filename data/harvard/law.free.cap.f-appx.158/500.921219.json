Bowden\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Bowden has been notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-23\">Bowden does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he violated the terms of his probation. The only issue Bowden raises on appeal is whether the district court\u2019s imposition of a ten-month sentence upon revocation of probation was unduly harsh. The ten-month sentence imposed by the district court is within the statutory maximum. Furthermore, the district court considered the advisory guidelines in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines Manual, which based on a Grade B violation and an original criminal history category of I, provided a sentencing range of four to ten months. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4 (2004). The court also considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Bowden\u2019s history and record on probation and sentenced him within the guidelines range to ten months of imprisonment. We find no reversible error in the imposition of the ten-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and note that counsel must inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
