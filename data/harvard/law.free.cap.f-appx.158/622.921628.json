First, Figueroa asserts that the district court erred in concluding that his prior state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Our precedent holds that a state felony conviction for simple drug possession is properly considered an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, this issue is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">Second, Figueroa asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), controls this issue. We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation and citation omitted). This issue is also foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
