This court remanded for a determination of whether the district court would extend the time for filing Brooks\u2019s notice of appeal pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). The district court found good cause for an extension of time. The court also noted that, pursuant to our decision in <em>Fobian v. Storage Tech. Corp., </em>164 F.3d 887, 891 (4th Cir.1999), it would be inclined to grant a motion to reopen the action. Brooks has now filed a motion to reopen in the district court and a motion to remand in this court. We grant the motion, and remand for the limited purpose of consideration of the merits of Brooks\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. <em>See Fobian, </em>164 F.3d at 892. We express no opinion of the merits of the motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
