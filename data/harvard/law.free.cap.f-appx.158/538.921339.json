He contests the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). He argues that his pauper status remains unchanged, that he has exhausted his administrative remedies, and that the district court failed to provide written reasons for its IFP certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Nichols has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. He does not identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis. Finally, the district court provided sufficient written reasons for its certification by adopting the reasons in the magistrate judge\u2019s report. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Nichols has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Nichols\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Nichols has one previous strike that was issued in <em>Nichols v. Cain, </em>122 Fed.Appx. 161 (5th Cir.2005). Nichols is advised that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
