Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of that case. We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">Washington argues that he preserved a <em>Booker </em>challenge by objecting to the sentencing enhancements and that, therefore, it is the Government\u2019s burden to show that the error was harmless. Alternatively, he argues that if the error was not preserved and the plain-error standard of review applies, he prevails under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">Washington\u2019s objections were to sufficient to preserve his <em>Booker </em>claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we review for harmless error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Government has the \u201cburden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">The Government has pointed to no evidence to show that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the sentencing error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the district court stated that it had \u201cstruggled\u201d in deciding whether to sentence Washington at the high or low end of the Guidelines range, in fact the court sentenced him at the low end. Because the Government failed to meet its burden, Washington\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the matter REMANDED for sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>In our prior decision, we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the cross-examination of Ralphcel Eaton or in allowing Tom Young to testify. Because Booker does not change this result, that portion of our prior decision is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
