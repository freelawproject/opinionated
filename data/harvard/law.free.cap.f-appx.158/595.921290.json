Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and his motion for reconsideration. He argues that the district court abused its discretion because he was entitled to resentencing under Amendment 505 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines and under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) [of Title 18] permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Wilson\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument is not cognizable in the context of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it is not based on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). The district court also correctly noted that Wilson had previously filed a motion for resentencing under Amendment 505, which the district court had denied. Wilson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and his motion for reconsideration. <em>Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
