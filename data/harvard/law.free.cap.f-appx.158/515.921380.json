Cross was convicted by a jury of witness tampering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1) (2000), and retaliating against a witness, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(b)(2) (2000). On appeal, this Court affirmed his convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Cross, </em>371 F.3d 176 (2004). This Court recently affirmed the sentence imposed at resentencing. <em>United States v. Cross, </em>No. 04-5030, 2005 WL 3452041 (4th Cir. Dec.16, 2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">Seeking a second direct criminal appeal of his convictions, Cross filed a notice of appeal at the earliest on September 13, 2005, of the district court\u2019s pre-trial April 15, 2003, order denying his motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. We lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal because it is untimely. Criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of the judgment or order at issue to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., 434 </em>U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Because Cross filed his notice of appeal over two years after his criminal judgment was entered, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
