Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). This court has rejected that argument in our recent decision in <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, 420 </em>F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
