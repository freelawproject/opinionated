Dowdell appeals a 180-month prison sentence imposed by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>court after Dowdell pleaded guilty to two charges arising from his operation of an international Ponzi scheme. Dowdell claims that the district court erred by failing to sentence him in accordance with sentencing provisions contained in an earlier plea agreement between Dowdell and the Government. Dowdell argues that these provisions became binding on the district court when it accepted the original plea agreement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). This argument is meritless. The original plea agreement and Dowdell\u2019s plea colloquy with the district court made clear that the sentencing provisions in the agreement were merely recommendations that did not bind the court in determining Dowdell\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>61 F.3d 263, 266-67 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>563 F.2d 1145, 1147 n. 4 (4th Cir.1977). Further, the record shows that Dowdell\u2019s subsequent guilty plea to reduced charges \u2014 entered after he was permitted to withdraw his original plea\u2014 was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We thus affirm Dowdell\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
