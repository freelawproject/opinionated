He appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Mejia-Mejivar argues on appeal that the district court erred by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), and by announcing an alternate sentence without addressing the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). Even assuming, without deciding, that the harmless error standard applies, Mejia-Mejivar cannot establish that any error by the district court in the application of the guidelines as mandatory affected his substantial rights because it had no effect on the district court\u2019s selection of Mejia-Mejivar\u2019s sentence. The district court noted in sentencing Mejia-Mejivar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">\u201cI have considered carefully the circumstances of this defendant ... and if the [Sentencing Guidelines did not exist, I would impose the same sentence ... I do not believe that the sentence that is developed by application of the Sentencing Guidelines is, in any way, materially different than that which I would impose, independent of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Accordingly, we deny Mejia-Mejivar\u2019s motion to remand and affirm his conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
