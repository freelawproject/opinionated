Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Nwankwo v. Stansberry, </em>No. CA-05-111 (E.D.N.C. filed Apr. 14, 2005; entered Apr. 21, 2005, and filed June 9, 2005; entered June 17, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> Nwankwo\u2019s motion for reconsideration should be construed as a Rule 59(e) motion because it was filed no later than ten days after the district court entered its judgment dismissing his complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). The timely filing of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion tolls the time to appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). Thus, Nwankwo\u2019s notice of appeal, filed within thirty days of the denial of his motion for reconsideration, was timely as to both the order denying the motion for reconsideration and the underlying order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
