Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As the district court correctly concluded, Barnett does not meet the standard under <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000), so he is not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-19\"> The district court also construed the petition as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed it as successive. Because Barnett clearly intended his petition as one under \u00a7 2241, and because the district court did not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2255 to consider the validity of Barnett's sentence on his convictions arising out of the Southern District of New York, we decline to consider this case under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
