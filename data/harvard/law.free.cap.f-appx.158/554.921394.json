Biggers has failed to set forth argument identifying error in the district court\u2019s determination that his complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>1993). When an appellant fails to identify error in the district court\u2019s decision, it is as if the appellant had not appealed that judgment, and this court \u201cwill not raise and discuss legal issues that [Biggers] has failed to assert.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Biggers has abandoned any argument challenging the dismissal of his complaint on limitations grounds by failing to raise the issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Biggers\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Biggers\u2019s complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Biggers is cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
