Douglas argues that he is entitled to a reduced sentence under Amendment 505 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">A district court exercises sound discretion in determining whether to grant a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we review its decision for abuse of discretion only. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Douglas\u2019s motion. This court\u2019s previous opinion denying relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) with respect to Douglas\u2019s Amendment 505 claim is the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 752-52 (5th Cir.1998). Douglas\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim is not cognizable in the context of a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it is not based on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
