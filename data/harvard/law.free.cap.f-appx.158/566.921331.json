Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and by extension, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Wimbish argues that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was based upon findings that were neither admitted by Wimbish nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As Wimbish failed to raise this claim in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-24\">Wimbish meets the first two prongs of the plain error test because his sentence was enhanced based on facts found by the district court, which constitutes obvious error after <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 521. Nevertheless, Wimbish\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim fails at the third step of the plain error test because he has not shown that the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>affected his substantial rights. There is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory as opposed to a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime. <em>See id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Wimbish next asserts, also for the first time on appeal, that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure based on Wimbish\u2019s substantial assistance was \u201ctotally irrational and amounted to a denial of due process.\u201d Because Wimbish neither shows that the Government bargained away its discretion to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion nor argues that the Government acted with unconstitutional motive, his downward departure claim is not reviewable. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Urbani, </em>967 F.2d 106, 110-11 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">-AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
