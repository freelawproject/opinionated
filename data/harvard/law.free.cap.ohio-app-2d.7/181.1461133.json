By way of preliminary information, it recites in brief that the licensors, the appellants 'here, own certain patents; that the licensee desires to obtain ' an exclusive interest in the use thereof \u2014 this for a consideration ' in money and \u2018 \u2018 other undertakings. \u2019 \u2019 The body of the contract indicates that the licensee has the exclusive right to the use of the patents and that as further consideration therefor he agrees to pay a percentage of the cost-plus profits on any sales embodying the same as a fee or royalty. The contract further provides for its revocation upon failure of the licensee to pay or upon his insolvency. The contract reserves to the licensor certain rights in the patents not involving the business of the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Under the circumstances, the case is readily distinguishable from that of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Peck, Tax Commr., </em>160 Ohio St. 288, upon which appellants rely in seeking the cancellation of the tax assessment. The Supreme Court points out in that case that the assignment of the patents, together with provisions for future deferred payments, was clearly a sale of a capital asset whereby the assignor divested himself of all right, title and interest in the patents and became entitled to future installment payments on the sale. The court notes \u2014 \u2018 \u2018 By the terms of such assignments, all Taylor\u2019s right, title and interest in the patents and patents pending were sold, assigned, and transferred to the corporation to the full end of the term for which they were granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The court further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201cIt is the opinion of this court that the contract of 1945 here under consideration constituted an outright sale of the patents, by reason of which Taylor ceased to have any interest in them, and that the payments were necessarily the consideration for such transfer and constituted the purchase payments for the sale of capital assets, and could not be income from taxable investments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The instant case is readily distinguishable in that this, transaction obviously is not a sale. It is in substance and effect what it stated to be by title, that is, a license agreement. Under the circumstances, the rule pronounced in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Peck, Tax Commr., </em>160 Ohio St. 288, is obviously not applicable, and this court is of the opinion that the decision of the Board <em>c\u00a3 </em>Tax Appeals is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-5\">Hildebrant, P.
