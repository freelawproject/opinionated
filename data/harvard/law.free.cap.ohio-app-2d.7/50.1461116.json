Pleas Court from the disallowance of his claim by the Dayton 'Regional Board of Review of the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Oom^ \u00a1 pensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">1 The employee, plaintiff-appellant here, filed a timely notice ] of appeal as provided by Section 4123.519 of the Revised Code.! .The notice of appeal was complete in all respects except that! \u25a0 the claim number was set out as No. 2349857, whereas, in fact,,' the claim number was 2348957.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The employee\u2019s petition in the court below was filed simul-; ! taneously with the notice of appeal and carried the correct : claim number. There is an obvious transposition of the num\u00a1bers eight and nine in the two series of figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The bureau filed- a motion to dismiss the appeal for noncompliance with the above statute in the respect set out. The employee thereupon moved the court below for permission to correct the notice. The court below granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction of the case because of the incorrect number.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The factual situation here is readily distinguishable from <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Young, Admr., </em>172 Ohio St. 317. That case involved two specific omissions from the notice of appeal. The court held the omissions rendered the notice ineffective and, accordingly, failed to vest jurisdiction in the Common Pleas Court. In the instant case, we are not concerned with an omission from the notice of appeal, the only defect being an obvious typographical error. In <em>Singer Sewing Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Puckett, </em>176 Ohio St. 32, the court modified the <em>Starr case </em>to the extent of hold:ing that a notice which was deficient as to caption was sufficient1 \u25a0nevertheless if it carried the required information in the body, \u00a1of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Most recently, in a case involving identical appellate pro-' cedure in regard to the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation, <em>Van Meter </em>v. <em>Segal-Schadel Co., </em>5 Ohio St. 2d 185, the court stated in paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201cStatutes providing for appeals and for proceedings with' respect to appeals and for limitations on the right of appeal are remedial in nature and should be given a liberal interpretation in favor of a -right of appeal. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>It is the opinion of this court that the notice of appeal in the instant case, since it involved no omission of required information hut merely an obvious typographical error which was apparent upon examination of other papers filed simultaneously \u00a1with the notice, should receive the benefit of the reasoning set out in the <em>Smger </em>and <em>VcmMeter cases </em>above, rather than the total hair-splitting technicality required by applying the <em>Starr case </em>to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">The order of the lower eourt dismissing the appeal is accordingly set aside and the cause remanded for further proceedings according to law, with instructions to grant the moition of the plaintiff below for permission to eorreet the trans-j position in the claim number.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\n<em>Jwdgmeirt reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-5\">Hmr\u00aeBR\u2018ANT, P.
