Section 2953.24, Bevised Code, is not applicable, for it relates only to the appointment of counsel for the petitioner to prosecute the vacation proceedings in the court in which sentence was imposed. Sections 2941.50 and 2941.51, Bevised Code, are limited in their applicability to appeals to the assignment of counsel to conduct an appeal <em>from a finding of guilty of a felony </em>made <em>at the time of the hearing at which sentence is imposed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\n<em>Motion for the appointment of counsel overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-13\">Younger, P.
