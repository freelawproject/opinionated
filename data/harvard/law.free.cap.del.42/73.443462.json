Simmons, </em>3 <em>Penn. </em>291, 50 A. 213. The writ will never issue in doubtful cases. <em>Road Commissioners v. New Castle, </em>2 <em>Penn. </em>466, 47 A. 374. Nor will the writ issue to enforce a right found to be in substantial dispute, or a right which is inchoate or prospective. 38 C. J. 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It is apparent that the problem involved is not whether this Court has the power to undo an act already done, but, instead, to determine whether or not the act was properly done. I am of the opinion that the power exists \u25a0 to examine Article 4 of the charter authorizing redemptions, . and to examine also the resolution \u2014 wherein the relator\u2019s shares were purported to be redeemed \u2014 in order to determine as to whether or not the method pursued was consistent with the power granted, so that I may conclude whether the relator at the time his petition was filed was possessed of the right to seek the remedy herein prayed for. <em>People ex rel. Colby v. Imbrie &amp; Co., </em>126 Misc. 457, 214 N. Y. S. 53; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>State ex rel. Walker v. Harrington and Terry, </em>3 <em>Terry </em>(42 <em>Del.) </em>14, 27 A. 2d 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"> Now, in determining as to whether or not the right exists it should be said that all external aids, and especially arbitrary rules, applied to the construction of contracts such as before me are more or less of uncertain value and Courts should not resort to their use without hesitation, and then with much circumspection. The object of construction is to ascertain the true intent from the words used, not how meaningless the words can be made by the application of any given rule. I do not mean that given rules such as the ejusdem generis rule do not have their proper applications. Yet, they never spring into operation unless an ambiguity exists veiling beyond true comprehension an accurate interpretation of the language used. The immediate problem is to ascribe the proper meaning to the words \u201cor otherwise.\u201d If the intent so requires, the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d as used should be construed without reference to the ejusdem generis rule, and may be given such a scope as the context might seem to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">When the pertinent language contained in Article 4 is read, it is found \u201cin case less than all of the Class A stock' is to be redeemed, the amount to be redeemed and the method of effecting such redemption * * * may be determined by the Board of Directors.\u201d Now, if this language stood alone, there could be no question but what the method to be selected would lie within the unrestricted discretion of the Directors. However, the clause continues \u201cby lot or pro rata or otherwise.\u201d What did the framers of this language intend? Did they intend that the words \u201cby lot or pro rata\u201d should be construed to be superfluous, or, at best, suggestive in nature, and the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d to engulf an unrestricted grant of power, or did they intend that the words \u201cby lot or pro rata\u201d should be given the meaning properly ascribed to them, and the general words \u201cor otherwise\u201d have a mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ing consistent therewith? The phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d in everyday parlance means \u201cor in any other way.\u201d \"Otherwise\u201d is defined by Webster as \u201cin a different manner, in other respects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"> The defined meanings of the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d does not of necessity impel a construction that they were used in their broadest sense. Naturally, a method \u25a0 selected other than \u201cby lot or pro rata\u201d would necessarily have to constitute a different method of redemption. The question is: Whether the method should conform in principle with the methods \u201cby lot or pro rata\u201d ? I find no ambiguity in the language used. It is evident to me that the framers of Article 4 intended by the language used to ascribe to the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d a meaning such as \u201cin like manner,\u201d thereby insuring, so to speak, fairness, as used in a restricted sense, and equality to all of the holders of the Class A stock. In construing the clause before me I find that the word \u201ceffecting\u201d is limited or modified by three adverbial constructions in parallel function, and the adverb \u201cotherwise\u201d is equivalent to the classification and intent of the two previous adverbial phrases. The reading of the adverbial constructions are thus equivalent to \u201cby lot, by pro rata, or in like manner.\u201d To reach any other conclusion would be to defeat the object sought. I, therefore, must conclude that the resolution clearly shows on its face that the method selected was not contemplated under the charter provision, and, therefore, the relator\u2019s status as a stockholder was not changed by the adoption thereof, and that he is possessed with sufficient right to seek the remedy herein prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Prior to discussing the merits surrounding the relator\u2019s application, it should be stated that the right to examine corporate books and records under the circumstances of this case is derived from the common law. <em>State v. Jessup &amp; Moore Paper Co., infra. </em>The right is not absolute and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>never granted to satisfy the fancy or curiosity of an idle mind, nor the minds of those who are prone to remote or speculative imagination. It is exercised only when the reason sought is found to be embodied in good faith and for a specific and proper purpose. <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Loft, </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>538, 156 A. 170; <em>State v. Jessup &amp; Moore Paper Co., </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>379, 77 A. 16, 17, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The parties are not in accord concerning the burden of proof. The Courts of this State have not passed directly upon this question. However, language, from time to time, has appeared in our reported cases,.the import of which would lead to the conclusion that the burden was upon the relator to prove his good faith and proper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In the case of <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Loft, </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>538, 543, 156 A. 170, 172, the Court, dealing with the question of proper motive on the part of the relator, stated, since the right of inspection was not absolute, \u201csuch purpose must not only be proved, but must, also, be alleged not by a mere bare general statement that it is a proper one, but by the allegation of specific facts, from which the propriety of such purpose will appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In the case of <em>State ex rel. Theile v. Cities Service Co., </em>1 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(31 <em>Del.) </em>514, 518, 115 A. 773,775, 22 A. L. R. 8, the Court stated, \u201cat common law, the right to inspect corporate books was a qualified right, and allowable only when . the stockholder was actuated by motives that were lawful and proper and by a purpose to subserve his interests as a holder of the corporate stock. And, accordingly, the petitioner was required to bring his case by adequate averments in his petition, within the limitations of the right above indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">It must be borne in mind that the writ is not issuable as a matter of course; on the contrary, it is issued only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>upon sound judicial discretion \u2014 consequently, it is mandatory upon the relator seeking the examination not only to allege, but, in my opinion, to prove a proper motive or purpose, which would properly cause the Court to exercise its judicial discretion in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">It is admitted that the allegations contained in the petition as filed are adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In approaching an analysis of the testimony, one must bear in mind certain basic or fundamental principles of corporate purpose. A corporation has been judicially defined as \u201can artificial being, existing only in contemplation of the law; a legal entity, a fictitious person, vested by law with the capacity of taking and granting property and transacting business as an individual. It is composed of a number of individuals, authorized to act as if they were one person. The individual stockholders are the constituents or component parts, through whose intelligence, judgment, and discretion the corporation acts.\u201d <em>Jones v. Williams, </em>139 Mo. 1, 39 S. W. 486, 490, 40 S. W. 353, 37 L. R. A. 682, 61 Am. <em>St. Rep. </em>436.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> The stockholders of a corporation are the equitable owners of its assets. They have a well defined interest in its present and future welfare, including its entire policy of operation. The officers of a corporation are persons entrusted with the duty of proper management. They act in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the corporation and its stockholders, and they should be ready and willing to account to the stockholders for their acts at all reasonable times. The fact that the officers manage the corporation does not to any extent take away from the stockholders the right to inspect their records and accounts to ascertain whether they are faithful, honest and intelligent in the performance of their duties. <em>Varney v. Baker, </em>194 <em>Mass. </em>239, 80 N. E. 524, 10 <em>Ann. Cas. </em>989. We must not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>lose sight of the fact that a share of stock represents capital invested, and the purchaser becomes thereby a part owner in the venture. . It would be foolhardy and unwise to say to any owner that he has no right to inquire into the value of his investment, provided his purpose be proper, unless an injury to the corporation or other stockholders could be shown in the granting of such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The evidence is voluminous. Space will not be taken to attempt to discuss each conflict thereof. A brief resume of the facts essential to a proper determination are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The respondent is a' Delaware corporation duly organized under the laws of this State in the year 1932. Its main object or purpose in business is the operation of a chain of retail stores for the sale of women\u2019s wearing apparel in the South and Middle West. The capital stock structure of the respondent has heretofore appeared under Article 4 of the charter. The relator is the registered owner of 125 shares of the Class A stock, which he received in the year 1932 as exchange for stock held by him in a New York corporation of similar name, for which he had paid the sum of $12,500. The total assets of the predecessor corporation were taken over by the respondent during 1932. At the hearing the respondent disclosed its current assets to be $1,500,000 as against its current liabilities of $1,200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The testimony further reveals that the relator made his investment in the Class A shares at the suggestion of one Louis Friedman, a mutual friend of the relator and the officers of the respondent, who guaranteed the relator that he would not suffer a loss therefrom; that from time to time the relator became in need of funds, and as of 1941, Friedman had advanced to him the sum of $8,500, and received as security the relator\u2019s stock certificate representing the 125 shares of Class A stock endorsed in blank. It was decided between the relator and Friedman in March of 1941 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>to ask the officers of the respondent to redeem the 125 shares, in order that both the relator and Friedman would have available cash. The Class A stock carried a 5% non-cumulative dividend. During the relator\u2019s tenure of ownership the dividends paid were as follows: In the year 1935 \u2014 $2.50 a share; 1936 \u2014 $5.00; 1937 \u2014 $2.50; 1939 \u2014 $2.50; 1940\u2014 $2.50. Throughout the year 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1938 no dividends were paid. The corporation during its years of existence never rendered to the relator a financial statement concerning its operation. The relator\u2019s 125 shares of the Class A stock, together with 45 shares owned by the estate of Rose, Seigfried of Saint Louis, constituted all of the Class A shares owned by persons not officers, employees or members of their respective families.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Friedman as agent of the relator held three conferences with the officers of the respondent \u2014 the first on March 8th, the second on March 11th, and the third on March 13th. The purpose for the conferences was to request that the respondent redeem the shares of the relator in accordance with the charter provisions. There is a marked difference of opinion as to what took place during these conferences. The relator contends that the officers of the respondent refused to redeem the shares, stating that the financial condition of the respondent would not justify such a course, as the corporation was just getting out of the red, was short of funds, and was entering into a dull season of the year; that the officers offered him $9,375 or 75 per cent of his investment of $12,500 for his shares, stating that they had not paid more than 50 per cent for any shares purchased by them, but, since their feeling toward the respondent was most friendly, they would offer him 75 per cent on the dollar invested; that the offer was refused as being unfair and unjust, and was an attempt on the part of the officers to deprive the relator of 25 per cent of his money honestly invested; that further negotiations concerning redemption ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The officers on the other hand admit that the financial condition of the respondent did not justify the redemption of the relator\u2019s shares as of March 13, 1941; however, they contend that they did not offer the relator $9,375 for his shares, but instead offered him $10,000, or approximately 80 per cent of his investment of $12,500, and that their reason for not offering more was that they would have to borrow the money to purchase the shares and pay interest thereon ; that they never stated to the relator, or his agent Friedman, that they paid 50 per cent for all pf the Class A shares purchased by them from others, as they paid only 50 per cent in one case, and that occurred where the owner was an employee and leaving the employment of the respondent, which occurred in the year 1933; that since 1933 they have purchased Class A shares, but paid from 90 per cent to 100 per cent on the dollar for all purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u2022 The relator contends that, since the respondent could not redeem his shares without jeopardizing its financial position, and, since the declaration and payment of dividends had been irregular, and, since he had never received a financial statement from the respondent, together with the fact that the officers\u2019 tender of purchase was considerably less than his investment, his investment was of sufficient amount to justify him in making a request to examine the books of the respondent to ascertain the true value of his shares. To this end the relator by his agent Friedman directed the following letter to the respondent on the 13th day of March, 1941:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cMarch 13th, 1941.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cThe Miller-Wohl Company, Inc.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201c112 West 38th Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cNew York City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u201cAttention: Mr. Max L.

As to the second reason advanced, I am of the opinion that the relator has proven his purpose to be proper, and I cannot conclude that his request was conceived in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">It appears to me that a fair inference to be drawn from the testimony of the officers of the respondent would be to say that the underlying reason for denying inspection was predicated upon their (the officers) lack of confidence in Mr. Lobell, the accountant selected by the relator to conduct the examination. I reach this conclusion based upon the following questions directed to the President of the respondent, and his answers thereto: \u201cQ. Why didn\u2019t you on one of those occasions (referring to letters) say, \u2018Send Mr. Lobell up and let him go over our books\u2019 ?\u201d \u201cA. Because, if you knew Mr. Lobell like I do, you would not want Mr. Lobell to go over your books.\u201d \u201cQ.. Why didn\u2019t you suggest some other accountant and say, \u2018We don\u2019t like Mr. Lobell\u2019 ?\u201d \u201cA. Mr. Friedman didn\u2019t suggest it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Concluding as I have, that the relator is entitled to examine the books of the respondent to ascertain the true value of his shares, I now reach the question as to how comprehensive such as examination should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The relator argues that such an examination should cover the years beginning with 1932 down to and including the year 1941, as he argues it might be found that more dividends should have been declared and paid to the relator covering that period, or that dividends were paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>on other shares before paying the full dividend of 5% on the Class A stock. He further argues that such an examination might reveal that the officers of the respondent may have paid themselves salaries far in excess of any sum that would be found to be reasonable. I cannot concur in the relator\u2019s argument. The petition is devoid of any allegation denoting or suggesting fraud or wrongdoing on the part of the officers of the respondent concerning their management of corporate affairs, and, further, I find no evidence that would justify me in drawing any inference that such was the case. The argument of the relator in this respect must be found to be imaginary, speculative and remote, which would not form the proper basis for such an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The relator has alleged in his petition that he is interested only in determining the true value of his shares. Such an examination should not be difficult, and the parties should be able to determine what books and records are necessary to accomplish such an end, and, further, should be able to agree upon a proper person to conduct such an audit. However, if they cannot so agree,' an order for the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus for the inspection of such books and records as will carry this opinion into effect will be signed by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
