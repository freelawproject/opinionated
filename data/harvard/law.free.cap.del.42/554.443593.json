The unreasonable necessity of - a separate action on an appeal bond in certain cases clearly led to the approval on July 2, 1925, of the latter part of the section included in brackets, passed as a portion of <em>Chap. </em>223, <em>Vol. </em>34, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>page 523, and resulting in the Statute as it now exists.</p>\n<p id=\"A20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number> The Statute has always been given a strict but reasonable construction. Thus in <em>Taylor &amp; Stayton v. Woodlen, </em>25 <em>Del. </em>(2 <em>Boyce) </em>525, 82 A. 85, the appeal was dismissed because the bond did not strictly cover the judgment appealed from. In <em>Isaacs v. Isaacs, </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>406, 154 A. 340, a motion to dismiss the appeal was refused when it appeared that th\u00e9 error in the bond did not affect the rights of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"><em>Wilson v. State, </em>19 <em>Del. </em>(3 <em>Penn.) </em>305, 51 A. 885, is strongly analogous to the pr\u00e9sent case. There the bond did not obligate the surety to pay any judgment which might be recovered against the \u201cexecutors or administrators\u201d of the appellant, as required by the Statute. The appeal was dismissed as not being \u201cin compliance with the form prescribed by the Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In the present case the bond reasonably complies with the provision of the Statute as to the older portion of the Act, but it fails utterly to comply with the latter portion in two particulars. It does not provide in any event for an entry of judgment against the \u201cexecutors or administrators-\u201d of the surety, nor provide for entry of judgment against the surety if such judgment shall be given against the \u201cexecutors or administrators\u201d of the appellant. Both of these situations are precisely covered by the statutory form of bond, and make the case strongly analogous to <em>Wilson v. State, supra. </em>There can be but little reason for failure to execute a proper bond where the exact form is fully set out in the Statute, and the use of quotation marks in the Statute is indicative of the fact that the form, as prescribed, is expected to be reasonably followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
