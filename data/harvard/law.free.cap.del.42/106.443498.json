The assessment record of the Town for the years 1940 and 1941 contained this entry: \u201cConsolidated Fisheries Company, improvement on public land, beach, $17000\u201d; and the treasurer testified that the Town made no assessment or valuation of the land itself. The tax rate was fixed at one per cent, amounting to $170.00 for each of the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendant first contends that there is a fatal uncertainty in the language of the statute arising out of the phrase, \u201cat the same rate,\u201d and that it is manifestly impossible to say whether the maximum tax rate is two per cent or six per cent; wherefore the provision should be declared void. Certainly the wording could be improved upon, but the meaning is sufficiently clear. The statute contemplated the taxation of public lands and improvements thereon whether the lands were held adversely to the Town or under lease from it at a certain rent; but there is a marked difference in the plan of taxation provided. In the first case, the lands and improvements are subjected to separate maximum rates of taxation, and there is no apparent purpose to make the value of improvements a component of the value of the land. In the second case, while the lands and the improvements clearly are to be valued separately, the value of the latter was, as is usual in the assessment of real property, intended to form a part of the value of the land. The tax base was declared to be the assessed value of the land and the value of the improvements thereon less a deduction in accordance with a stated formula. The phrase, \u201cat the same rate,\u201d clearly refers to the maximum rate of six per cent made applicable to lands held adversely to the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The formula is not .difficult to understand. The language of Section 3, Chapter 10, of the Revised Code of 1893, providing for the assessment of ground rents, which was in force at that time, was adopted almost verbatim. The rent reserved was $1312. By the formula each six dollars of rent reserved represented one hundred dollars of land value. The deduction required to be made may be found thus: $1312.00 -4- 6 X 100, or, approximately $22,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The municipal authorities, for whatever reason, made no valuation of the land,- and made no deduction. Disregarding entirely the direction of the statute, they arbitrarily established as a tax base the value of the improvements alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">An assessment is the basis of the tax. It is- the most important step of all the proceedings in taxation. In the broadest sense an assessment is a jurisdictional requirement ; and in a suit for taxes it is essential that a legal assessment be shown, for if the assessment is void so is the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">This is not an instance of a mere irregularity occurring within the limits of the taxing authority, nor is it a case of an excessive assessment. Essential statutory requirements were omitted. There was no assessment made in accordance with the law; and the pretended assessment, clearly void on its face, could be resisted in an action at law for the recovery of the tax. 3 <em>Cooley, Taxation, </em>\u00a7 1335; See <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. State of Missouri, </em>190 U. S. 412, 23 S. Ct. 730, 47 L. Ed. 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">As the judgment must be for the defendant for the reason given, it is unnecessary to consider whether, by Chapter 2, Volume 36, Delaware Laws, the Town, at the time, was without jurisdiction over the public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
