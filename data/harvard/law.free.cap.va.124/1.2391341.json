Whatever the mind receives has an effect upon it, passing with almos\u00ae infinite graduation from a mere impression to a fixed belief. The State strains every nerve to disseminate knowledge. By the diffusion of education it hopes to create a higher citizenship and to find the means of repressing vice and crime,\" but if the courts take an extreme position on this subject, and hold that every opinion shall work a disqualification for service as a juror, the administration of justice will be confided, not to the most intelligent, but to the most ignorant of our citizens. The courts, therefore, while resolute in seeing that every man shall he tried by an impartial jury, inquire into the quality and degree of the opinion, and to that end search the conscience of the juror upon his <em>voir dire, </em>and look into the sources of the information upon which his opinion rests.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b37-10\">2. <em>Juey\u2014Disqualification of Juror\u2014Opinions Formed by </em>Jurors\u2014 <em>Appeal and </em>Error.\u2014Upon the question of whether a venireman has formed such an opinion as disqualifies him from serving as a juror, great weight is justly due to the opinion of the trial judge, who sees and hears the venireman.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b37-12\">3. <em>Juey\u2014Disqualification of Juror\u2014Bias or </em>Opinion.\u2014If the examination of a juror upon his <em>vow dire </em>impresses one with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>fairness of the juror, his lack of bias or prejudice, his desire to do justice to both parties, regardless of former impressions or expressions, and of his good faith in that regard, he is a competent juror.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-5\">4. <em>Juey\u2014Disqualification of Juror\u2014Bias or </em>Opinion.\u2014Where the reading of the testimony of each juror and the cumulative 'effect of the testimony of all of them upon their <em>vow dire </em>examinations does not create a lasting impression that all the jurors stood \u201cindifferent in the cause,\u201d, a suspicion at least of unfairness or partiality is cast on the composition of the jury which tried the issue, and it is essential that the jury should be free from suspicion of unfairness or partiality.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-7\">5. <em>Juey.\u2014Qualification\u2014Bias\u2014Personal Knowledge of </em>Jurors.\u2014 Where the question at issue is the testamentary capacity of the deceased, it is not easy to see how jurors who had been intimately acquainted with the deceased for years, and some of whom had had dealings with him, could disabuse their minds of opinions as to the mental capacity of the deceased, and render a verdict solely on the evidence adduced on the trial. However honest they may have been in their belief that they could do so, the law does not put them to such a test, nor subject the administration of justice to the suspicion of partiality.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-9\">6. <em>Juey\u2014Qualification\u2014Bias\u2014Personal Knowledge of </em>Jurors.\u2014 A juror is not incompetent to serve simply because he is acquainted with one of the parties, or knows some fact or facts material to the issue. There are many facts material to the issue that are not controverted, such for instance as the <em>corpus delicti </em>in a criminal prosecution, the venue of the action, the reputation of a witness for truth and veracity, and the like, but where he has knowledge of <em>controverted </em>facts, material to the issue, which would tend to bias his opinion as a juror, and it appears from his examination on his <em>voir dire </em>that he has made up and expressed an opinion upon that question which it would require evidence to remove, he cannot be said to \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-11\">7. <em>Juey.\u2014Qualification\u2014Bias\u2014Personal Knowledge of </em>Jwrors.\u2014 A party may be able to remove impressions or opinions which are known to rest upon newspaper reports, or other hearsay evidence. Indeed, opinions based upon such foundation are rarely fixed and decided. But when based on personal knowledge of the juror of controverted facts, it is usually of such a fixed and abiding character as to place the juror in the class of those whom the statute declares do \u201cnot stand indifferent in the cause.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>8. <em>Jury\u2014Coming from Another City or County\u2014Criminal Cases \u2014Change of </em>Venue.\u2014No provision is made by statute for getting qualified jurors in a civil case from another city or county, and the power to obtain such jurors is not inherent in the court. Section 4024 of the Code of 1904 provides for such jurors in a criminal case, but not in a civil case. In the instant case if an impartial jury could not have been obtained in the city where the case was tried, appellants should have moved for a change of venue and not for a jury from another city or county.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-5\">9. <em>Jury.\u2014Special Jury\u2014Appeal and </em>Error.\u2014An application for a special jury is one addressed to the sound discretion of the ta\u2019ial court, and the action of the trial court on such a- motion will not be reversed unless it is made to appear that its discretion has been improperly exercised.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-7\">10. Presumptions and Burden of Proof\u2014Sanity\u2014Insanity.\u2014 Sanity is the normal condition of the human mind, and every man is presumed to be sane until the contrary is made to appear. After adjudication of insanity, a presumption of insanity continues, but a subsequent adjudication of restoration to sanity by competent authority restores the previous presumption of sanity until the contrary is made to appear.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-9\">11. Testamentary <em>Capacity.\u2014Burden of </em>Proof.\u2014The burden of proving testamentary capacity is on the propounder of the will and continues upon him throughout any contest on that question, but when he has shown a compliance with all the statutory requirements for the due execution of a will, the legal presumption of sanity comes to his relief and dispenses with any evidence to the contrary. The proof of due execution therefore entitles the propounder <em>prima facie </em>to have the will admitted to probate.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-11\">12. Order of <em>Proof.\u2014Discretion of Cowrt\u2014Appeal and </em>Error.\u2014 The order of introduction of evidence lies largely in the discretion of the trial court, and its ruling will not he reviewed where no prejudice or injury to the party objecting is shown.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-13\">13. Order of <em>Proof.\u2014Testamenta/ry </em>Capacity.\u2014In the instant case where the question at issue was the testamentary capacity of deceased, who had been confined in hospitals for the insane for many years, but had been discharged as restored to sanity and continued to exercise and enjoy his rights and privileges as a sane man until his death, there was no error in permitting the propounders of deceased\u2019s will to rest their case upon proof of the due execution of the will. They had the option to introduce their evidence as to the testator\u2019s sanity in chief, or in rebuttal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>14.

Testamentary Capacity.\u2014Instructions.\u2014Where the question at issue was the testamentary capacity of the deceased, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cWhile the burden of proof is upon those offering a will for probate to show testamentary capacity on the part of the testator at the time the will was executed to the satisfaction of the jury, yet the court tells the jury that there is in all cases an existing presumption in favor of the testator\u2019s sanity and capacity, which is to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining the question of competency.\u201d It is objected to this instruction that the latter part was in conflict with the first-part.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-11\"><em>Held: </em>That the jury could not have been misled in applying the instruction to the facts of the case.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-12\">17. Testamentary Capacity.-\u2014Instructions.\u2014Where the question at issue was the testamentary capacity of- the deceased, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that the testimony of credible witnesses present at the execution of the will is entitled to peculiar weight on the question of testamentary capacity and that this is especially true of attesting witnesses whose duty it is to ascertain and judge of the testator\u2019s mental capacity at the time.\u201d It was objected to this instruction that it was ^erroneous in that it commented upon the weight of the testimony of the attesting witnesses to the will and told the jury that their evidence was entitled to peculiar weight upon the question of testamentary capacity.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-15\"><em>Held: </em>That the instruction followed well established precedents, and there was nothing in the evidence in the instant case which took it out of the operation of the general rule.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Appeal from a decree of the Corporation Court of city of Staunton.

Rust, deceased, praying an issue <em>devisavit vel non </em>to determine whether a writing which has been admitted to probate as his will was the true last will and testament of the decedent. The will was contested on the ground (1) of the insanity of the testator at the time of its execution, (2) of undue influence exerted over him by the beneficiaries, and (3) of the insane delusion of the testator that his father and his father\u2019s family had placed him in insane hospitals and kept him there in order to get his estate. All of these grounds were contested by the beneficiaries under the will. If any one of them was sustained, the will would be set aside. Upon these issues the parties .went to trial before a jury. At the first trial the jury were unable to agree upon a verdict and were discharged. At the second trial, the jury found in favor of the will, and a decree was entered accordingly. From that finding and decree this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">The point most urgently insisted upon in the oral argument was that the contestants did not have a fair trial be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>fore an impartial jury of the issues involved. The persons called as jurors were severally examined on oath, as provided by section 3154 of the C\u00f3de, to ascertain if they stood \u201cindifferent in the cause.\u201d The examination of these persons, so far as pertinent to the objections raised, is given below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">H. H. Fultz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cQ. Have you formed or expressed any decided or fixed opinion in regard to the issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u201cQ. Is that opinion so decided and fixed that you on your oath do not think you could go upon the jury and give a fair and impartial verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">\u201cA. I wouldn\u2019t like to say about that. I have expressed an opinion several times, but I wouldn\u2019t like to say I couldn\u2019t go on there and give a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201cQ. What is your opinion based on\u2014what you have heard and read in the newspapers? \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-12\">\u201cQ. Were you present during the last trial of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-13\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-14\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t hear any of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-16\">\u201cQ. Then you could not say you could not go upon the jury and give a fair and impartial trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-17\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-18\">By Mr. Elder: \u201cHe has expressed an opinion and he has already formed an opinion. We think he ought not to be accepted. It will certainly take evidence to dislodge that opinion, whatever it is. We don\u2019t know what the opinion is. We don\u2019t think he, from his own statement, could make a fair juryman. I know Mr. Fultz and like him, and he may take our view of this matter, but even so, he would not be a proper juryman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>By the Court: \u201cQ. As I understand you, Mr. Fultz, your state of mind now is that you could <em>go </em>upon the jury and listen to the evidence and base your verdict upon the evidence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir, I believe I could, as far as that goes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">C.

I have expressed an opinion, but don\u2019t know whether it is decided or not, just what I know of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">\u201cQ. You have expressed an opinion, but don\u2019t know that it is decided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">\u201cA. No, sir, I don\u2019t know that it is decided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">\u201cQ. Do you feel, Mr. Shuey, that you could disregard that opinion entirely and go upon the jury, listen to the evidence and give a fair and impartial trial, based entirely upon the evidence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-12\">\u201cA Yes, sir, I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">By Mr. Fulton: \u201cQ. Do you feel biased in favor of either one or the other in the^ case from what you know about the facts and circumstances? Have you got any personal opinion now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I expect I have rather formed an opinion on one side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-15\">\u201cQ. I do not ask you which side it is, but you do feel biased on one side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I believe I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-17\">\u201cQ. Did you know Mr. Rust himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-18\">\u2022\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-19\">\u201cQ. And from the facts and information as you know them now you feel biased one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-20\">\u201cA. Very much so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-21\">By Mr. Fulton: \u201cNow the statute, your Honor, reads that if he has expressed or formed any opinion or is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>scious of any bias or prejudice\u2014Now he says he is conscious of a bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">By the Court: \u201cQ. As I understand you, Mr. Shuey, you feel that you could go upon the jury and base your verdict, not upon what you have heard in the past and not upon any opinion you have, but simply upon the evidence as you hear it from the witness stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">\u201cA. I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201cException by contestants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">R. W. Johnson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cQ.

Is that opinion of such a nature and so fixed in your mind that you could not lay it aside and go upon the jury and listen to the evidence and give a verdict based entirely upon the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201cA. Well, I haven\u2019t read of it and don\u2019t know that I could tell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">\u201cQ. I simply want to know whether you feel you could lay aside your opinion as formed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-14\">\u201cA. Yes, I could lay it aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-15\">\u201cQ. And base your verdict entirely upon the evidence as produced ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-17\">By Mr. Fulton: \u201cQ. You say, Mr. Johnson, that you knew Mr. Rust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-18\">\u201cA. I knew Mr. Rust, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-19\">\u201cQ. You heard this matter discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-20\">\u201cA. I have heard it discussed outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-21\">\u201cQ. I mean outside. This particular case to be tried you have heard discussed and from the information you have you feel you are sensitive of a bias in favor of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>side or the other\u2014you needn\u2019t tell me which side, but you feel you have an opinion one way or the other about this matter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cA. Well, I hardly know. I haven\u2019t taken enough interest in it to hardly say. That is, I have heard it discussed and discussed it off and on with people myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Have you ever expressed an opinion one way or the other about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u201cA.

I may be in error, if I am I would be g\u2019lad to be corrected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know. All I can say is that I could hear the evidence all the way through and possibly change my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">\u201cQ. It might possibly change your mind from what It is now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">\u201cQ. You are then sensitive of a bias in favor of one side or the other at this time when you go in the box?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-13\">\u201cA. In a way, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-14\">\u201cQ.

Agner, leaving the remaining seven to compose the trial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-22\">Section 3154 of the Code, under which these proceedings were taken is as follows: \u201cThe court shall, on motion of either party in any suit, examine on oath any person who is called as a juror therein to ascertain whether he is related to either party; or has any interest in the cause or has expressed or formed any opinion or is sensible of any bia\u00ae. or prejudice therein; and the party objecting to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>juror may introduce any competent evidence in support of the objection; &gt;and if it shall appear to the court that the juror does not stand indifferent in the cause, another shall be drawn or called and placed in his stead for the trial of that cause. \u2022 And in every ease the plaintiff and defendant may each challenge one juror peremptorily, where the jury consists of seven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The question for consideration is, did any one or more of this panel \u201cnot stand indifferent in the cause?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The testator was sixty-five years of age at the time of making his will and at the time of his death. He had been placed in a hospital for the insane at the age of eighteen years and had been kept in such hospitals for about thirty years almost continuously. He ha.d been discharged, however, as restored in 1899, and from that time until his death in 1917, had resided in or near the city of Staunton. He was a familiar figure on the streets of that city. He was very eccentric. He was unkempt in appearance, and generally carried a sack or bag over his shoulder which contained such articles as he chose to place therein. By his will, he gave his entire estate, estimated as worth from thirty-five to fifty thousand dollars, to strangers to his blood. There had been a trial of the case, resulting in a hung jury, about three months before the case was called for the second trial. It was under these circumstances that the jurors aforesaid were called to <em>sit on the </em>second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It would be unprofitable to review all of the decisions of this court on the subject of the competency of jurors, and if we did we should be forced to the conclusion expressed by Judge Keith in <em>McCue\u2019s Case, </em>103 Va. 870, 993, 49 S. E. 623, 626, that \u201cthe cases are not reconcilable.\u201d Among the most important cases on the subject, there may be cited <em>Wormley\u2019s Case, </em>10 Gratt. (51 Va.), 658; <em>Jackson\u2019s Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>23 Gratt. (64 Va.), 919; <em>Little\u2019s </em>Case, 25 Gratt.

E. 862; and <em>Mumford Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 </em>Bank, 116 Va. 449. We fully concur with Judge Keith in the following statement in <em>McCue\u2019s </em>Case, 103 Va.at pp. 988-9, 49 S. E. at p. 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201cThe cases upon this subject are almost without number, and they are not to be reconciled. The trend of recent decisions is in the direction of limiting, rather than extending', the disqualification of jurors by reason of mere opinion. Whatever the mind receives has an effect upon it, passing with almost infinite gradation from a mere impression to a fixed belief. The State strains- every nerve to disseminate knowledge. By the diffusion of education it hopes to create a higher citizenship and to find the means of repressing vice and crime; but if the courts take an extreme position on this subject, and hold that every opinion shall work a disqualification for service as a juror, the administration of justice will be confided, not to the most intelligent, but to the most ignorant of our citizens. The courts,, therefore, while resolute in seeing that every ma.ti shall be tried by an impartial jury, inquire into the quality and degree of opinion, and to that end search the conscience of the juror upon his <em>voir </em>dire, and look into the sources of the information upon which his opinion rests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We also concur in his statement, \u201cthat great weight is \u2022justly due to the opinion of the trial judge, who sees and hears the venireman.\u201d The subject of the weight to be attached to \u201ca <em>decided or substantial </em>opinion\u201d of a venireman is well discussed by Judge Moncure in <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>Case, 23 Gratt. (64 Va.) 919, and he finally arrives at the conclusion that \u201cthe court must determine that question in all such cases in view of all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> In the <em>McCue Case, </em>Judge Keith quotes at length the statement of the juror on his <em>voir dire, </em>and then says: \u201cNo man can read the rigid examination to which this juror was subjected without being impressed with his fairness, with his desire to deal justly by the prisoner, and with his conscientious purpose to discharge his duty as a citizen.\u201d While very general in its terms, we do not know of a better rule to test .the competency of a juror to sit on the trial of cases, civil or criminal. It certainly meets the requirements of the statute, applicable to civil cases that he shall stand \u201cindifferent in the cause.\u201d If the examination impresses you with the fairness of the juror, his lack of bias or prejudice, his desire to do justice to both parties, regardless of former impressions or expressions, and of his good faith in that regard, he is a competent juror. In the ease in judgment, the testimony of the jurors does not so impress us. We read the testimony of each juror, and ponder and consider it, and the cumulative effect of the testimony of all of them, and come away from the case with a feeling that the contestants have not had a fair trial by a jury who stood \u201cindifferent in the cause.\u201d We return and read, and re-read the testimony of the jurors in the light of the principle that great weight should be given to the opinion of the trial judge, who has seen and heard the jurors, 'and by a strained effort, taking the testimony of each juror separately, we get the impression that possibly or even probably the jurors did \u201cstand indifferent in the cause,\u201d but the impression is not lasting, and we again revert to our former conclusion. It is absolutely essential of course, to the proper administration of justice, that the tribunal which is to administer it should be. fair and impartial. It is hardly less essential that it should be free from the suspicion of unfairness or partiality. The avoidance of all appearance of injustice, and as far as possible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of ail doubt on the subject, is necessary for a proper respect for the administration of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Most of the cases in this jurisdiction involving the competency of jurors have been criminal cases, where the issue involved was the guilt or innocence of the accused, concerning\" which the juror had made up and expressed \u00a1an opinion based on what he had heard or read of the case, and the inquiry has generally been as to the nature or character of that opinion. But here one of the issues was the capacity to make a will and one of the questions involved was how far the jurors had, by words or conduct, made up or expressed opinions on that issue. The testator was not only a familiar figure on the streets of the city from which the jury was drawn, but two of the panel from which the jury was selected, Agner and Bickle, had business transactions with him, one of them renting his property and the other \u201chad transactions with him in the store, selling him goods,\u201d thereby in the most positive way affirming his capacity to contract. They would have placed themselves in a very awkward position to affirm by their verdict that he did not have the capacity to make a will. Another juror, Shuey,, had expressed an opinion from <em>\u201cjust what I </em>know1 <em>of him/3 </em>and while he felt that he could \u201cdisregard that opinion entirely and go upon the jury, listen to the evidence and give a fair and impartial trial, based entirely upon the evidence,\u201d yet, even after thus an-swearing, on cross-examination, he gives the follewing testimony :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cQ. Bo you feel biased in favor of either one or the other in the case from what you know about the facts and circumstances? Have you got any personal opinion now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cA. I expect I have rather formed an opinion on one side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cQ. I do not ask you which side it is, but you do feel \u2022 biased on one side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cA. Yes, I believe I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cQ. Did you know Mr. Rust himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cQ. And from the facts and information as you <em>know them now </em>you feel biased one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cA. <em>Very much so, yes</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">To the same effect is the testimony of R. W. Johnson, another juror, but who was stricken from the panel. The testimony of Agner, another juror, who was stricken from the panel, will not be considered, for reasons hereinafter set forth. Another juror, Day, was not a mere acquaintance of the deceased, but seems to have been intimate with him. Deceased was at his place \u201ca good deal\u201d and he \u201cknew him very well in \u00a1a business way.\u201d This juror was \u201cfrank to say\u201d that he had \u201cformed an opinion about this matter\u201d and was \u201csensible of an opinion or a conviction one way or the other at this time that would take evidence to change.\u201d The subject of the contest had been a matter of general discussion in the city, and he had frequently discussed it himself, and had also heard others discuss it. It is true that he, like other jurors, declared that he could discard his preconceived opinion and base his verdict solely on the evidence in the cause, but, as said, in a different connection, by Staples, J., in <em>Wright\u2019s Case, </em>32 Gratt. (73 Va.) 941, 944, \u201csuch a man may persuade himself that he is impartial, but the law does not so regard him. Unconsciously to himself, it may be, his prejudices may follow him into the jury box, and influence and control his judgment there.\u201d It is not easy to see how jurors who had been intimately acquainted with the deceased for years, and some of whom had had dealings with him, could disabuse their minds of opinions as to the men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u25a0tal capacity of the deceased, and render a verdict solely on the evidence adduced on the trial. However honest they may have been in their belief that they could do so, the law does not put them to such a test, nor subject the administration of justice to the suspicion of partiality. H. H. Fultz, another juror, had made up or expressed a <em>\u201cdecided or fixed opinion </em>in regard to the issue.\u201d How far this statement was qualified by subsequent statements made on his <em>voir dire </em>appears from his testimony herein-before set forth. His examination previous to the last \u2022question asked him did not sufficiently show that he stood '\u2018indifferent in the cause.\u201d Whether his answer to the last question propounded to him rendered him competent is doubtful. Rut the cumulative effect of doubt and uncertainty attaching to the competency of so many of the .jurors cannot be overlooked, and at least casts a suspicion of unfairness or partiality on the composition of the jury which tried the issue. The matter at issue, the mental condition of the testator, was a matter largely within the personal knowledge of the jurors, and their minds were naturally affected by that knowledge. It would hardly be contended that one who had witnessed an assault would be a competent juror to try the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> We do not mean to say that a juror is incompetent to serve simply because he is acquainted with one of the parties, or knows some fact or facts material to the issue. There are many facts material to the issue that are not controverted, such for instance as the <em>corpus delicti </em>in a criminal prosecution, the venue of the action, the reputation of a witness for truth and veracity, and the like, but where he has knowledge of <em>controverted </em>facts; material to the issue, which would tend to bias his opinion as a juror, and it appears from his examination on his <em>voir dire </em>that he has made up and expressed an opinion upon that ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tion which it would require evidence to remove, he cannot be said to \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stentz, </em>30 Wash. 134, 70 Pac. 241, 63. L. R. A. 807; <em>Vance </em>v. <em>State, </em>56 Ark. 402, 19 S. W. 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">As said in <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>State, </em>66 Ark. 53, 48 S. W. 904, \u201cWhen it is apparent that the juror has formed an opinion from his own knowledge of the facts of a case, or that from his connection with the prosecution or defense, he is not an impartial juror, his statement that he can give the defendant a fair and impartial trial will not remove the objection to his incompetency, for it is possible that the most prejudiced man might be willing to say, and even believe,, that he would be 'an impartial juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> We adhere to the opinion in the <em>McCue Case, supra, </em>as to the character of opinions which should exclude a juror from service, but as pointed out in that opinion it is necessary not only to inquire into the quality and degree of the opinion of the juror, but also to \u201clook into the sources of the information upon which his opinion rests.\u201d A party may be able to remove impressions or opinions which are known to rest upon newspaper reports, or other hearsay evidence. Indeed, opinions based upon such foundation are rarely fixed and decided. But when based on personal knowledge of the juror of controverted facts, it is usually of such a fixed and abiding character as to place .the juror in the class of those whom the statute declares do \u201cnot stand indifferent in the cause.\u201d The mental capacity of the testator was the prime issue in the cause, and that issue should not have been submitted to the determination of jurors who had made up and expressed opinions on the subject from their intimate acquaintance and business relations with the testator. No man would like to admit that he could not do justice in a; case which he is to try under the sanction of an oath, and he may be ever so honest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>in his statement that he can do justice, notwithstanding his previously expressed opinion, but where the foundation of that opinion is personal knowledge of the facts in controversy, neither the juror nor the litigants should be subjected to that hazard. The statute assures to the parties a panel of nine persons free from legal exception, and after such &gt;a panel has been obtained, then \u201cthe plaintiff and the defendant may each challenge one juror peremptorily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> Application was made to the trial court for a jury from another county or city, on the ground that an impartial jury could not be obtained in the city of Staunton. The 'application was refused and the refusal is assigned as error. The case had been previously tried in the city of Staunton and there had been a hung jury. The record does not disclose that there had been any difficulty in getting an impartial jury in the city at that time, and, 'aside from affidavits filed by the appellants, it does not appear that a second impartial jury could not be obtained in the city. If the court had power to grant the application, It was in its discretion to refuse it until, by an effort in that behalf, it had been made to appear that an impartial jury could not be obtained. But the court had no such power. The method of selecting those who are to serve as jurors for the year and of drawing them for service as needed is particularly prescribed by statute (Code, sections 3142 to 3146, incl.), but no provision is made by statute for getting qualified jurors in a civil case from another city or county and the power to obtain such jurors is not inherent in the court. Section 4024 of the Code provides for such jurors in a criminal case, but not in a civil case. If an impartial jury could not be obtained in the city of Staunton, appellants should have moved for a change of venue in accordance with the provisions of section 3316 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> The refusal of the trial court to grant the appellants\u2019 application for a special jury is also assigned as error. The application was one addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and appellants have failed to point out any error in the action of the trial court, or how they were injured by its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Indeed, the position of the appellants, both in the trial court and in this court, was and is that no impartial jury, regular or special, could be obtained in the city of Staunton. The action of the trial court on such a motion will not be reversed unless it is made to appear that its discretion has been improperly exercised. <em>Southern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>102 Va. 710, 47 S. E. 862; <em>Lemons </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>115 Va. 809, 80 S. E. 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">It is also assigned as error that the trial court refused to quash the <em>venire facias </em>on the grounds that the jury were not selected, drawn and impanelled as required by the statute. As the case has to be reversed on other grounds and the alleged error is not likely to occur on another trial, it is not necessary to consider this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><bracketnum>[10, 11, 12, 13]</bracketnum> It is also assigned as error that the trial court refused \u201cto compel the proponents of the will to put on all their evidence in chief as to the sanity of Rust, it having appeared from the evidence they offered that Rust had been previously insane and was afflicted with \u2018general insanity\u2019 before and at the time when the will was written.\u201d Rust had been confined in hospitals for the insane for nearly thirty years prior to the year 1899, but in that year he was discharged as restored to sanity and continued to exercise and enjoy his rights and privileges' as a sane man until his death in 1917. Sanity is the normal condition of the human mind, and every man is presumed to be sane until the contrary is made to appear. After adjudication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>insanity, a presumption of insanity continues, but a subsequent adjudication of restoration to sanity by competent authority restores the previous presumption of sanity until the contrary is made to appear. Such was the case in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The burden of proving testamentary capacity is on the propounder of the will and continues upon him throughout any contest on that question, but when he has shown a compliance with all the statutory requirements for the due execution of a will, the legal presumption of sanity comes to his relief and dispenses with any evidence to the contrary. The proof of due execution therefore entitles the propounder <em>prima facie </em>to have the will admitted to probate. <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>3 Rand. (24 Va.) 399; <em>Wallen </em>v. <em>Wallen, </em>107 Va. 131, 57 S. E. 596; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Wampler, </em>108 Va. 705, 62 S. E. 926, and cases cited; <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Lunsford, </em>31 W. Va. 659, 8 S. E. 493, 2 L. R. A. 668. There was no error, therefore, in permitting the propounders of the will to rest their case upon proof of the due execution of the will. They had the option to introduce their evidence as to the testator's sanity in chief, or in rebuttal. Furthermore, no injury is shown to have been sustained by the appellants by reason of the order in which the evidence was introduced. The order of introduction of evidence lies largely in the discretion of the trial court, and its ruling will not be reviewed where no prejudice or injury to the party objecting is shown. <em>Ches. &amp; O. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>115 Va. 32, 78 S. E. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><bracketnum>[14]</bracketnum> The petition for appeal contains the following assignment of error: \u201cYour petitioners further represent that the verdict of the jury should be set aside because the court erred in giving instructions 1 and 12, inclusive, for the proponents, for reasons apparent on the face of those instructions, and because the instructions were not applicable to the evidence in the case.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>This assignment of error will not be. considered because the petition does not point out the error complained of. <em>Worley </em>v. <em>Mathieson A. Works, </em>119 Va. 862, 89 S. E. 880, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><bracketnum>[15]</bracketnum> The trial court gave twenty-seven instructions, on the motion of the appellants and twelve on the motion of the appellees. The appellants complain specifically of instructions 1, 3, 4 and 7, given for the appellees. The ground of objection to instructions 1 and 7 is not set forth with sufficient certainty to require consideration by this court. <em>Worley </em>v. <em>Mathieson A. Works, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><bracketnum>[16]</bracketnum> Instruction 3 was as follows: \u201cWhile the burden of proof is upon those offering a will for probate, to show testamentary capacity on the part of the testator at the time the will was executed to the satisfaction of the jury, yet the court tells the jury that there is in all cases an existing presumption in favor of the testator\u2019s sanity and capacity, which is to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining the question of competency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The objection to this instruction is that the latter part of it is in conflict with the first part. The first part told the jury that the burden of proof was upon those offering the will to show testamentary capacity, while the latter part told the jury that there is in all cases an existing presumption in favor of the testator\u2019s sanity and capacity. We have already pointed out, in another connection, the rule applicable, to the presumption of sanity and do not deem it necessary to say more in this connection than that the jury could not have been misled in applying the instruction to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\"><bracketnum>[17]</bracketnum> Instruction 4 was as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that the testimony of credible witnesses present at the execution of the will is entitled to peculiar weight on the question of testamentary capacity and that this is especially true of attesting witnesses whose duty it is to ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tain and judge of the testator\u2019s mental capacity at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The objection to this instruction is that it \u201cwas erroneous in that it commented upon the weight of the testimony of the attesting witnesses to the will and told the jury \u2018that their evidence was entitled to peculiar weight upon the question of testamentary capacity.\u2019 \u201d The instruction follows well established precedent and is in the exact language of instruction \u201cP,\u201d approved by this court in <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>115 Va. 74, 78 S. E. 573. We do not think there is anything in the evidence in the case in judgment winch takes it out of the operation oj the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As the -case has to be remanded for a new trial for the reasons hereinbefore stated, it would be improper for this court to consider the ruling of the trial court on the motion of appellants to set aside the verdict because contrary to the evidence as the evidence may be different on another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u2022 For the reasons hereinbefore stated,, the verdict of the jury on the issue <em>devismit vel non </em>will be set aside, and the decree of the Corporation Court of the city of Staunton, based thereon, will be reversed, and the cause remanded' to said corporation court for a new trial of said issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
