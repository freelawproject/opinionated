It is further agreed that he was not the owner, or the landlord, of the land hunted over by him, nor was he a member of the families of the owners and landlords of said land, nor was he a tenant or renter residing on said land. It is further agreed that the sole question before the court is whether or not a license is required in order to engage in fox hunting in this State, and that the defendant does not come within any exemption of the Virginia game laws, unless under the provisions thereof one may engage in fox hunting without first procuring ,a license to hunt. It is further agreed that said defendant was hunting without the consent of the landlord over whose land he hunted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It thus appears that the question for our determination is whether one who engages in fox hunting in this State is a \u201cperson who hunts\u201d within the meaning of section 82 of the act in question. So much of that section as is pertinent to this inquiry reads as follows: \u201cHunting without license prohibited. Any person who hunts outside of the limits of his own or the adjoining property\u2014without first obtaining a license permitting him to do so\u2014shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than five nor more than twenty-five dollars * *</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, p. 967, \u201cHunting\u201d is defined to be \u201cthe act of pursuing and taking wild animals; the chase.\u201d Webster\u2019s International defines \u201cHunt:\u201d To search for or follow after, as game or wild animals; to chase; to pursue for the purpose of catching or killing; to' follow with dogs or guns for sport or exercise; as, to hunt a deer. To follow the chase; to go out in pursuit of game; to course with hounds.\u201d So, in the New Standard Dictionary of the English Language, it is defined: \u201cTo pursue for the purpose of killing or catching; as to hunt the lion; to take part in the chase for sport or exercise; as, to <em>hunt the fox </em>(Italics added) ; to go in pursuit of wild animals for food, or feather; * * So we find: \u201cFox hound\u2014one of a breed of dogs trained for fox hunting; \u201cFox hunter\u201d and \u201cFox hunt\u2014to chase the fox with hounds.\u201d These authorities are quite sufficient to show that the statute plainly embraces a person who engages in fox hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Moreover, we think the act furnishes internal evidence that section 32 was intended to include fox hunters within the class who are required to take out licenses for the privilege of engaging in that sport. Section 33 of the act provides that \u201cif the owner of any premises shall post notices thereon, in conspicuous places, stating that hunting there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>on without written permission is prohibited, then any person who hunts on such lands during that current year without first having obtained from the owner or agent thereof permission in writing to do so, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be fined not less than five nor more than twenty-five dollars; provided, that if the owner or agent of such lands shall at the trial request the remittance of the penalty, the trial judge shall so order. <em>Provided that this section shall not apply to coon, opossum, beaver, skunk, fox or deer huntersP </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">If the legislature had not intended to include fox hunters within the provisions of section 32, it would either have expressly excepted them from its operation or else would not have declared that section 33 should not apply to them. Besides, the exception to the above section is manifestly intended to make available to the class of hunters to which it applies the benefit of the license which they are required to obtain. For it is a matter of common knowledge that if the animals referred to in the exception could not be followed beyond the limits of the premises upon which they are started, in most cases the chase would be bootless and the license without value to the possessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The statute imposes a general license tax upon all persons who hunt, and any exception thereto must be strictly construed, and those claiming to come within such exemption must make it clearly appear. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynchburg </em>Y. <em>M. </em>C. <em>A., </em>115 Va. 745, 80 S. E. 589, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is also a fundamental rule of statutory construction that words used in an act are to be given their natural and ordinary meaning, unless it plainly appears that they are used in some other sense.
