The conveyance will be held to be a release of all damages which would be presumed to be included in the award of damages if the property had been condemned. The grantor, therefore, cannot recover for any damages to the remainder of his land which result from a proper construction, use and operation of works upon the property conveyed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b290-10\">3. <em>Railroads\u2014Conveyance of Land for Right of Way\u2014Injury to Other Property of Grantor by Construction of Railroad\u2014Eminent </em>Domain.\u2014The rule stated in the preceding syllabus covers all damages to the residue of the tract, where a part of a tract is taken by condemnation proceedings, or is conveyed, for a right of way for a railroad, which are due to the construction and operation of the railroad on a grade different from the natural surface of the land, because of the erection of an embankment on the right of way on such a part of the land which does not physically impinge upon or upheave the land adjacent to the right of way, or - deprive it of lateral soil support, of violate the riparian or surface water rights of the owner thereof; unless the railroad company has limited itself to a particular grade or method of construction and operation, or the damages have been assessed, in the case of condemnation, or paid, in the case of a purchase and conveyance, upon the basis of such limitation. In the absence of such limitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>all damages, past, present and future, to the residue of such real estate due to such construction and operation are presumed to have been included in the award of damages in a condemnation proceeding, and in the consideration paid therefor in case of a conveyance.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-5\">4. Eminent <em>Domain\u2014Profile Filed With Petition\u2014Damages to Adjoining </em>Landowners.\u2014For a number of years there has been a general statute in Virginia which in condemnation proceedings requires all companies exercising, the right of eminent domain to file with the petition a plat of the survey of the right of way proposed to be taken, with a profile showing the cuts and fills, etc., which enforces upon such companies a fixing of a limitation upon the grade line differing from that of the natural surface of the land to which they propose to construct their works and upon which they propose to operate their trains. Such limitation forms a basis for the assessment of damages by the commissioners in the condemnation proceeding, and such a company, if it afterward desires to change or adopt a substantially different grade, must obtain authority therefor, either by purchase or by further condemnation proceedings; otherwise, it will, in subsequent actions therefor, be liable for damages occasioned to property owners affected by such change of grade of the construction or operation thereon of its works.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-7\">5. Eminent <em>Domain\u2014Profile Filed With Petition\u2014Damages to Adjoining Landowners\u2014Damage to Residue of </em>Land.\u2014A railroad company, in the absence of such a statute as that mentioned in the preceding syllabus or of a similar requirement in its charter, at the time of the location and acquisition of the right of way, on a parcel of land which is a part of a larger tract, having acquired a right of way of a certain width by condemnation proceedings, is, as between it and the owner of the residue of such tract of land, and those in privity of estate with the latter, bound by no limitation upon the height to which it may construct its works thereon and operate the same, and change such height of construction and operation thereon of its trains from time to time, except such limitation as may arise from its duty to keep within the reasonable requirements of the discharge of its duties as a public service corporation and the further requirement of law that such construction and operation shall be done in a reasonably skillful and proper manner.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-9\">6. <em>Kailroads\u2014Conveyance for Right of Way\u2014Damage to Residue of </em>Property.\u2014There being no statute enforcing upon railroad companies a fixing of a limitation upon the construction and operation of its works prior to its purchase of a right of way, unless it voluntarily does so, a conveyance to it of land for its right of way will operate-to confer upon it, as between it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the grantor and those in privity of estate with the latter, the unlimited right of construction and operation of its works upon the land conveyed, at such height from the natural surface of the ground as its requirements and a reasonably skillful manner of construction and operation from time to time may dictate.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-5\">7. <em>Railroads\u2014Conveyance of Right of Way\u2014Damage to Residue of Property\u2014Construction of </em>Deed.\u2014In the instant case a deed to a railroad company of a tract of land, although in fee simple, was made directly to the railroad company as grantee, and in view also of what is stated in the deed on the subject of the line of railroad which was not then in existence, and of what is shown on the \u201cPlan\u201d made a part of the deed, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that it appears on the face of the deed that the conveyance was of a right of way for the proposed railroad of the grantee; especially in view also of the statute law of this State, which requires a railroad company to purchase the land for its right of way, if it can agree with its owner upon the price and terms therefor.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-7\">8. <em>Railroads\u2014Right of Way\u2014Construction of Deed\u2014Fee </em>Simple.\u2014 That a conveyance is of the fee has no significance upon the question of whether it is a right of way for a railroad, since under our eminent domain statute the company obtains title to its right of way in fee by condemnation proceedings. 9. <em>Deeds\u2014Construction\u2014Deed Drawn by </em>Grantee.\u2014Where a deed to a railroad is drawn by the grantee or its agent, the rule is that \u201cany doubt as to its true meaning should be solved adversely to the company.\u201d But this rule has to do merely with the meaning of ambiguous language in the deed, and cannot at all affect a rule of law applicable to the proper construction of a deed about the language of which there is no ambiguity.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-11\">10. <em>Railroads\u2014Right of Way\u2014Profile Filed With Deed\u2014Knowledge of </em>Grantor.\u2014To a deed of land to a railroad company prepared by the railroad a plan showing a profile of the proposed road was annexed and expressly made a part of the deed by the language of the deed itself.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-13\"><em>Held: </em>That the grantor was as much bound by and affected with constructive knowledge of what is shown on such \u201cPlan\u201d as she was with knowledge of any other contents of the deed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-15\">11. <em>Railroads\u2014Right of Way\u2014Damage to Other Land of Landowner From Whom </em>Acquired.\u2014The rule is well settled that while an award of damages in a condemnation proceeding to take a part of a tract of land will be presumed to include damages to the residue of that tract, due to the construction'and operation on the part of the land taken, such award will not he presumed to include other damages to such residue of land due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>to the construction and operation of the company\u2019s works on a different, or on part of a different tract of land not involved in such condemnation proceeding.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b293-5\">12.

Eminent <em>Domain\u2014Award, Damages Including\u2014Damages to Other Property of </em>Landowner.\u2014A landowner owned a life interest in a tract of land, part of which was taken by a railroad company in eminent domain proceedings.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b293-13\"><em>Held: </em>That under subsection 23 of section 1105-f, Code of 1904, the award of damages in these proceedings did not bar the landowner\u2019s action for recovery of alleged damages to another tract of land owned by her in fee upon which her dwelling house was situated, by reason of the construction by the railroad company of its works on the land taken, and its subsequent opera/tion of its trains thereon, and also by reason of the changing of the grade of a public road, it not appearing that the commissioners had considered and passed upon such damages to the landowner.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b293-14\">16. Eminent Domain <em>Proceedings\u2014Damages\u2014Report of Commis</em>sioners.\u2014It would be easy enough in all cases of condemnation for the commissioners to state in their report specifically what cases they in fact consider on the question of damages and the results of their action, whether in awarding or denying the award of damages, in each case considered, so that when any subsequent suit for damages is instituted the report may be turned to for evidence upon the question of whether such damages have or have not been considered and passed upon in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>condemnation proceeding. Such a procedure would be but fair alike to companies exercising the right of eminent domain and to property owners affected. And that the report of the commissioners should measure up to such requirements is the true intent and meaning of the eminent domain statute. Only by such a procedure can such companies be freed from the danger of hieing vexed with suits for damages which have been awarded and paid, and property owners be relieved from the danger of the effort being made to deprive them of their right to have their <em>bona fide </em>claims of damages in fact passed upon and adjudicated, so that such property right may not be taken away without due process of law by some constructive adjudication which never in truth occurred.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appomattox county, in an action of trespass on the case.

The dwelling house land of the plaintiff lay to the north of and within the angle formed by the junction of those public roads, and the south-side of such dwelling house land lay along the Pamplin-Charlotte C.

H. road therewith, aforesaid, along the boundary line dividing it from, the dwelling house tract and from lot A. It appears from the record that after making such conveyance the plaintiff forgot that she had retained a life estate in it and that Mrs. J. Y. Spencer, mother of said infant, became the tenant of the Spencer tract in right of her said son.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">The plaintiff had lived for many years in the dwelling house aforesaid prior to and was living therein at the time of the institution of this action, but did not occupy or use the Spencer tract, as aforesaid, as must be inferred from the evidence for the railroad company in the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The railroad company, something over a month before said conveyance to it of lot A, when the situation of the title and the possession of the lot and of the dwelling house land and of the Spencer tract was, as aforesaid, proceeded under the statute contained in Acts of 1915 (extra session), p. 11, to locate and obtain th\u00e9 right of way for a connecting line between two points, Burkeville and Pamplin, on its existing main line for the more efficient and economical transportation of traffic between said two points, which the duty resting upon it as a public service corporation required it to. transport. Such right of way as located by the railroad company took therefor said lot A and a portion of the Spencer tract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-4\">On April 28, 1915, the railroad company, by <em>ex parte </em>proceedings under the statute, sub-section 3 of section 1294-b of Pollard\u2019s Code, 1904, obtained from the board of supervisors of the county of Appomattox, in which the same is located, their consent to a change of location of the Darlington Heights public road where it passed along in front of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house land and bounded lot A, such change consisting in the abandonment of that location for such road and the relocation of it so as to extend it from the junction, or intersection of the Pamplin-Charlotte C. H. road therewith, aforesaid, thence almost due west, over the Spencer tract of land, across the proposed location of the right of way of the railroad company thereon, by an under-grade crossing, and thence, after reaching the western edge of the proposed right of way aforesaid on the Spencer Tract, proceeding along such edge of such right of way until it reached and passed into the former location of said Darlington Heights road where it passed the northwest comer of lot A, thence going in a northerly direction towards Pamplin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">The railroad company in this proceeding, filed before the board of supervisors plats and profiles showing such change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of location of the county road; the height of the embankment for its railroad which it proposed to construct at such under-grade crossing (which was some 15 feet in height at that point), and the height of such embankment .which it proposed to construct thence along the right of way it proposed to acquire across the Spencer tract and across said lot A (such embankment being from about 15 to 8V2 feet high from the natural surface of the ground, as it passed along in front of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house). Such plats and profiles also showed that the grade of the Pamplin-Charlotte C.

The plats and profiles filed by the railroad company with such proceeding showed the height above the surface of the ground of the embankment it proposed to construct for its line of railroad along the right of way aforesaid in front of the dwelling house of the plaintiff on the Spencer tract and the proposed under-grade crossing and the lowering of the grade of the Pamplin-Charlotte C. H. road as it passed along the side of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house land as aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">After the commissioner\u2019s report aforesaid was filed, to-wit, on June 22, 1915, an order of said judge was entered in vacation appointing a commissioner to enquire and report, among other things, what persons were entitled to the said sum of $1,500.00 and in what proportions. Such commissioner issued a notice to the plaintiff and to Mrs. J. Y. Spencer, J. Y. Spencer, her husband, and Jack Spencer, of the pendency of such proceeding before him under such order. Legal service of such notice was accepted by Mr. Franklin, an attorney at law, as attorney for \u201call the defendants\u201d in such proceeding. The commissioners reported, in substance, that the plaintiff owned a life estate in the said Spencer tract of land, and the commuted value of it and that Jack Spencer was the owner in fee of such land in remainder after the life estate therein of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Some time in July, 1915, as it would seem from the contents thereof (the precise date not appearing from the record) , an order was entered by said judge of the court below m said Spencer land condemnation proceeding under said subsection 9 of section 1105-f, 3 of Pollard\u2019s Code, 1910, reciting among other things, that the railroad company had paid into court the $1,500 aforesaid, and the order ratified, confirmed and approved the proceedings and reports of the commissioners in all respects, directed the report to be recorded as provided by law, and dismissed the proceedings from the docket, with provision that the court, however, retained \u201cjurisdiction to direct the distribution of said fund according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">By order entered October, 1915, the said judge, after directing the payment of certain costs and expenses, decreed that $747.73 of said $1,500 be paid to the plaintiff as the present value of her life estate in such sum of money, which .was accordingly paid over to Mr. Franklin, as her attorney, and by him subsequently paid over to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">It appears from Mr. Franklin\u2019s testimony in the record that he was present at the meeting of the commissioners above mentioned on June 3, 1915, in the Spencer land condemnation proceeding, and that he then represented the plaintiff as her attorney at law, not at her request, but, as he testifies, because the plaintiff had consulted him \u201ctime and again and perhaps nearly every time she has any trouble, for that matter,\u201d and that he wrote the deed from plaintiff conveying the Spencer tract of land, as aforesaid, to Jack Spencer, and \u201cknew that there was a reservation of a life estate in that deed,\u201d and, as such witness, further testified: \u201cSo, when I. appeared there * * * I was representing Miss Dora\u201d (the plaintiff) \u201cbecause I knew that Miss Dora did not know and Mrs. Spencer did not seem to know, and-I don\u2019t reckon she did, that she had a life estate in it, so the commissioners just went through and adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>what you all, you\u201d (addressing counsel for the railroad company) \u201cand Mrs. Spencer had already agreed on, $1,-500.00.\u201d This witness, also, testified that no question was considered by the commissioners in arriving at the $1,500 damages which they reported, as aforesaid, in the Spencer land condemnation proceeding \u201cwith reference to anything except the damage to that particular piece of land of Jack Spencer\u2019s, and you had agreed upon that beforehand.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\"

Does the consent of a board of supervisors, under subsection 8 of section 1294-b (1 Pollard\u2019s Code, 1904), to a change of location of a public road by a railroad company shield the latter from liability for such damages, if any, as such change may cause to the owner or occupant of any lands?</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">This question must be answered in the negative. Such statute expressly provides that the company exercising such privileges \u201cshall make proper compensation for such damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Indeed, we do not understand that the railroad company disputes the correctness of the conclusion just stated, although its plea No. 2 (quoted in the above statement), filed in the case by leave of court over the objection of -the plaintiff, raised such question in the trial court, and one of the assignments of error presents it to us for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The positions of the railroad company before us on this subject \u00e1re, in substance, that while the plaintiff, as an original proposition, was entitled to demand and receive of it just compensation for such damages, that compensation therefor was in fact included (along with compensation for many other claims of damages) in the consideration which the railroad company paid the plaintiff for her deea to it (quoted in the above statement), and that such deed will be construed to have released all claim of the plaintiff-for such damages; or that if this be not so, that such damages were either included in the $150 item of award of damages made by the commissioners in the Spencer land condemnation proceeding (set forth in the above statement) , or that such award operated as an estoppel against any subsequent claim for such damages, and that all claims of the plaintiff therefor are barred by such proceeding by reason of the eminent domain statute law on the subject, hereinbelow more specifically set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">These positions will be hereinafter dealt with.-</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> 2. Did the deed above mentioned, when properly construed, operate as a release by the plaintiff of the claims of damages made in her original and amended declaration in this case, which were due to the construction of the railroad company, on lot A, of the embankment for its railroad and the operation of its trains thereon ?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">A summarized statement of such claims of damages will appear from the statement preceding this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">It is well settled that if it be a fact that the land conveyed by the deed under consideration (which is shown on the diagram above as \u201clot A\u201d) was conveyed to the railroad company as a right of way for its proposed railroad, the deed vested in the railroad company the same rights as though lot A had been acquired for that purpose by condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u201cThe conveyance will be held to be a release of all damages which would be presumed to be included in the award of damages if the property had been condemned. The grantor, therefore, cannot recover for any damages to the remainder of his land which result from a proper construction, use and operation of works upon the property conveyed.\u201d 2 Lewis on Em.

In the absence of such limitation, all damages past, present and future to the residue of such real estate due to such construction and operation are presumed to have been included in the award of damages in a condemnation proceeding, and in the consideration paid therefor in case of a conveyance. 2 Lewis on Em.

Cas. 622, rests upon the same presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is true that for a number of years there has been a general statute in Virginia which, in condemnation proceedings, requires all companies exercising the right of eminent domain to file with the petition a plat of the survey of the right of way proposed to be taken, with a profile-showing the cuts and fills, etc., which enforces upon such-companies a fixing of a limitation upon the grade line differing from that of the natural surface of the land to which they propose to construct their works and upon which they propose to operate their trains. Such limitation forms a basis for the assessment of damages by the commissioners in the condemnation proceeding, and such a company, if it afterward desires to change or adopt a substantially different grade, must obtain authority therefor, either by pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>chase or by further condemnation proceedings; otherwise, it will, in subsequent action therefor, be liable for damages occasioned to property owners affected by such change of grade of the construction or operation thereon of its works.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> A railroad company, in the absence of such statute or of a similar requirement in its charter, at the time of the location and acquisition of the right of way, on a parcel of land which is a part of a larger tract, having acquired a right of- way of a certain width by condemnation proceedings, is, as between it and the owner of the residue of such tract of land, and those in privity of estate with the latter, bound by no limitation upon the height to which it may construct its works thereon and operate the same, and change such height of construction and operation thereon, of its trains from time to time, except such limitation as may arise from its duty to keep within the reasonable requirements of the discharge of its duties as a public service corporation and the further requirement of law that such construction and operation shall be done in a reasonably skillful and proper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> There being no statute enforcing upon railroad companies a fixing of a limitation upon the construction and operation of its works prior to its purchase of a right of way, unless it voluntarily does so, a conveyance to it of land for its right of way will operate to confer upon it, as between it and the grantor and those in privity of estate with the latter, as aforesaid, the unlimited right of construction and operation of its works upon the land conveyed, at such height from the natural surface of the ground as its requirements aforesaid and reasonably skillful manner of construction and operation from time to time may dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Some of the decisions hold, as indicated above, but not \u2022without conflict of authority, that, notwithstanding a condemnation or conveyance of a right of way for a railroad company, unlimited as to the right of construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>railroad thereon at any grade at variance with the natural surface of the ground, there is nevertheless a limitation imposed upon the railroad company\u2019s right of construction of its works in certain particulars, which is the same as that upon the rights of ordinary proprietors of land, namely, that the railroad company cannot, any more than an ordinary owner of land, by construction of works upon its right of way, do any actionable injury to an adjacent landowner by depriving the soil of the adjacent land of support, or by interfering with the flow of running streams thereon, or with the surface-water rights of the adjacent landowner, without liability to him for damages, in addition to those awarded in the condemnation proceedings, or covered by a consideration for a conveyance. See 2 Lewis on Em. Dom., <em>supra, </em>especially secs. 110-114, 818, 820, 824, 826. But since there is no allegation in the pleadings of the plaintiff in the instant case of any injuries caused by deprivation of lateral soil support to her land adjacent to the right of way of the railroad company, nor of interference with any riparian water rights in any flowing stream thereon; and since there is no proof in the case of any violation of surface-water rights, although there is, as noted in the above statement of the case, an allegation in the declaration of the violation of the latter rights of the plaintiff on her adjacent land, we are relieved of the duty of entering upon any consideration of the precise limits of such rights as are mentioned in this paragraph, or of how far they may furnish exceptions to the rule we have under consideration as to the effect of a deed to a railroad company conveying to it a right of way for its railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">But the plaintiff contends that it cannot be said that the deed in the instant case was for a right of way for the railroad company, that it is but an ordinary conveyance to it as the grantee of land in fee, with a description of the boundaries thereof, and conferred no other rights upon the rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>road company with respect to the use thereof than any individual grantee has, namely, to hold and use the land subject to the law applicable to adjoining proprietors of land and of the maxim <em>sic utere tuo ut alienum, non laedas, </em>and the following authorities are cited to sustain such position, viz: <em>Pettit </em>v. <em>Jamestown, etc., R. </em>Co. 222 Pa. 490, 71 Atl. 1048, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 322-3; Lewis on Em. Dom., <em>supra </em>(sec. 820); <em>Beaty </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., </em>6 W. Va. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In the <em>Pettit Case </em>cited, the deed was to an individual as \u201ctrustee,\u201d not stating for whom the grantee was \u201ctrustee,\u201d so that it did not appear on the face of the deed that the conveyance was to a railroad company. Further, in that case, the injury in question consisted of the removal of the lateral support of the soil of plaintiff\u2019s land by work done by defendant on its adjacent right of way conveyed by the deed,, as to which subject an exceptional rule applies in some jurisdictions, as above noted. Lateral soil support and interference with riparian rights in running streams of water and with surface-water rights of an adjoining landowner; as furnishing exceptions to the general rule applicable to the effect of the award of damages in a condemnation proceeding, and to the construction of deeds of conveyance of land for the right of way aforesaid, are above considered, and is the subject of what is said in section 820 of Lewis on Eminent Domain, cited. In <em>Beaty </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>cited, the injury and resultant damage complained of concerned the water rights of the plaintiff, and was caused by the failure of the railroad company to make or provide a sufficient drain to carry off the water through an embankment built on its right of way. As above noted, an exceptional rule obtains in some jurisdictions on that subject, and there are considerations as to when such exceptional rule is operative, or as to whether a given case does or does not fall within such exception, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>are immaterial to the instant case and need not be entered into here. However, in that case itself, the deed conveyed a parcel of land in fee simple without any condition, merely referring to the proposed line of railroad in the designation of - the boundaries of the land conveyed (as does the deed in the instant case, if the profile therewith be left out of view) ; and the court, in its opinion, said: \u201cAlthough no purpose is expressed in the deed, the company acquired this land, it may well be inferred, for the purpose of constructing its road upon it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> So, in the instant case, in view of the fact that the deed is made directly to the railroad company as grantee, in view also of what is stated in the deed on the subject of the line of railroad which was not then in existence, and of what is shown on the \u201cplan\u201d made a part of the deed (which \u201cplan\u201d appears in the statement preceding this opinion), even if we left out of consideration the profile shown on such \u201cplan\u201d which evidenced that the railroad would be constructed on the land conveyed on an embankment, as it was afterwards constructed, we cannot escape the conclusion that it appears on the face of the deed that the conveyance was of a right of way for the proposed railroad of the grantee; especially in view also of the statute law of this State,- which requires a railroad company to purchase the land for its right of way, if it can agree with its owner upon the price and terms therefor (which includes damages to the residue of the land of the owner where only a part of a tract is taken for the- right of way), and does not allow the railroad company to proceed by condemnation proceeding, unless it cannot so agree with such owner, or unless title to such land cannot be obtained by conveyance from- the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> That a conveyance is of the fee has no significance upon the -question of whether it is a right of way for a railroad, since under our eminent domain statute the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Obtains title to its right of way in fee by condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The general rule applicable to the change of grade of streets, namely, that damages occasioned by such change are not in general presumed to have been included in a prior condemnation proceeding, or to have been released by a prior conveyance of a right of way for a street, is urged upon us for plaintiff as in conflict with the view of the law which we have above taken. The case of <em>Harman </em>v. <em>City of Bluefield, </em>70 W. Va. 129, 73 S. E. 297, is cited and especially relied oh for plaintiff upon this point. An examination of such case and of other authorities on this subject (see 2 Lewis on Em. Dom., secs. 712-714, 825, and authorities there cited) discloses that where no limitation is placed upon the grade of the street prior to or at the time of the condemnation of the right of w\u2019ay therefor, by plans establishing a grade line or otherwise, damages will be awarded in the condemnation proceeding, once for all, to cover the right of the municipality to establish any grade it may see fit. And the general rule adverted to in the beginning of this paragraph obtains only where a prior limitation has been placed upon the grade of the street, either by a formal establishment of grade lines, or by the use of a road or street way of a certain grade, which it was not contemplated at the time of such use would ever be changed. Hence, such general rule cannot be regarded as at all in conflict with the view which we have above taken of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> It should also be noted that it is urged upon our consideration for plaintiff that the deed in the instant case was drawn by the grantee, or its agents, and that the rule as to such a deed is that \u201cany doubt as to its true meaning should be solved adversely to the company,\u201d citing <em>Lockwood v</em>. <em>Ohio R. R. Co., </em>103 Fed. 243, 43 C. C. A. 202. Such rule as applied in that case, however, had to do merely with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the meaning of ambiguous language in the deed, and cannot at all affect a rule of law applicable to the proper construction of a deed about the language of which there is no ambiguity. Hence, we think there is no merit in such position.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> The foregoing has proceeded upon the idea that the profile shown on the \u201cplan\u201d which is a part of the deed in the instant case, conveyed no meaning to the plaintiff, which is the position taken for the plaintiff in the case. We cannot concur in this view, however. We think that the plaintiff is as much bound by and affected with constructive knowledge of what is shown on such \u201cplan\u201d as she is with knowledge of any other contents of the deed. The \u201cplan\u201d aforesaid is expressly made a part of the deed by the language of the deed itself. This being so, the conclusion above reached, as to the release of damages which the law will 'imply from the execution and delivery of said deed, is strengthened.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Coming now to the application of the above conclusions of law to the injuries complained of by the plaintiff in the instant case, as due to the construction by the railroad company of the embankment on lot A, and the operation of its trains thereon (which are set forth in detail in the above statement of the case), and resultant damages sought to be recovered in the instant case therefor, we are of opinion that the deed aforesaid operated as a release of all of such claims of damages of which there is any evidence whatever in the record. We will here mention these matters and our conclusions thereon <em>seriatim:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">(a) The embankment constructed on lot A occupied the old location of the Darlington Heights road to its center, and its construction, so as to be used as a part of the railroad, necessarily obstructed the whole of that road, and that deprived the plaintiff of the front entrance to her dwelling and dwelling-house land from such road.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>(b) Any expense to which the plaintiff has been (or may be) put in making alterations and repairs to such front entrance has the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">(c) The destruction of the privacy of the plaintiff\u2019s home has the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The same is true of:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">(d) The trash, dust and dirt finding easy access into said dwelling; of (f) the detraction from the appearance of the dwelling house and dwelling-house land; and of (g) the nuisance, resulting from the jarring of the ground, shaking the dwelling house and the noise, smoke and dust emitted by passing trains on said-embankment, whereby the walls, windows, and doors of the dwelling are alleged to have been cracked, displaced and broken and the air in and about the said premises has been so polluted as to sensibly impair the enjoyment thereof and the ordinary comfort of human existence therein, etc., as alleged\u2014so far as there is any evidence in the case tending to show such injuries, or any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">As above noted, there is no evidence in the case tending to prove the allegation mentioned above under the heading (e), with respect to the collection of water and its retention upon the dwelling-house land, causing it to soak, percolate and flow through and into the whole of such land and into and under the dwelling house, causing to become and be permanently damp and wet, hence, no further mention need be made of that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">As to the allegations of the first count of the original declaration of the additional injuries of the deprivation of the plaintiff of the use of her front yard and front porch:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">There is no evidence in the case of any deprivation of use of the front yard or porch. The only evidence of deprivation of use of any entrance to the front of the dwelling-house land (except that afforded by the old location of the Darlington Heights road, which was obstructed and neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>sarily made impassible by the construction of the embankment, on lot A and its use as a part of the line of railroad constructed thereon, as aforesaid, is to the effect that a front driveway was obstructed, which entered the dwelling-house land from the Darlington Heights road by a gate located on the north side of the front yard (which gate was on the eastern line of lot A); but that was obstructed, and necessarily so, by the embankment constructed on lot A.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><bracketnum>[11]</bracketnum> 3. Did the deed above mentioned operate as a release by the plaintiff of her claims of damages which were not due to the construction by the railroad company on lot A of the embankment for its railroad, or to the operation of its trains thereover; but were due to the construction or operation of the works of the railroad company on lot B, of the embankment, undergrade crossing, etc., mentioned in and shown on the diagram with the statement preceding this opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">This question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The rule is well settled that while an award of damages in a condemnation proceeding to take a part of a tract of land will be presumed to include damages to the residue of that tract, due to the construction and operation on the part of the land taken, as above stated, such award will not be presumed to include other damages to such residue of land due to the construction and operation of the company\u2019s works on a different, or on part of a different tract of land not involved in such condemnation proceeding. And the same rule applies to deeds of conveyance of a right of way for a railroad. Lewis on Em. Dom., sec. 822; <em>Alabama, etc., R. Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>92 Ala. 277, 9 So. 203; <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>City of Rockford, supra </em>(137 Ill. 123, 28 N. E. 573); <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>B. C., etc., R. Co., </em>51 N.

W. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On this subject Lewis on Em. Domain says, in section 822, cited: \u201c* * * If parts of black acre and white acre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>are taken, and if the works as constructed upon black acre produce damage to white acre, then there is no presumption that these were included in the assessment to the proprietor of white acre, and he may recover therefor as though no land of his had been taken for the work.\u201d (Citing numerous cases.) The same section of this work also states that, <em>\u201c* </em>* when parts of certain lots were taken for a railroad and damages assessed therefor, and the parts not taken were damaged by the railroad crossing and obstructing a street upon which the lots abutted at some distance from the lots, it was held that the latter damages were not included in the assessment and that an action would lie to recover the same. * * * Many of the cases which have been cited are where the plaintiff had conveyed or released the part appropriated, but the effect of a conveyance or release as to future damages is the same as a condemnation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It is said on this subject in the opinion of the court in the case of <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>City of Rockford, supra </em>(137 Ill. 123, 28 N. E. 573), that the principle involved is \u201cthat the deed of land for right of way of a railroad company has the same effect, as between the parties, that a condemnation under the law of eminent domain for that purpose would have. But it must be obvious that this principle can have no application to anything not included within the grant\u2014 as, for instance, damages caused by acts of the railroad company upon other lands than those to which the grant relates\u2014for as between the grant and damages resulting from such acts, it is impossible that there can be the relation of cause and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The case of <em>Forest View Land Co. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., </em>120 Va. 308, 91 S. E. 198, is relied on for the railroad company as establishing a different rule in this State. In that case the deed involved contained an express release of claims for damages, which was the same in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>terms as the release of damages implied by law in a deed to a railroad company for a right of way where the deed is silent on the subject of such release. The landowner in that case did not contest the effect of the release upon any ground in conflict with the views above expressed, but contended that the works of the railroad company were not in fact constructed <em>on the land conveyed. </em>We rejected this contention and held that the works of the railroad company were on the land conveyed, within the meaning of the language of the release, when construed in the light of all the facts and circumstances in the case, including particularly the knowledge with which the grantors in the deed were charged as to the unified and entire plan of the company. It follows, therefore, that the Forest View Land Co. case is not controlling as authority in the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><bracketnum>[12,13]</bracketnum> Of course, the rule last mentioned must be reasonably applied.' If the acts of the railroad company done on lot B were inseparably attendant upon those done on lot A, and have not caused any additional injuries to the dwelling-house land or dwelling thereon, than have been caused by the acts of the railroad company on lot A, then, manifestly, the claim that such injuries were in part caused by acts of the railroad company on lot B would not avail the plaintiff to obviate the aforesaid bar of the deed. Only one satisfaction can be demanded for the same damages, although they may be due to more than one contributing cause. However, the deed does not bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover damages, due to the acts of the railroad company on lot B, which are additional to or are different from the damages due to the acts of the railroad company on lot A. '</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">It may be true that little, if any, of the injuries complained of in the instant case as due to the construction and operation of the railroad company\u2019s works on lot B were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>different or in addition to those caused by the same character of construction and operation on the adjacent lot A. But this is a question for the jury under proper instructions and cannot be properly decided by us. Such question was not submitted to the jury in the court below, but was withdra'wii from the jury as a result of the instructions given as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><bracketnum>[14]</bracketnum> 4. Did the deed above mentioned operate as a release by the plaintiff of the claim of damages due to the change of grade by the railroad company of the PamplinCharlotte C. H. public road, above mentioned, along the south side of the dwelling-house land ?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The injury and resulting damage which such change of grade is alleged to have occasioned is set out in the above statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Such act of the railroad company was not done on the land granted by the deed, but upon other land, and the injury alleged was different from any of those alleged to have been occasioned by the acts of the railroad company upon the land granted. Hence, for the reasons stated and upon the authorities cited in the consideration of the third question above, we are of opinion that this fourth question, now under consideration, must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\"><bracketnum>[15]</bracketnum> 5. Did the Spencer land condemnation proceedings set forth in the statement preceding this opinion operate as an estoppel of or bar the plaintiff\u2019s action in the instant case for the recovery of the alleged damages to her dwelling-house land and dwelling thereon alleged to have- been occasioned by reason of the construction by the railroad company of its works on the embankment, under-grade crossing, etc., on lot B, and its subsequent operation of its trains thereon, and by reason also of the changing of the grade of the Pamplin-Charlotte C. H. public road, as also set forth in the said statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">This question will be decided by the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>whether the statute hereinafter quoted purports to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action in the instant case. We shall, therefore, confine our consideration of the subject in hand to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The railroad company relies on the statute contained in subsection 23 of section 1105-f (the eminent domain statute, 1 Pollard\u2019s Code, 1904), as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action for the damages now in question, which, so far as material, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>\u201cWho may be a party to the proceedings; when right of action will abate.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201c(23) Any person * <em>* * </em>who claims that he will'be damaged in his property by reason of the location, construction * * * of the line * * * maintenance, or proper and reasonable operation of any works in this act mentioned * * * for public use, may appear before the commissioners appointed as in this act provided, at the time and place provided for their meeting, make himself a party to the proceedings and have his rights passed upon by the commissioners, and his damages, if any, ascertained* allowed and paid as in this act hereinbefore provided for the taking of land, material, water or other things. But after the notice required by this act, and the judgment of the court upon the report of the commissioners, and the payment to the <em>persons therein named, </em>or into court, for <em>their </em>use, of the sum or sums of money ascertained by such report, no action shall be brought by any person, <em>whether he appeared or not, </em>to recover compensation for * * * damages <em>considered and passed upon by the commissioners, </em>resulting * * * from the location, construction * * * of the line or * * * maintenance or proper and reasonable operation of any such works.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We are of opinion that under such statute the plaintiff might have appeared in the Spencer land condemnation proceeding and have had her right to the damages now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>under consideration \u201cpassed upon by the commissioners\u201d acting therein. But the test of whether the plaintiff is or is not estopped, or is or is not barred from maintaining a subsequent action for the damages we have under consideration, is not the application of the doctrine of <em>res adjudicates, </em>but a test prescribed by the statute just quoted. Under that statute the question is not one of estoppel, but one of whether the action is or is not barred. And the test of the latter is the same, as we shall presently point out in more detail, whether the plaintiff \u201cappeared or not\u201d in such condemnation proceeding. It becomes unnecessary, therefore, to consider the questions raised in the record as to whether the plaintiff, by the appearance of her attorney before the commissioners, became then a party to the proceeding, or as to what was the effect upon her said rights of being a party to the subsequent proceeding making distribution of the damages awarded as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Further: It will be observed from a reading of the statute that it provides, in substance, that if certain prerequisites as to notice, etc., set forth in the statute, are fulfilled, then all persons, whether they have \u201cappeared\u201d in the proceeding \u201cor not,\u201d are thereafter barred from bringing any action to recover compensation for the \u201cdamages considered and passed upon by the commissioners\u201d in such proceeding, but only such damages as have been so <em>considered and passed upon </em>are thereby barred of future recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The record furnished by the commissioners\u2019 report in the Spencer land condemnation proceedings is relied on by the railroad company to evidence the fact that the damages to plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house land and dwelling house thereon. sought to be recovered in this action, were \u201cconsidered and passed upon by the commissioners\u201d in such condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">If the commissioners\u2019 report does show this, with the certainty which the law requires in such case, in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of fraud (and none is alleged in the instant case) the report is conclusive of that fact in a collateral proceeding \u25a0(such as this is)-.</p>\n<p id=\"AIy\">The only portion of the commissioners\u2019 report aforesaid which can be relied on to establish the fact aforesaid is the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cWe are of opinion, and do ascertain, that f-or the said part\u201d (of the Spencer land) \u201cand <em>for other property so taken, </em>$1,350.00 will be a just compensation, and the damages to the adjacent and <em>other property of said tenants or owners\u201d </em>(of the Spencer land) \u201cand to the <em>other property of other persons, who will be damaged </em>in their property by reason of the construction and operation of the works of said company * * * are. $150.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">It will be observed that this on its face presents a case of a report awarding, and not denying damages. First, so considering the report\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The precise question before us is, does it appear from such language of such report with any reasonable degree of certainty that a part of the $150 damages awarded was awarded as damages to the plaintiff\u2019s property last above mentioned ?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">It is apparent that some of the language employed in reporting the damages considered and passed upon by the commissioners was unquestionably copied, and did not report an actual consideration of and passing upon damages. For instance, the report states that the $1,350 was ascertained as a just compensation not alone for the \u201csaid part\u201d of the Spencer tract \u201cso taken,\u201d which was the fact as disclosed by the record of the proceeding set forth in the above statement, but that such $1,350 was also, <em>\u201cfor the other property so taken.\u201d </em>There was no such other property taken. The proceedings being statutory, the plain mandate of subsections 4 and 8 of said eminent domain statute, requiring a description of any \u201cother property\u201d proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>to be <em>taken </em>to be contained in the petition and report, could not be ignored as a prerequisite to such <em>taking. </em>No such description was contained in such proceedings under consideration, and no such property was even sought to be taken in such proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Again: The report states that the commissioners ascertained that \u201cthe damages to the adjacent and <em>other property of said tenants or </em>owners, and to the property of other persons who will be damaged in their property * * * are $150.00.\u201d Now, there was no <em>\u201cother property </em>of said tenants or owners\u201d (meaning the tenants or owners of the Spencer land), as to which damages could have been \u201cconsidered and passed upon\u201d by the commissioners, except the residue of the Spencer tract adjacent to the part of that tract \u201ctaken,\u201d as shown by the record. This being so, it seems manifest to us that the commissioners were using some form for their report which, in the particulars mentioned, probably copied the language of the eminent domain statute, or of the petition of the railroad company in the proceedings, or of the order of court appointing them, quoted in the statement preceding this opinion, and that such language was inapplicable to and did not report the actual action of the commissioners in such particulars. That no such action occurred is disclosed by the face of the record, such report notwithstanding, when the report is read in the light of the whole record in the condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">How, then, stands the question of whether the commissioners, as a matter of fact, did consider and pass upon the damages to the dwelling-house land and dwelling thereon of the plaintiff? The only language in the report which can be relied on to show such fact is the sentence, included in the above quotation, in which the commissioners\u2019 report $150 as the \u201cdamages to the adjacent and other <em>property of said tenants and owners, </em>and <em>to the property of other persons </em>who will be damaged in their property. * * *\u201d _^s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>we have pointed out, no portion of the $150 w'as in fact awarded as damages to \u201cother property of said tenants or owners.\u201d Can it be said from the report with any reasonable certainty that any portion of the $150 was awarded as damages \u201cto the property of other persons * * *?\u201d Is it not equally probable that the language of the report which is relied on by the railroad company to have the effect of making the commissioners so report, was copied, as aforesaid, and no more reported or was intended to report actual action of the commissioners than did the other language in the same sentence which, as we have just seen, was merely formal and was probably so copied. To say the least of the language under consideration, as was in part said in the case of <em>C. &amp; O. Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Hoye, </em>2 Gratt. (43 Va.) 514, of a similar ambiguity in a report of commissioners in a condemnation proceeding: \u201cIt is probable the words * * * were copied from the terms of the act\u201d (or from the papers in the condemnation proceeding aforesaid) ; \u201cand that no damages were allowed for this reason. Their finding is uncertain. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">It is true that the case last cited is not one in which the report of the commissioners was drawn in question in a collateral proceeding, as in the instant case, but it is helpful as disclosing the view taken by this court of the definiteness and certainty which should characterize such reports and of the. principle involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">But wholly aside from the matters of uncertainty aforementioned, the report of the commissioners in the instant case, in the language above quoted, relating to the award of the $150 damages, contains another serious and, as we shall presently see, fatal ambiguity, even if the view be taken of it that the commissioners meant to report any damages to \u201cother property of other persons,\u201d or that they had \u201cconsidered and passed upon\u201d the damages now sought to \u00bbe recovered by the plaintiff, and had allowed or denied an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>award of anything as such damages. The report upon such view of it, either awards the $150 damages to three separate, different and distinct properties, to-wit, (1) the adjacent Spencer land, being the residue of the Spencer tract not taken; (2) other property of the tenants or owners of the Spencer land, and (3) <em>\u201cto </em>the other property <em>of </em>other persons,\u201d or it awards such damages to the adjacent Spencer land and, denies any damages to the other property of the tenants or owners of the Spencer land and \u201cto the other property of other persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">What \u201cother property\u201d and what \u201cother persons\u201d are meant? It is impossible to determine these questions from the report. It does not say <em>all </em>other property, or <em>all </em>other persons.. (We should perhaps say in passing, however, that we do not mean to hold that the use of the word \u201call\u201d in this connection would have removed the ambiguity under consideration.) For aught that the report contains, the commissioners may have considered and passed upon the damages to the property of A and B, or any other two or more persons, and never considered the damages to the property of the plaintiff last above mentioned. The only fact which it could be claimed that the report evidences as to what damages \u201cto other property of other persons\u201d the commissioners considered and passed upon, is that they awarded a part of the $150 as damages, or denied the award of any damages to the property of other persons (in the plural number), the persons being unnamed and the property otherwise unidentified. Such a report, manifestly, supplies no record evidencing that damages to any particular property of any person, other than the Spencer property, were considered and passed upon by the commissioners, favorably or unfavorably, by being awarded or denied; and clearly it does not show that the damages to the plaintiff\u2019s property under consideration were considered and passed upon by the commissioners by being awarded or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>nied. That is to say, the commissioners\u2019 report furnishes no evidence whatever on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><bracketnum>[16]</bracketnum> It would be easy enough in all cases of condemnation for the commissioners to state in their report specifically what cases they in fact consider on the question of damages and the results of their action, whether in awarding or denying the award of damages, in each case considered, so that when any subsequent suit for damages is instituted the report may be turned to for evidence upon the question of whether such damages have or have not been considered and passed upon in the condemnation proceeding. Such a procedure would be but fair alike to companies exercising the right of eminent domain and to property owners affected. And that the report of the commissioners should measure up to such requirement is, we think, the true intent and meaning of the eminent domain statute aforesaid. Only by such a procedure can such companies be freed from the danger of being vexed with suits for damages which have been awarded and paid, and property owners be relieved from the danger of the effort being made to deprive them of their right to have their <em>bona fide </em>claims of damages in fact passed upon and adjudicated, so that such property right may not be taken away without due process of law by some constructive adjudication which never in truth occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The general rules prevailing on this subject are considered in Chapter XXI of Lewis on Eminent Domain (3d ed.), especially in sections 764, 766 and 767. We refrain, however, at this time from a more specific holding in the premises than that made in the next preceding paragraph, since the decision of the case before us does not require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">6. There were rulings of the trial court on questions of the admission or exclusion of testimony which are made the subject of assignments of error numbers II and III, on pages 2 and 3 of the printed petition for writ of error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>instant, case, but as they raise no novel questions, we deem it unnecessary to say more of them than that we are of opinion that there was no error in such rulings of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">7. There were instructions asked for by the plaintiff which were refused by the trial court, which are not set forth in the statement of the case preceding this opinion as they do not raise any questions upon the facts of this case not otherwise raised in the record. It is deemed sufficient to say of such instructions that some of them are in conflict with the views above expressed and as a whole they are not so framed as to be applicable on a new trial of the case in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">For the reasons stated above, we are of opinion to set aside the verdict and judgment under review and award the plaintiff a new trial, to be had, if she is so advised, not in conflict with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
