That after the said allotment, the defendants, by a deed, duly executed, &amp;c., and dated on the 4th of August, 1816, conveyed to a certain <em>Columbus O\u2019Donnell </em>and <em>John PL.

Poor; </em>and moreover, that the said deed of mortgage is defectively executed, and even if a legal or equitable title existed in these defendants, that the said deed exhibited by the complainants, with their bill, is wholly defective in its execution, and agreeably to the laws of <em>Maryland </em>conveys no legal or equitable title to the complainants,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-5\">Leave was afterwards prayed for, and granted, to amend the bill, by making the said trustees, <em>Columbus O' Donnell </em>and <em>John H. </em>Poor, defendants, against whom, together with the other defendants, the same relief was prayed as by the original bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-6\">The answers of the defendants to the amended bill, admitted the execution of the deed of trust, Sec.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-7\">The original mortgage to the complainants was filed as an exhibit with the MIL The clause of redemption is, \u201c that if the said <em>Dudley Poor </em>and <em>Deborah </em>Poor, his wife, their heirs, &amp;c. shall pay to the said <em>James Brundige, </em>&amp;c. the sum of $3059 <em>75, </em>on or before, &amp;c., then this indenture shall cease,\u201d &amp;c.

And they alleged in bar of the complainants bill, that they had no legal right to make said deed of mortgage; and if they had, that the same is defectively executed, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6\">On the 18th day of November, 1826, after the coming in of the preceding answer, the complainants again, with leave, amended their bill, so as to make <em>John Tappan </em>a party complainant. In this bill, <em>Tappan </em>is stated to be the actual creditor, and re-asserting the existence of a specific lien on the property contained in the mortgage for the aforesaid debt, they pray for a sale of it, and for general relief. And at the same time the following agreement, signed by the solicitors of the parties, was filed: \u201c The undersigned, solicitors for the parties in the above cause, do hereby agree, that <em>John Tappan </em>shall be deemed and taken as a party complainant, in the original and amended bills of complaint filed in this cause, in the same manner, to all intents and purposes, as if the said <em>John Tappan </em>had been inserted as a complainant in the same, at the time the said bills were filed and exhibited in this Court.

And it also alleges, that <em>Dudley Poor </em>applied for and obtained the benefit of the insolvent laws, and that <em>Matthew McLaughlin </em>was appointed his trustee. On the 9th of December, 1823, the plaintiffs having obtained leave, amended their hill, by which amended bill they allege that <em>Dudley Poor </em>and <em>wife </em>have conveyed the mortgaged property to <em>Columbus 0\\Domi.ell, </em>and <em>John II.

On the 16th of December, 1822, <em>Dudley' Poor </em>and <em>wife, </em>jointly pleaded in bar, that the mortgaged property had been previously conveyed to <em>Columbus O\u2019Donnell, </em>and <em>John H. Poor, </em>in trust for the uses specified in the deed of trust, and therefore that the mortgage relied on by the plaintiffs, was insufficient and void. On the 3d of August, 1824, <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>and <em>John H. Poor, </em>by their joint answer, admit \u25a0the execution of the deed of trust, and produce it as required by the first amended bill. After the amendments of \u25a0the bill of the 9th of December, 1823, and of the 4th of \u25a0October, 1825, <em>Dudley Poor </em>and <em>wife </em>again jointly pleaded, \u25a0that they'had, by a deed bearing date on the 4th of August, 1826, conveyed certain property therein described, including that in the proceedings mentioned to <em>Columbus O\u2019Donnell, </em>and <em>John H. Poor, </em>In trust for the separate, use of <em>Dudley\u2019s wife, </em>and for the uses mentioned in that deed; and then aver, and plead, that the mortgage deed for a part of the property which had been so conveyed in trust, is defectively executed, and that they had no legal right or power at that time to make such a contract, for that property. After which it was agreed that these answers, should stand as answers to the third amendment of the 13th of November, 1826. The general replication has been filed, issue joined, and the case standing ready for hearing, has been fully argued. The deed of trust of the 4th of August, 1816, was produced, commented upon, and its execution and verity on all hands entirely admitted. I have thus particularly stated the circumstances of this case, because the statement itself leads us directly to those well established principles upon which it may be at once disposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of, without the least difficulty, and without being carried away into that group of decisions in relation to the execution of a power reserved to a <em>feme </em>covert, that have tasked the diligence, and exercised tlxe ingenuity of so many distinguished lawyers; since there is no allegation in these pleadings, by which the court can he called upon to treat the mortgage, upon which the plaintiffs sue, as an execution of the powers with which the wife of <em>Dudley Poor </em>has been clothed by the deed of trust. The case is simply this : the plaintiffs say, that to secure a debt due them, they obtained a mortgage of certain property ifom <em>Dudley Poor </em>and <em>wife, </em>which property they pray may be sold to pay that debt. To this <em>Dudley Poor </em>and <em>wife </em>plead in bar, that they\" had no legal right or power to make such a mortgage, for the reasons set forth. To this the plaintiffs have replied, generally, and issue has been joined, and the case set down for hearing. Where the defendant files a plea In bar, if the plaintiff conceives it <em>to </em>be defective in form and substance, and Is anxious to have that matter determined, he may set the plea down for hearing, and take the judgment of the court upon it. Eat if the plaintiff allows the plea to he correct, or it is so determined to be by the court, he may then reply and join issue upon the truth of the facts therein set forth; and if, upon the hearing, the defendant, establishes the truth of the facts thus put in issue, the suit is at an end, so far as the plea extends, it is too late, after issue joined, to inquire into the formality of the plea, or whether it he in any respect defective in form: or whether any, and how far an answer might be necessary to its support, because the plaintiff, by replying to it, has thereby tacitly waived all objections of that sort, and admitted it to he a good bar in equity, if the facts be true. And it is the constant course of the court where issue has been joined on the plea, and its truth is proved or admitted, to dismiss the bill with costs, if the plea goes to the whole. In this case, the plea of <em>Dudley Poor </em>and <em>wife </em>covers the whole and entire substance and merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>having been admitted by the replication to he good in point of equity, and the truth of the facts therein set forth having been established, there is an end of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">Decreed, that the complainants hill of complaint he dismissed, with costs. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">From which decree the complainants appealed to <em>this </em>court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b16-7\">The cause'was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

This is a bill to foreclose a mortgage, a.nd nothing else; the original and amended hills have all this character, and the appellants now ask for relief, not warranted by the bill. Under the general prayer, they are only entitled to such relief as is consistent with their bill. The object of the bill, then, being to obtain a sale of mortgaged property, and its specific prayer looking alone to that object, they cannot now be allowed to ask for the execution of a contract, defectively executed. A bill made for one purpose, cannot be applied to another. <em>Chalmers vs. Chambers, </em>6 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>29. 2. The deed of trust from <em>Poor </em>and <em>wife, </em>to O\u2019 <em>Donnell </em>and <em>John H. Poor, </em>was founded upon a meritorious consideration; and the complainants can have no equity as strong as that of the wife. The whole question, then, is on the validity of the mortgage, which he contended was void at common law, and under the act of Assembly, and that it was not an execution of the power under the deed of trust. The mortgage was void under the act of Assembly, because the wife was not examined privately, and apart from her husband. It is no execution of the power reserved to her by the trust deed. It does not refer to that deed, or manifest an intention to execute the powers with which it clothes her. Such powers must be strictly executed, especially in the absence of a valuable consideration. 1 <em>Madd. Ch. </em>44, 45. <em>Colier vs. Layer, 2 P.

The bill claims relief, not on the ground of a separate estate of the wife, but upon a mortgage executed by husband and wife, for a debt due from husband and wife; without reference to any separate estate of the wife, or any power to mortgage by virtue of the deed of trust. In order to obtain relief on such a bill, he must show a mortgage of a legal or equitable estate, executed according to the act of Assembly, so as to bar the right of a <em>feme covert. </em>He cannot support the ease he has stated, by shewing the execution of a power by the wife, or a contract to mortgage her separate estate, by virtue of a trust for her separate benefit; for either of them would be a different ground of relief, and a different equity, from the one he has stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-7\">The mortgage is not properly acknowledged to bind a <em>feme covert, </em>nor would it bind her, being a <em>feme covert, </em>as a contract to mortgage, independent of her separate interest under the deed of trust \u2014 and as that interest is not alleged in the bill, and her interest under the deed of trust is not stated as a ground of relief, the case charged in the bill, fails in the proof, and the bill must be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-8\">3. If, under the statement in the bill, the deed of mortgage can be relied on, as the contract of a married woman to mortgage her separate estate, and as thereby creating, by her contract, a specific lien on her property, it ought to have been so charged in the bill; and the deed of trust, giving her the power, should have been set forth, and the consideration for the contract stated, so as to shew the equity of the complainants to claim the execution of the agreement to encumber, against <em>Mrs. Poor. Chalmers vs. Chambers, </em>6 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>39. <em>Coop. Eq. Plea, </em>13, 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-9\">In the case of <em>Price and Nisbet vs. Bigham, 7 Harr. and Johns. </em>296, the contract to charge the land with the debt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>set out, and the consideration for the agreement fully stated, and the contract and consideration proved, as stated in the bill. In this case, nothing is charged but the mortgage, and the specific lien is alleged to arise by reason of the mortgage, and no other contract but a mortgage is stated; and the equitable consideration of a joint debt from husband and wife, charged in the bill, is not proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-4\">4. If the facts were all proved, there is no equity upon which the complainants can claim a specific execution; it was the separate debt of the husband, and due from him as security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">5. The instrument called a mortgage, does not profess to be the execution of the power reserved in the deed of trust; and does not appear, and is not alleged to have been so intended.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-6\">Williams, (District Attorney of U. S.) in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">The relief we ask, is conformable to the case made by the bill. Our prayer is, that the specific property may be sold, and the case made by the bill is such, as to justify this prayer. The instrument of writing which furnishes the foundation of the complainants bill, though called a mortgage, is but an equitable contract. The case in 6 <em>Harr, and Johns. </em>29, relied on, on the other side, is not analagous to this; there, the prayer of the bill was to have the deed recorded, and the decree ordered a sale of the property. The relief granted was entirely different from the case stated in the bill, and from the relief prayed. This bill has a double aspect; it asks that the mortgage may be considered a specific lien, and also for a sale of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">Whether the defence set up, be a plea or answer, the doctrine asserted by the Chancellor is not law in this State,, <em>Chase vs. McDonald &amp; Ridgely, 7 Harr. and Johns. </em>170, 176, 178, 181, 197, 198.

Ch. </em>44, 45. <em>Hunt vs. Rousmaniere, </em>1 <em>Peters Rep. </em>13.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b20-8\">Archer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVL\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">The decision in <em>Tiernan vs. Poor and wife, </em>at the last term of this Court, has settled the principal questions upon which this cause must turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">From the doctrines there maintained, <em>Mrs. Poor </em>possessed a right to encumber her property by deed, or contract, provided the same should be founded on a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">It was further decided, that although the paper, purporting to be a mortgage, and which was the foundation of the suit, was not acknowledged according to the provisions of the acts of Assembly, whatever might be the effects of such omission, in taking from the instrument the character, technically speaking, of a mortgage, yet that, equity would treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>it as a mortgage, so far as to authorise a Court of Chancery to decree a sale of the property, covered by it, for the payment of the debt it was executed to secure. -</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">Taking the facts stated in the bill as true, there would be a sufficient consideration upon which to ground the complainant\u2019s bill; for that avers, that the defendant being indebted, executed the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Admit the facts in the answer to he true, and a sufficient consideration is also manifested. There it is stated, that the mortgage was executed by <em>Poor and </em>wife, to secure to <em>Tap-pan, </em>one of the complainants, a debt which <em>Poor </em>owed him, and that it was made in consequence of <em>Tappan\u2019s </em>agreeing to extend the time of the payment of <em>Poor\u2019s </em>debt. <em>Tappan\u2019s </em>agreement to extend the payment, in consideration of the receipt of the mortgage, furnished a sufficient consideration to sustain the complainant\u2019s equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">All the material allegations of the bi31 are admitted by the answer. Tn addition to a sufficient consideration as above stated, it is admitted that the instrument was executed. With these admissions, the instrument becomes, in the language of the bill, a specific lien on the, property it covers.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">There is, however, one fact averred in the bill, which is not admitted in the answer, \u2014 the joint indebtedness of the husband and wife; but that cannot be material, because the equity of the complainant is the same, whether the allegation that they were jointly indebted, be true or not. The real and only controversy is this: does there exist a specific lien on the property? and that the lien exists, whether they were jointly indebted, or whether <em>Poor </em>was indebted, and they jointly executed the instrument in consideration of forbearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">It is not necessary to express any opinion as to the effect of replying to a plea, because we do not consider there is any plea filed in the cause. The paper filed by the defendant, which he indiscriminately calls a plea, and an answer, we consider as nothing more than an answer; and it is perfectly apparent from the proceedings in the canse, and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the agreement of counsel, which constitutes a part of the cause, that it was so considered and treated by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The decree of the Chancellor is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Court of Chancery, that a sale of the property may be there decreed, to satisfy the debt of the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
