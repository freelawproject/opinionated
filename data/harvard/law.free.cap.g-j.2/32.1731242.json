The testator\u2019s personal estate being insufficient to pay his debts, and also the pecuniary legacies, one of the grandsons, after the widow\u2019s death, filed a bill to have the land sold for the payment of his legacy.

The bill which was filed on the 4th of February, 1825, stated, that <em>Charles </em>Drury, the grandfather of complainant, by his last will and testament, dated on the 8th of July, 1806, bequeathed to him the sum of $60, after his debts and funeral charges should be paid. The testator then directed, that his land after the death or marriage of his wife, (to whom he gave an estate in the same during widowhood,) should be sold by his executors, <em>Henry Childs Drury </em>and <em>Charles Drury, </em>and the money, therefrom arising, to be divided between his five sons, of whom the said executors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>are two. That one of the testator\u2019s sons has since died, as has also his widow. That the personal estate, except a very small balance, has been exhausted in the payment of debts, so that complainant has only received f 10, on account of his legacy, that being his proportion of the residuum in the hands of the executors. That <em>Ilenry C. </em>Drury, one of the executors and heirs of the said testator, has purchased the title of the other heirs to the land, and refuses to sell the same for the satisfaction of the balance of complainant\u2019s legacy. <em>Prayer, </em>that a decree may be had for the sale of said land, for the purpose of paying said legacy, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\"><em>Charles Drury s </em>will, referred to in the hill, contains, among others, the following clauses. \u201c Item. I give and bequeath to my two grandsons, <em>William T. Simmons </em>and <em>Aaron Welch, </em>sixty dollars each.\u201d \u201cAnd all the rest and residue of my personal estate, I give to be equally divided between my said five sons.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">The answer of <em>Ilenry C. Drury, Charles Drury, </em>and <em>Samuel Drury, </em>three of the defendants, admitted the will of <em>Charles Drury, </em>the testator, and that he made such a (.\u2022\u2019' \u2022position of his land, and bequeathed the legacy to the complainant as his bill charges. The defendants, <em>Charles </em>and <em>Samuel, </em>admit that they sold their interest in the land to the defendant, <em>Ilenry C., </em>who alleges that he purchased the interest of the defendant, <em>Joseph Drury. </em>The defendant, <em>Ilenry C., </em>states, that he paid the complainant his full proportion of the personal assets of the testator, on account of his legacy, as will appear by his receipt, filed with his answer. The defendants then deny, that the land devised to them by their father, is liable for the balance of complainant\u2019s legacy, as it is not, by the testator, made a charge thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">The answer of <em>Joseph Drury, </em>admits the facts set forth in the bill, and consents to the decree as prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The complainant\u2019s receipt on account of his legacy, referred to in the answer of <em>Henry C.

But whatever may be its effects under certain circumstances, I do not think that it can have any material bearing upon this particular case, and therefore, shall express no opinion respecting it, in any way whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">All the cases that have been cited as analogous to this, show, that the court has been altogether, or mainly governed, by what was deemed to be the intention of the testator. The whole controversy, here turns upon the single point of the intention of this testator, <em>Charles Drury. </em>He sets out with the general declaration, \u201c after my debts and funeral charges are paid,\u201d but he does not say how, when, or out of what fund, they are to be paid; nor does he make any allusion to them. Hence this expression can be considered in no other light, than as a general recognition of the legal liability of the whole of his estate, to the payment of his debts and funeral charges. It manifests no intention to alter or change the general bearing of that liability in any manner whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">It is a very ancient and well established principle of our .law, that the personal estate of a deceased debtor, shall be considered as the natural fund, for the payment of his debts, and must be first applied for that purpose. There are many cases, however, in which a Court of Equity will so marshal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the assets in favor of creditors and legatees, as to relieve the personal estate from the grasps of those who have other means of obtaining satisfaction. But those cases only shew and illustrate the nature of the power of the court, under these circumstances, where the law, or the intention of the testator allows of the exercise of such a power. Here the intention of the testator, <em>Charles </em>Drury, is clear and decisive against the application of any such authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">It is evident that he had under his contemplation the whole of his estate, made up as it was of the two well known kinds of property, <em>real </em>and personal, the legal character of each component part of which he perfectly understood, or shewed no disposition to alter in any one particular, in reference to the objects of his bounty. He first distinctly and specifically disposes of his whole real estate to his wife, for life, or during her widowhood, and after to his sons. He then proceeds to his personalty. He gives several pecuniary legacies, and then, by a sweeping bequest, disposes of \u201call the rest and residue of his <em>personal </em>estate.\u201d Taking the whole will together, it amounts to this. That after the estate has been cleared of all claims against it, in the usual manner, and according to law, the realty shall go to his wife and sons, and the personalty, if sufficient, shall be applied to the payment of certain legacies, and the residue, if any, to his sons. The devise of the land is as much and properly a <em>specific </em>donation, as the bequest of the pecuniary legacies. To charge the pecuniary legacies upon the land directly or indirectly, or by substitution, or otherwise, it is conceived would be a manifest violation of the intention of the testator, and unwarranted by any law, or adjudged case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">Decreed, that the complainant\u2019s bill be dismissed, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">From which decree the complainant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b43-8\">The cause was argued before Bcchanan, Oh.
