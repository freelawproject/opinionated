Beall </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife, on the 10th of December, 1825, against <em>William, Wells </em>of <em>George, </em>and <em>Jemima </em>his wife, the present appellants, and <em>William Wells, </em>executor of <em>Jacob W. Brashears, </em>stated, that some time in the year 1797, a certain <em>John W. Brashears o\u00ed Prince George </em>County died, leaving five children; one of whom, <em>Richard W. Brashears, </em>the former husband of the complainant <em>Mary, </em>died in the year 1806, intestate, leaving a son, since deceased. That the said <em>John W. Brashears, </em>by a duly executed will, (a copy of which the complainants exhibit,) devised to the aforesaid <em>Jacob W. Brashears, </em>(one of his sons in tail,) 44 acres of a tract of land called <em>Plummer's Pleasure, </em>and also by the said will, devised the residue of the said tract in tail, to be equally divided between the said <em>Richard W. B. </em>and <em>Beall B. </em>(another son,) with cross remainders, to the survivor, and the aforesaid <em>Jacob W. B. </em>That <em>Beall B. </em>died in the year 1801, without issue, and without altering the estate so devised to him, whereby the aforesaid <em>Richard W. B. </em>became entitled to three-fourths of the residue of the said land, and that upon his death, his widow, the complainant <em>Mary, </em>(afterwards married to the other complainant <em>Otho B. Beall, </em>became entitled to one-third of the rents and profits thereof. That at the death of <em>Richard, W. B. in </em>1806, <em>the </em>said lands were undivided, and they have continued since in the possession and use of <em>Jacob W. B. </em>who has received all the rents and profits of the same, promising to account to complainant <em>Mary, </em>for her dower right therein, hut never doing so. That the said <em>Jacob W. B. </em>died in the year 1816, devising and bequeathing his whole estate to <em>Jemima, </em>(one of the appellants,) since intermarried with the other appellant, <em>William Weds </em>of <em>George, </em>and appointing <em>William Wells, </em>the other defendant, his executor. That since the death of <em>Jacob W. B., Wells </em>and wife have had possession of the aforesaid land, and have <em>received </em>to their own use the .rents and profits of the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>promising to account, &amp;c. as the said <em>Jacob W. B. </em>had done before them. <em>Prayer, </em>that <em>William Wells, </em>the executor of <em>Brashears, </em>maybe decreed to account with, and pay to the complainants, the rents and profits which accrued to complainant <em>Mary, </em>in the life-time of his testator, and that the appellants <em>(Wells and wife,) </em>may be compelled to do the same, in reference to the rents, &amp;c. accrued since, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">The <em>answer </em>of <em>Wells </em>and wife, admits, that <em>John W. Bra-shears </em>died in, 1797, leaving five children, of whom <em>Richard W., </em>the former husband of complainant <em>Mary, </em>was one. That he died in the year 1806, intestate, leaving an only-son. They further admit that <em>John W. B. </em>made such a devise of the tract of land called <em>Plummer's Pleasure </em>as the bill charges, and that <em>Beall B. </em>died in the year 1801, without altering the nature of the estate created in him by the said devise of <em>John W. B. </em>But they expressly deny, that <em>Richard W. B. </em>the former husband of the complainant had, or could have, any title to the land so devised to him by <em>John W. B. </em>because the said <em>John W. B. </em>had not himself any title therein. They admit \u00bfthat <em>John W. B. </em>in his lifetime, <em>contracted </em>for the purchase of said land, but they deny that he ever paid any part of the purchase money for the same; and they allege, that after his death, <em>Jacob W. B. </em>made a new contract for the purchase of said land, and paid the entire purchase money out of his own private funds, taking a deed to himself for the same. They likewise admit, that from the death of <em>Richard W. B. </em>the said land has been held and used by <em>Jacob W. </em>and themselves, but they deny that either of them ever promised to account to the complainants, or either of them, for any portion of the rents and profits. They insist that <em>Jacob W. B. </em>was the rightful owner and occupier of said lands, and they exhibit and make the will of <em>Jacob </em>a part of their answer, by which he bequeaths and devises the whole of his estate to the defendant <em>Jemima </em>in fee tail general, and therefore they are not accountable to any person, for the rents .and issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the lands in question. They admit that <em>Jacob </em>died in 1816, as charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The answer of <em>William Wells, </em>the executor of <em>Jacob, </em>admits that he was constituted and qualified as his executor, but he alleged, and proved, that he had settled the estate, and paid over the residue, to the defendant <em>Jemima </em>and her husband <em>William Wells </em>of <em>George, </em>and the bill was dismissed as to him, without any opposition from the complainant\u2019s solicitor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">A commission issued, and proof was taken, among other things, in relation to the value of the rents of the land in controversy. \u2014 The opinion of the Court of Appeals however, renders a recapitulation of the proof, wholly unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">At December Term, 1827, Bland, Chancellor, passed the following decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">This case has been intimately associated, and in some respects blended with the case of <em>Otho B. Beall, </em>administrator of the late <em>Richard B. Brashears, </em>against <em>William Wells </em>and others. The two cases were argued together, and admitted to depend upon the same principles, to a certain extent. I therefore took up, and considered the case instituted by <em>Otho B. Beall, </em>as administrator, and have decided it first, because it manifestly involved every material principle of this case, and more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-9\">This suit has been instituted to recover the rents and profits of the dower, to which it is alleged the complainant <em>Mary, </em>was entitled, in a portion of the land called <em>Plummer\u2019s Pleasure; </em>and her claim is opposed upon two grounds. First, that her former husband <em>Richard W. B. </em>had during the coverture, no more than a mere equitable interest of which she is not dowable, and secondly, the lapse of time, and the statute of limitations, is relied on as a bar. But as I have already explained and decided in the case of <em>Beall </em>as administrator <em>vs. Wells </em>and others, the late <em>Richard W. B. </em>the former husband of the complainant <em>Mary, </em>had, during the coverture actual possession, and a good, legal title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>and died seised of three-fourths of that portion <em>o\u00ed Plummets Pleasure, </em>which had been devised to him and his brother <em>Beall </em>in tail, by their father the late <em>John W. B. </em>and consequently she was entitled to dower of that land. And with regard to the statute of limitations I have formerly decided, that it constitutes no bar, and does not in equity, apply to a widow\u2019s claim of dower, or the rents and profits thereof, <em>Oliver vs. Richardson, </em>9 <em>Ves. </em>232. Whereupon it is on this 29th day of December, adjudged, ordered and decreed, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">From this decree the appellants <em>Wells </em>and wife, appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b480-6\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch. J., Earle, Martin, Stephen and Archer, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-7\"><em>Key, </em>and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellants, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">1. That if <em>Richard W. B. </em>the first husband of the complainant <em>Mary, </em>had any title in the land in question, it was but an equitable title, and as he died prior to the act of 1818, <em>ch. </em>193, his widow is not entitled to dower in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-9\">2. The title to dower being expressly disputed by the answers, the right should first be established at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-10\">3. Limitations is a bar to the recovery of the rents and profits, which became due more than three years prior to the filing of the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-11\">1. <em>Richard W. 3. </em>had no title to <em>Plummer\u2019s Pleasure, </em>or if any, but an equitable title. The answer expressly denies that he died seised of any part of said land. This denial is responsive to the bill, and throws the proof of title on the complainant, and there is no proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-12\">2. The objection to the want of jurisdiction in the Court, is open to us, notwithstanding the answer. In fact the question could not arise until the answer is filed, as it is not until then that the Court can know, that the title to dower will be disputed. A demurrer to a bill like the present, would admit the seisin of the husband, and of course the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>right to dower would follow. As a general rule, it is admitted that in reference to dower, Courts of law and equity, have a concurrent jurisdiction; but when the <em>facts </em>upon which the claim rests, are controverted, the title must be established at law, before Chancery can grant relief. <em>Herbert vs. Wren, </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>370. <em>Mundy vs. Mundy, 2 Ves. Jr. 122. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. </em>70. <em>Jeremy\u2019s Equity, </em>305. 1 <em>Johns. Ch.

The bill filed in this case, would have authorised a decree for profits, and an assignment of dower also. <em>Chalmers vs. Chambers, </em>6 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-7\">2. If when, the right to dower is contested by the answer, it must be established at law before Chancery can relieve, it does not follow, that the hill is to be dismissed. It must be retained until the right is ascertained. But suppose the objection to be a valid one, it should have been presented by demurrer or plea. After answer, it cannot be insisted on.

Ch. R. </em>488, and the cases there referred to. It appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>equally clear, that where dower is claimed at common law, and the husband\u2019s title to the land is controverted, it must be made out at law. <em>Mundy vs. Mundy, </em>4 Brown, 295. <em>Mundy vs. </em>Mundy, 2 <em>Ves.
