C, under notice of set-off, established payments to the amount of $195; and to shew that A had no separate right of action, proved that he w\u00e1s a- partner in two firms, one of which furnished the bricks, and the other did the brick work of the houses, and both of which rendered accounts in 1818 and 19-, amounting to $2850, for their respective claims. He also proved various receipts, during the same years, of the individual partners of those firms for payments made to them \u2014 some on account of such buildings generally \u2014 some for bricks, \u2014 some for brick work, amounting in the whole to $1310. A then offered to prove by one of his former partners, that his firm was dissolved about the close of 1819, and its debts assigned to A. The county court admitted the witness, and held that the settlement in 1820, was evidence of C\u2019s-knowledge of the dissolution of that firm, and the transfer of its debts to A; hut no evidence of the dissolution of the other firm being given, that court also decided that the whole evidence did not furnish competent proof of any balance being due to A individually. Upon appeal, held that this was a question of fact for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b418-12\">Appeal from <em>Baltimore County Court.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-13\">Action of <em>Assumpsit. </em>The declaration contained counts for work and labor, and materials found and provided, &amp;c.

It is not denied, that there was proof of a dissolution of the partnership between <em>Shoemaker </em>and <em>Athey, </em>and the defendant\u2019s prayer does not raise that question\u2014 the question presented is, Was there evidence of a dissolution between <em>Barger </em>and <em>Athey, </em>and that the claim due that firm, was assigned <em>to Athey. </em>That this was known <em>to </em>defendant, and that with such knowledge he promised to pay\u2014 a promise to pay one of the partners a partnership debt, is not <em>per se </em>evidence of a dissolution and assignment. <em>Allstan vs. Contee, 4 Harr. and Johns. </em>351. <em>Onion vs. Paul, </em>1 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>114. 2. The accounts relied on, show, that a sum of money was due from the defendant, for bricks furnished, and for brick work, but there is no data by which it can be ascertained how much is due for each, and therefore the jury had no rule by which they could have found a verdict. <em>Davis vs. Davis, 7 Harr. and Johns. </em>36. <em>Fergusson vs. Tucker, </em>2 <em>Harr. and Gill, 189.

If the Court were right as to the dissolution of the partnership between <em>Alhey </em>and <em>Barger, </em>they were clearly in error as to the remaining part of the direction. The accounts of 1818, and 1819, produced by the defendant in the hand-writing of <em>Alhey, </em>became evidence in behalf of his estate, and it may be, that by their assistance, the plaintiffs might have been able to separate the debt due to <em>Shoemaker </em>and <em>Alhey, </em>from the debt due to <em>Alhey </em>and <em>Barger, </em>and thereby to show what proportion of the large item of $964,01, in the settled account of the <em>1st of </em>March, 1820, belonged to the former partnership. For this, under the evidence given, added to the first and third items of the account, which were undisputed, they might have been entitled to a verdict, subject to a deduction of the sum of the set-off, which was also proved. We do not pretend to say, that from this source, the plaintiffs would have succeeded to establish this part of their demand against the defendant. This point the jury alone would have the right to decido; and that the plaintiffs were deprived of the use of this proof, by the directions of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Ail we mean to signify is, that the accounts of 1818 and 1819, might have been used for this purpose by the plaintiffs, and that it should have been left to them to make the attempt, if they had seen proper to do so. We intend alone to say that those accounts were legal, and competent proof to go to the jury, of the balance due from the defendant to <em>Alhey </em>in his life-time. The judgment must be reversed, and the case sent back on a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
