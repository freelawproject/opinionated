This petition was accompanied with \u201ca list of debts due by <em>James Williams </em>of debts due, and property belonging to <em>James Williams,\u201d </em>and an affidavit of their truth; proof of <em>Williams\u2019s </em>residence in the State for the two years next preceding his application; the certificate of the sheriff of <em>Baltimore </em>county, of said <em>Williams </em>being in actual confinement for debt alone, with the reference of the application by the judge aforesaid, to the commissioners of insolvent debtors; the bond of <em>James Williams, </em>with security for his appearance before the commissioners, and <em>Baltimore </em>County Court; the bond of <em>George Winchester, </em>dated 24th June, 1819, for the performance of the duties of <em>provisional trustee </em>of the said <em>Williams; </em>the conveyance from <em>Williams </em>to <em>Winchester </em>of all his property, in trust, for his creditors, duly acknowledged; the receipt of <em>Winchester, </em>as trustee, for all <em>Williams\u2019s </em>property; the certificate of the commissioners, that <em>Winchester </em>had been appointed <em>provisional trustee, </em>and had certified to them that he was in possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of <em>Williams\u2019s </em>property; the <em>personal </em>discharge granted by one of the judges of <em>Baltimore </em>County Court to <em>Williams; </em>the bond of <em>George Winchester, </em>(-without security) <em>to </em>perform the duties of <em>permanent </em>trustee of the said Williams, dated <em>2d August, </em>1819; the certificate of the commissioners aforesaid, dated <em>25th </em>September, 1819, addressed to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, that they had examined <em>Williams\u2019s case, </em>that he had acted fairly and <em>bona fide ; </em>and the final discharge awarded to <em>Williams </em>by said Court, from all debts due by him prior to the 24th June, 1819, with the usual exception of subsequent acquisitions by gift, descent, bequest, devise, or distribution, in his own right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-4\">And the plaintiff further offered in evidence, that the said <em>James Williams </em>stopped payment, and his notes were protested in and by the said <em>Union Bank </em>on the first day of <em>June, </em>1819; he further offered in evidence, the record entries on the application of the said <em>James Williams </em>for \u25a0the benefit of the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland, </em>from which it appeared that he applied for the benefit of said insolvent laws on the 24th day of June, 1819, and that <em>George Winchester, </em>the plaintiff, was appointed provisional and permanent trustee of said <em>Williams, </em>by the commissioners of insolvent debtors, and gave his single bond <em>without security, </em>for the faithful performance of his duty as such trustee. The plaintiff further offered in evidence, a deed of assignment from <em>James Williams </em>and <em>John Gooding, </em>of the brig <em>Ariel </em>and cargo, dated <em>Baltimore, 4ih June, </em>1819, to secure a debt previously due from the grantors to the bank, (a recital of which is not material to the questions ultimately decided,) and then proved that the said <em>Union Bank </em>accepted the said brig and cargo at the valuation of sixty-five thousand dollars; and that some portion at least, if not all, the proceeds of the said brig and cargo, in money, came to the possession of, and was received by, the said <em>Union Bank, </em>before the commencement of this suit. Whereupon the defendants, by their counsel, prayed the Court to instruct and direct the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled <em>to re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>cover, because he had not given bond, with security, for the faithful performance of his duty as trustee of the said <em>James Williams; </em>because there is no privity between- the plaintiff, as trustee of <em>James' Williams, </em>and the defendants* so as to enable him to support this* suit;' which instruction and direction the Court (Archer, Ch\u00bf- J., and Hanson, A.

That the certificate of the commissioners of insolvent debtors, that the insolvent had complied with the requisitions of the statute, and the final discharge of the insolvent by the Court, is conclusive evidence of the regularity of the proceedings in the insolvent debtors\u2019 court, and cannot be collaterally reviewed in a suit between the trustee and a debtor of the insolvent. 2. That under the act of 1816, establishing the insolvent debtors\u2019 court, a permanent trustee is not required to give bond, with security. 3. The defect, if it be one, of the trustee not having given bond, can only be taken advantage of by plea in abatement. They referred to <em>Stark. Evid. 547, 548.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">delivered the opinion of the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">This is an action of <em>assumpsit </em>brought by the appellant in <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, as trustee of <em>James Williams, </em>an <em>insolvent debtor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The declaration contains the usual counts, for goods sold and delivered, money lent, &amp;c., to which there is the general issue plea of <em>non assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The appellant claims in the character of trustee; and at the trial, for the purpose of proving his title, and right to recover, produced in evidence the papers and proceedings connected with the application and final discharge of <em>Williams, </em>the insolvent. By which it appears, that the bond given by the appellant for the performance of his duty as trustee, is without security, for which reason the Court below instructed the jury, that he was not <em>entitled to </em>recover. And it is here contended, 1st. That the certificate of the commissioners of insolvent debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>that <em>Williams, </em>the insolvent, had complied with all the requisitions of the insolvent laws, and his final discharge, are conclusive evidence of the regularity of the proceedings, and of the insolvency of <em>Williams, </em>and of the appellant\u2019s right to sue in an action between him as trustee, and a debtor of the insolvent. 2d. That under the insolvent laws of the State, a trustee of an insolvent debtor discharged in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>is not required to give bond, with security, for the faithful discharge of his duty. And 3d. That if a bond, with security, is required to be given by a trustee of an insolvent debtor, he not having given such a bond, can only be taken advantage of by a debtor of the insolvent, in a suit by the trustee, by a plea in abatement, and not on a plea of <em>non assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The whole of these points were raised in argument, and elaborately discussed, in the case of <em>Houck vs. Crouse, </em>decided by this Court at June Term, 1828, in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>was held, that in a suit by a trustee of an insolvent debtor, claiming in his character of trustee, and not in his own right, a general issue plea does not admit the character in which the plaintiff sues, but that such a suit is analagous to the case of an assignee of a bankrupt claiming in that character; and that on the general issue, the plaintiff must prove every thing essential to the showing himself clothed with the character and authority of a trustee; which could not be done by the production of the certificate of the commissioners and the final discharge of the insolvent only, but that all the proceedings must be exhibited. That the different insolvent laws of the State constitute one general system, and must be construed together; and so construed, require a bond, with security, to be given by the trustee, before he can act as such, without which he cannot be invested with the character and rights of a trustee. That to establish his character as trustee, and right to sue in that capacity, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to show that such a bond was given, by proof of the bond itself, and not by the production merely of the certificate of the commissioners, that the insolvent had complied with all the requisitions of the insolvent laws, and his final discharge; and that if he does not do so, the defendant is not driven to a plea in abatement, but may take advantage of it on the general issue. And we have heard nothing in the argument of this case to induce a departui\u2019e from what was decided in the case of <em>Houck vs. Crouse. </em>We concur, therefore, with the Court below, in the instruction given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"Apb\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
