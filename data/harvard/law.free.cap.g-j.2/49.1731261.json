After this, the representative of the deceased, the defendant, attended several meetings of the persons interested in the said claims, at which it was always stated, that the plaintiff was acting as the agent of the owners of the properly taken in prosecuting their claim. The defendant also gave the plaintiff a letter of introduction, in which he was mentioned as the \u201crepresentative of the unfortunate''owners\u201d of the property, for which indemnity was sought; and the person to whom it was addressed, was requested to aid the plaintiff in obtaining redress. One of the witnesses also proved, that in frequent conversations with the defendant, he, the witness, had stated that twenty per cent, was the commission stipulated to bo paid by the owners of the aforesaid property; and that the defendant never objected to the same.

The plaintiff further offered evidence, that the said <em>George Stiles </em>died in the year 1819, and before any decision had been made by Congress on the subject of said petition; that sometime subsequent to the death of said <em>George Stiles, </em>and after the defendant had taken out letters testamentary on his estate, he, the defendant, attended several meetings of the aforesaid owners, on the subject of the aforesaid petition, in which it was always stated, that said <em>Causten </em>was acting as the agent of said owners in prosecuting the petition aforesaid. And further, that the defendant wrote the following letter, which he addressed to Commodore <em>Rodgers, </em>at the city of <em>Washington: \u201cBaltimore, </em>1st February, 1821. <em>Commodore John Rodgers: </em>My dear Sir, \u2014 Permit me the pleasure of introducing to your acquaintance, my friend, <em>Mr. James Causten, </em>who visits your city on the subject of the vessels so prudently and efficaciously sunk in this harbor on the ever memorable September, 1814. Mr. <em>Causten </em>goes,, as a representative of the unfortunate owners, who, you know, have ever since been refused a fair com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>pensation for the very heavy damages sustained, and must <em>beg the </em>favor of you <em>to </em>grant him such friendly advice and information as you may deem calculated to aid him in this very deteriorated business. Yours, with great respect, and pure regard, <em>John S. </em>Stiles.\u201d The plaintiff also offered evidence by <em>Robert </em>Barry, that he had had frequent conversations with the defendant, in which he stated that twenty per cent, was the commission stipulated to be paid by said owners, and that the defendant never objected to the same. He also offered in evidence the act of Congress, making the compensation. And that the amount of loss ascertained, according to the provisions of said act, to have been sustained by the destruction of said vessels, owned as aforesaid by said <em>George Stiles, </em>being between five and six thousand dollars, was duly paid to the defendant, as executor of said <em>George Stiles, </em>by the agents of the government, and that he has never accounted to the plaintiff for any part of the money so received, but has retained the whole amount. And the plaintiff, further to support the issue on his part, gave evidence to the jury, by legal and competent testimony, that he did collect the documents and proofs in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and elsewhere, which were necessary to support the <em>claims of the petitioners, including those of the </em>said <em>George Stiles, </em>and that he did, previous to the death of the said <em>George Stiles </em>in 1819, after said contract, proceed to <em>Washington, </em>and that since the death of the said <em>Stiles, </em>and since letters have been granted to the defendant, did as well collect other documents and evidence in support of said claim, as attend at <em>Washington </em>during several sessions of Congress, prosecuting the claims of the petitioners and of the defendant, until the passage of the law of Congress aforesaid, by which the claims of the petitioners were liquidated. Whereupon, the defendant prayed the Court to instruct the jury, that, 1st. If the jury shall believe, from the evidence in the cause, that <em>George Stiles, </em>in his life-time, contracted with the plaintiff for his services as an agent in prosecuting claims for compensation alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to be due, for the destruction of certain vessels owned by the testator in his life-time, and for which he was to receive at the rate of 20 per centum, and that he continued to act in virtue of <em>that agency, </em>after the death of said <em>George Stiles, </em>in pursuance of said contract^ then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action; which opinion the court (Archer, Ch. J.) gave. Thereupon the defendant further prayed the opinion of the Court, and their direction to the jury, that there is not sufficient evidence in the cause, to shew that any <em>new </em>contract was made between the plaintiff and the defendant, after the death of <em>George Stiles, </em>by which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this cause from the defendant, in his individual capacity. And the defendant further prayed the opinion of the Court, that if the jury believe that the claim set up in this case was on a contract for procuring a law of Congress, then the same is against public policy and void; both of which opinions the Court refused to give. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b60-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Stiles, </em>the executor of <em>George Stiles, </em>and <em>Causten, </em>the appellee, by which the latter was employed by the former as agent for the prosecution of the claim, which might be made on the <em>United Stales, </em>for the injury done to the vessels of the testator, sunk during the late war, for the preservation of the city of <em>Baltimore. </em>We concur with the opinion of the County Court, that there was. Putting out of view the fact, that such a contract was entered into between the testator in Ms \u00fcfe-time and <em>Causten,, </em>and it is unquestionable, from the proof in the cause, that a jury might, nay, ought, to infer the existence of an agreement of this kind, between the appellant and the appellee. Upon no other principle can a solution be given to the acts of <em>John S. Stiles. </em>The right of the jury to draw this inference, is not taken away by proof of a contract between the testator and <em>Causten, </em>of which there is no legal proof that <em>John 8. Stiles </em>had any knowledge. The fact of such knowledge, is a matter for the jury to decide upon, after deliberating on all the circumstances in testimony before them. The inference of its existence is not self-evident, or so undeniably true, that the human mind could not doubt on the subject. The County Court were right, therefore, in submitting it to the consideration of the jury. We mean to decide simply the question before us; and to intimate no opinion, as to the appellee\u2019s right to recover on the count for money had and received, in case all his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>services as agent, had been rendered under his contract with <em>George Stiles, </em>the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
