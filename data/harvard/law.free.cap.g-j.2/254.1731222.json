The defendant further offered in evidence that he then applied to said <em>Mayo, </em>who said that they might be among the books and dockets that were in the committee room of the House of Delegates, which had been used by the clerks when employed in recording the Chancery papers, and that he would examine there for them; that witness went to examine last evening, but found the book cases locked, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>learned on inquiry that <em>Gideon Pearce </em>the clerk of the House of Delegates, who has the key of the said hook cases, is now on the Eastern Shore of this State, and witness was therefore unable to make the examination, and does not know whether the books are there or not. And after the aforesaid evidence was given, the defendant by his counsel, <em>offered to </em>read in evidence from one of the original minute books of the Court of Chancery, the following reports and orders:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">\u201c In Chancery, September Term, 1818. \u2014 On examination of the dockets and fd.es in the office of the Register of the Chancery Court, laid before me in pursuance of the order of the 2d instant, it is ordered, with respect to the decrees, papers and proceedings in the time of <em>Thomas H.

The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">5th Exception. In addition to the evidence stated in the preceding bills of exceptions numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, the defendant produced as a witness, <em>Ramsay Waters, </em>Esq. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the present. Register of the Court of Chancery, who succeeded <em>T.

II. Bowie; </em>that he performed the duly with as much care and accuracy as he could, having till the next meeting of the General Assembly to complete it, and that according to the most accurate estimate he could make, the costs of making up the records of said office, whilst said <em>T. II. Bowie </em>was the Register, to wit, from 1st January, 1816, to February, 1821, would be $ 1500. And the defendant then offered to prove by said <em>Ramsay Waters, </em>that according to that estimate it would have cost nothing to complete the records, for not completing which, this suit is brought, because the records for that period of time had been all correctly made up by the said <em>Bowie, </em>in his life-time \u2014 to the admissibility of such last mentioned parol testimony so offered, the plaintiff by his counsel objected \u2014 and the Court was of opinion that the same was inadmissible and rejected the same. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">6th Exception. Upon the whole evidence stated in the preceding bills of exceptions, the plaintiff by his counsel prayed the opinion of the Court, that the books produced being records of the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, made out and recorded by the persons authorised and required by law to record the same, are of themselves <em>prima facie </em>evidence, that the papers and proceedings were such as the law required to be recorded by the said persons\u2014 and inasmuch as the defendant is liable for the default of the aforesaid <em>T. II. Bowie, </em>in not recording the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, which it became his duty between the date of his bond and the end of the third week in November, 1816, to record, that the plaintiff is entitled in this action to recover the damages sustained by the <em>State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>for such default of the said <em>T. II. Bowie, </em>and that the measure of damages is the sum paid by the <em>State </em>for recording the proceedings which it became the duty of the said <em>Bowie, </em>during the period last above mentioned to record, unless the defendant can shew by the inspection of the said books or other records of the Court of Chancery, that papers and proceedings have been illegally recorded in the books above mentioned, or that the <em>State </em>has paid an unreasonable sum for the said recording. To the giving of which instruction the defendant by his counsel objected, for admitting the right of the <em>State </em>to sue for the expenses incurred in the completion of said records \u2014 yet the whole of those expenses have been incurred since the institution of this suit. Because the papers which have been transcribed are not records, and have no right to be considered as such \u2014 and because said papers were selected by the persons who were merely appointed to transcribe the papers required by law to be recorded, and were not authorised to decide what papers ought to be recorded, and by the terms of the contract were to be paid according to the number of sides which they might record \u2014 and because the bond upon which this suit is brought, was not required by the Constitution, or any existing law, and therefore the defendant is not responsible under said bond, for the conduct of said <em>Bowie, </em>as Register of the Court of Chancery, for any <em>period .of </em>time \u2014 and because the original papers have not been produced, and there is no proof that the copies have ever been examined or compared with the originals. But the Court gave the instruction as prayed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The defendant excepted. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $652 12; both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b278-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Because the condition of his bond as Register, by its terms covers the whole time he continued in office, under the original appointment, or a succession of annual appointments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-8\">3. Because the condition is broken, if all the papers and record books, which were by him added, while he held the office in manner above mentioned, were not, at his death, in good order and repair, with the records and entries for all that time, faithfully, and truly, and legally made up, and entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">On the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, they insisted, that the <em>State </em>may recover, beyond the penalty of the bond, if more than the penalty of the bond should be proved to be due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\">The great question arises on the <em>jirst </em>exception, which involves the enquiry, whether the office of the Register of the Court of Chancery, is an annual appointment. According to the practice, the appointment is not annually made; it follows, therefore, if the office is one to which the incumbent must be annually appointed, that for a long time since the adoption of the Constitution we have had no Register. They referred to the <em>Act of </em>1716, <em>ch. </em>1, <em>sec. </em>1, 3, 5; 1742, <em>ch. </em>10, <em>sec. </em>2, 3, <em>7 </em>\u2014 Constitution, <em>Art. </em>10, <em>sec. </em>49. If the language of the Constitution is doubtful, then the contemporaneous construction, and continued practice of those who framed it, is entitled to great consideration. According to the Constitution the old officer is to continue to act, until a new one is appointed and qualified, and he holds in virtue of the old appointment \u2014 if then he may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>required to act beyond the third week in November, it follows that his bond will continue answerable. If his office continues, his responsibility, and his bond must continue \u2014 unless you disregard the words of the Constitution, which provides for the continuance in office of the old officer, you must say that he will so continue, and remain responsible, until a successor is appointed, and qualifies, no matter how long the period may be. The security, when he becomes such, must be supposed to look to this provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">But if the appointment is annual, still the bond is good for more than one year. The bond is in conformity with the act of 1742, and it was competent to the Legislature notwithstanding the nature of the appointment, to require a bond for more than one year: they referred to the act of 1823, ch. 195. For what period was the bond intended to be given? This is a question on the construction of the bond. 2 Maul. <em>and Selw. </em>369. Under the act of 1823, <em>ch. </em>195, a bond would be good for two years, because the Legislature have directed that it shall be given for two years. Under the act of 1742, its obligation covers the whole period; the Register may remain in office, because such is the clear meaning of the act, and the power of the Legislature to require, and the party to give such a bond,- can hardly be doubted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">The right to recover beyond the penalty of the bond, is the question presented by this exception. The <em>Act of </em>1825, <em>ch. </em>208, <em>sec. </em>1, creates this difficulty \u2014 a surety in a public bond, cannot discharge himself by paying the penalty \u2014 the object of requiring the bond, is to provide personal security. The small amount of the penalty of Constables\u2019 bonds, being greatly below the sums which ordinarily must pass through their hands, shows that the Legislature never intended to limit the responsibility of the surety to the penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Can it be contended, that in an action by a party to a constable\u2019s bond, (hat lie or his sureties could discharge themselves by proving the payment of the penalty to a third person. The principal question on the 6th exception is, whether the <em>Registers </em>of the Chancery Court <em>are </em>required to give bond? The acts of the provincial legislature are in force, unless inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution. The 53d <em>section </em>of the constitution could not have been designed to disable the legislature from demanding a bond. The 10th <em>section </em>of the constitution authorises the putting of office bonds in suit, yet the only officer expressly required by the constitution to give bond, is the sheriff. They referred to the acts of 1800, <em>ch. </em>83, <em>sec. </em>3, and 1801, <em>ch. </em>60. All the laws since the constitution requiring bonds, are invalid, if those prior to it are repealed by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-4\">3. Can the State recover, otherwise than as an individual, for suits in which she is interested? Act of 1743, <em>ch. </em>10, <em>sec. </em>7. The error on this subject is, in drawing our analogies from the powers of the king of England. The State can have no separate interest, as the king has. She is hut a trustee, a mere agent, having no interest of her own, her interests, being the interests of the people, ilow could an injury, similar to the one now complained <em>of, </em>he redressed by an individual? The individual could not authorise the records to be made up; the expense of doing which could alone furnish the measure of damages. The State'is interested in quieting titles, and preserving the harmony of the public. The act of 1748 provides for the disposition of the penalty of the bond. The papers in the office are not the property of the litigating parties. They are fded there for the benefit of those who claim under them, and cannot he withdrawn after being once filed. .By the act of 1748, the Register was not only to keep the records in repair, but he was bound to record all the papers that were filed in his office for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">The question upon the 4th and 5th exception, is upon the admissibility of secondary evidence to prove the contents of a record. The record fyooks were, of course, the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>evidence, and the question is upon the sufficiency of the foundation for the introduction of secondary evidence; reasonable diligence to procure the best proof, was not employed. There was no evidence of a careful search in the office, but if there was, yet as the books were seen out of the office, a mere search in the office, would not be reasonable diligence. The meaning of the rule that the best evidence must be sought for is, that you are to look where you are likely to find the thing sought after. The place where the record is kept, is not, of course, the place in which it is likely to be found. 1 <em>Jackson vs. Hasbrouck, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>194. The orders of the Chancellor could not be evidence <em>per se. </em>They are passed upon an inspection of the record. His knowledge of the fact is derived from this examination. These orders and minutes are not judicial acts, and the'fact that they certify the existence of the books, shows that there is better evidence than they themselves furnish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-4\">Were the papers from the Council Chamber, records? The resolutions of the legislature, under which these papers were recorded, only authorised the withdrawal, and the Register to deliver such papers as the law require to be recorded. A record is made by transcribing papers authorised to be recorded by law, by persons who are authorisedto.do so, by law. Records are not required to undergo a previous examination before they are entitled to the consideration due to them. as such. The papers from the Council Chamber were not offered as conclusive, but merely <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and the defendants were bound to have shown,- in order to destroy their effect, either that the papers were not correctly copied, or that they contained proceedings not proper to be recorded. In regard to the objection, that the money was not paid, until after suit was brought, they insisted, that the right to sue, is for the breach of official duty; \u2014 it is that which gives the cause of action, and the money paid, furnishes the measure of damages; and as these papers were recorded for twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>five per cent. less than the law allows for such services, the defendant cannot complain of a measure so furnished.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-5\"><em>Magruder </em>and <em>Brewer </em>for <em>Way man </em>\u2014 on <em>Wayman\u2019s </em>appeal.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">1. The Registers in Chancery, are not legally required to give bond. 3. The <em>State </em>has no right to sue for the omission to record any case in which it is not a parly, or interested in the event of the suit. 3. The minute books offered in evidence were primary, and the best evidence that could be offered to prove, that the records of the year 1816, were duly recorded by the said <em>Thomas Id. Bowie. </em>4. That the book, and parol testimony offered, ought to have been admitted, if secondary evidence only, it being sufficiently shown that recourse could not be had to the original records. 5. That the books produced are not <em>prima, facie </em>evidence; that the papers and proceedings are such as the law requires to be recorded, and the amount paid by the <em>State, </em>is not the proper measure of damages. 1. Because the said hooks are <em>not </em>records. 2. Because the papers were selected by the persons appointed to transcribe the records, and who were not authorised to decide what papers ought to be recorded, and who were to be paid according to the number of sides transcribed. 3. Because the original papers have not been produced, and there is no proof that the copies have been examined and compared with tlie originals. 4. That the <em>State </em>is not entitled to recover in this action, the amount paid for recording said papers, because the whole was paid after the institution of this suit. 1. Officers, as a matter of course, are not required to give bond; there must be some law requiring it, and neither the constitution, or law requires it, in the case of the Register in <em>Chancery </em>\u2014 Section 52 prescribes his qualifications, but it is silent in regard to a bond. Sheriffs are directed to give bond, and if it had intended that the Register should do so, a similar requisition would have been adopted in regard to that officer. No bond was ever given by a Regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ter, from the adoption of the constitution, until 1811. 2. But if a bond is necessary, still the <em>State </em>can only recover for breaches in reference to cases in which she is a party, or is interested. The papers in the Ohaneery office are the property of the parties, until they are put on the record; until then the <em>State </em>had no interest. They referred to the acts of 1716 and 1742. The 5th <em>section </em>of the act of 1710 authorises the <em>State </em>to sue only when the records are not in repair, and by the same section, individuals are empowered to sue for damages sustained before the proceedings are recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">The 4th and 5th exceptions presents the question of the nature of the evidence, which the defendant is to produce, that t,he papers have been recorded. The object <em>in </em>offering the orders and minute book, was not to prove the contents of the record books, but to show the <em>existence </em>of sueh books. In controversies of a civil nature, the record books cannot be produced; their contents can only be proved by exemplified copies. The contents of a record can only be proved by the book itself, or a copy; because the contents cannot be carried in the memory, but proving the <em>existence </em>of the book, is a different affair. The proof that the proceedings in question have been recorded, is that of the very officer to whom the act of 1817, <em>ch. 119, sec. 6, had </em>confided the duty of prescribing those that should be recorded. To show that the evidence offered, if regarded merely as secondary, was admissible, they referred to 12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">On the appeal of the <em>State, </em>they contended, 1. That the appointment was an annual one, hut if not annual, still the bond was only good for one year. Officers here, since the adoption of the constitution, hold as they do in <em>England. </em>There is no such thing in the <em>State, </em>as an officer holding at the pleasure of the government. They all hold, either during good behavior, or their appointments are annual. The 48th <em>section </em>of the constitution prescribes the tenure by which offices are to be held, and the 49th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>speaks of the bonds to bo given. The office of Register is not among those which are to bo held during good behavior. The commission of the Register must expire on the third week in IRoveinbor in each year, and being an annual appointment, iho sureties are only liable for one year. <em>Union Bank of Maryland vs. Ridgely, </em>1 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>324, 328, 432. Bonds to the <em>Stale </em>are to be construed according to the intention of the parties, as bonds to individuals. <em>Lord Arlington vs. </em>Merrick, 3 <em>Saund. 414. </em>2. But if the office is not animal, still the bond is good but for one year. That part of the constitution which speaks of the re-appointment, says nothing about the continuing responsibility of the old bond. It dispenses with a new commission and a second qualification, and it is to be supposed, that if they intended to dispense with a new bond, they would have so provided. Upon the question of the liability of the bond for more than the penalty, and to show that it cannot be liable for more, they referred to <em>Lansdale vs. Church, </em>2 <em>Durnf. and East. </em>388. <em>While vs. Sealy, </em>1 <em>Doug. </em>49. <em>Wilde vs. Clarkson, </em>6 <em>Term Rep. </em>303. 1. <em>Atk. </em>79. <em>Tew vs. Earle of Winterton, </em>3 <em>Bro.

We will first decide on the exceptions taken by the <em>Stale, </em>and then turn our attention to those signed at. the instance of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The suit was instituted on an office copy of the bond of <em>Thomas II. Bowie, </em>late Register in Chancery, against <em>Henry Wayman, </em>one of his securities. The bond was entered into when <em>Thomas II. Bowie </em>was first appointed to the office, on the 34th day of January, 1816, and he continued to act as Register until his death, in 1881, without being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>re-appointed by the Executive, or having renewed his obligation to the <em>State: </em>and the first question that presents itself is, can the plaintiff recover in this action, for the failure of <em>Thomas II. Bowie </em>to record all proceedings from the date of the bond, to the time of his death, which it was the duty of the Register of the Court of Chancery for the time being to record ?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">This general question brings into immediate view the constitutional point in the cause, as well as the construction to be given to the contract contained in the obligation which is the ground of the action. The one will be disposed of by a recurrence to the constitution itself, and the other by an examination of the language of the condition of the bond, in connexion with the act of Assembly under which <em>it was </em>given.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">All appointments to office under the constitution, by the executive of the <em>State, </em>are made by the authority of the 40th, 48th and 49th sections; and it not being pretended that the Register in Chancery is commissioned during good behavior, he is necessarily an officer of annual appointment, under the 49th section. The tenure of his office being limited, he cannot continue to act after his term expires, except in the single instance of the appointment of a successor, in which case he may act until such successor, commissioned in his stead, is qualified. If re-appointed, he may continue to act without any new commission or qualification, but unless re-appointed, he is not legally an incumbent of the office, and cannot lawfully perform any of its duties. This is the plain interpretation of the constitution ; and in arriving at its meaning, our attention has been confined to the instrument itself, and we could not think ourselves at liberty to regard the devious course which is said heretofore to have been pursued in relation to the appointment of this officer. ' The constitutional grant limits the duration of the office to a certain term, and no irregularities in the proceedings of the appointing power, can extend it beyond that period. The idea so much insisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>on, of continuing office without a re-appointment, until a new appointment is made, it is supposed has grown out of these deviations from the constitutional law, and therefore cannot receive the sanction of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The parties to the bond, executed it with an express reference to the provisions of the constitution, as thus expounded ; and if its language could create a responsibility, not comprehended within them, we do not think that the expressions of this contract operate such an effect. The condition rightly and properly pursues the form the act of 1742 prescribes, and its words that seem to look to an extended responsibility, are, \u201cwhilst he shall continue in the office of Register of the Court of Chancery,\u201d \u201cand during the time he hath officiated in the said Register\u2019s office;\u201d and these, we are clearly of opinion, are to be construed to relate to the time the officer lawfully continues in his office, and not to a period when he holds it without authority. The provisions of the constitution form the basis of the contract, and like the recital in the condition of a bond, restrain the indefinite expressions used in it, and adapt them to the intention of the parties. Wliai this intention was at the time of making the contract, cannot be mistaken. It evidently was, to engage for a faithful discharge of duties, as long as they could be legitimately performed under the official grant, and no longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The question we have to decide in the second exception taken by the <em>State </em>is, whether the plaintiff\u2019 could recover in the action a sum larger than the penalty of the bond sued upon. This subject is not without its difficulties, and they have arisen chiefly from discordant adjudications in reference to it. We will not attempt to point out these discordancies, but proceed at once with an expression of our own opinion, formed upon reflection, and on an attentive review of all the authorities we had an opportunity to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Yl hen the penalty of a bond is sued for against a surety, the utmost that can be recovered is the penalty, and legal interest thereon, by way of damages, <em>pro detent\u00c1one </em>debili, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>from the time the debt is demanded. This is the import and effect of his contract, and his accountability cannot be stretched beyond it. In this position we are fully sustained by many authorities, but by none more effectually than by 1 <em>Saund. </em>58, <em>note </em>1, and <em>Harris vs. </em>Clap, <em>et al. </em>1 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>308. This was an action against <em>Clap </em>and surety, on an arbitration bond, in the penal sum of $5000, conditioned to pay an award of $4618 68, which had remained so long unpaid, that the interest carried the amount greatly beyond the penalty of the bond. Under a rule of reference in the Court of Common Pleas, a judgment had been entered up on the award against <em>Clap: </em>he removed the case to the Supreme Court, on a petition of review, Avhich had been dismissed. In the suit on the arbitration bond, <em>Clap </em>and his surety confessed the forfeiture of the obligation; and the question made was, what sum the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the defendants. Th\u00e9 judges delivered their opinions at large, and determined that the judgments should be entered for the penalty of the bond, and interest thereon, by Avay of damages, for the detention of the debt from the time it Avas demanded by the Avrit; talcing care that it should not exceed the sum due on the ayvard, Avhich Avas in truth and conscience the plaintiff\u2019s demand; and the chief judge declared, that in no case could the plaintiff\u2019s demand be allowed to overrun the penalty and interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In the case under consideration,-if the Court below had granted the plaintiff\u2019s prayer, sanction might have been given to a recovery opposed to this case of <em>Harris vs. </em>Clapp, <em>et al. </em>and as we believe, to several other authorities on this doctrine, that could easily be averted to. The plaintiff might have recovered $4000 or \u00a31500, notwithstanding the penalty and interest fell greatly short of that sum. The prayer, however, was refused, and we entirely approve of the opinion given by the Court, Avhich declared, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover more than \u00a31000, the penalty of the bond. It is not in every case that interest by way of damages is to be recovered on the penalty: and when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>case occurs, as it most commonly does where the obligee is plaintiff, or is asking in some form for relief, it may be considered as an exception to the general rule, which limits the recovery by the penalty of the bond. 3 <em>Caine\u2019s Rep. </em>49. 1 <em>Dougl. </em>49. 2 <em>Wm. Black. </em>1190. 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>303, <em>(no.) Equity Cases, </em>92. 3. <em>Sergt. and Lowb. </em>297. That the recovery in this action was properly so limited is apparent to us, when we call to mind that the question arose on a prayer to instruct the jury, who were to assess damages for breaches assigned or proved in the condition of a collateral bond, and were wholly unauthorised by the issues to find damages for the detention of the debt. Over the last they had no cognizance, and it cannot in any way be received in this case, as a subject for the instruction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We have a word or two more for this branch of the case, before we dismiss it: We have to beg that our proposition may not be misunderstood. When we state, that the responsibility of a surety cannot be extended further than the penalty of the bond, with interest thereon, by way of damages; our meaning is, to apply it to a question of recovery in a single case, and in no manner to affect the rights of other persons, who may have just grounds to sue the same bond.' If they have distinct demands, it is clear, that a recovery and payment in one suit can be no bar to other actions, in which the several claimants may recover to the same extent, and can only be limited by the penalty: and in particular cases, by the penalty and interest, as in <em>Harris vs. Clap, et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Having decided on the exceptions taken by the <em>Stale, </em>we will now turn our thoughts, for a short time, to the four remaining exceptions, signed at the instance of the defendant. In the <em>third </em>exception the defendant\u2019s prayer is laid at the root of the action, and denies the <em>State\u2019s </em>right to maintain it. The plaintiff exhibited before the jury, sundry resolutions of the Legislature, authorizing the Governor and Council to contract, in the name of the <em>State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>with some person or persons, to record the unrecorded papers in the Chancery office: and offered the proceedings of the executive under the resolutions. And also offered in evidence the original records, made under the said resolutions and proceedings, and which had been returned to the Governor and Council, and accepted by them, and remained in the Council Chamber for the purpose of binding up, before they were deposited in the Chancery office. He also offered in evidence that the proceedings in Chancery, before the end of the third week in November, 1816, required to be recorded by <em>Thomas H. Bowie, </em>and left unrecorded by him, had been recorded under the said resolutions and proceedings, and accepted by the Governor and Council, and deposited in the Council Chamber as <em>aforesaid; </em>and he produced the said records in Court, and offered further in evidence, that these last mentioned records cost the <em>State </em>about \u00a7725, which it had paid to the persons employed to make the same. The defendant on his part offered in evidence from the said records so produced, that many of the cases improperly omitted to be recorded by <em>Thomas H. Bowie, </em>were suits between individuals to which the <em>State </em>was not a party, and in which the <em>State </em>had no other interest than what belongs to it as the guardian of the rights of its individual citizens. And then prayed ail instruction to the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages for the omission by <em>Thomas H. Bowie, </em>to record proceedings and decrees in suits, to which the <em>State </em>was not a party, and on account of which nothing was paid to <em>Bowie </em>by the <em>State, </em>or by him demanded of it. Our reflections on this point, have satisfied us, that the Court were right in refusing this direction to the jury. To say nothing at present of the acts of 1716, <em>ch. </em>1, and 1742, <em>eh. </em>10, which in terms give the action to the public, it appears to us, it may be sustained by the <em>State </em>on one ground without the aid of others. The records of our Courts of Justice are to be considered as public property, and so important is it to the community that they should be made up correctly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>preserved with care, that when a neglect in these particulars in any \u2019of its officers occurs, an obligation is imposed on the <em>Stale </em>to supply the defect, and have the work done at the expense of the Treasury. The defaults of the officers are thus visited on the public, and their bonds afford the only means of security for the <em>Stale to </em>r\u00e9sort to against loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The <em>fourth </em>and <em>fifth </em>exceptions present questions of evidence, and are of minor consideration, and will be disposed of at the same time. The defendant wished to give in evidence two record books, in which were recorded proceedings required to be recorded by <em>Thomas it. Bowie. </em>He proved by the present Register, that two such books were in the Chancery office, and being unable to produce them, he endeavored, by testimony, to .show they were lost, in order to let in the secondary proof of them, which he offered to lay before the jury. The point then is, whether his testimony was sufficient to answer the purpose he had in view. Whether the evidence of the loss of the books, was such as to authorise the admission of the proof offered. The Court below thought it was not, and we cannot but coincide in the opinion. The utmost extent to which the testimony Went, was to prove that the books inquired after had been missed from the Chancery office, and that there was every reason to believe they had been taken out by, and were in the hands of, some of the persons engaged in recording the Chancery proceedings, under the resolutions of the Legislature: and that <em>Joseph </em>Mayo, the only one of the recording Clerks applied to for these record books, stated he did not recollect having taken them out, and did not know that he had ever seen them out of the office; and while the trial was going on, that he made an unsuccessful search for them among the books and dockets in the committee room of the House of Delegates, which had been used by the Clerks when employed in recording the Chancery papers. This testimony is inconclusive' and unsatisfactory, and leaves the mind in doubt, whether by a further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>search the record books sought for, might not have been regained. Several persons were employed in making up these records, and for some purpose, it is believed, had these books, and yet one of them alone was applied to for them, and the application to him was made at so late a period, that a confused and hurried examination for them could only be made. This is not the reasonable diligence the law requires in hunting up lost records, and is insufficient to let in, to the jury, the parol proof mentioned in the <em>fifth </em>exception, or the inferior evidence offered by the defendant in the <em>fourth </em>exception. The primary character claimed on the argument, for the reports and orders in the time of Chancellor <em>Kilty, </em>made under the act of 1817, <em>ch. </em>119, and offered in the <em>fourth </em>exception, cannot <em>be </em>acceeded to them. If they are evidence at all, a point upon which it is unnecessary to make up an opinion, they must range in the subordinate class, and cannot be received to supply the place of a record, until conviction is produced on the minds of the Court of the loss of it. The principal objection made by the defendant in the last exception, to the instruction prayed by the plaintiff was, that the bond sued on was not required by the constitution or any then existing law, and therefore he was not legally responsible under the said bond, for the conduct of <em>Bowie, </em>as Register of the Court of Chancery, for any period of time. This is a question of some magnitude, and we must return again to the constitution for the solution of it. The sheriff is the only officer who is required, in express terms, by the constitution to give bond and security, and this, by the 42d <em>section, </em>he is bound to do, every <em>year,u as </em>usual.\u201d The form then in use was prescribed by the act of 1715, <em>ch. </em>46, and it was constantly after used by the sheriff elected by the people, until the year 1794, when it was found expedient to increase the penalty and alter some parts of the condition. It was competent to the Legislature to prescribe a new form of bond for the sheriff, immediately after 1776; but at that juncture, there was other business to occupy that body, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>were willing to repose upon the then laws of <em>Maryland, </em>which unquestionably formed the ground work of the constitution itself. How else are we to understand the before mentioned expression of the 42d <em>section, as usual, </em>which has a direct reference to the existing laws, or the practice under them. The County Clerks, by the constitution, are to hold their commissions during good behavior, and although they are not expressly directed to give bond and surety, as in the case of the sheriff, from the year 1776 to the year 1800, bonds were given by them, and that according to the form prescribed by the act of 1742, <em>chap. </em>2. in the last mentioned year, the year 1800, a law was passed compelling the Clerks of the County Courts to give bonds in larger penalties, and with a different form of condition. The same may be said <em>of the other </em>officers named in the act of 1742, and in the constitution of the <em>State; </em>all of whom, at one period or other, within the last fifty years, have complied with the act, and given bond, pursuant to its provisions, without any respect whatever to the tenure of their offices, which, under the <em>Provincial </em>government, it is believed, was only <em>durante bene pl\u00e1cito. Bordley vs. Lloyd, </em>1 <em>Harr. and M\u2019Hen. </em>27. All this uniformity <em>of </em>proceeding, from the earliest times, goes forcibly to prove, that the acts of 1716, <em>ch. </em>1, and 1742, <em>ch. </em>2, were existing laws at the adoption of the constitution, and were so considered <em>by </em>those who were first engaged in carrying it into execution. If this wants further confirmation, we think it may he found in the 10th <em>section </em>of the constitution itself, which seems to point to those laws, and to imply strongly, that other officers than the sheriff were to give bond with security. The section gives to the House of Delegates power to direct all office bonds, which are to be made payable to the <em>State, </em>to be sued for any <em>breach of duty. </em>We clearly think, then, that the defendant was responsible under the bond, for the conduct of <em>Bowie, </em>as Register of the Court of Chancery, the first year he was in offiee. Other objections were started by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s prayer in the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>exception, all of which we consider groundless, and as forming no legal impediment to the instruction given by the Court to the jury. We do not deem it necessary to give them a particular notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
