Plowden, </em>the present appellee, appeared and became a party to the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The defendant pleaded payment, and an account in bar for rent due from <em>Llewellin, </em>the intestate of the appellee; issues were joined upon these pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">1. At the trial, the defendant offered to read in evidence, the receipt of <em>William H. Plowden </em>to him for $200, dated February 16th, 1827, to which the plaintiff objected, and the Court, (Plater, A. J.) sustained the objection. The plaintiff then offered evidence to prove, that the note, on which the action was founded, was given for property belonging to the estate of <em>Jeremiah Boothe, </em>and sold by the said <em>John Llewellin </em>as his executor. The defendant objected to the admissibility of this proof, but the Court (Plater, A. . J.) overruled the objection, and permitted it to go to the jury. The plaintiff then prayed the Court to instruct the jury, that if from the evidence in this cause, they should be . of the opinion, that the rent charged in the account in bar was due from <em>John Llewellin </em>to the defendant, in his individual right, and not as executor, that then the defendant is not entitled to be credited with it in this action. The Court (Plater, A. J.) gave the instruction as prayed, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">The verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The cause was submitted on notes by the appellant to Buchanan, Ch. J. Earle, and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-5\"><em>Slonestreet, </em>for the apppellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-6\">1. The action being on a sealed note, the proof offered by the plaintiff to show its consideration, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-7\"><em>2. </em>Although <em>Llewellin is </em>described in the note as the executor of <em>Boothe, </em>still the suit was brought, and correctly brought, in his, <em>Llewellin'\u2019s </em>name; and therefore a payment to <em>Llewellin, </em>or an account in bar against him, was competent evidence to defeat the action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-8\">No counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b465-9\">Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGs\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The judgment in this case is reversed. The testimony offered by the plaintiff to prove the consideration of the bill, <em>under seal, </em>was not legal and proper evidence to go to the jury, and ought to have been rejected by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">This action was instituted by <em>Llewellin, </em>in his own right, and not in his capacity of executor of <em>Boothe, </em>and if the rent charged in the account in bar, was due from him, as a debt <em>of his own, </em>and not in his representative character, it was a legal set-oif in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">The error of the Court below appears to have proceeded from a misconception of the nature of this action. The debt to be set-off, must be due in the same right with that claimed. If, as they supposed, <em>Llewellin </em>sued <em>as </em>executor, their instruction would have been correct; but the claim being in his own right, the prayer of the plaintiff ought not to have prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
