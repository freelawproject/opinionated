On the 11th October, 1828, the appellee was reported to be entitled to his final discharge under the Insolvent Laws of the State, by the Commissioners of Insolvent debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>and on that day was accordingly discharged by <em>Baltimore </em>County Court. On the 23d March, 1829, the State sued out a writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>on the aforesaid judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>and the appellee was arrested, and brought before <em>Baltimore </em>County Court for commitment, lie thereupon moved the Court for his discharge from the custody of the sheriff on the ground that he had applied for the benefit of the insolvent Laws of Maryland, and obtained a final discharge since the rendition of the judgment aforesaid. And <em>Baltimore </em>County Court [Aechee, C. J.] accordingly discharged him. The State appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b415-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch. J. Eakle, and Stephen, A. J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-6\"><em>Taney, </em>(Atty. Genl.) and <em>Gill, </em>for the State,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4OA\">contended, that the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland </em>do not apply to the <em>Stale, </em>The <em>Slate </em>is not a creditor within their meaning; and the rights of the <em>State </em>against the persons of her debtors, are not restrained by them. They said that the insolvent laws of Maryland did not bar the <em>State </em>in the prosecution and recovery of her debts. The act of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, was the basis of the system, and when first enacted was a mere private act, Cor the relief of the persons mentioned in it. One of its provisions (Sect. 3,) required the debtor at the time of presenting his petition, to produce to the Court which was to grant the discharge, \u201c the assent in writing of so many of his creditors, as have due to them the amount of two-thirds of the debts due by him at the time of his application \u201d for relief. Foreign creditors not residing within the United States, or not having agents therein authorised to act in their behalf, are not to be considered as creditors within the meaning of the act. The 2d section required the Court, to which the application might be made, to direct personal notice of the application to be given to the creditors, or their agents, or public notice to be given where the debtor resides, and on the appearance of the creditor, or neglect to appear at the times and place appointed, the Court is to proceed with the consideration of the case. By the 9th section, creditors were au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>thorised to file allegations of fraud against the insolvent to vacate his discharge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-5\">When the Legislature was malting these various provisions requiring assent of creditors, and notice to creditors to he given, and authorising creditors to proceed against a fraudulent insolvent, it could not have escaped their attention, that no officer Was empowered to act for the public \u2014 none - entrusted to give the required assent to confer jurisdiction on the discharging court; none indicated to whom notice might be given, nor whose duty it was to take notice of the advertisement. Under these omissions in material and important particulars, essential to preserve the integrity of the system, to confer jurisdiction on the Court, and guard the rights of creditors, and consequently directly affecting the debts of the public, and leaving the <em>State, </em>in her character of creditor, entirely unrepresented, it is insisted that she is not a creditor within the spirit and meaning of the original system, and was not intended to be barred by it. There is no power short of the Legislature which can release a public debt; and when that authority, acting in the ordinary course of legislation, passes a law releasing debts generally, without any particular mention of the State, a question arises upon a fair construction of the whole law, whether the <em>State\u2019s </em>debts were intended to be released. If as many reasons tending to form an exception in favor of an individual could be found, it would be contended that a discharge under this system, would be no discharge of the claim of such individual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-6\">It is true that the authority to discharge, conferred upon the Court, is in its term broad enough to include the <em>State\u2019s </em>debt. The Court has power to order that the debtor shall be discharged, \u201cas well from all debts, covenants, contracts, promises and agreements due from, or owing, or contracted in his individual, as also in a co-partnership capacity, by him,\u201d before the time of his application, \u201c provided that no person who has been guilty of a breach of the law, and hath been fined, or is liable to be fined for such breach, shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>discharged from the payment of any fine incurred for any breach of the laws of this <em>State\u201d </em>but the question still remains what creditors shall lose their rights, what debts ar\u00e9 to be barred ? Answer, all debts due to persons who have a capacity and right to act under, and be affected by the conditions and principles upon which the discharge is to be obtained. The conditions and principles upon which the discharge is obtained, constitute the consideration upon which it is granted \u2014 the inquiry is therefore always open, as to what class of creditors is not affected by it. No argument can be drawn from the proviso, which is not an exception, nor in the nature of an exception; if the proviso had not been introduced into the act, a discharge from debts and covenants would not have released judgments for fines and breaches of the criminal code. It must therefore be con - sidered as introduced <em>ex abundante </em>cautela.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">It is true that the act of 1805, has, since its passage, beeii converted into a general system, by a legislative declaration that all insolvents may avail themselves of it, yet that does not change its construction in relation to creditors. They contended that a \u201claw is the best expositor of itself \u2014 that every part of an act is to be taken into view for the purpose of discovering the legislative mind, and that the details of one part may contain regulations restricting the extent of general expressions used in another part of the same act;\u201d that this was an undisputed rule in the construction and application of statutes, and one which applied directly to the act in question, when set up as a bar to a demand of the State. That the details of the insolvent debtors\u2019 act restrain its general expressions, and confine its application to those creditors only who could comply with its provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-6\">It is contended, moreover, that the State has a preference over all claims, except liens, upon the insolvent debtors\u2019 estate. If she is to be considered as embraced within the term creditor, instead of a priority she would have to come hi with other creditors for a distributive share. This would. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>produce a loss to the public not contemplated by the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-5\">They cited <em>acts of </em>1805, <em>ch. </em>110, <em>sec. </em>2. 1807, <em>ch. </em>150, <em>sec, 4. </em>1812, <em>ch. </em>77, <em>sec. </em>2, 5. <em>Cox Dig. </em>638. <em>Pennington vs. Coxe, </em>2 <em>Cranch, </em>33, 52. <em>State vs. Stump and Gilpin, </em>2 <em>Harr. and McHen. </em>174. <em>Murray vs. Ridley, admr. </em>3 <em>Harr. and McHen. </em>177. <em>Wood vs. Repold, </em>3 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>127. <em>State vs. Rogers and wife, </em>2 Harr. <em>and McHen. </em>198. <em>Contee vs. Chews, ex'tr. </em>1 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>417. <em>Kip vs. Bank New York, </em>10 <em>Johns. </em>63. <em>Kennedy vs. Strong, </em>10 <em>Johns. </em>289. <em>Act of </em>1792, <em>ch. </em>51.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-8\">No counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
