The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-13\">1. At the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the following award, and the order and guarantee thereunder written. !&lt; We, the subscribers, arbitrators appointed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Jacob Leab </em>and <em>Ezra Mantz, </em>in the settlement of accounts, of <em>Jacob Leab </em>against <em>Francis Ritchie, </em>from the commencement to the last date of the account: do award that <em>Ezra Mantz </em>pay unto <em>Jacob Leab, </em>or order, thirty days from the date hereof, $289 current money, being the balance we have allowed due <em>Jacob Leab, </em>on the accounts of <em>Francis Ritchie: </em>witness our hands, this 30th of May, 1820. <em>Isaac Mantz, Ns. </em>Turbatl.\u201d \u201c Mr. <em>Ezra Mantz </em>will please to pay <em>Ignatius Davis, </em>or order, the above award of $289 with interest. Which sum I guaranteed to said <em>Davis, </em>for value received, this 10th of September, 1822. <em>Jacob Leab.\u201d </em>Having first proved that <em>Jacob Leab </em>the defendant, signed and delivered the same to the plaintiff, at the time <em>it </em>bears date. The plaintiff further proved, that after the delivery to him of said award and order, he called on <em>Ezra Mantz, </em>the person therein named, for payment of said award, some time in tho month of October, 1822, who promised to do so, as soon as he could get money enough for that purpose. That the said <em>Ezra Mantz </em>failing to pay the amount of said award and order to the plaintiff, he instituted suit against him in <em>Frederick </em>County Court, to October term, 1823, upon which he obtained judgment at August term, 1824, for tho amount thereof, fie further proved, that at the time said judgment was obtained, and ever since, the said <em>Mantz </em>was, and still is insolvent. That on the first day of November, 1823, the plaintiff called on the defendant and informed him of the failure of said <em>Mantz </em>to pay to him, the said award and order, and demanded payment thereof from the defendant, who refused to pay the same, and thereupon this suit was instituted. The defendant then prayed the Court to instruct tho jury, that upon the evidence offered by the plaintiff, he is not entitled to recover. Which instruction the Court, (Seriver, and Th. Buchanan, A. J\u2019s.) gave. Tho plaintiff\u2019 excepted, and the verdict and judgment being for the defendant, the plaintiff' prosecuted the present appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Schley, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">The only question in this case is, whether the guarantee of the appellee is to be treated, as would be treated the contract of an endorser of a bill of exchange. It was never contemplated by the parties to this contract, to change the relation which subsisted between them. <em>Leab </em>is still to be viewed as the debtor of <em>Davis. </em>The contract of the former. does not rest upon the mere implication of law \u2014 it is express, and the Court can do nothing but enforce it. <em>Cutter vs. Powell, </em>6 <em>Term. Rep. </em>320. <em>Cates vs. Night, </em>3 <em>Term. Rep. </em>444. The responsibility of an endorser simply, is regulated by law; which to fix his liability, requires certain things to be done, and in the absence of any express contract, reference is supposed to be had to the implied one; but the party here has expressed his engagement, and the Court cannot introduce stipulations, and impose duties, which are not to be found in the contract itself, as written. <em>LeaVs </em>obligation was unqualified, that the money should be paid, and nothing but payment can be a compliance. He is to be regarded, either as a principal, or security \u2014 if as a principal the case is at an end \u2014 if as a surety, then forbearance of the principal will not discharge him, he being considered a guarantor, and bound to see the money paid. <em>Wright vs. Simpson, </em>6 <em>Ves. </em>734. <em>Bank of New-York vs. Livingston, </em>2 <em>Johns.

There is a guarantee in every endorsement, but it is a commercial guarantee, and is governed by commercial rules \u2014 it is by implication of law, and has no analogy to an express and positive engagement. <em>Campbell vs. Butler, </em>14 <em>Johns.

That the contract on which the suit was brought, was to be viewed as an accepted hill of exchange, payable on demand. To constitute a hill of exchange no form of words is necessary; it is sufficient, if there be a direction to the drawee to pay the money to the pay ee. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>53. 2. No time of payment being expressed, it was payable on demand. Ch<em>itty on Bills, </em>345. <em>Gracie vs. N. Y. Ins. Co. </em>8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>189. <em>Jackson vs. Ketchum, ib. </em>374. 3. Being payable on demand, it should have been presented in a reasonable time, and notice of non payment given. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>446. <em>Darbishire vs. Parker, </em>6 <em>East. Rep. 4, </em>9. 2 <em>Caine\u2019s, </em>369. <em>Cruger vs. Armstrong and Barnwall, </em>3 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>5. 4. Every endorsement contains in itself a guarantee by legal operation. In an ordinary case, the holder of a hill is bound to demand payment in a reasonable time, and give notice; the reason is, that the drawer may have an opportunity of getting his funds from the drawee : now does not the same reason apply to a case,, where a word which the law would imply is introduced by the parties ? <em>Hollrow vs. Wilkins, </em>1 <em>Barn. and Cres. </em>10. A guarantee is a conditional undertaking, and due diligence must <em>be </em>used to get the money from the parly primarily liable, else the guarantor is discharged. <em>Mantz </em>having accepted the bill, became the debtor of <em>Davis, </em>and <em>Leah </em>could take no steps to recover the .money: <em>Davis </em>held the bill so accepted lor more than 12 months. Notice must he given in the ease of an express guarantee, provided the drawee be solvent when the debt becomes due. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>265. <em>Nicholson vs. Gonthet, </em>2 <em>H.

A guarantee is not equivalent to an absolute promise to pay \u2014 it is conditional. <em>Mitchell vs. Dall, </em>2 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>175. 4 <em>Conn.

Rep. </em>424. 5. But if this is to be considered as an assignment of the award mentioned in the order, still it was necessary to use due diligence, and prove insolvency in the party by whom, according to the award, the <em>money </em>was to be paid. <em>Parrott vs. Gibson, </em>1 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>398. <em>Boyer vs. Turner\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>3 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>285. 2 <em>Wash.

The word guarantee in <em>the </em>assignment does not vary the case. 16 <em>Serg. and Rawle, </em>79. 6. If this is no bill of exchange, then it is a promise to pay the debt of another; and if so, the consideration, as well as the promise, must be in writing. <em>Elliott vs. Giese, </em>7 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>457. <em>Wain. vs. Walters, </em>5 <em>East. </em>10. <em>Keonard vs. Bredenburgh, </em>8 <em>Johns. </em>29. <em>Fell on Gua. </em>337. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>5.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-7\">Archer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYW\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The act of 1825, <em>ch. </em>117, had for its object the prevention of the reversal of judgments, unless upon the very questions submitted'to the tribunals below; and was intended to remedy the evils flowing from the raising of points above, and assigning the same for error, which were never agitated below, and which, if they had been, could easily have been remedied by amendment of the pleadings, or otherwise, but which remedy was entirely lost to the party after the cause was in the appellate Court. The Legislature intended to make this Court, so far as regarded the common law cases, strictly an appellate Court, deciding every cause upon the questions submitted below, and upon none other. If general prayers are allowable, it is obvious that the mischiefs intended to be x-emedied by the act will not at all be obviated, because upon a general prayer, it is impos\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>siblo to ascertain from the record, the point which was presented to the Court below, and upon which they decided, and we should be perpetually discussing and deciding points, which may or may not have been acted on in the subordinate Courts. The record here does not show the point upon which the Court acted; in such a case, we can neither <em>reverse </em>or <em>affirm, </em>but to effectuate the objects of the Legislature, we can dismiss the appeal, it being their intention, not that wo should in such a case, continue the cause on our docket without the power of action, hut that we should not entertain the appeal, unless the record showed the point appealed from. In this view of the act of Assembly, and of the prayer in this cause, it follows that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
