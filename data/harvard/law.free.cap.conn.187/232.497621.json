Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdA\">The plaintiff, M &amp; L Homes, Inc., sought a writ of mandamus ordering the defendant zoning and planning commission of the town of Montville to issue a certificate of approval for its subdivision plan and to cause such approval to be endorsed by the chairman or secretary of the defendant upon the town clerk\u2019s filing a copy of that plan. The plaintiff claimed that its subdivision plan of \u201cScarborough Estates, Section II\u201d submitted to the defendant on October 28, 1975, was approved pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 by virtue of the defendant\u2019s failure to \u201capprove, modify and approve, or disapprove [it] . . . within the period of time permitted under Section 8-26d.\u201d Under General Statutes \u00a7 8-26d (b): \u201cA decision on an application for subdivision approval, on which no hearing is held, shall be rendered within sixty-five days after receipt of such application.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied the request for the writ of mandamus and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The facts relevant to our disposition of this appeal are as follows: On October 28, 1975, the plaintiff filed an application for a subdivision with a map or maps called \u201cScarborough Estates, Section II\u201d (hereinafter, the original application) with the defendant commission concerning land, which it owned in Montville. It was formally received by the defendant on November 11, 1975. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-26d (c). On January 27,1976, seventy-seven days after the application\u2019s receipt, the plaintiff\u2019s engineer and agent, Frederick Hayes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requested and received from the defendant a sixty day extension for this application. On April 5,1976, the plaintiff revised its subdivision maps and on July 7,1976, the Montville inland wetlands commission approved the subdivision based on the revised maps, subject to certain special conditions and limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 14, 1976, the defendant held a meeting to consider final approval of the plaintiff\u2019s application, but withheld final approval because no representative of the plaintiff was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">On November 22, 1976, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, Hayes, sent a letter to the defendant requesting its review of preliminary plans for resubdivision of Section II and also requesting withdrawal of the plaintiff\u2019s Section II application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>to Hayes, dated December 15, 1976, the defendant replied and suggested that the revised proposal be submitted to the inland wetlands commission and, \u201cas soon thereafter as possible,\u201d arrange to have the new proposal placed on the defendant\u2019s agenda. On February 28, 1977, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, Hayes, wrote to the defendant requesting that the revised layout approved by the inland wetlands commission be placed on the defendant\u2019s agenda as the \u201cfinal subdivision known as \u2018Scarborough Estates, Section II.\u2019 \u201d At a meeting of the defendant held on April 12, 1977,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant commission informed the plaintiff\u2019s representative that its preliminary original application for Scarborough Estates, Section II had been withdrawn in November, 1976, as requested by Mr. Hayes and that the plaintiff now had to submit a new application as well as a copy of the decision of the inland wetlands commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">On April 14, 1977, the plaintiff submitted to the defendant another subdivision application (the new application) for approval of Scarborough Estates, Section II. Unlike the original application, this was marked \u201cfinal\u201d by the plaintiff. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>new application, on its face, differed from the original application in that the number of lots was reduced and the presence of a sanitary sewer line was noted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant commission considered the new application at a workshop meeting on April 26, 1977, with the plaintiff\u2019s agent and found that certain matters still needed clarification or further consideration. Shortly thereafter, by letter dated May 2, 1977, the defendant commission wrote to Frederick M. Hayes Associates, the plaintiff\u2019s representative, explaining the difficulties that remained with the application. In that letter the defendant commission also indicated that as soon as the plaintiff made the recommended changes, it would \u201cpromptly take action on the application for the proposed subdivision.\u201d Apparently the plaintiff failed to provide the defendant commission with the information it requested in its May 2,1977 letter because at its meeting of June 14, 1977, the defendant commission unanimously denied the plaintiff\u2019s new application \u201cin view of incomplete documentation, availability of which had been previously requested by letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">By letter dated June 2,1977, counsel for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant making a demand, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-26, for a certificate of approval for the subdivision, based on its original application for approval which had been filed with the defendant on October 28, 1975.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>commission, by a letter dated June 15, 1977, wrote back to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel acknowledging receipt of his letter of June 2, 1977, requesting a certificate of approval and pointed out, inter alia, that a cheek of the commission\u2019s files revealed \u201ca letter dated November 22, 1976 signed by Mr. Hayes requesting the withdrawal of the Section II application, and [that] a new application was submitted to us April 26, 1977.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Thereafter, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, by letter dated June 22, 1977, wrote to the defendant commission stating that he understood from communications with the Hayes office \u201cthat some progress is being made\u201d and that, as counsel, he was \u201ctaking no further action for the time being without, however, waiving any rights asserted in my letter of June 2, 1977.\u201d On January 10, 1978, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote the defendant commission again making a demand for a certificate of approval as he had in his letter of June 2, 1977, adding, however, that if \u201cI do not hear from you or your attorney within ten days from the date of this, I will institute a mandamus action.\u201d The plaintiff instituted its mandamus action in May, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The trial court denied the issuance of a mandamus and found that \u201cthe fact that the plaintiff withdrew its [original] application, submitted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>new application and engaged the defendant and the Inland Wetlands Commission in protracted and involved negotiations, indicates that the plaintiff had decided to forego its right to <em>de jure </em>approval.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) It also concluded that the evidence submitted was \u201csufficient to establish that the plaintiff is estopped from claiming approval by operation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred: (1) in finding that the original application was, in fact, withdrawn; (2) in implying that the delay of the plaintiff in asserting its claim to de jure approval was such as to contribute to the denial of the mandamus relief; and (3) in determining that the evidence established that the plaintiff was estopped from claiming approval of its subdivision by operation of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because we agree with the trial court\u2019s holding that the original application was withdrawn, we need address only that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The defendant concedes that the sixty-five day deadline imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 8-26d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>a decision by the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s original application expired on January 15, 1976. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-26, 8-26d. It also recognizes that its failure to approve, modify and approve, or disapprove the plaintiff\u2019s original application within that period constituted an approval of that application by operation of law under the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 8-26; <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>184 Conn. 450, 454, 440 A.2d 163 (1981); <em>Viking Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Town Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 243, 246, 435 A.2d 29 (1980). The statute specifically provides: \u201cThe failure of the commission to act [on the subdivision application] shall be considered an approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the commission <em>on demand.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 8-26. The plaintiff made no such demand until the June 2, 1977 letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to the defendant, shortly after which Ms counsel wrote the defendant, on June 22, 1977, to indicate that he was \u201ctaking no further action for the time being . . .\u201d as he understood from the Hayes office \u201cthat some progress is being made.\u201d Even later, on January 10,1978, the plaintiff again wrote demanding a certificate of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The plaintiff retained the engineering firm of Frederick M. Hayes Associates<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> from the time of its original application and it was authorized to act for it throughout its doings with the defendant as well as with the inland wetlands commission and the sewer authority. Hayes himself wrote the defendant on January 27, 1976, requesting a sixty day extension wMch was granted, indicating that more time was necessary for review of sewerage plans and approval from inland wetlands.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The subdivisions were revised. Inland wetlands finally approved the revised plans on July 14, 1976 after certain revisions and a public hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The trial court found as a fact that the plaintiff withdrew its original application. Such a determination on the evidence before it was not clearly erroneous as the plaintiff claims. See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>220-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. In light of the ongoing activity, including the Hayes letter of November 22,1976, and the plaintiff\u2019s filing of the new application with a request for a determination of it, it is evident that the plaintiff not only withdrew the original application, but did, as the trial court determined, decide to forego its right to de jure approval. In his letter of November 22, 1976, to the defendant commission, Hayes requested their \u201creview and comment of the enclosed preliminary plans,\u201d pointing out that while the plaintiff realized this was a preliminary proposal, it felt that the development of the land would be properly served both as to the wetlands and potential owners \u201cin a more economical and feasible manner than as shown by the previously developed plans.\u201d Hayes then stated that \u201c[t]he following items would have to be approved prior to your approval: 1.) Withdrawl [sic] of Section II application. 2.) Public hearing on revised subdivision of Section I &amp; II (resubdivision). . . .\u201d After further correspondence and contact between the plaintiff and defendant, the former submitted, on April 14, 1977, the new application, marked \u201cfinal,\u201d for approval of the subdivision known as Scarborough Estates, Section II. To \u201cwithdraw\u201d has been defined to mean \u201cto eliminate from consideration\u201d; Webster, Third New International Dictionary; the evidence amply justifies such a conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The plaintiff argues that, under General Statutes \u00a7 8-26, its right to the original subdivision became \u201cvested\u201d on January 15, 1976. See, e.g., <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 71, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). This claim merits little discussion. If we assume without deciding that it acquired such a \u201cvested right,\u201d its conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>referred to above demonstrates that it withdrew any claim to such a right. Vested rights are not immutable; see <em>In Re Marriage of Bouquet, </em>16 Cal. 3d 583, 592, 546 P.2d 1371 (1976); they may be relinquished.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The plaintiff argues that our construction of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-26 and 8-26d in <em>Viking Construction </em>and <em>Gervasi, </em>supra, demonstrates that it had a clear legal right to the issuance of the certificate of approval and thus to a mandamus. <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 541, 244 A.2d 391 (1968), upon which the plaintiff also relies, was decided before the passage of \u00a7 8-26d, but did decide that the sixty day period then in \u00a7 8-26 within which a commission \u201cshall approve, modify and approve, or disapprove any subdivision application . . .\u201d was mandatory. <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 544. In both <em>Viking Construction </em>and <em>Gervasi, </em>we held that the failure of the commission to act on a subdivision application within the statutory sixty-five day period worked an approval by operation of law and a mandamus was ordered. See <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 454; <em>Viking Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Town Planning Commission, </em>supra, 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Finn</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> Viking Construction </em>and <em>Gervasi </em>are all factually distinguishable from the case at hand. <em>Finn </em>was an appeal from the action of the defendant commission in adopting subdivision regulations alleging that its action was arbitrary and illegal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that the regulations were adopted in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-25 and 8-26 and that the time limitations prescribed in them were illegal. In that case we struck down, as violative of the General Statutes, the regulations insofar as they purported to extend beyond the permissible period of sixty days, the time between the submission of the application and the decision of the commission. <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 544. In <em>Viking Construction, </em>citing <em>Finn, </em>we said that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-26 and 8-26d \u201cestablish a definitive timetable during which planning and zoning commissions must act.\u201d <em>Viking Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Town Planning Commission, </em>supra, 246. We rejected the defendant commission\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cofficially received,\u201d which was contained in General Statutes \u00a7 8-26d (Rev. to 1977), gave the commission discretion to determine when \u201cit wishes to receive a subdivision application . . .\u201d and held that the statutory timetable, under the circumstances of the case, effected the approval of the subdivision plan by operation of law. Id., 247-48. In <em>Gervasi, </em>in finding error in the denial of a mandamus, we remanded with direction to render a judgment ordering the defendant commission to issue the requested certificate approving the application. <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 455. In that case we held, citing <em>Viking Construction </em>and the statute, that where the defendant commission failed to follow the court\u2019s order by timely reconsidering the application, it had been approved by operation of law long before the commission purported to disapprove it. <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 454\u201455.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">None of these three cases involved an application that was withdrawn and followed by a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>application \"with the latter actively pursued. None involved a demand for a certificate of approval under the statute on the original application after it was withdrawn, with a new one filed and denied. None involved any fact pattern related to the unique circumstances of this case that could serve as a rational predicate for applying the statutory timetables construed therein to require the result sought by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The plaintiff also claims that it never would have withdrawn the original application had it known about the approval by operation of law. In an explanation of his failure to make demand for the certificate earlier, DeMelis, the plaintiff\u2019s president,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> argues that, prior to the summer of 1977 when he consulted counsel, he had no knowledge that the original subdivision application had been approved by operation of law. In addition, the plaintiff also claims that Hayes, its engineer, \u201cnever even knew the plaintiff had an approved subdivision by operation of law . . . .\u201d This argument is not persuasive. The plaintiff was charged with knowledge of the law. See <em>Pallman </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>135 Conn. 593, 594, 67 A.2d 560 (1949); <em>Silberman </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>129 Conn. 273, 279, 27 A.2d 634 (1942); <em>Longwood Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Castle County, </em>349 A.2d 19, 21 (Del. Super. 1975) (construction company dealing with real property is deemed to have been aware of statutes relating to county\u2019s exercise of its police power concerning construction and service of sewers); <em>Gignilliat </em>v. <em>Borg, </em>131 Ga. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>182, 183, 205 S.E.2d 479 (1974) (a person is presumed to know what zoning regulations do or do not permit); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Cities Service Oil Co., </em>33 Md. App. 315, 323, 364 A.2d 603 (1976) (a corporate being, as well as a person, is chargeable with knowledge of the law); <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>109 N.H. 293, 295, 249 A.2d 679 (1969) (buyers of property are charged with knowledge of zoning regulations); 7 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev.) \u00a7 24.505. In pointing out that the plaintiff\u2019s claimed lack of knowledge does not avail it, we note that the long passage of time before it made demand for the certificate of approval is certainly not of controlling importance, but is one factor that may be considered. Cf. <em>Silberman </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>supra, 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy designed to enforce the performance of a plain positive duty, and, as such, the writ will properly issue only when the person against whom it is directed is under a clear legal obligation to perform the act compelled.\u201d <em>Gerrity </em>v. <em>Bisciglia, </em>178 Conn. 235, 238, 423 A.2d 871 (1979); see <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>177 Conn. 420, 426, 418 A.2d 66 (1979); <em>State ex rel. Levy </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>133 Conn. 334, 342, 51 A.2d 136 (1947); <em>State ex rel. Shelton </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>109 Conn. 249, 253, 146 A. 382 (1929); 52 Am. Jur. 2d, Mandamus \u00a7 31. \u201cMandamus neither gives nor defines rights which one does not already have. It commands the performance of a duty .... It is an expeditious remedy to protect a clear legal right.\u201d <em>Milford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 513, 518, 356 A.2d 109 (1975). The party who seeks the performance of the duty has the burden of establishing his clear legal right to its performance. <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>supra; <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>175 Conn. 586, 612, 402 A.2d 763 (1978); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Budds, </em>165 Conn. 507, 516, 338 A.2d 479 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 940, 94 S.

Ct. 2119, 48 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1976). \u201cAlthough the remedy by mandamus is at law, its allowance is governed by equitable principles . . . .\u201d <em>Pape </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>170 Conn. 588, 596, 368 A.2d 28 (1976) ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dern, </em>289 U.S. 352, 359, 53 S.
