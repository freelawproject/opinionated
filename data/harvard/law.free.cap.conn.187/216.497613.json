Diette, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>John M. Bailey, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Herbert G. Appleton, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-6\">Weight, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADo\">The defendant in this appeal was charged with the crimes of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95. The defendant was tried to a jury and was acquitted on the unlawful restraint charge at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case. After all the evidence had been presented, the court charged the jury that it might consider not only first degree sexual assault but also what the court termed the \u201clesser included offenses\u201d of sexual assault in the third and fourth degrees. The jury acquitted the defendant of the first degree charge but found him guilty of sexual assault in the third degree. The court thereupon denied the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The defendant\u2019s appeal is grounded on six claims of error. As one claim of error is dispositive of this appeal, we need not discuss the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The alleged assault arose out of a relationship which was evidently, at least in part, consensual. The events giving rise to the charges occurred at the end of an extended evening of drinking and dalliance, first at a Hartford \u201csingles\u201d bar and later at the victim\u2019s apartment, to which she had invited the defendant and another couple in the early morning hours. From the testimony of the other couple, the jury could have concluded that the victim was a willing participant in various sexual activities. These activities culminated in acts of intercourse giving rise to a claim that pene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tration had occurred as a result of the defendant\u2019s use of force. This claim was the basis for the state\u2019s charge of sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant now appeals his conviction of the offense of sexual assault in the third degree; General Statutes \u00a753a-72a; on the ground that that offense is not a lesser offense included within the crime of sexual assault in the first degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70; with which he was charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">If this assertion is correct, the defendant was convicted of an offense for which he was not on trial. In such a case the conviction would be improper, and the verdict could not stand. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 399 n.10, 429 A.2d 919 (1980), a defendant convicted of an offense of which, he was never given notice has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">If sexual assault in the third degree is a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree, the defendant has had notice of the lesser charge because the statement of the principal charge constitutes notice as to all offenses necessarily included therein. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>182 Conn. 585, 591, 438 A.2d 792 (1981), which reads as follows: \u201cThe constitutional right to notice is satisfied as to lesser included offenses because, \u2018where one or more offenses are lesser than and included within the one charged, notice of the one charged constitutes notice of any lesser included offenses. See <em>Paterno </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>334 U.S. 314, 320-21, 68 S. Ct. 1044, 92 L. Ed. 1409 (1948).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Connecticut\u2019s general test for lesser included offenses was recently set forth in complete form in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), and was clarified in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Because <em>Whistnant </em>was decided after the decision under review was rendered, we will test the propriety of the instruction against the earlier rules which are reflected in the <em>Whistnant </em>conditions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The leading case on lesser included offenses prior to <em>Whistnant </em>was <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 301 A.2d 547 (1972). In <em>Brown </em>the court focussed on the information as the starting point for an inquiry into possible lesser included offenses. The threshold question was \u201cwhether it is <em>possible </em>to commit the greater offense, <em>in the manner described in the information </em>or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In the present ease, the information merely charged \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in violation of General Statutes $ 53a~70. Section 53a-65<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the definitions applicable to sexual offenses. Under subsection (2) of that statute, \u201c\u2018[s]exual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete . . . intercourse . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018Sexual contact,\u2019 \u201d the offense of which sexual assault in the third degree consists, is defined in subsection (3) as \u201cany contact with the intimate parts of a person not married to the actor for the purpose of sexual gratification of the actor.\u201d Subsection (8), in turn, defines \u2018\u201c[i]ntimate parts\u2019\u201d as \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d Under subsection (8), a victim\u2019s mouth is not an intimate part. Thus, it is clearly possible to compel a victim to engage in fellatio, a form of intercourse under \u00a7 53a-70, without compelling the victim to submit to a nonconsensual touching of her intimate parts, the definition of sexual contact under ^ 53a-72a. Accordingly, under the information as worded in this case, a violation of \u00a7 53a-72a is not included within the violation of \u00a7 53a-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The <em>Brown </em>court (pp. 60-62) rejected an earlier approach, appropriate to short form informations, in which the court was free to examine the evidence for any crimes suggested therein. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mele, </em>140 Conn. 398, 100 A.2d 570 (1953). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 96-97, 384 A.2d 326 (1977), stated the rule that a court is to \u201clook only to the information and \"bill of particulars\u2014as opposed to the evidence presented at trial\u2014to determine what constitutes a lesser included offense of the offense charged.\u201d In the present case the trial court evidently adopted the <em>Mele </em>approach, rather than the more restrictive examination of the information required by <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">If the examination of the information, and bill of particulars, if any, revealed that a lesser offense could be included in the offense charged, the court had next to consider whether the evidence would support a conviction of that lesser offense. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 61 n.2, the evidence test is phrased as requiring a rational basis for an acquittal on the charge and a conviction on the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Applied to the present case, the rule would permit a lesser included instruction only if the evidence would support a conclusion that the victim had consented to intercourse but had objected to other sexual contact. The record before this court suggests no rational basis for such a conclusion, confirming that the lesser included instruction was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We therefore conclude that the defendant was deprived of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 399 n.10. It is clear, however, that there can be no review of the judgment of acquittal on the first degree charge even though errors may underlie that judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>supra, 594. Nor can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>there be a new trial on the third degree offense under the present information whieh does not charge that offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and the ease is remanded with direction to render judgment that the defendant is not guilty of sexual assault in the first degree and ordering that he be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u201c[General Statutes] See. 53a-70. sexual assault in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when sueh person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against sueh other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to sueh person or a third person.\u201d Of. \u201c[General Statutes] See. 53a-72a. sexual assault in the third degree: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when sueh person (1) compels another person to submit to sexual contact (A) by the use of force against sueh other person or a third person, or (B) by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person, which reasonably causes sueh person to fear physical injury to sueh person or a third person, or (2) engages in sexual intercourse with another person whom sueh person knows to be related to sueh person within any of the degrees of kindred specified in section 46b-21.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-11\"> The Substituted Information in this case reads as follows: \u201cGEORGE D.

Ct. 2912, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1054 (1977) ; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 168-69, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977). However, before a double jeopardy barrier arises, the two offenses must not only arise out of the same aet or transaction but must be substantially the same. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>178 Conn. 422, 423 A.2d 114 (1979). The following test for the latter requirement was approved by the <em>Goldson </em>court as set out in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 <em>L. </em>Ed. 306 (1932): \u201cThe applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Applying the <em>Bloekhwrger </em>test to this case, it is possible to commit the greater offense as charged without committing the lesser; it is also possible to satisfy the forcible sexual contact requirement for third degree sexual assault without satisfying the penetration requirement for the higher offense. Because the offenses are not substantially the same for double jeopardy purposes, there would be no constitutional impediment to a new trial on sexual assault in the third degree, an offense for whieh the defendant has never been charged and whieh was not included in the offense for which he was tried.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
