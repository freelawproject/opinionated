In the course of its business as a supplier and installer of household equipment, the plaintiff, a Connecticut corporation, constructed and delivered kitchen cabinets to contractors, and installed stairs. The plaintiff filed timely sales tax returns as a retailer for the period June 30, 1970, through March 31, 1973. In computing its sales tax liability, the plaintiff deducted amounts representing the price of delivery and \u201cof installing certain materials such as stairs.\u201d Its computed sales tax of $19,194 equals the liability the plaintiff would have incurred on the purchase of materials if it were a construction contractor, who is treated as a consumer for purposes of computing sales tax, rather than a retailer of tangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Following an audit by the defendant, the defendant assessed a sales tax deficiency of $27,028.90; General Statutes \u00a7 12-415; plus a statutory penalty and interest for the applicable tax quarters. After a hearing requested by the plaintiff pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 12-418, a deputy tax commissioner upheld the tax, interest and penalty assessments. Although the commissioner made no finding with respect to the stairs, he did find that the plaintiff was a retailer of kitchen cabinets because it did not attach or install them after delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court from the defendant\u2019s decision; General Statutes \u00a7 12-422; the plaintiff claimed that although it filed sales tax returns as a retailer, it was a contractor and hence liable as a consumer to reimburse its retailers for the sales tax on the cost of materials used in the construction of kitchen cabinets and in the fabrication of stairs. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff was a retailer of tangible personal property and was liable for collecting and remitting to the defendant sales tax on the purchase price, which includes the cost of delivery and installation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On the basis of the stipulated facts that the plaintiff filed sales tax returns as a retailer and remitted to the defendant funds collected from its customers, the trial court found that the plaintiff was a retailer of tangible personal property. Accordingly, the trial court held that the plaintiff had not sustained its burden of proving that the sales tax deficiency assessment was erroneous and hence dismissed its appeal in part. In addition, the trial court set aside the 10 percent statutory penalty assessed under General Statutes \u00a712-415 (4), reasoning that the plaintiff did not negligently or intentionally disregard its sales tax liability, but declined to set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>aside the statutory interest assessed under General Statutes \u00a712-415 (2). In its appeal the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in finding that the plaintiff was a retailer and in declining to set aside the interest imposed by the defendant. In its cross appeal the defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s setting aside of the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201cA sales tax is imposed on all retailers making sales in Connecticut by General Statutes \u00a712-408 (1). Reimbursement for the tax thereby imposed, furthermore, \u2018shall be collected by the retailer from the consumer and such tax reimbursement, termed \u201ctax\u201d in this and the following subsections, shall be paid by the consumer to the retailer . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a712-408 (2). While the statute does not define the term \u2018consumer,\u2019 it is generally held that a general contractor who purchases material from a retailer for use in the construction of a building for his customer is the \u2018consumer\u2019 of those materials within the meaning of that term as it appears in statutes similar to \u00a712-408 imposing a sales tax.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 599, 362 A.2d 847 (1975); see General Statutes \u00a7 12-408; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-18;<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Sullivan </em>v. <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>395 U.S. 169, 171, 89 S. Ct. 1648, 23 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1969); see generally <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 128-29, 355 A.2d 236 (1974). A consumer of \u201c \u2018tangible personal property purchased from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>retailer\u2019 and used in the construction of a building pursuant to a construction contract is ordinarily the general contractor.\u201d <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 601. Although the plaintiff does not dispute that it collected reimbursements from its customers for the sales tax it paid as a retailer, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in finding that it was not a consumer, but a retailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The burden of proving an error in a deficiency assessment is on the plaintiff. <em>Modugno </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>174 Conn. 419, 421, 389 A.2d 745 (1978); <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 599. In holding that the plaintiff had failed to sustain its burden, the trial court was not bound to limit its reasoning to that utilized by the tax commissioner, as the plaintiff claims. The court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff is a retailer is reasonably supported by the stipulated facts that the plaintiff completed and delivered kitchen cabinets, supplied and installed stairs, and held itself out as a retailer of household equipment. Although the plaintiff\u2019s claim that it installed stairs as a contractor may be meritorious, depending upon the extent of fabrication conducted at the construction site; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-18 (c); the record is insufficient for us fully to address the merits of this claim. Therefore, the finding is not clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; cf. <em>Connecticut Theater Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>179 Conn. 672, 675-76, 427 A.2d 863 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the court erred in not setting aside the interest assessment raises the issue of the court\u2019s equitable powers in an administrative appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 12-422. That statute provides in part that in reviewing a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>of the tax commissioner, the \u201ccourt may grant such relief as may be equitable . . . .\u201d In the absence of a trial court\u2019s attempt to exercise administrative powers; see <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 353-54, 64 A.2d 330 (1949); the trial court may grant relief consistent with its review of a deficiency assessment upheld by the Commissioner. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-421, 12-422; see <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>31 Conn. Sup. 373, 375, 333 A.2d 63 (1974); <em>Bowne </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 309, 316, 313 A.2d 426 (1973). The tax commissioner may include penalty and interest charges as part of deficiency assessments. Interest may be assessed from the date when the tax should have been paid to the date of payment. General Statutes \u00a7 12-415 (2). A 10 percent penalty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be assessed when the commissioner determines that a sales tax deficiency is the result of negligent or intentional disregard of the tax law. General Statutes \u00a712-415 (4). The defendant does not dispute that the trial court had jurisdiction to set aside the penalty assessed, but contends that the court has no similar power with respect to an assessment of interest because the defendant or the tax review committee does not have the express power to review an assessment of interest as it does with respect to a penalty. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-3a, 12-421. In its claim of error, the plaintiff contends not only that the trial court does have jurisdiction to set aside an assessment of interest, but also that it erred in not exercising that power in this case. We agree with the plaintiff that it was within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>trial court\u2019s province to consider whether to set aside the interest imposed as part of its review of the deficiency assessment; see <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 377; <em>Bowne </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 316; but we also consider the resolution of that issue to be within the court\u2019s sound discretion. The plaintiff has not persuaded us that the court\u2019s exercise of discretion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In its cross appeal from the trial court\u2019s setting aside of the statutory penalty assessed by the defendant, the defendant claims that the court erred by focusing upon the honesty and innocence of the plaintiff, rather than upon its negligence or intentional disregard of sales tax law. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court expressly found that the plaintiff did not negligently or intentionally disregard the law and hence is not subject to the statutory 10 percent penalty. In support of this finding the court explained that the defendant never questioned the plaintiff\u2019s honesty or innocence and that the plaintiff relied on his accountant for sales tax advice. The defendant contends that the plaintiff\u2019s veracity and reliance upon its accountant were improper considerations for determining a penalty based upon intentional disregard of the law with respect to deductions for transportation and delivery charges. We disagree. Reasonable reliance upon an accountant\u2019s advice may be considered as a factor, although not necessarily a conclusive one, when determining whether the plaintiff disregarded the law either negligently or intentionally. <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 374-76. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s veracity is clearly relevant to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>a penalty is appropriate. <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 374. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> Unless itemized as separate charges, delivery and installation are deemed included in the purchase price. General Statutes <em>\u00a7 </em>12-407 (8) and (9). Bor purposes of this appeal, the plaintiff has abandoned its claim that the delivery and installation charges should be excluded from the sales tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\"><em> </em>\"[Regs., Conn. State Agencies] See. 12-426-18. contractors AND SUBCONTRACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">(a) definitions. The term 'contractor,\u2019 as used herein, includes both contractors and subcontractors and, among others, building, electrical, plumbing, heating, painting, decorating, paper hanging, air conditioning, ventilating, insulating, sheet metal, steel, masonry, carpentry, plastering, cement, road, bridge, landscape and roofing contractors or subcontractors. The term 'construction contract,\u2019 as used herein, means a contract for the repair, alteration, improvement, remodeling or construction of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"AAcI\">(b) TAXABILITY OF SALES TO OR BY CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS. A contractor shall pay the tax as a consumer on the purchase or lease of all materials, supplies or equipment used by him in ful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>filling either a lump sum contract, a cost-plus contract, a time and material contract with an upset or guaranteed price which may not be exceeded, or any other kind of construction contract except:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">(1) Where the contractor contracts to sell materials or supplies at an agreed price and to render service in connection therewith, either for an additional agreed price or on the basis of time consumed or</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">(2) Where such contractor is engaged as a permittee in the business of selling such materials or supplies at retail. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">A contractor may, in certain instances, himself fabricate part or all of the articles which he uses in construction work. For example, a sheet metal contractor may partly or wholly manufacture roofing, cornices, gutter pipe, furnace pipe, furnaces, ventilation or air conditioning duets or other such items from sheet metal which he purchases, and use these articles, pursuant to a contract for the construction or improvement of real property. In this instance, the sale of the sheet metal to such contractor constitutes a sale at retail within the meaning of the law and he pays the tax as a consumer when ho buys the same. This is so whether the articles so fabricated are used in the alteration, repair or reconstruction of an old building or are used in new construction work.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">(c) PERSONS WHO SELL COMPLETE UNITS OP STANDARD EQUIPMENT at retail and install same. This section is not applicable to sales contracts whereby a person, whether he is a contractor, subcontractor or otherwise, acts as a retailer selling tangible personal property in the same manner as other retailers and is required to install a complete unit of standard equipment, requiring no further fabrication but simply installation, assembling, applying or connecting services. In such instances, the contract will not be regarded as one for improving, altering or repairing real property. For example, the retailer of an awning or blind agrees not only to sell it but to hang it; an electrical shop sells electrical fixtures and agrees to install them; a retailer sells an electric washing machine and contracts to install the same; a dealer sells cabinets and agrees to install them. A person performing such contracts is primarily a retailer of tangible personal property and should segregate the full retail selling price of sueh property from the charge for installation, as the tax applies only to the retail price of the property. . . See General Statutes \u00a7 12-426 (1); see generally <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 603-604, 362 A.2d 847 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> The penalty for negligent or intentional disregard of the tax law is the greater of 10 percent of the deficiency or $50. When the taxpayer has fraudulently or intentionally evaded the tax, the commissioner may assess a 25 percent penalty. General Statutes <em>\u00a7 </em>12-415 (5). Tax evasion is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
