General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-319 through 38-351. On behalf of each of its clients the plaintiff instituted and settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>personal injuries claims arising out of automobile accidents against third parties. In each ease, the settlement amount exceeded the basic reparations benefits paid by the defendant, after deducting expenses and the plaintiff\u2019s legal fee, which fee amounted to one-third of the gross settlement. After disbursing the settlement proceeds to each client and placing in escrow approximately $16,000, the amount of the basic reparations benefits paid by the defendant for all six clients, the plaintiff, in 1979, sought a judgment declaring whether the defendant or the plaintiff\u2019s clients were entitled to the funds in escrow. The trial court reserved three questions for review of this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The first question reserved is: \u201cDoes Section 38-325 of the Connecticut General Statutes entitle the Defendant to full reimbursement of the entire amount of the basic reparations benefits paid to insureds who settled their claims against third parties?\u201d Between January 1, 1973, when the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act became effective; Public Acts 1972, No. 72-273;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and October 1, 1980, the period relevant to the present appeal, General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 (b) provided: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201cWhenever a person who receives basic reparations benefits for an injury recovers damages from the owner, registrant, operator or occupant of a private passenger motor vehicle with respect to which security has been provided under this chapter or from a person or organization legally responsible for his acts or omissions, the insurer is entitled to reimbursement from the claimant to the extent that said basic reparations benefits have been paid and the insurer shall have a lien on the claimant\u2019s recovery to such extent.\u201d One of the amendments to \u00a7 38-325 (b) which became effective October 1,1980, was the insertion after \u201c[wjhenever a person who receives basic reparations benefits for an injury recovers damages,\u201d of the phrase \u201ceither by judgment or settlement.\u201d Public Acts 1980, No. 80-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u201cBasic reparations benefits are provided, without regard to fault, to the basic reparations insured for personal injuries and economic loss suffered as a result of automobile accidents.\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 270-71, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976) ; see General Statutes \u00a7 38-319 (k). Reimbursement to the insurer of reparations benefits paid when the insured recovers damages for the same injuries comports with the general purpose of the no-fault legislation, which is to minimize the cost of mandatory insurance coverage by minimizing the amount of benefits paid by the insurer. See <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>supra, 288-90 <em>; Bobeck </em>v. <em>Public Service Mutual Ins. Co., </em>38 Conn. Sup. 318, 321, 445 A.2d 602 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The trial courts have been divided on whether \u201crecovers damages\u201d includes amounts received by settlement prior to that amendment in 1980. The Appellate Session of the Superior Court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>has consistently held that recoveries by settlement are included, reasoning that the language added by amendment sought to clarify, rather than alter, the original legislative intent in enacting the provision and that the common meaning of \u201crecovers damages\u201d includes settlement proceeds. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sagnella, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 806, 807-808, 437 A.2d 150 (1981) ; <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 794, 795, 437 A.2d 143 (1981) <em>; Amica Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 618, 619-20, 430 A.2d 1317 (1981) <em>; Unigard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tremont, 37 </em>Conn. Sup. 596, 598, 430 A.2d 30 (1981) ; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 664, 666, 405 A.2d 675 (1978). Our review of the statutory language and of its legislative history <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> compels us to agree with the Appellate Session view.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, our answer to the first question is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The second question reserved is: \u201cDoes Section 38-325 of the Connecticut General Statutes entitle the Defendant to reimbursement for the amount of the basic reparations benefits paid to insureds who settled their claims against third parties reduced by a share of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the same proportion that the benefits paid bear to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>total settlement amount?\u201d Another amendment of General Statutes \u00a738-325 (b), provided by Public Acts 1980, No. 80-131, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Payment of Fees for Collection of Basic Reparations Benefits,\u201d added to the reimbursement provisions a provision that required \u201can amount which represents the insurer\u2019s contribution toward attorney\u2019s fees for the collection of basic reparations benefits\u201d to be deducted from the reimbursement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The plaintiff claims that if this court construes \u201crecovers damages\u201d to include settlement proceeds, then we must also give retroactive effect to the new provisions regarding proportionate deduction for attorneys\u2019 fees afforded by the 1980 amendment. We do not agree and adopt the Appellate Session reasoning that distinguishes between language clarifying an earlier provision and language augmenting an earlier statute. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sagnella, </em>supra, 808 <em>; Amica Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 620. Prior to October 1, 1980, General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 (b) contained no provision for deducting attorneys\u2019 fees from the amount reimbursed to the insurer, and the plaintiff has failed to persuade us that the legislature intended the amendment to be given retroactive effect. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (u) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and 55-3 ; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>177 Conn. 327, 331, 416 A.2d 1201 (1979). Therefore, onr answer to the second question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Finally, the third question reserved is: \u201cAre the Plaintiff\u2019s clients entitled to retain the full amount of the monies held in escrow by the Plaintiff?\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s claim that attorneys\u2019 fees should be deducted from the amount reimbursed on the equitable ground of quantum meruit is without basis because the defendant by sending notice of the lien to the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was not impliedly contracting for the services of the plaintiff but rather was merely advising the plaintiff of its right to reimbursement. See <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Varillo, </em>Appellate Session of the Superior Court, Docket No. A.S. 653, April 27, 1979. The plaintiff\u2019s additional claim based on unjust enrichment is inapplicable in the context of a statutory lien. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 664, 667, 405 A.2d 675 (1978). The plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the trust fund doctrine is inapposite because the essential elements of a trust, express or implied, are not present in this case. See <em>Zack </em>v. <em>Guzauskas, </em>171 Conn. 98, 103, 368 A.2d 193 (1976) <em>; Marzahl </em>v. <em>Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>170 Conn. 62, 64, 364 A.2d 173 (1976) ; <em>Worobey </em>v. <em>Sibieth, </em>136 Conn. 352, 355-56, 71 A.2d 80 (1949). With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s final claim, that the statute as construed here violates the equal protection clause, we adopt the Appellate Session reasoning which rejects that claim in <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 723, 436 A.2d 308 (1981). Accordingly, our answers to the first two questions compel a negative response to the third question.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em> </em>We find that there are actual bona fide and significant questions of law in dispute between the parties; that the action is ready for final judgment; that the resolution of these questions involves public interest; and that their present resolution would be in the interest of judicial economy. Accordingly, we will consider the questions reserved. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-235; Practice Book <em>\u00a7\u00a7 </em>390, 3133 ; <em>Cavalli </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>174 Conn. 212, 215, 384 A.2d 374 (1978) ; <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 271, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S.
