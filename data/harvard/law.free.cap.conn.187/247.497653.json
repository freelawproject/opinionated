Ribicoff: and David Kotkin, minority shareholders of Hartford CATY, Inc. (HCTY) and Telesystems of Connecticut, Inc. (TOC). These appeals are taken from the trial court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of their appeals to the Superior Court from: (1) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>decision of the division of public utility control (DPUC); and (2) the denial by the DPUC of petitioners\u2019 motion to rehear and reconsider that decision. In its decision the DPUC determined The Times Mirror Company to be an \u201cunsuitable owner\u201d of a controlling interest, through its interest in Community Properties, Inc. (CPI), in HCTY and TOC in light of its acquisition of The Hartford Courant, and it ordered the franchises of HCTY and TOC to be revoked on April 1, 1981 unless Times Mirror eliminated the cross ownership by that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The trial court granted the DPUC\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeals of the petitioners on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction because the petitioners are not aggrieved. This court granted the petitioners\u2019 certification for appeal from the decision of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The trial court filed a detailed memorandum of decision. <em>Ribicoff </em>v. <em>Division of Public Utility Control, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 24, 445 A.2d 325 (1980). After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs of the parties and their arguments, we conclude that there is no error in the judgment from which the appeals were taken and that the memorandum of decision filed by the trial court adequately and properly disposes of the contentions of the parties before us. That decision may be referred to for a detailed discussion of the facts and the applicable law. It would serve no useful purpose to repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em> </em>Times Mirror did not do so; but, with. CPI, HCTV, and TOC, it sought review of the decision in Superior Court. The decision of the DPUC has been stayed by the trial court until one year after final judicial review of the decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
