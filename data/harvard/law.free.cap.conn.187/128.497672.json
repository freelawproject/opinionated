The plaintiff, Community Progress, Inc., filed a certificate of dissolution with the Secretary of the State of Connecticut on March 1,1977 and three days later, on March 4, filed a petition, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-491,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for judicial determination of all outstanding claims and demands against it. After due notice and the filing of various claims, the trial court held a hearing and made a determination about the plaintiff\u2019s assets and the claimants\u2019 respective rights thereto. The claimants who have appealed are two attachment creditors and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The facts found by the trial court in its memorandum of decision are undisputed. The debtor\u2019s sole assets at the time of its dissolution consisted of funds totaling $171,144.80 on deposit in three banks, of which $50,000 in the Orange National Bank were subject to attachment. The United States filed claims totaling $3,178,045, consisting of $799,055 owed to the Community Services Administration and $2,378,990 owed to the Department of Labor. The State of Connecticut filed claims of $1,041,732.20, arising out of moneys due on various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>state grants-in-aid contracts. Sonford Kessler and Durrick O. K. Jones had attachment liens totaling $50,000; the Jones lien had matured into a judgment lien, hut neither lien had been perfected through an execution. In addition, claims were filed by two attorneys. Attorney David A. Keif had a claim for $1874.50 for fees and expenses directly attributable to the dissolution proceedings themselves. Attorney Stephen E. Ronai was awarded $5000 on a claim of $6375 for services rendered to preserve the assets of the plaintiff in connection with the lawsuits that had resulted in the attachment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The trial court, concluding that there was no evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s insolvency, relied solely upon the priority of claims established by \u00a7 33-494<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>and ordered distribution as follows: Under \u00a7 33-494 (1), as a first priority, the claims of Attorney Reif and Attorney Ronai; under ^ 33-494 (3), the claims of the United States and the State of Connecticut \u201cupon a parity basis\u201d; and under \u00a7 33-494 (5), all other claims. The court specifically found that because of the absence of a timely execution, the attached funds on deposit with the Orange National Bank had become part of the assets available for distribution to priority creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On this appeal, the United States challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion about the applicable statutes and the creditors Jones and Ressler contest the court\u2019s conclusion about the status of their respective judgment and attachment liens. Since resolution of the claims of the United States necessarily has implications for the status of liens created under state law, we will address first the appeal of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Federal law provides for the claims of the federal government a virtually absolute priority in the assets of an insolvent debtor in cases in which an act of bankruptcy has been committed. The gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>eming statute, variously denominated \u00a7 3466 of the Revised Statutes (1875) or 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 191,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has been in force since 1797 and is founded upon a policy of protecting the federal revenues. The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly stated that \u201cthe statute must be given a liberal construction consonant with the public policy underlying it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Key, </em>397 U.S. 322, 324, 90 S. Ct. 1049, 25 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1970); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. 77, 81-82, 96 S. Ct. 310, 46 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1975); <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>269 U.S. 483, 487, 46 S. Ct. 176, 70 L. Ed. 368 (1926). It is clear that federal rather than state law determines the proper characterization of a state or private lien that may be competitive with the claims of the United States; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>340 U.S. 47, 51, 71 S. Ct. 111, 95 L. Ed. 53 (1950); <em>Illinois ex rel. Gordon </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>329 U.S. 362, 374-75, 67 S. Ct. 340, 91 L. Ed. 348 (1946); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>261 U.S. 253, 260, 43 S. Ct. 295, 67 L. Ed. 638 (1923); and doubtful, under federal law, whether any such competing lien is ever sufficiently perfected and choate to overcome the priority given to the United States. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vermont, </em>377 U.S. 351, 358 n.8, 84 S. Ct. 1267, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>12 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1964); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert Associates, Inc., </em>345 U.S. 361, 365, 73 S. Ct. 701, 97 L. Ed. 1071 (1953); <em>Illinois ex rel. Gordon </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra, 370; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>314 U.S. 480, 486, 62 S. Ct. 350, 86 L. Ed. 356 (1941); see generally Plumb, \u201cThe Federal Priority in Insolvency: Proposals for Reform,\u201d 70 Mich. L. Rev. 3 (1971); Kennedy, \u201cThe Relative Priority of the Federal Government: The Pernicious Career of the Inchoate and General Lien,\u201d 63 Yale L.J. 905 (1954); 2 G. Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property (1965) \u00a7 40.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">This court recognized, in <em>Hofmann </em>v. <em>United Welding &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>140 Conn. 597, 600, 102 A.2d 878 (1954), that \u201c\u00a73466 is the supreme law of the land and the courts of this state are bound by and must apply it, whenever it is pertinent.\u201d \"We held (p. 604), furthermore, that the fact of the debtor\u2019s insolvency, which triggers the applicability of \u00a7 3466, may be adjudicated \u201cin the very proceeding in which priority is being sought. It was the duty of the court, in passing upon the matter of priority, to determine whether facts existed which brought the claim of the United States within the section in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In order for its \u00a7 3466 claim to priority to be established under the circumstances of this case, the United States must demonstrate (1) the insolvency of the debtor, (2) debts due to the United States and (3) either a voluntary assignment of the debtor\u2019s property or the commission of an act of bankruptcy. The trial court found that the plaintiff-debtor had not challenged the correctness of the amounts claimed to be owed to the United States. The court concluded, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>statute was inapplicable because the plaintiff\u2019s insolvency had not been demonstrated. It noted that the plaintiff had neither been adjudicated a bankrupt nor alleged its insolvency in its petitions for dissolution and for winding up.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It found, furthermore, that no evidence \u201cwas ever introduced during any part of the proceedings by any party that [the plaintiff] was insolvent under the Federal Bankruptcy Act or was unable to pay its maturing debts.\u201d We disagree that the record at trial was insufficient to establish the plaintiff\u2019s insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The test of whether a person is insolvent under the Bankruptcy Act is that \u201cthe aggregate of his property . . . shall not at a fair valuation be sufficient in amount to pay his debts.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a71 (19) (1940) (52 Stat. 840 [1938]). Measured by that test, the plaintiff\u2019s insolvency is apparent. Its total assets of $171,144.80 are insufficient to pay the $3,178,045 owed to the United States, and there are other outstanding creditors\u2019 claims as well. <em>Hofmann </em>established that insolvency may be determined without a formal adjudication of bankruptcy. The only reason why <em>Hofmann </em>required a remand to the trial court for a further determination of insolvency was that there the discrepancy between the debtor\u2019s assets and his debts only became apparent six years subsequent to the institution of receivership proceedings. A remand was therefore essential to determine whether, despite an initially uncontested allegation of solvency at the institution of the receivership, the debtor was already insolvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>at that earlier time. In the case before us, the insufficiency of the plaintiffs assets to pay its debts incontrovertibly arose at the very time that wind-up proceedings under General Statutes \u00a7 33-494 were begun. The evidence before the trial court in the form of claims both timely filed and uncontested in amount establishes the plaintiffs insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s insolvency is only one element of what the United States must prove to establish its \u00a7 3466 priority. The attaching creditors in their appeal raise the question whether the claims owed to the United States are \u201cdebts\u201d within the meaning of the federal statute. These creditors argue that the federal claims for reimbursement, based upon unauthorized expenditures which were disallowed after audit, do not sufficiently allege an obligation to repay upon the part of the plaintiff. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The claim of the federal government arose out of government contracts with the plaintiff. Such contracts automatically incorporate by reference applicable federal statutes and regulations. <em>G. L. Christian &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>160 Ct. Cl. 1, 66-67, 312 F.2d 418, reh. denied, 160 Ct. Cl. 58, 320 F.2d 345, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 954, 84 S. Ct. 444, 11 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1963), reh. denied, 376 U.S. 929, 84 S. Ct. 657,11 L. Ed. 2d 627, motion for leave to file second petition for rehearing denied, 377 U.S. 1010, 84 S. Ct. 1906, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1059 (1964); and see <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>256 U.S. 575, 41 S. Ct. 563, 65 L. Ed. 1099 (1921); <em>The Floyd Acceptances, </em>74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 666, 19 L. Ed. 169 (1868). Federal legislation expressly permits governmental recovery of grant funds improperly spent. See 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>TJ.S.C. \u00a72835 (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Read in conjunction with this statute, the plaintiff\u2019s contractual duties included an obligation to repay unauthorized expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Nothing else about these obligations would exclude them from qualifying as \u201cdebts\u201d within \u00a7 3466. That term has consistently been broadly defined in the federal cases. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. 77, 85, 96 S. Ct. 310, 46 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1975); <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>269 U.S. 483, 487, 46 S. Ct. 176, 70 L. Ed. 368 (1926); Plumb, supra, 10-12. It includes obligations arising out of government contracts even when the amounts due have not been finally liquidated before initiation of dissolution proceedings; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>supra, 85; and includes repayment obligations arising out of federal programs for grants and loans. See, e.g., <em>Small Business Administration </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>364 U.S. 446, 451-52, 81 S. Ct. 191, 5 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1960); <em>United States Department of Agriculture </em>v. <em>Remund, </em>330 U.S. 539, 544-45, 67 S. Ct. 891, 91 L. Ed. 1082 (1947). Considering the consistent refusal of the Supreme Court of the United States to limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>reach of \u00a7 3466, we mnst conclude that the claims of the United States in the present proceedings qualify as \u201cdebts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The third and final element that the United States must establish to invoke \u00a7 3466 is that the debtor has either made a voluntary assignment of his property or committed an act of bankruptcy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State of Connecticut maintains that the proceedings under General Statutes \u00a7 33-491 do not constitute an assignment or an act of bankruptcy unless and until the court appoints a receiver or a trustee. Concededly no such appointment was ever sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>or made in this case. The United States argues that the powers conferred by the state statute upon the Superior Court are so pervasive that the filing of a petition pursuant to \u00a7 33-491 constitutes both the voluntary appointment of a trustee and an assignment for the benefit of creditors. We are persuaded that, with respect to \u00a7 3466, federal law requires us to accept the position of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Both the state and the United States rely upon <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>supra. In that case, an insolvent bank had, by resolution, given full control of its affairs to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>state superintendent of banks, who took possession and control of the bank\u2019s property and business for the purpose of liquidation. The court began by noting (p. 487) that \u00a7 3466 \u201cis to be liberally construed.\u201d It then held (p. 489) that a debtor could be sufficiently divested of its property, under \u00a7 3466, without having title pass to another. Looking to the substance of the powers conferred upon the bank\u2019s transferee, the court found (p. 491) that the transferee\u2019s duties \u201crequired him to perform the functions of an assignee, receiver or trustee for the liquidation of the debts of an insolvent.... [The transferee] had a power that for present purposes had the same effect as a title, and that is enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Applying the <em>Bramwell </em>test, which looks to substance rather than to form, we must determine whether the powers conferred upon the Superior Court by the plaintiff\u2019s petition pursuant to \u00a7 33-491 sufficiently divest the plaintiff of possession and control of the totality of its assets to satisfy the third requirement of \u00a73466. \u201c[C]ontrol over the assets ... is decisive,\u201d the Supreme Court held in <em>King </em>v. <em>United States, </em>379 U.S. 329, 337, 85 S. Ct. 427, 13 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1964). In this case, the plaintiff in its petition, following the wording of the statute, asked the court to assume general jurisdiction and supervision over the liquidation of the corporation and to order and adjudge all claims and demands against the corporation. Even though there was no formal conveyance to the court, the plaintiff prayed the court to enter orders for the distribution of all of its property. In effect, the court was empowered by the petition to act as an assignee, receiver or trustee \u201cand that is enough.\u201d Whether viewed as an assignment or as a receiver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ship, the plaintiff\u2019s institution of \u00a7 33-491 proceedings while insolvent permitted the United States to invoke the priority provisions of \u00a7 3466. See <em>Crateo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Intermark, Inc., </em>536 F.2d 862, 865-66 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>In re Bonnie Classics, Inc., </em>116 F. Sup. 646, 648 (S.D.N.Y. 1953); <em>In re Dutch O\u2019Neal Motors of Louisiana, Inc., </em>148 So. 2d 468, 470 (La. App. 1963); and see <em>Wohlschlaeger </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>157 F.2d 933, 934 (8th Cir. 1946); <em>In re Western Auto Associate Store, </em>295 F. Sup. 566, 572 (W.D. Va. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 3466 is the governing priority statute dictates the order in which the plaintiff\u2019s funds must be distributed. The trial court\u2019s assignment of first priority to the claims of Attorneys Reif and Ronai must stand because no appeal has been taken from that order. The state no longer shares a priority status with the United States, because \u00a7 33-494 (3) is superseded by \u00a7 3466. <em>Illinois ex rel. Gordon </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>329 U.S. 362, 370, 67 S. Ct. 340, 91 L. Ed. 348 (1946); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>261 U.S. 253, 260, 43 S. Ct. 295, 67 L. Ed. 638 (1923). The only question that remains is whether the claims of the attaching creditors Jones and Ressler were sufficiently perfected and choate before the initiation of the \u00a7 33-491 distribution proceedings to take priority over the claims of the United States. As did the trial court, we hold that they were not. State law requires a judicial lien to be reduced to execution before it can be deemed perfected. General Statutes \u00a752-328; <em>Bradbury </em>v. <em>Wodjenski, </em>159 Conn. 366, 370, 269 A.2d 271 (1970). Federal law requires a judicial lien to be both perfected and choate before it can supersede the priority of the United States; such a lien must at least be reduced to pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>session .before it can prevail. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert Associates, Inc., </em>345 U.S. 361, 366, 73 S.

ACTS OF BANKRUPTCY</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">(a) Acts of bankruptcy by a person shall consist of his having (1) concealed, removed, or permitted to be concealed or removed any part of his property, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors or any of them, or made or suffered a transfer of any of his property, fraudulent under the provisions of section 107 or 110 of this title; or (2) made or suffered a preferential transfer, as defined in subdivision (a) of section 96 of this title; or (3) suffered or permitted, while insolvent, any creditor to obtain a lien upon any of his property through legal proceedings or distraint and not having vacated or discharged such lien within thirty days from the date thereof or at least five days before the date set for any sale or other disposition of such property; or (4) made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors; or (5) while insolvent or unable to pay his debts as they mature, procured, permitted, or suffered voluntarily or involuntarily the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take charge of his property; or (6) admitted in writing his inability to pay his debts and his willingness to be adjudged a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">(b) A petition may be filed against a person within four months after the commission of an act of bankruptcy. Such time with respect to the third act of bankruptcy shall expire four months after the date the lien through legal proceedings or distraint was obtained and, with respect to the first or fourth act of bankruptcy, such time shall not expire until four months after the date when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>transfer or assignment became so far perfected that no bona fide purchaser from the debtor could thereafter have acquired any rights in the property so transferred or assigned superior to the rights of the transferee or assignee therein, and such time with respect to the second act of bankruptcy shall not expire until four months after the date when the transfer became perfected as prescribed in subdivision (a) of section 96 of this title. For the purposes of this section, it is sufficient if intent to hinder, delay or defraud under the first act of bankruptcy, where such intent is an element of such act, or if insolvency under the second act of bankruptcy, exists either at the time when the transfer was made or at the time when it became perfected, as hereinabove provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">(c) It shall be a complete defense to any proceedings under the first act of bankruptcy to allege and prove that the party proceeded against was not insolvent as defined in this title at the time of the filing of the petition against him. If solvency at such date is proved by the alleged bankrupt, the proceedings shall be dismissed. In such proceedings the burden of proving solvency shall be on the alleged bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">(d) Whenever a person against whom a petition has been filed alleging the commission of the second, third, or fifth act of bankruptcy takes issue with and denies the allegation of his insolvency or his inability to pay his debts as they mature, he shall appear in court on the hearing, and prior thereto if ordered by the court, with his books, papers, and accounts, and submit to an examination and give testimony as to all matters tending to establish solvency or insolvency or ability or inability to pay his debts as they mature and, in case of his failure so to do, the burden of proving solvency or ability to pay his debts as they mature shall rest upon him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
