The plaintiff recovered a judgment for the diminution of the estate of Alma Bouffard in a negligence action brought against the attorney for the estate. The judgment not having been satisfied, the plaintiff brought this action directly against the defendant Transamerica Insurance Company, the judgment debtor\u2019s malpractice insurer. Transamerica moved to strike the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175. The court granted the motion to strike the entire complaint and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 157, rendered judgment for the defendant upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>motion after the plaintiff failed to replead. See <em>Kilbride </em>v. <em>Dushkin Publishing Group, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 718, 443 A.2d 922 (1982) ; <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>186 Conn. 86, 439 A.2d 1066 (1982). The plaintiff has appealed from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In reviewing a ruling on a motion to strike, we must construe the allegations of the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff. See <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>156 Conn. 92, 97-98, 239 A.2d 486 (1968). In his amended complaint the plaintiff alleged that (1) he had recovered a judgment against the attorney for the estate for \u201cdamages to property\u201d arising out of the attorney\u2019s carelessness;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the defendant Transamerica was the attorney\u2019s insurer at the time the losses were suffered; (3) the judgment had not been satisfied; and (4) the plaintiff is subrogated to the judgment debtor\u2019s rights against Transamerica under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175. Although a motion to strike admits facts well pleaded; <em>State </em>v. <em>LeSelva, </em>163 Conn. 229, 231, 303 A.2d 721 (1972); it does not admit legal conclusions. <em>Research Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>157 Conn. 587, 588, 248 A.2d 927 (1968). The plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the direct action statute\u2019s subrogation provision is applicable can, therefore, be disregarded for the purpose of a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The defendant argues, and the trial court agreed, that the financial loss suffered by the plaintiff, as administrator of the estate of Alma Bouffard, is not \u201cdamage to property\u201d as contemplated by the direct action statute. The court based its construction of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175 primarily on the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the word \u201ccasualty\u201d in the statute. \u201cChapter 681 of the Connecticut General Statutes, within which is contained General Statutes Sec. 38-175, is entitled \u2018Casualty Insurance . . . .\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary p. 275 (4th ed. 1968), defines a \u2018casualty\u2019 as an \u2018accident;\u2019 event due to sudden, unexpected, or unusual cause ... A loss ... by fire, shipwreck, lightning, etc.\u2019 \u201d The implication of this statement in the memorandum of decision is that the loss of value of an estate due to negligence is not such a casualty and \u00a7 38-175 does not encompass mere monetary loss as suffered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Our construction of the direct action statute, however, yields a different result. As is true in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature. See <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corporation, </em>442 U.S. 330, 337, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979) <em>; Baston </em>v. <em>Ricci, </em>174 Conn. 522, 528, 391 A.2d 161 (1978). General Statutes \u00a738-175 provides in relevant part: \u201cEach insurance company which issues a policy to any person, firm or corporation, insuring against loss or damage on account of the bodily injury or death by accident of any person, or <em>damage to the property of any person, </em>for which loss or damage such person, firm or corporation is legally responsible, shall, whenever a loss occurs under such policy, become absolutely liable, and the payment of such loss shall not depend upon the satisfaction by the assured of a final judgment against him for loss, damage or death <em>occasioned by such casualty.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cIn its dictionary definitions and in common usage \u2018property\u2019 comprehends anything of material value owned or possessed. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1818 (1961). Money, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>is a form of property.\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corporation, su</em>pra, 338.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cA consumer whose money has been diminished by reason of an antitrust violation has been injured in his . . . property . .. .\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corporation, </em>supra, 339. Although this is our first opportunity to construe the word \u201cproperty\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 38-175, we have on several occasions discussed its meaning in other contexts. In <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>143 Conn. 381, 386, 122 A.2d 789 (1956), we were called upon to decide whether the phrase \u201cany Stamford property owner\u201d in 26 Spec. Law 1236, No. 619, \u00a7 553.1 was restricted to owners of real property. We said: \u201cThe word \u2018property\u2019 is defined as \u2018[t]hat to which a person has a legal title.\u2019... It may include everything which is the subject of ownership.\u201d Id., 386-87. And in the taxation context, we stated that \u201c[t]he word \u2018property\u2019 . . . refers to every species of valuable right or interest which is subject to ownership, or that which has an exchangeable value or which goes to make up one\u2019s wealth or estate . .. .\u201d <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 131-32, 355 A.2d 236 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The defendant focuses on the phrase \u201csuch casualty\u201d as narrowing the meaning of \u201cdamage to the property of any person\u201d so as to exclude mere monetary damage. Of course, the use of \u201csuch\u201d to modify \u201ccasualty\u201d indicates an allusion to the preceding language \u201cbodily injury or death by accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of any person, or damage to the property of any person . . . .\u201d These occurrences are referred to indiscriminately by the term \u201csuch casualty.\u201d \u201cCasualty,\u201d like property, must be construed according to its \u201ccommonly approved usage.\u201d General Statutes \u00a71-1 (a). The standard definition appropriate to the context of this case is \u201can unfortunate occurrence\u201d synonymous with \u201cmischance.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. The trial court relied upon a more restrictive definition: an \u201c[ajccident; event due to sudden, unexpected, or unusual cause . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. Rev.) Even under this narrower definition, the trial court\u2019s view that damage to the net worth of an estate resulting from an attorney\u2019s negligence is not such an occurrence is erroneous. We must assume that the loss was accidental since the former action sounded in negligence rather than fraud. Although \u201csudden\u201d may also imply quickness, its primary meaning is unexpected, \u201chappening without previous notice or very brief notice.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. The complaint may fairly be construed as alleging that the loss resulted from a sudden, unexpected <em>or </em>unusual cause, to wit, the attorney\u2019s negligence. Our interpretation of the word \u201ccasualty\u201d is, of course, limited to its significance as used in \u00a7 38-175. We recognize that in other contexts it may have a more restricted connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">There is no recorded legislative history<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which militates against the broad construction dictated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>by the common usage of the language of the act. This court, however, has previously postulated in other contexts that the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the \u201cdirect action\u201d statute was to remedy \u201c[t]he unfairness to the assured of contracts of insurance\u201d with provisions that the insurer should be liable only in cases where the assured had actually paid a judgment obtained against him. <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>107 Conn. 649, 652, 142 A. 268 (1928). \u201cThe intention of the Act is to give the injured person the same rights under the policy as the assured . . . .\u201d Id., 653. Although the statute has been invoked almost exclusively in the context of motor vehicle negligence situations involving personal injuries and damage to tangible property, nothing in the statement of purpose of the act or any of our decisions so limits its scope. See <em>Connecticut Wholesale Drug Co. </em>v. <em>New England Fire Ins. Co., </em>121 Conn. 514, 516-17, 186 A. 551 (1936). We note that chapter 682a of the General Statutes, entitled \u201ccasualty insurance rates,\u201d is made applicable to \u201call insurance on risks or on operations in this state\u201d except for five categories of insurance specifically exempted from such rate regulation. General Statutes \u00a7 38-201b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It cannot be questioned that malpractice insurance rates are included in the casualty insurance rates to which chapter 682a applies. It is reasonable to infer from this usage of the word \u201ccasualty\u201d in the insurance context that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the same broad import of the word was intended by the legislature in using the phrase \u201closs . . . occasioned by such casualty\u201d in \u00a7 38-175.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Nor can we ascertain any consideration of policy which would justify authorization of a direct action by a judgment creditor against his debtor\u2019s insurer in cases where the property damaged is tangible but not where the property involved is intangible. The insured loss is no less real to the injured party if it is a decrease in his assets than if it is an equivalent amount of damage to his car. The defendant would have us read into \u00a7 38-175 by construction a meaning not apparent from its language and not consistent with any reasonable public policy. \u201c \u2018It clearly is incumbent upon any litigant desiring to limit the general and inclusive import of [a] word to show something in the context of the statute or some general course of interpretation in like matters, sufficient logically to justify a restriction ....\u2019\u201d <em>General Realty Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>133 Conn. 241, 50 A.2d 59 (1946). The defendant has not met this burden with respect to the word \u201cproperty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We are not unmindful that in certain areas of the law a distinction has been made between the right to recover for physical injury to property and for other economic loss. In the field of product liability many authorities have refused to extend strict tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>liability to cover economic loss. See, e.g., <em>Fredonia Broadcasting Corporation </em>v. <em>RCA Corporation, </em>481 F.2d 781, 797 (5th Cir. 1973) ; <em>Southwest Forest Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>422 F.2d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 400 U.S. 902, 91 S. Ct. 138, 27 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1970) ; <em>Seely </em>v. <em>White Motor Co., </em>63 Cal. 2d 9, 18, 403 P.2d 145 (1965) ; <em>Hiigel </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>544 P.2d 983, 989 (Colo. 1975) ; <em>Hawkins Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Matthews Co., </em>190 Neb. 546, 561-62, 209 N.W.2d 643 (1973) ; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Gatlin, </em>241 Or. 315, 318, 405 P.2d 502 (1965) ; <em>Signal Oil &amp; Gas </em>v. <em>Universal Oil Products, </em>572 S.W.2d 320, 325 (Tex. 1978); 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 402A; Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 101; White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed. 1980) \u00a7 11-4. A contrary view that strict liability should apply to economic loss also has attracted a following. See, e.g., <em>Santor </em>v. <em>A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc., </em>44 N.J. 52, 66-67, 207 A.2d 305 (1965); <em>Kassab </em>v. <em>Central Soya, </em>432 Pa. 217, 231 n.7, 246 A.2d 848 (1968) ; <em>Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fairbanks Morse, Inc., </em>58 Wis. 2d 193, 219, 206 N.W.2d 414 (1973). In adopting the rule of \u00a7402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts as the basis for product liability claims in this state prior to the adoption of our current legislation, we recognized that an allegation of \u201cphysical harm to the consumer or user or to his property\u201d was essential, as the rule provides. <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 549, 562, 227 A.2d 418 (1967) ; see also <em>Hoelter </em>v. <em>Mohawk Service, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 495, 500, 365 A.2d 1064 (1976); <em>Garthwait </em>v. <em>Burgio, </em>153 Conn. 284, 289, 216 A.2d 189 (1965). In 1979 when our unitary product liability statute; Public Acts 1979, No. 79-483; was adopted, the harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>for which relief was provided was defined to include \u201cdamage to property, including the product itself, and personal injuries including wrongful death.\u201d General Statutes \u00a752-572m (d). The legislative history of this statute contains a clear indication that the phrase \u201cdamage to property\u201d in this definition was intended to encompass economic harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The effect of this change in our law is to remove the requirement of privity of contract for an action by the person who has sustained an economic loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>against the manufacturer or seller responsible for that loss. Our construction of the phrase \u201cdamage to the property of any person\u201d in \u00a7 38-175 coincides with the gloss imparted by the legislative history upon the similar term \u201cdamage to property\u201d in \u00a7 52-572m (d), and the consequence is similar. In both situations the result of enforcing the privity barrier was to immunize from liability those who had received benefits from an economic transaction for which, as a matter of policy, they might reasonably be held accountable. In both the legislature has now relaxed this barrier without distinction between injury to property and economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The defendant urges upon us an alternate ground for sustaining the court\u2019s ruling striking the complaint, that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action under \u00a7 38-175 since he alleged that he had won a judgment against the attorney rather than a final judgment. This ground was not set forth by the defendant in support of his motion to strike.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor was it mentioned or relied upon by the trial court in its memorandum of decision. Had the plaintiff been apprised of this alleged defect, he might have chosen to amend his complaint or to replead, if the motion to strike had already been granted. We, therefore, decline to consider the doubtful merit of this belated claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 38-175. liability of insurer under liability policy. Each insurance company which issues a policy to any person, firm or corporation, insuring against loss or damage on account of the bodily injury or death by accident of any person, or damage to the property of any person, for whieh loss or damage such person, firm or corporation is legally responsible, shall, whenever a loss occurs under sueh poliey, become absolutely liable, and the payment of sueh loss shall not depend upon the satisfaction by the assured of a final judgment against him for loss, damage or death occasioned by such casualty. No sueh contract of insurance shall be cancelled or annulled by any agreement between the insurance company and the assured after the assured has become responsible for such loss or damage, and any such cancellation or annulment shall be void. Upon the recovery of a final judgment against any person, firm or corporation by any person, including administrators or executors, for loss or damage on account of bodily injury or death or damage to property, if the defendant in such action was insured against such loss or damage at the time when the right of action arose and if sueh judgment is not satisfied within thirty days after the date when it was rendered, sueh judgment creditor shall be subrogated to all the rights1 of the defendant and shall have a right of action against the insurer to the same extent that the defendant ini such action could have enforced his claim against such insurer had such defendant paid sueh judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> The complaint does not disclose the specific acts of negligence which were relied upon in the underlying action against the attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> In <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corporation, </em>442 U.S. 330, 337, 99 S.
