The defendant, Edward Falby, was arrested on a warrant for third degree burglary in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 and subsequently confessed to murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). He claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress his confession, in various evidentiary rulings, and in jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The events surrounding the defendant\u2019s confession are substantially undisputed and were set forth by the trial court in a lengthy finding of facts. On June 10, 1978, the defendant was arrested in Westport during the commission of a burglary and was scheduled for arraignment on a charge of burglary in the third degree before the Court of Common Pleas on June 20, 1978. A local attorney, Jerrold Engelman, agreed to represent the defendant at his arraignment subject to payment of a retainer on the 20th; Engelman did not enter an appearance for the defendant until June 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">On June 13, 1978, the body of a nine year old girl was discovered in a wooded area approximately one quarter of a mile from the defendant\u2019s home. A child who had walked through the area earlier in the afternoon described to the police an encounter \"with a slender, red-haired young man, and a composite drawing of the suspect appeared in local newspapers. On June 16 the child identified the defendant from a photo display as the young man he had spoken to. The defendant at that time was eighteen years old and had red hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">Following this identification, Lieutenant William Smith of the Westport police department and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Inspector Ernest Draper of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office obtained two warrants: a bench warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest on the third degree burglary charge and a search and seizure warrant for the defendant and his home in relation to the murder investigation. Together with a sizable contingent of police officers, Smith and Draper proceeded to the defendant\u2019s home late in the afternoon of June 16; Smith had a tape recorder in his pocket and recorded his conversations with the defendant and his family. The defendant was not at home when the police arrived but was arrested shortly thereafter outside the house and twice informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before reaching the police station, where he was again informed of his rights. The defendant did not enter his home and was not shown the search and seizure warrant, although a copy was left with Barbara Falby, the defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">At the Westport police station the defendant was questioned by Smith and Draper from approximately 5:45 p.m. to 7 p.m., until the arrival of attorney Michael Cantore, who had been sent to police headquarters by Barbara Falby. In the course of his interrogation the defendant confessed to killing the nine year old girl, and that confession was recorded on tape; the defendant did not subsequently sign a written statement. The defendant was arrested on a bench warrant for murder at approximately 10 p.m. that night and taken to the Bridgeport Correctional Center at approximately 11:30 p.m., where a corrections officer once again advised the defendant of his rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-43. At his jury trial for murder, the defendant\u2019s confession was, over his objection, admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The defendant\u2019s principal claim of error on appeal is the denial of his motion to suppress his confession. He bases that claim on several grounds: the failure of the police to inform him that he was a murder suspect; the absence of counsel during interrogation; improper police tactics in arresting the defendant for an unrelated crime and promising him psychiatric help in return for a murder confession ; and technical errors in obtaining the burglary warrant and executing the murder warrant. The defendant also raises two additional evidentiary claims of error: that the trial court erred (1) in admitting the testimony of a young girl concerning an attack on her by the defendant a year prior to the/ murder and (2) in failing to exclude expert testimony tainted by a violation of the court\u2019s sequestration order. Finally, the defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions because the court (1) explained to the jury that the state was not seeking capital punishment but failed to explain the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity; (2) rejected the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on two lesser included offenses; and (3) instructed the jury improperly concerning the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at his trial. We find error only in the trial court\u2019s instruction on lesser included offenses but will review those of the defendant\u2019s other claims that may arise again upon a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error concerning the admissibility of his confession argues that the principles of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), require the suppression of his confession because he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>told, at the time when he was apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he was suspected of the crime of murder. The trial court, in its memorandum of decision denying his motion to suppress, held, as a matter of law, that <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>does not require the police to inform a defendant of the exact nature of the charges against him; the court furthermore found, as a fact, that the defendant knew, at the time of his arrest, that he was a prime suspect in the Westport murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The principles of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>are well established and undisputed. In order to assure that a confession is voluntary, and to protect a suspect\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the police are obligated to observe certain formalities before attempting to elicit a confession from a suspect who is in custody. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 478-79;<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 136, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 161, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>does not deny that he was given the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings immediately upon his arrest on the burglary warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He maintains, however, that the police were, in addition, obligated to inform him that, although he was under arrest for burglary, he was a prime suspect in, and would be interrogated about, the Westport murder. When the burglary arrest was, as he alleges, a mere pretext for the murder interrogation, he argues that <em>Miranda </em>requires disclosure of the police agenda before a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights can be knowing and intelligent. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The record in this case, which includes a complete transcript of all conversations between the police and the defendant from the moment of his arrest to the arrival of Attorney Cantore, lends considerable support to the defendant\u2019s allegation that his arrest for burglary was indeed unrelated to the custodial interrogation which followed. The record reveals a striking and sustained reluctance on the part of the police to articulate the subject of their concern. Repeatedly, the police evaded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>defendant\u2019s specific inquiries about why he was being taken into custody and questioned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Officers Smith and Draper testified that the defendant was never directly informed that he was a murder suspect. They further testified that their reason for requesting a burglary bench warrant was concern that the defendant would flee the jurisdiction once the search warrant alerted him to police suspicion about his involvement in the murder. Draper testified that at the time of the initial arrest he did not believe that he had sufficient evidence for a murder warrant. Another police officer testified, without contradiction, that the authorities had no need for further questioning about the burglary because they already possessed sufficient evidence against the defendant. There was also testimony by the police, amply confirmed by the transcript of the defendant\u2019s interrogation, that in fact he was asked no questions about the burglary. In light of this testimony, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the burglary bench warrant was a convenient pretext for custodial interrogation of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>concerning a murder, at a time when inadequate grounds existed to arrest him for the more serious crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">It is clear that the guidelines of <em>Miranda </em>do not, per se, limit police interrogation to the crime with which a suspect has been explicitly charged. Ordinarily, <em>Miranda </em>warnings permit the police to extend their questioning of one who is in custody to include crimes other than the very case under investigation. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 104-105, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975); <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 1, 4-5, 88 S. Ct. 1503, 20 L. Ed. 2d 381 (1968). Good faith inquiry into the possible commission of one crime may legitimately unearth grounds for pursuing evidence of guilt for another crime. We are asked today to rule whether these principles permit the police deliberately to withhold from a suspect, at the time of issuing the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the nature of the sole crime on which they intend to focus their interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The circumstances of the present case do not present an appropriate opportunity for deciding the extent to which the police have a duty to inform a suspect of the true subject of their intended interrogation. We recognize that this is an issue on which the case law is divided. For cases denying the existence of such a duty, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>533 F.2d 1210, 1212 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Brierly, </em>492 F.2d 735, 738-39 (3d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 877, 95 S. Ct. 140, 42 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>431 F.2d 97, 99 n.1 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>296 N.C. 344, 352-53, 250 S.E.2d 263 (1979) and cases cited therein; contra, see <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>McCrary, </em>643 F.2d 323, 328 (5th Cir. <em>1981); Schenk </em>v. <em>Ellsworth, </em>293 F. Sup. 26, 28-29 (D. Mont. 1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>475 Pa. 17, 22-23, 379 A.2d 553 (1977); cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>630 P.2d 583, 589-90 (Colo. 1981); see generally White, \u201cPolice Use of Trickery in Inducing Confessions,\u201d 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 611-14 (1979); Dix, \u201cMistake, Ignorance, Expectation of Benefit, and the Modern Law of Confessions,\u201d 1975 Wash. Univ. Law Q. 275, 318-21. Adequate disclosure is one element of the requirement that a confession is \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 163, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980), quoting <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961); see <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973). The word \u201cmurder\u201d spoken by a police officer is often a potent stimulant to the exercise of such constitutional rights as the right to counsel and the protection against self-incrimination. Justice Stewart has written of \u201csociety\u2019s deeply felt belief that the criminal law cannot be used as an instrument of unfairness . . . .\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 225. This court too has only in recent days condemned unfair police procedures, when we held that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>inhibits not only police encounters of the third degree kind, it also precludes all types of questioning and psychological ploys, calculated or reasonably likely to produce the desired result. Interrogation extends to any words or actions on the part of police officers that they should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301-302, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>186 Conn. 437, 443, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>441 A.2d 857 (1982). The police had no duty, however, to disclose to the defendant what he actually knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The trial court found, as a matter of fact, that the defendant had actual knowledge that he was a prime suspect in the Westport murder. The overall issue of whether a confession is voluntary and admissible under the fifth amendment is a question of fact \u201cfor determination by the trial court in the exercise of its legal discretion. ... in accordance with constitutional standards of due process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>175 Conn. 398, 408, 399 A.2d 1269 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>supra, 162-63; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>149 Conn. 640, 652, 183 A.2d 612 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The transcript supports the trial court\u2019s factual determination. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, there was testimony concerning the publication in local newspapers, prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest, of a composite sketch of the murder suspect together with a description of a slender, red-haired young man. Barbara Falby testified that on June 15 the defendant had decided to speak to a police detective about the investigation but was dissuaded by her. This testimony, added to the defendant\u2019s own observation to the police that he had \u201cideas\u201d about the reason for his arrest, adequately supports the trial court\u2019s finding of actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Since the defendant had sufficient knowledge of his actual situation at the time of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he was not misled by the failure of the police to disclose to him their intention to interrogate him about the murder. In these circumstances, the nature of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that he received did not render the confession involuntary or its admission into evidence improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The defendant also claims that his confession should have been suppressed because it was obtained in the absence of counsel. Two bases for this claim are urged: that the defendant was at the time of interrogation already represented by counsel retained earlier in relation to the burglary charge, and that the police were aware of Barbara Falby\u2019s strenuous efforts on behalf of her son to contact an attorney following the arrival of police officers at her home. In light of these facts, the defendant argues, the state has not met its burden of demonstrating the defendant\u2019s waiver of his sixth amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Although the record does not conclusively establish Attorney Engelman\u2019s representation of the defendant on the burglary charge at the time of his murder confession and the trial court made no relevant finding of fact, we need not resolve that question today. This court has recently held that \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant had been represented by counsel in a different proceeding did not . . . give notice to the police than an appearance had been entered by the defendant\u2019s counsel in connection with the charges then under investigation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>supra, 168. Thus, even if Engelman\u2019s appearance for the defendant on the burglary charge had been entered prior to June 16, that appearance would in no way undermine an otherwise valid waiver of right to counsel for the murder interrogation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>183 Conn. 280, 283-86, 439 A.2d 330 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moscone, </em>171 Conn. 500, 510, 370 A.2d 1030 (1976). Finally, we note that since the defendant was eighteen years old at the time of his confession, his mother\u2019s efforts to secure counsel for him could not neutralize his own valid waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>rights. See General Statutes $ 1-ld. In these and all other respects, there was therefore sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that the defendant had waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim for suppression rests upon the police strategy of promising him psychiatric help in return for a confession. Such promises made to a young man whom the police knew to have a troubled psychiatric history, the defendant argues, fatally weaken the voluntariness of his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The transcript of the defendant\u2019s police interrogation supports the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cLieutenant Smith\u2019s approach was that of a \u2018Father Confessor\u2019 \u201d urging on the defendant the beneficial consequences of a full confession. The transcript also, however, supports the trial court\u2019s further findings that no actual promises were made by the police and that the defendant\u2019s capacity for decision-making was not impaired by this method of interrogation. On the record before us we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s findings of voluntariness are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claims of error in the admission of Ms confession involve alleged procedural breaches by the authorities. First, the defendant objects that since he received no <em>Miranda </em>warnings from a judge of the Court of Common Pleas on the occasion of his June 10 warrantless burglary arrest as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-lb, all subsequent confessions are barred by General Statutes \u00a7 54-1c. It is true that the latter statute renders inadmissible the confession of any suspect \u201cwho has not been informed of Ms rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>as provided by section 54-lb or section 54-64b.\u201d It is also true, however, and dispositive, that the defendant\u2019s Superior Court bench warrant arrest for burglary on June 16, which transferred jurisdiction from the Court of Common Pleas and thus superseded the prior arrest, was followed by adequate and valid <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The defendant next charges violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-43,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which at the time of his arrest authorized the issuance of a bench warrant \u201c[u]pon the representation of any state\u2019s attorney that he has reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed within his jurisdiction.\u201d First, he argues, the warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest was obtained by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Richard Jacobson rather than by State\u2019s Attorney Donald Browne. Second, the representation was not made under oath as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The defendant\u2019s first objection fails because an assistant state\u2019s attorney \u201cin the absence from the county or district or disability of the state\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ney or at Ms request, shall have and exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of state\u2019s attorney.\u201d General Statutes $ 51-278. The trial court expressly found that on the afternoon of June 16 Donald Browne was out of the judicial district of Fairfield County, and that finding is adequately supported by the record. The defendant\u2019s second objection, the lack of an oath, is fully answered by our decision in <em>Grega </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>178 Conn. 207, 210, 423 A.2d 873 (1979), where we held that an application by a state\u2019s attorney for a bench warrant may be supported by either an oath or an affirmation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 132, 214 A.2d 900 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim for suppression is based on the time that elapsed between his initial arrest at approximately 5:20 p.m. and his appearance before an official of the Bridgeport Correctional Center at approximately 11:30 p.m. Under General Statutes \u00a7 54-43, any person arrested on a bench warrant must be taken \u201cwithout undue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>delay\u201d before the clerk of the Superior Court or, in the event that the clerk\u2019s office is closed, before a designated official at a community correctional center, to be advised of his rights. The defendant does not challenge the authority of the official who acted; he claims only that the six-hour delay between arrest and advice constitutes undue delay under \u00a7 54-43, and so requires exclusion of his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In its findings of fact, the trial court set forth a timetable for the afternoon and evening of June 16. According to that timetable, the defendant spent the hour from approximately 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. in conversation with Attorney Cantore. He spent the time from approximately 10 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. being photographed and fingerprinted at police headquarters in Westport; the drive from Westport to Bridgeport took an additional half hour. The defendant does not dispute these times. Of the six hours between arrest and arrival at the correctional center, then, two hours were consumed in related and reasonable activities.. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that the remaining four hours, during which time the authorities obtained and executed a bench warrant for murder, constitute an undue delay. The fact that other arrangements might have been made to accelerate the defendant\u2019s progress does not by itself establish a statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The defendant also claims error in the trial court\u2019s admission of testimony by a fourteen year old girl concerning an attack on her by the defendant one year prior to the murder. There are two bases for this claim: (1) that the state did not offer clear and convincing proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>for the attack, and (2) that the witness\u2019 in-conrt identification of the defendant was fatally tainted by a photo display ruled impermissibly suggestive by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">At a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the witness testified that on June 27,1977, she was walking her bicycle through a wooded area not far from the murder site when a young man approached her. After initiating a conversation and giving his name as \u201csomething like Holby or Folby,\u201d the young man began to help her with her bicycle. When the witness resisted his efforts to help, he \u201cgrabbed me around the neck and began to choke me.\u201d As the witness struggled, she and her attacker heard footsteps approaching. The attacker then threw her to the ground and ran off. On the evening of the crime the witness was unable to identify her attacker from a display of nine black and white photographs, including a recent photograph of the defendant. The witness did not recall seeing a bandage on the attacker\u2019s wrist, although there was testimony that the defendant wore such a bandage at that time. A year later, following the murder, the police returned with seven of the previous photographs and a new photograph of the defendant in place of the earlier one; the witness then identified the defendant as her attacker. She also subsequently identified the defendant in court. There was independent testimony by another witness, a friend who had been living with the Falby family at the time of the first attack, that the defendant had described to her an occasion on which \u201che was walking home from Norwalk through a path and there was a little girl on the path with a bicycle and he just had the urge to take her around the neck\u201d and in fact did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>In ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial court found clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had attacked the witness. It further found that the strong similarities between that attack and the circumstances of the murder rendered the disputed testimony probative on the issue of intent. Although the court rejected the 1978 photo identification as impermissibly suggestive, it found that the witness\u2019 in-court identification was based upon independent observation and so was admissible. At trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, the witness testified to his attack upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">This court has recently provided a succinct statement of our law on the admission of evidence of prior crimes by a defendant. <em>\u201cAs </em>a general proposition, evidence of guilt of other crimes, because of its prejudicial nature, is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crimes with which he is charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>159 Conn. 169, 172, 268 A.2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>147 Conn. 589, 599, 164 A.2d 399 (1960). Such evidence is admissible for other purposes, however, such as when it is particularly probative in showing such things as intent, an element in the crime, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity, to name some exceptions to the rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 701, 364 A.2d 186 (1975). The trial judge, however, must determine in the exercise of judicial discretion that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial tendency. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>[164 Conn. 560, 597, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S.

On the record before us we cannot say that such an abuse of discretion occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The trial court had sufficient grounds for deciding that the witness\u2019 testimony was admissible. Although she did not identify the defendant from the first photo display and did not recall a bandage on his wrist, the witness\u2019 subsequent in-court identification was buttressed by her reliance on the color of the attacker\u2019s hair, a significant factor not present in the black and white photographs shown to her, and by her recollection of the name given by her attacker. The trial court had before it two attacks on young girls, one nine and the other twelve, in wooded areas in the same section of West-port, on similar June days one year apart. In each case, the attacker apparently initiated a conversation and offered assistance before seizing his victim. One victim reported that her attacker attempted to choke her with his hands; the other died of traumatic asphyxia, a cause of death which the state\u2019s chief medical examiner testified was consistent with manual strangulation. These facts, together with independent testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s account of the earlier attack, amply supported the court\u2019s determination that the disputed testimony was sufficiently probative of the issue of intent to commit murder to outweigh any prejudicial tendency. There was no error in the admission of the disputed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error is the trial court\u2019s refusal to disqualify two of the state\u2019s expert witnesses who were given a transcript of testimony by the defense\u2019s expert in violation of a sequestration order, or, in the alternative, the court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the case against the defendant because of prosecutorial misconduct in violating that order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The defendant, who offered an insanity defense, called as his expert witnesses Jonathan Pincus, a neurologist, and Dorothy O. Lewis, a psychiatrist. The state\u2019s expert witnesses, Robert Miller, a psychiatrist, and Michael S. Johnson, a psychologist, both received a complete transcript of Pincus\u2019 testimony prior to their appearances in court; the assistant state\u2019s attorney acknowledged that he had arranged for delivery of that transcript to his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">At the time Pincus testified a sequestration order affecting all witnesses was in effect. The defendant claims that that order, issued by the court mid-way through the trial in response to a request by counsel for both sides, adopted by reference the terms of the elaborate sequestration order imposed by the court during the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession. Further, the defendant argues that, even if the more elaborate order is not applicable, the state has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>violated the terms of a basic sequestration order in a manner prejudicial to the defendant and hence its expert witnesses should be disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">After a hearing in the absence of the jury, the trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments, finding instead that the sequestration order in effect was a limited one and that the state\u2019s attorney, although overzealous, did not violate that order, intentionally or otherwise, and was not guilty of prosecutorial misconduct. Although the court found the remedies of disqualification and dismissal too drastic for what it termed an \u201cunwise\u201d action, it took several remedial steps. First, the court ordered that the transcript of Pincus\u2019 testimony be withheld from the state\u2019s neurologist. Second, the court permitted defense counsel to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses as to whether they had seen or been influenced by the transcript. Finally, the court informed the jury that in weighing the testimony of the expert witnesses it should remember that Lewis did not have access to Pincus\u2019 testimony but that Miller and Johnson did.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In assessing the defendant\u2019s claim, it is not necessary for us to determine the scope of the sequestration order in effect at the time of the alleged violation. The state\u2019s conduct in providing witnesses barred from the courtroom during Pincus\u2019 testimony with a verbatim transcript of that testimony was a clear violation of any sequestration order, narrow or broad, and the trial court erred in finding otherwise. This court has asserted that \u201c \u2018[t]he obvious purpose of sequestering a witness while another is giving his testimony is to prevent the one sequestered from shaping his testimony to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>rob\u00f3rate falsely the testimony of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 331, 363 A.2d 72 (1975); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 200, 187 A.2d 442 (1962). It is sophistical to argue that what can be achieved by hearing spoken testimony inside the courtroom cannot equally be achieved by reading the identical testimony outside the courtroom. This is especially true when the testimony in question, because of its highly technical nature, is less susceptible to influence by the witness\u2019 persona than a narrative of events, for example, might be. It is no affront to expert witnesses to suggest that they too may be affected in subtle, inadvertent ways by exposure to the differing views of a colleague. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>186 Conn. 426, 435, 441 A.2d 852 (1982). The state\u2019s position that physical removal of its witnesses absolves it of wrongdoing would vitiate any sequestration order by exalting form above substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The remedy for such a violation rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion, guided by a primary concern for \u201cthe fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>186 Conn. 476, 488-89, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982). Although in the present case the trial court\u2019s remedial measures neutralized any prejudice to the defendant and rendered the error harmless, the state should not in a new trial be encouraged to rely on such subsequent correctives to cure its violation. Should the trial court again impose a sequestration order which \u201cmerely prohibits a sequestered witness from being in the courtroom when he is not testifying\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 331; General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a; that order cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>avoided by the disingenuous strategy of transferring the testifying witness\u2019 voice from the courtroom to a transcript.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The defendant finally challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to honor his request to instruct the jury that manslaughter in the second degree and criminally negligent homicide were lesser included offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the court instructed only on murder and manslaughter in the first degree. We agree that the trial court erred in refusing the additional instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45, the \u201cjury before which any person indicted for murder is tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u201d Whether an accused may avail himself of this statutory privilege by means of a jury instruction is governed by the principles set forth in <em>State </em>v. Rodrigues, 180 Conn. 382, 399-400, 429 A.2d 919 (1980), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), and summarized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, 72, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed 2d 807 (1981): \u201cIn view of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c), which allows a defendant indicted for murder to be found guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged, it is clear that any lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>degree of homicide may be considered by the trier, subject to the requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), that the evidence does support a conviction of the lesser included offense and that the elements differentiating the lesser offense are sufficiently in dispute to justify finding the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodrigues, </em>supra.\u201d The issue before us, then, is whether the evidence at trial, including the defendant\u2019s confession, can support a conviction for manslaughter in the second degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1); or criminally negligent homicide. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The crucial element distinguishing manslaughter in the second degree and criminally negligent homicide from murder and manslaughter in the first degree is intent, \u201coften the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Rodriguez, supra, 404. If, based on the admissible evidence presented at trial, the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant acted either recklessly or with criminal negligence in causing the victim\u2019s death, then the defendant was entitled to the charge requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">At trial the state\u2019s chief medical examiner testified that, based on the dirt in the victim\u2019s mouth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>right lower lobe bronchus, she was probably \u201calive at the time that her face was in the dirt.\u201d In his confession the defendant indicated that when the victim began to bleed \u201cI got scared and I just picked her up and threw her over by that little stream.\u201d Combined with the account of the aborted attack a year earlier, when the defendant allegedly removed his hands from the victim\u2019s neck and threw her to the ground, this evidence suggests at least a possibility that the defendant acted recklessly or with criminal negligence in leaving a child with her face in the dirt following another such attack.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since we cannot as a matter of law exclude this possibility, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as requested on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the second degree and criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">There is error in part, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In this opinion Speziale, C.
