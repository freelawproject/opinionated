J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuT\">In the early morning hours of July 22, 1977, police and fire officials found nine bodies, eight of them children, inside the burned-out house of Fred Beaudoin, Sr. and Cheryl Beaudoin in Prospect. All of the victims had been beaten, some had been bound, and Cheryl Beaudoin had been stabbed. The defendant, Lome Aequin, was indicted for the murders, and charged by information with first degree arson for the burning of the house. After a trial before a jury of twelve, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to an effective prison term of not less than 105 years nor more than life.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Before and during trial, the defendant made a number of motions challenging the admissibility of a confession which was obtained from him while he was in police custody on July 22. He also sought to suppress items of physical evidence which he claimed were the fruits of his illegally obtained confession. These motions were denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The defendant has appealed to this court, claiming error in (1) the admission of his confession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>its fruits at trial, (2) the exclusion of a written hearsay statement, and (3) the composition of the jury array.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The defendant made a confession to the state police in which he described in graphic detail his brutal and apparently motiveless murders of the nine victims. The confession was admitted at trial over the defendant\u2019s objection. The defendant claims, inter alia, that the confession was obtained in violation of his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures and his fifth amendment right not to be a witness against himself, as those rights are applied to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964); <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">THE FOURTH AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">A confession is by definition a self-incriminating statement, and any challenge to the admissibility of a confession naturally focuses on the fifth amendment guarantee that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d U.S. Const., amend. Y. The now familiar warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467-73, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), are designed primarily to protect that right. Before the fifth amendment issue is reached, however, a preliminary inquiry involving the fourth amendment must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Miranda </em>held that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements . . . stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Id., 444. It is clear in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion itself, and also in cases decided by this court, that \u201c[b]efore one suspected of the commission of a crime is entitled to the warnings constitutionally required by <em>Miranda </em>. . . two conditions must be satisfied: the suspect must be in the custody of law enforcement officials; <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977); <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 344-48, 96 S. Ct. 1612, 48 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1976); and the suspect must be subjected to interrogation. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121,136, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981); see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The first prong above is derived from the fourth amendment guarantee of freedom from unreasonable seizures. In this respect, we recently held that \u201c[wjhether the confession and physical evidence are admissible turns on the answers to two subsidiary questions: (1) whether the defendant was \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution so as to invoke their protection, and, if so, (2) whether he was \u2018reasonably\u2019 seized, that is, whether there was probable cause to seize him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 157-58, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980); <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 99 S. Ct. 2248, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>60 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1979).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. Ostroski, 186 Conn. 287, 290-91, 440 A.2d 984 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The defendant was in the company of police officers for all but a few minutes from 9:30 a.m. on July 22 through the time his confession began at approximately 11:45 p.m. <em>Ostroshi, </em>supra, requires that the court determine <em>when </em>the defendant was legally in custody and whether, at that time, the police had probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">At about 9:30 a.m. on the morning of the Prospect fire, police went to Acquin\u2019s residence. Trooper James K. Blais told Acquin that the Beaudoin house had burned and some deaths had occurred there. Blais then \u201casked him if he would voluntarily help us by coming with us to help in the investigation.\u201d Acquin voluntarily agreed to go to the Bethany barracks, and then to the Meriden state police headquarters. He was read the <em>Miranda </em>rights for the first time at about 10:30 a.m., and officers began to question him about the Beaudoin family and about his own activities on the previous day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The interview was tape recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Detective Joseph E. Zdanowicz relieved Blais at approximately 10:45 a.m. and also advised Acqnin of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. Zdanowicz then continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the questioning and prepared a written statement, which Acquin refused to sign. Shortly thereafter, at about 1:30 p.m., Acquin indicated that he did not want to hear about the details of the crime, and asked to go home. Trooper George R. Hamila escorted Acquin to a police ear, and they drove toward Route 69, apparently to take him home to Waterbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Upon learning that Acquin was being taken home, Lieutenant James Shay, the officer then in charge of the investigation, radioed an order to Hamila to bring Acquin to the Bethany barracks. Acquin told Hamila that he did not want to go back, and they continued toward Waterbury. When Shay repeated the order, Hamila turned the car around. Acquin protested and opened the door of the moving patrol car to get out. Hamila stopped the car, and Acquin began walking north on Route 69 toward home. Within minutes, at approximately 2 p.m., Shay arrived on the scene, accompanied by four other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>officers in two police cars. Shay placed a hand on Acqnin\u2019s shoulder and spoke to him. briefly. Surrounded by three cars and several officers, Aequin agreed to return to the Prospect command post with Shay.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">At oral argument before this court, the state conceded that the defendant was seized for fourth amendment purposes when Shay placed a hand on him on Route 69. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">This court has recently reaffirmed that a person has been \u201cseized\u201d so as to invoke the protection of the fourth amendment \u201c \u2018only when by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained. ... As long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person\u2019s liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective justification. . . . We conclude that a person has been \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 291-92; see also <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 444. In this case Aequin had just been questioned for three hours by the police, he had heard an order to return him to the police barracks, he was surrounded by police officers, and the senior officer had placed a hand on his shoulder. Although Shay did not declare \u201cI seize you in the name of the State,\u201d his classic gesture could not have been more clear. No reasonable person could have believed that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>was free to leave. The defendant was in custody at that time. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The defendant contends, however, that he was in custody at approximately 9:30 a.m. when he was first questioned. The record reveals the following undisputed facts: The defendant voluntarily agreed to accompany the officers, first to Bethany, then to Meriden. The questions asked of him concerned the Beaudoin family, whom he knew well, and his contact with them the previous day. When he asked to go home, all questioning stopped, he was promptly taken to a police car, and the police started to drive him home. No claim is made that he was restrained or coerced in any way during the initial interview. Under the undisputed facts before us, no reasonable person could have considered that he was not free to leave at that time. The defendant was not in custody until he was seized by Shay at approximately 2 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">\u201c \u2018Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that a felony had been committed.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>153 Conn. 39, 42, 212 A.2d 75 [1965]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>178 Conn. 427, 435-36, 423 A.2d 72 (1979); and that the person arrested committed it. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 529, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980); see <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1949); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>(1925). The quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion, but is substantially less than that required for conviction. Our cases have made clear that \u201c[tjhere is often a fine line between mere suspicion and probable cause, and \u2018[tjhat line necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances.\u2019 <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 176.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Penland, </em>174 Conn. 153, 155-56, 384 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 2237, 56 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1978). Furthermore, when we test the quantum of probable cause, it is not the personal knowledge of the arresting officer but the collective knowledge of the law enforcement organization at the time of the arrest which must be considered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>174 Conn. 405, 411, 389 A.2d 730, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 859, 99 S. Ct. 177, 58 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>165 Conn. 239, 246, 332 A.2d 64 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>161 Conn. 371, 377, 288 A.2d 439 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1017, 92 S. Ct. 677, 30 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">It is uncontested that the following facts were known to the police before Shay approached the defendant on Route 69 at about 2 p.m.: Nine bodies had been found, all badly beaten and some tied up, in the burned-out Beaudoin house. The fire was the result of arson. Aequin was the foster brother of Fred Beaudoin, Sr. and a frequent visitor to the Beaudoin home. Aequin had been at the house from at least 7:30 to 10 p.m. on the previous evening, July 21. Aequin had recent scratches on his face, which he explained were the result of a mugging the night before. In Zdanowicz\u2019s opinion, the injuries were not consistent with this explanation. Aequin had not reported the mugging to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>police, and had not mentioned it at all in his oral statement to the police at approximately 9:30 a.m. Resident state troopers in Bethany considered Acquin to be violent by nature on the basis of past experience. Acquin had once lived at the Beaudoin house and the house had caught on fire during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In addition, police had interviewed Fred Beaudoin, Sr. and Alden Brooks, the only living people other than Acquin known to have been at the house on the night of July 21-22. Beaudoin had been at work when the fire broke out at approximately 3:45 a.m., and Brooks had apparently offered an acceptable account of his own whereabouts. When Acquin was told of the fire and deaths at 9:30 a.m. he showed neither surprise nor emotion. Rose Aim Paolino, who reported the fire at 3:45 a.m., had seen a dark colored car speeding away at that time. Acquin often drove a black Rambler, and had been driving it earlier in the evening.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, Fred Beaudoin, Jr., one of the child victims, had told a playmate that Acquin was going to sleep overnight at the Beaudoin home on the night of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the police had information which implicated others as possible suspects need not detain us. The function of this court is not to second-guess the reasonable and logical conclusions of experienced police officers at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the time of their determination of probable cause. Nor are we concerned with a retrospective look at the truth or falsity of the information which police had at the time of the arrest. <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 176.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">We hold that the defendant was in custody on Route 69 at 2 p.m., and that the custody was legal because there was probable cause to arrest him at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">THE FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIM: MIRANDA</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The defendant\u2019s graphic and detailed confession to the murders was admitted at trial. The defendant asserted before the trial court, and claims before this court, that the confession was obtained in violation of his right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself under the fifth amendment to the constitution, as interpreted in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378, reh. denied, 452 U.S. 973, 101 S. Ct. 3128, 69 L. Ed. 2d 984 (1981), and <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">After his encounter with Shay on Route 69 in Prospect at approximately 2 p.m., Acquin was brought to the Prospect command post. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>again read the <em>Miranda </em>rights and then questioned at length by Hamila regarding his activities of the preceding two days. At approximately 5:45 p.m. Acquin interrupted himself in midsentence and stated that he wanted a lawyer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Hamila reported Acquin\u2019s request for counsel to Captain Thomas McDonnell of the Connecticut state police, who had assumed overall command of the investigation. McDonnell told Hamila to get something to eat. McDonnell then went into the room with Acquin and talked with him for over half an hour in an attempt to discover who Acquin wanted to represent him. McDonnell suggested Acquin\u2019s previous attorney and the public defender. Acquin rejected both, as he did the suggestion that his brother be called to get him an attorney. After some time, Acquin indicated that \u201cit wasn\u2019t really an attorney that he wanted, it was just somebody he could trust,\u201d and that he wanted Joel Albert, a psychiatrist working with prisoners in the New Haven jail. Acquin also indicated \u201cthat as soon as Albert got there that he would tell us the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>about what happened the night before.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McDonnell broke off the conversation at that point, and ordered Shay to find and to summon Albert. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>then returned to the interrogation room, and he and Acquin decided to get something to eat.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Hamila returned shortly thereafter, and McDonnell, Hamila and Acquin drove to a restaurant nearby, where they ate hamburgers in the police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Acquin was not handcuffed or physically restrained during this trip. At Acquin\u2019s request he was taken to Bethany rather than back to Prospect, where a crowd of reporters had gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>In Bethany, Acqnin was left alone in a room to wait for Albert. He curled up in an armchair and slept or rested for about two and one-half hours, when Albert finally arrived at approximately 11:40 p.m. on July 22. McDonnell woke Acquin up, and asked whether he still wanted to see Albert and to tell his story. Acquin said he did, and the two of them joined Albert in another room. McDonnell told Acquin that Albert was not an attorney and reminded him that any statement made could be used against him in court;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and at Albert\u2019s request, McDonnell then left the room. Albert determined that Acquin did want him there, and called McDonnell back in. Neither Acquin nor Albert mentioned an attorney.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On direct examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tion, McDonnell described the conversation which followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cA. They [sic] then asked Lome Aequin: do you want to tell us what happened last night. And, he said: no, I don\u2019t want to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">Q. And, what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">A. I said: well, I thought you said when Dr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">Albert got here that you would tell us the truth about what happened last night. And, he said: well, what I mean is, it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want to tell you, I want you to ask me questions, I can\u2019t go through it all again. So, I asked him questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">Q. Did you ask him questions ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">Q. What did you ask him first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">A. First question I asked him was: how did you really get those cuts. Previously he told us he got the cuts during an assault, he was assaulted by some people up in the Waterbury area. And, his reply to my question was that he didn\u2019t get the cuts from those guys the way he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">Q. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">A. And, then I asked him: did you kill all those people. And, he said: yes, he did. And, then without any further questions for quite some time, he went into a narrative about what happened the night before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The defendant claims that the facts before us establish as a matter of law that his confession was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Any inquiry into the admissibility of a confession obtained while a defendant is in custody must of course begin with <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that the fifth and fourteenth amendments\u2019 prohibition against compelled self-incrimination requires that a suspect in police custody be informed specifically of his or her right to remain silent and to have an attorney present before being questioned. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 444, 479. The court further held that \u201c[i]f the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease\u201d; id., 473-74; and \u201c[i]f the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d Id., 474. Furthermore, \u201c[i]f the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d Id., 475. The standard for waiver is that announced in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938): \u201cA waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. . . . [which] must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d Accord, <em>North Carolina </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>183 Conn. 280, 439 A.2d 330 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Supreme Court recently reconfirmed the principles stated above in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, where the court held: \u201c[ W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. We further hold that an accused, such as Edwards, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d Id., 484-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The defendant contends that <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, establishes a per se rule that once an accused has asked for counsel, any further questioning of any kind by the police violates his fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We do not, however, construe the <em>Edwards </em>opinion so broadly. To do so would transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards \u201cinto wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make informed and intelligent assessments of their interests.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975). We believe that the <em>Edwards </em>opinion is a restatement of existing principles of constitutional law, and is not intended to overrule decided cases. <em>Edwards </em>does not prohibit communication between police and a suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>who has requested an attorney. Rather it prohibits the use of confessions obtained when police \u201cinitiate\u201d renewed custodial interrogation after such a request. The Supreme Court has stated quite clearly that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards are relevant only when an in-custody accused is subjected to interrogation. \u201c \u2018Interrogation\u2019 \u201d means \u201cany words or actions . . . that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 15, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>186 Conn. 437, 443, 441 A.2d 857 (1982). The per se rule suggested by the defendant would negate the holding in <em>Innis </em>by forbidding any conversation initiated by police after a request for counsel whether or not \u201clikely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d But the majority in <em>Edwards </em>was careful to disavow any intention to overrule the interrogation requirement of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>supra, stating: \u201cThe Fifth Amendment right identified in <em>Miranda </em>is the right to have counsel present at any custodial interrogation [absent which] . . . there would have been no infringement of the right that Edwards invoked . . . .\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The relevant inquiry when a defendant has clearly invoked his right to counsel is to ask, first, was there in fact <em>interrogation </em>and, second, did the police <em>initiate </em>it. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 490 (Powell, J., concurring in the result).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>It is unquestioned that Acquin was read the <em>Miranda </em>rights before any statement was taken, and it appears clear from the record that he understood those rights. It is also undisputed that he specifically requested an attorney at 5:45 p.m. (\u201cI think I\u2019m in trouble. I think I better get a lawyer.\u201d), and that he confessed several hours after that request. <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Miranda </em>require, therefore, that we examine two incidents which occurred after the defendant\u2019s request: (1) McDonnell\u2019s inquiries about whom the defendant wanted as an attorney; and (2) the events immediately following the arrival of Albert in Bethany, which immediately preceded the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Inquiries about Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">When Acquin said, \u201cI think I better get a lawyer,\u201d Hamila, who was questioning him, stopped immediately and reported the request to his superior, McDonnell. McDonnell proceeded to ask further questions of the defendant in an attempt to ascertain whom he wanted to represent him. McDonnell offered to call: Acquin\u2019s previous attorney, any other attorney, and the public defender. Acquin said he didn\u2019t want any of them. McDonnell then offered to find Acquin\u2019s brother, who he thought was \u201cin the building someplace\u201d and have him obtain an attorney. Again Acquin refused the offer, indicating that \u201che didn\u2019t want his brother to know that he was involved . . . .\u201d On further inquiry about how to find a lawyer, Acquin indicated that \u201cit wasn\u2019t really an attorney that he wanted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>it was just somebody that he could trust,\u201d and asked that Albert be present before he made a statement. Aequin told McDonnell \u201cthat as soon as Dr. Albert got there that he would tell... the truth about what happened the night before.\u201d McDonnell then ordered a search for Albert.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The questions asked by McDonnell were not interrogation. They were not of the kind likely to elicit an incriminating response. Rather, they were limited to information which would allow McDonnell to comply with the defendant\u2019s request for counsel by ascertaining who should be called. Questions of this type, when limited to finding the attorney of the suspect\u2019s choice, are not forbidden by <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny. The right to counsel is of little use to an accused if police are not allowed to ascertain whom to summon. McDonnell suggested several different ways for the defendant to obtain legal advice, and even offered to call the defendant\u2019s brother. Such carefully limited questions cannot reasonably be considered interrogation, and would be proper whether or not the defendant\u2019s request for counsel was \u201cequivocal.\u201d See <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>597 F.2d 513 (5th Cir. 1979) (en banc).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Albert arrived in Bethany at about 11:40 p.m., more than five hours after Aequin told McDonnell that he would \u201ctell the truth about what happened last night\u201d if Albert were present. The two met alone, very briefly, and then Albert called McDonnell back into the room. McDonnell was careful to explain that Albert was not an attorney, and that if Aequin said anything to Albert in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>McDonnell\u2019s presence, it could be used in court. McDonnell testified on direct examination to the ensuing conversation: \u201cI then asked Lome Aequin: do you want to tell us what happened last night. And, he said: no, I don\u2019t want to tell you. ... I said: well, I thought you said when Dr. Albert got here that you would tell us the truth about what happened last night. And, he said: well, what I mean is, it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want to tell you, I want you to ask me questions, I can\u2019t go through it all again. So, I asked him questions.\u201d A detailed confession followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\"><em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, holds that confessions obtained after a request for counsel are inadmissible if they are the result of renewed custodial interrogation \u201cinitiated\u201d by the police. In <em>Edwards, </em>the defendant was arrested for robbery, burglary and murder, advised of his rights, and then questioned about the crimes. After giving a statement presenting an alibi defense, Edwards sought to make a deal. He then stated: \u201c \u2018I want an attorney before making a deal.\u2019 \u201d Police immediately ceased all questioning, and Edwards was locked up. The next morning, two detectives came to the jail and asked to see Edwards, who told the guard that he did not want to talk to anyone. The guard replied that \u201c \u2018he had\u2019 \u201d to talk to them, and took him to an interrogation room where he was played a recording of an \u201calleged accomplice who had implicated him\u201d in the crimes. Edwards then gave a second statement which incriminated him. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 478-79. It was the second statement which was excluded by the Supreme Court decision in <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We have already indicated that we do <em>not </em>read <em>Edwards </em>to prescribe a per se rule that a confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>which follows <em>any </em>conversation initiated by police after a request for counsel must be suppressed. We agree with Justice Powell, concurring in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 488-492, that \u201cfew cases will be as clear as <em>[Edwards]. </em>Communications between police and a suspect in custody are commonplace. It is useful to contrast the circumstances of this case with typical, and permissible, custodial communications between police and a suspect who has asked for counsel. For example, police do not impermissibly \u2018initiate\u2019 renewed interrogation by engaging in routine conversations with suspects about unrelated matters. And police legitimately may inquire whether a suspect has changed his mind about speaking to them without an attorney. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>32 Ore. App. 61, 65, 573 P.2d 326, 327 (1978); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Crisler, </em>285 N.W.2d 679, 682 (Minn. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marcum, </em>24 Wash. App. 441, 445-446, 601 P.2d 975, 978 (1979).\u201d Id., 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Unquestionably, the defendant invoked his right to counsel. \u201cI think I better get a lawyer\u201d could hardly be more clear; however, subsequent legitimate questions to find out whom he wanted showed that the request was not as unequivocal as it appears to be on its face. Acquin stated, among other things, that \u201cit wasn\u2019t really an attorney that he wanted, it was just somebody that he could trust. He wanted to sit and have somebody sitting with us that he trusted before he had any further conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We note in this regard Fifth Circuit cases which foreshadowed the decision in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, and which the <em>Edwards </em>majority approved: \u201cThe rule in the Fifth Circuit is that a knowing and intelligent waiver cannot be found once the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Amendment right to counsel has been clearly invoked unless the accused initiates the renewed contact. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>550 F.2d 300 ([5th Cir.] 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>409 F.2d 491 ([5th Cir.] 1969). Waiver is possible, however, when the request for counsel is equivocal. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>597 F.2d 513 ([5th Cir.] 1979) (en banc). See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>601 F.2d 768 ([5th Cir.] 1979).\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 486 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>597 F.2d 513 (5th Cir. 1979) (en banc), in upholding the admission of a confession, the court stated: \u201cWhen police stop interrogation as required [after a request for counsel], admissions that later come at the initiative of a suspect are subject to the traditional analysis for voluntariness.... The same principle governs when ... a suspect who has been informed of his rights expresses both a desire for counsel and a desire to continue the interview without counsel. Where the suspect\u2019s desires are expressed in such an equivocal fashion, it is permissible for the questioning official to make further inquiry to clarify the suspect\u2019s wishes.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 517. In <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>supra, the accused, Nash, was advised of his rights prior to questioning. His \u201cequivocal\u201d request for counsel began unequivocally: \u201cNash: Well, I don\u2019t have the money to hire one, but I would like, you know, to have one appointed. [Prosecutor] Files: You want one to be appointed for you? Nash: Yes, sir.\u201d Id., 516. The relevant dialogue is quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Thompson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>601 F.2d 768 (5th Cir. 1979), also cited in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, the Fifth Circuit clarified the rule: \u201c[W]henever even an equivocal request for an attorney is made by a suspect during custodial interrogation, the scope of that interrogation is immediately narrowed to one subject and one only. <em>Further questioning thereafter must be limited to clarifying that request </em>until it <em>is </em>clarified. When and if it is clarified as a present desire for the assistance of legal counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>all </em>interrogation must cease . . . (Emphasis in original.) <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra, 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We believe that <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>must be read to include this common-sense Fifth Circuit rule, which was implicitly approved by the majority, and specifically stated in Justice Powell\u2019s concurring opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In the case before us, the defendant\u2019s request for counsel was more \u201cequivocal\u201d than Nash\u2019s. Although, like Nash, Acquin clearly asked for counsel, he also rejected every suggestion for obtaining an attorney, including talking to his own brother. Instead he stated that he would \u201ctell the truth\u201d if the police allowed Albert to be there. The trial court found that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s request for counsel was indecisive and under the circumstances Captain McDonnell was correct in making an inquiry into whether the suspect did or did not want counsel present.\u201d The record amply supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s request was \u201cindecisive\u201d and therefore equivocal. We cannot therefore say that this conclusion is clearly erroneous under the well-established standard of factual review. Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u00a7 3060D; <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 392, 441 A.2d 629 (1982); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The finding of indecisiveness alone, however, does not settle the question of admissibility of the confession. This exception to the general rule of <em>Edwards </em>is very narrowly circumscribed. The facts of this case demonstrate the limits of the inquiry which can be made. McDonnell limited his clarifying questions carefully to the subject of whom Aequin wanted as his counsel. No question implied in any way that the request might be denied, or that it would be advisable to talk before obtaining counsel. Five hours passed before Albert arrived. McDonnell then told Aequin that the doctor was there and asked whether he still wanted to see him and to give a statement. The defendant answered affirmatively. Albert and Aequin conferred alone, then Albert called McDonnell in. McDonnell again explained the legal consequences of making a statement<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and then asked whether Aequin wanted to tell them what happened the night before. When Aequin said \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you,\u201d McDonnell expressed his confusion, whereupon Aequin explained \u201c [w] ell, what I mean is ... I don\u2019t want to tell you, I want you to ask me questions . . . .\u201d This clarification from the defendant indicated his desire to talk. The scope of questioning here compares favorably with that of the prosecutor in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>supra, 516. The inquiries of McDonnell were limited to those necessary to clarify the defendant\u2019s equivocation and to ascertain that he was aware of the consequences of giving a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The defendant\u2019s confession was not obtained in violation of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, because his request for counsel was equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s confession is not made inadmissible solely because he had previously asked for an attorney does not end the inquiry. The trial court correctly stated that \u201c[t]he next question is whether the defendant \u2018voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently\u2019 waived his rights. The state has a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of demonstrating that the suspect\u2019s constitutional rights have been respected. <em>State </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>29 Conn. Sup. 423, 432 [290 A.2d 593 (1972)]. Waiver has been defined as \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>[Zerbst], </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 ... 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L. Ed. 1461, 1466 [1938]. This standard is applied to an in-custody interrogation. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 475.\u201d A finding of waiver involves two interrelated factual determinations: (1) did the defendant understand his rights; and (2) did he voluntarily relinquish them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>183 Conn. 280, 284, 439 A.2d 330 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 157-58, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980); <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra. The trial court in its discretion makes these determinations, but that discretion must be \u201cexercised in accordance with constitutional standards of due process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>supra, 162-63. The trial court found, and the record indicates, that the defendant was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings five times, that he understood his rights, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>neither threats nor physical force were used on the defendant. Moreover, the defendant had been arrested and advised of his rights several times before. One of the unusual facts of this case is that Albert, a professional psychiatrist who was called to the scene at the defendant\u2019s request, was present during the events leading up to the confession. He witnessed the entire confession, and testified that in his opinion the defendant \u201cseemed collected,\u201d and understood the meaning of the warnings given to him. Albert also stated that the confession was given \u201cspontaneously\u201d and that he felt the defendant had a psychological need to tell the story. Aequin also indicated twice that he wanted to tell the truth, but that he just wanted somebody he could trust (Albert) to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We cannot say that, on the basis of the evidence before it, the trial court erred in concluding that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to counsel and to remain silent. There is simply no evidence that the circumstances were such as to \u201c \u2018overbear . . . [the accused\u2019s] will to resist ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>149 Conn. 640, 653, 183 A.2d 612 (1962); <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">On the basis of the foregoing we conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting the defendant\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The Hearsay Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">At trial the defendant offered in evidence a signed written statement given to a state policeman by John Ricciuti, owner of a bar which the defendant had visited the night of the murders. Ricciuti, a fugitive from New Jersey authorities, could not be located and was unavailable to testify. The statement indicated that the defendant was not drunk at 1 a.m., and therefore contradicted the testimony of Deborah Veilleux that the defendant had slurred speech and \u201cwalked kind of staggered.\u201d The court refused to admit the Ricciuti statement on the ground that it was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Unquestionably the statement was hearsay, and therefore admissible only if permitted under some exception to the rule. <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>157 Conn. 561, 563, 254 A.2d 904 (1969); see Tait &amp; LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence (1976) c. 11. The defendant has not shown or even argued that the Ricciuti statement comes within any exception recognized in Connecticut. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 630, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L.

Moreover, here, the trial court specifically found that \u201cthere was no evidence that the circumstances surrounding the statement provide any sanction for ascertaining its truth . . .\u201d; that is, the trial court did not find it trustworthy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nothing before us indicates that this determination was an abuse of discretion, and we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Challenge to the Jury Array</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The jury array from which the jury panel was chosen in this case was 44.82 percent female, while 52.69 percent of registered voters in New Haven County were female, a difference of 7.87 percent. The defendant, after presenting only these facts to the trial court, moved to dismiss the jury panel on the ground that the array from which it was selected was not a fair cross-section of the community. The trial court denied the motion, stating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>difference was statistically significant but that it did not constitute in any way an unrepresentative or unfair cross-section of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201cIn order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frasier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 216-17, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), quoting <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The defendant presented no evidence whatsoever to show that this underrepresentation was due to systematic exclusion of the group. <em>State </em>v. <em>Frasier, </em>supra, 218. Therefore, he failed to make the required prima facie showing, and there was no error in the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-12\"> The court, however, did suppress evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood type obtained from a urine sample.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\"> It should be noted that where there is an illegal seizure it is also necessary that the acquisition of the evidence sought to be suppressed be causally related to the illegal seizure. <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 157-58, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S.

Because we hold below that the defendant was not in custody during the 9:30 a.m. interview, we need not decide what the legal effect of this elaboration on <em>Miranda </em>may be, but we cannot condone any attempt by officers to explain away the import of the fundamental constitutional rights contained in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> The defendant stresses the fact that Paolino stated that the taillights she saw were round, and that the taillights of the Bambler were rectangular.

But the mistakes must be those of reasonable [persons], acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability. The rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these often opposing interests [of individual rights versus community protection].

I asked him who he wanted. And, there were very long pauses before he would respond to my questions. And, then he said he didn\u2019t know; asked him: did he have anyone in particular in mind. He said no. I asked him: how about the attorney that you had last time. And, he told me that he didn\u2019t trust that attorney and he didn\u2019t want him. I asked him\u2014told him that: was there anybody else, another attorney. He said no, there wasn\u2019t another attorney that he wanted or trusted. I asked\u2014 Then I told him: if he couldn\u2019t pick an attorney that I would make calls and get a publie defender or the state would provide an attorney for him. And, he replied to that that he didn\u2019t want the attorney that we\u2014that I would call. He said: it would be just like talking to another cop. He didn\u2019t want any attorney that we choose. I then asked him about his family.

He wanted to sit and have somebody sitting with us that he trusted before he had any further conversation. And, I asked him who that, you know\u2014is there sueh a person, who can we get for you. And, he suggested a Dr. Albert, who I was not familiar with and didn\u2019t know who he was. And, I asked who he was and how he knew him.

He was calling him either a shrink or a head doctor or something like that, but wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was an attorney. And, I told him that, you know, that Dr. Albert couldn\u2019t play the part of an attorney if, in fact, he wasn\u2019t an attorney. And, Acquin just kept saying that he wasn\u2019t really concerned about that, what he wanted was somebody to sit in that he could trust and be with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">Q. Did he say he trusted Dr. Albert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-13\">A. He said he trusted a Dr. Albert very, very much. In fact, he said that, while this conversation was going on, that he had told me and Dr. Albert some things that we were the only two he had ever told, he hadn\u2019t even told some of his family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-14\">Q. And, how long did this conversation go on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-15\">A. Well, from the time I went in the room until I came out and told Shay\u2014I would say from a half to three quarters of an hour or so. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-16\">Q. After he said he wanted to see Dr. Albert, what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-17\">A. Well, that is when I told Shay to make arrangements to find Dr. Albert.

I had already inquired of that fact, that Dr. Albert\u2014found out he was not an attorney and that he couldn\u2019t act in the capacity of an attorney.

This rule is also in accord with the decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>626 S.W.2d 25 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1981). There, the police stopped questioning when the defendant requested counsel. On his way to the holding cell, however, the defendant stopped to talk with his girlfriend. The escorting officer \u201cheard her informing appellant he should tell the truth. [The officer then] asked appellant if he wanted to talk about it or go ahead to the detention area.\u201d Id., 29. The court held that \u201c[t]hese facts cannot be equated with a resumption of the interrogation as condemned by <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> See footnote 7, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\"> The defendant also claims that his confession was illegally obtained because at approximately 6:30 p.m. McDonnell \u201casked him [Aequin]: what other scratches he had beside the one[s] I can see on his face and his arms.\u201d Aequin responded by dropping his trousers to show a scratch or burn mark on his thigh.

First, as outlined above, the request for counsel was equivocal and, therefore, did not bar all further questions. Second, there was no causal connection between the \u201cscratches\u201d question and the confession made more than five hours later after Albert had arrived and spoken to Aequin. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 488-92 (Powell, J., concurring in the result); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 107-11, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L.
