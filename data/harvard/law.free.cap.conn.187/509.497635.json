On June 30, 1980, the case was dismissed on the trial court\u2019s own motion under \u00a7 251 of the Practice Book for the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>prosecute with due diligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2The plaintiffs did not appeal from this dismissal within the twenty day appeal period <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>see Practice Book \u00a7 3007; nor was the appeal period stayed by the plaintiffs\u2019 filing of a motion during the appeal period \u201cwhich, if granted, would render the judgment or decision ineffective.\u201d Id. On August 8, 1980, after expiration of the appeal period, the plaintiffs, filed a motion \u201cto open [\u00a7] 251 dismissal.\u201d This motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>was denied by the trial court on October 3, 1980.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 22, 1980, the plaintiffs appealed from this denial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jurisdictional statement on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal form indicates clearly that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal was taken only from the denial on October 3, 1980, of the motion \u201cto open [\u00a7] 251 dismissal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Before we can reach the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, however, it is necessary for us to consider the threshold question of whether their appeal is taken from a final judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court may hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal only if the denial of their motion \u201cto open [\u00a7] 251 dismissal\u201d is a final judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 3000; General Statutes \u00a7 52-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 motion \u201cto open [\u00a7] 251 dismissal\u201d is a motion to restore the case to the docket. See <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Gachim, </em>183 Conn. 413, 416, 439 A.2d 379 (1981) ; <em>Snow </em>v. Calise, 174 Conn. 567, 570, 392 A.2d 440 (1978) ; <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>92 Conn. 649, 652, 103 A. 940 (1918). Such a motion, if filed within the twenty day appeal period, stays the expiration of the appeal period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>until twenty days after the issuance of notice of the decision on the motion. Practice Book \u00a7 3007; <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Gachim, </em>supra; <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>supra; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>134 Conn. 198, 201, 56 A.2d 171 (1947) ; <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Rosoff, </em>120 Conn. 120, 122, 179 A. 407 (1935) ; <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>supra; <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>75 Conn. 541, 544-45, 54 A. 204 (1903) ; <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 526, 535, 30 A. 775 (1894). But the decision on a motion to restore a case to the docket is not itself appealable. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Gachim, </em>supra; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Rosoff, </em>supra; <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 15 n.21; see <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>supra; <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Riverbank Motors Corporation, </em>154 Conn. 289, 292, 224 A.2d 716 (1966); <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>supra. Because the plaintiffs have appealed from a decision which is not appealable, their appeal must be dismissed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-4\">This case has the unusual procedural feature of being dismissed twice. The second dismissal of the ease was entered on July 1, 1980, the day after the first dismissal. The second dismissal resulted from the granting of the defendants\u2019 motion for nonsuit based on the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with a discovery order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\"> The plaintiffs suggest that the \u00a7 251 dismissal was not final when it was entered, and thus not immediately appealable, because it could be opened within four months under \u00a7 326 of the Practice Book. This suggestion has been previously considered by this court and found to be without merit. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>134 Conn. 198, 200-201, 56 A.2d 171 (1947). The fact that the trial court has the power to open a judgment; see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7326, 377 ; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-212a, 52-212; does not mean that the judgment is not final for purposes of appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3000, 3007 ; General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>169 Conn. 154, 159-60, 362 A.2d 831 (1975) ; <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn., </em>156 Conn. 61, <em>64-65, </em>238 A.2d 393 (1968) ; <em>Wells Laundry </em>&amp; <em>Linen Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Acme Fast Freight, Inc., </em>138 Conn. 458, 463-64, 85 A.2d 907 (1952). If the appropriate motion to open is made within the appeal period, the expiration of that period is stayed until twenty days after the issuance of notice of the decision on the motion. Practice Book \u00a7 3007. If no such motion is made, the appeal period expires twenty days from the issuance of notice of the judgment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">It is well established that a dismissal under \u00a7 251 is a final judgment for purposes of appeal. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra; <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn., </em>supra; <em>Wells Laundry &amp; Linen Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Acme Fast Freight, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Rosoff, </em>120 Conn. 120, 122, 179 A. 407 (1935) ; <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Shore Line Electric Ry. Co., </em>84 Conn. 24, 31, 78 A. 587 (1911) ; <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>75 Conn. 541, 544-45, 54 A. 204 (1903).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\"> The plaintiffs also moved, on October 29, 1980, to open the second dismissal. See footnote 1, supra. On November 12, 1980, the trial court declined to render a decision on this motion because the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the denial of their motion \u201cto open [\u00a7] 251 dismissal\u201d was pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> The plaintiffs subsequently amended their appeal to include in their claim the trial court\u2019s refusal to decide their motion to open the second dismissal. See footnotes 1 and 3, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged this at oral argument before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> We raise this question by our own motion. The defendants originally raised this question in a motion to dismiss filed October 31, 1980. On December 2, 1980, we denied this motion. After a review of the case upon full briefing, however, we have concluded that it is necessary to reconsider our jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This conclusiou makes it unnecessary for us to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in their amended appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to decide their motion to open the second dismissal. See footnotes 1, 3, and <em>4, </em>supra. The conclusion reached above indicates that the first dismissal stands. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the trial court\u2019s refusal to decide their motion to open the second dismissal is rendered moot. The amended appeal, therefore, also must be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
