Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEi\">This case raises issues arising out of the bailor-bailee relationship of the parties. On October 26, 1953, the plaintiff Julia Griffin delivered certain goods to the defendant Nationwide Moving and Storage Company, Inc. to be stored, for a valuable consideration, in the defendant\u2019s warehouse. The defendant placed and kept these goods in its warehouse located on Donald Street in Hartford.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 1972, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>wrote to the plaintiff stating that it was pleased to announce that \u201cyour goods will be safely stored in our new 54,000 square foot warehouse. . . . The new address will be 100 Peters Road, Bloomfield, Connecticut.\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That letter also informed her that the monthly storage rate was being increased. On or about August 1, 1973, the plaintiff made demand upon the defendant for the return of her property stored with the defendant and was informed that the property had been destroyed in a fire which had also destroyed the Donald Street warehouse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action to recover the value of the goods. From the judgment awarding damages to the plaintiff, the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred: (1) in concluding that the defendant failed to rebut the presumption of negligence arising from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>its failure to deliver the bailed property to the plaintiff upon her demand; (2) in concluding that certain provisions on the warehouse receipt given to the plaintiff did not validly limit the defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff; and (3) in determining the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in concluding that the defendant failed to rebut the presumption of negligence arising from its failure to redeliver the bailed property to the plaintiff upon her demand. The defendant argues that while the court applied the correct law, it applied it to the evidence in a manner that was \u201cnot consistent with the established precedent.\u201d It also maintains that the presumption of negligence should not have benefited the plaintiff, upon the defendant\u2019s proof \u201cof the actual circumstances of the loss, the human conduct, if any, which materially contributed to the loss, and the precautions taken to prevent the loss.\u201d See <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>153 Conn. 219, 225, 215 A.2d 123 (1965) ; <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Poppel &amp; Sons Service Station, Inc., </em>142 Conn. 598, 603, 115 A.2d 655 (1955); <em>Leake &amp; Nelson Co. </em>v. <em>W. J. Megin, Inc., </em>142 Conn. 99, 102-103, 111 A.2d 559 (1955) ; <em>Frissell </em>v. <em>John W. Rogers, Inc., </em>141 Conn. 308, 312, 106 A.2d 162 (1954). We conclude that the trial court correctly applied the law to the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">It is undisputed that the relationship between the parties is that of bailor and bailee. \u201cThe failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of a bailee to return goods delivered to him raises a presumption that their nonproduetion is due to his negligence. <em>Dejon </em>v. <em>Smedley Co., </em>108 Conn. 659, 667, 144 A. 473 [1929].\u201d <em>Frissell </em>v. <em>John W. Rogers, Inc., </em>supra, 310; see <em>Barnett Motor Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Cummins Diesel Engines of Connecticut, Inc., </em>162 Conn. 59, 63, 291 A.2d 234 (1971); <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 225. \u201c \u2018This presumption prevails unless and until the bailee proves the actual circumstances involved in the damaging of the property. If those circumstances are proved, then the burden is upon the bailor to satisfy the court that the bailee\u2019s conduct in the matter constituted negligence. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Paramount Petroleum &amp; Products Co., </em>101 Conn. 238, 242, 125 A. 617 [1924] ; <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>Amodeo, </em>118 Conn. 58, 63, 170 A. 486 [1934]. The circumstances which the bailee must prove must be something more than those indicating the immediate cause of the damage. The proof must go so far as to establish what, if any, human conduct materially contributed to that immediate cause. <em>Frissell </em>v. <em>John W. Rogers, Inc., </em>[supra, 312].\u2019 <em>Leake &amp; Nelson Co. </em>v. <em>W. J. Megin, Inc., </em>[supra, 102]. \u2018 \u201cThe isolated fact of destruction by fire or of loss by theft rebuts nothing. The bailee must prove something more if he is to overcome the presumption. He must prove the actual circumstances connected with the origin of the fire or the theft, and these include the precautions taken to prevent the loss.\u201d <em>Frissell </em>v. <em>John W. Rogers, Inc., </em>[supra, 311].\u2019 <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Poppel &amp; Sons Service Station, Inc., </em>[supra, 604].\u201d <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 225. In <em>Barnett Motor Transportation, </em>we held that the presumption in favor of the bailor continues \u201cuntil the bailee not only produces <em>substantial contravening evidence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>but proves the actual circumstances involved in the loss of the property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Barnett Motor Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Cummins Diesel Engines of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 64. Whether the bailee has proved the actual circumstances of the loss and rebutted the presumption of negligence in that the bailee has taken reasonable precautions under the circumstances is a question of fact for the trier. <em>Barnett Motor Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Cummins Diesel Engines of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Lissie </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>33 Conn. Sup. 540, 545, 359 A.2d 187 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The defendant\u2019s proof of the mere fact of destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s goods by fire rebutted nothing. See <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 225. The facts, as found by the court, demonstrate that the defendant did not prove the actual circumstances of <em>the </em>fire which destroyed the warehouse in which the plaintiff\u2019s goods were stored. The court found that the defendant kept the plaintiff\u2019s goods in a warehouse which had been the scene of previous fires and which was located in an area that had been experiencing considerable civil unrest for more than a year after it notified the plaintiff that her goods would be moved to a new warehouse in Bloomfield.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At best, the defendant\u2019s evidence about the cause of the fire which destroyed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s goods was vague.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s vice president testified that the Donald Street warehouse was destroyed by fire. He was then asked by his attorney when it was so destroyed and he answered: \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t say destroyed by fire. We had fires and robberies in the Donald Street warehouse up until the day we physically moved out. Then it was completely destroyed after we left, which was a vacant building.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s evidence on this issue, even if credited, hardly proved the actual circumstances of the loss so as to rebut the presumption of negligence under our cases. Having recognized the safety problem in the Hartford location by arranging for a new warehouse in Bloomfield, the defendant did not take the precaution of actually moving the plaintiff\u2019s goods to that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in concluding that certain provisions on the warehouse receipt given to the plaintiff at the time of the bailment did not validly limit its liability to her. Specifically, it argues that the work order and the warehouse receipt, both of which the plaintiff received,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> contained language which limited its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>liability for loss or damage of the goods stored.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant elaims that the trial court erred in finding that because the plaintiff was unaware of the limitation of liability clauses on the work order and the warehouse receipt, these provisions did not become part of the bailment contract between the parties. It further elaims that, under the circumstances, the plaintiff should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>deemed to <em>have </em>assented to the limitation of liability provisions which were part of the bailment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The law does not favor contract provisions which relieve a person from his own negligence. See generally 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7195, comment b; 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 188, 189; 78 Am. Jur. 2d, Warehouses \u00a7 232; 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments \u00a7\u00a7 139-141. Such provisions, however, have been upheld under proper circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Santora, </em>135 Conn. 286, 293, 64 A.2d 51 (1949) ; <em>Willard Van Dyke Productions, </em>Inc. v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>12 N.Y.2d 301, 304, 189 N.E.2d 693 (1963) (involving contract clause limiting liability in processing film); <em>Neece v. Richmond Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>246 N.C. 547, 99 S.E.2d 756 (1957); see also 68 A.L.R.2d 1341. Parties to a bailment may generally provide by their contract of bailment for relief from liability of the bailee for loss or damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Samelson v. Harper\u2019s Furs, Inc., </em>144 Conn. 368, 373, 131 A.2d 827 (1957) ; see <em>Malone v. Santora, </em>supra; <em>Carter v. Reichlin Furriers, </em>34 Conn. Sup. 661, 664\u201465, 386 A.2d 647 (1977); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments \u00a7\u00a7 139, 142; 17 C.J.S., Contracts \u00a7 262. We have held that the right of a bailee to limit his liability by special contract does not extend to relieve him wholly against his own negligence, for to do so would be against public policy. <em>Malone v. Santora, </em>supra; see also <em>New England Fruit &amp; Produce Co. v. Hines, </em>97 Conn. 225, 234, 116 A. 243 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Whether a particular provision forms part of a contract is ordinarily a factual question for the trier. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Reichlin Furriers, </em>supra, 665. The assent of both parties is necessary to the special provisions limiting liability of the bailee. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>James, </em>109 Conn. 365, 370, 146 A.2d 614 (1929); see 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments \u00a7 147. There is no claim here of an express assent to such an agreement in this case. However, \u201can actual \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 would not be required if, under all the circumstances, the plaintiff\u2019s conduct would warrant a reasonable belief that she had assented to the terms of the [warehouse receipt and work order which she received and had in her possession during the years] .... <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Hartford Public Library, </em>119 Conn. 428, 433 [177 A. 269 (1935)]; <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Swirsky, </em>103 Conn. 624, 633 [131 A. 420 (1925)] ; <em>Hartford Distillery Co. </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>97 Conn. 1, 6 [115 A. 488 (1921)].\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Reichlin Furriers, </em>supra, 665 ; see also <em>Brown Bros. Electrical Contractors Co. </em>v. <em>Beam Construction Corporation, </em>41 N.Y.2d 397, 361 N.E.2d 999 (1977); 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 21. In other words, the existence of a binding contract limiting the defendant\u2019s liability, as claimed, is not dependent upon the subjective intent of the parties. <em>Brown Bros. Electrical Contractors Co. </em>v. <em>Beam Construction Corporation, </em>supra, 399; see also <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>National City Bank of New York, </em>200 F. 287, 293 (S.D.N.Y. 1911), aff'd, 201 F. 664 (2d Cir. 1912), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>National City Bank </em>v. <em>Hotchkiss, </em>231 U.S. 50, 34 S. Ct. 20, 58 L. Ed. 115 (1913). When the evidence is examined to determine whether the circumstances generated such a contract \u201cdisproportionate emphasis is not to be put on any single act, phrase or other expression, but instead, on the totality of all of these, given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>attendant circumstances, the situation of the parties, and the objectives they were striving to attain . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Brown Bros. Electrical Contractors Co. </em>v. <em>Beam Construction Corporation, </em>supra, 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In this case, the trial court found that the plaintiff was unaware of the limitations of liability printed on both the warehouse receipt and the work order. There is authority for the view that even where the bailor does not sign the receipt containing the limitation of liability clause or expressly assent to its terms, he may still be bound because such acts can be deemed to be immaterial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 78 Am. Jur. 2d, Warehouses \u00a7236. Although courts have tended to recognize that limitation of liability clauses for negligence may be validly contracted for by an ordinary bailee, they have demonstrated a strong tendency to hold contracts of this type against public policy when entered into by bailees in the course of dealing with the general public. 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments \u00a7 145. Such bailees, who have been termed \u201cprofessional\u201d bailees, as differentiated from \u201cordinary\u201d bailees, are those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>make it their principal business to act as bailees and who deal with the public largely \u201con a uniform and not an individual basis. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bailments \u00a7 145; see <em>Miller\u2019s Mutual Fire Ins. Assn. v. Parker, </em>234 N.C. 20, 24, 65 S.E.2d 341 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The argument against enforcing such limitation of liability clauses in most cases is that such \u201cprofessional\u201d bailees impose predetermined conditions upon bailors whose bargaining power lacks parity with such bailees. See, e.g., <em>Miller\u2019s Mutual Fire Ins. Assn. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra; 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 208. On the other hand, recent authority also distinguishes between a bailor who possesses experience and sophistication in such matters and one who is merely a member of the public. <em>World Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Freight Service, Inc., </em>222 F. Sup. 849, 852 (D.N.J. 1963); <em>Muelder </em>v. <em>Western Greyhound Lines, </em>8 Cal. App. 3d 319, 332, 87 Cal. Rptr. 297 (1970). \u201cIn Connecticut provisions exculpating a bailee or limiting his liability are not necessarily a part of the bailment contract in the absence of actual knowledge of them. <em>Nothnagle </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>139 Conn. 278, 281 [93 A.2d 165 (1952), aff\u2019d, 346 U.S. 128, 73 S. Ct. 986, 97 L. Ed. 1500 (1953)]; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>135 Conn. 286, 291 [64 A.2d 51 (1949)] ; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>James, </em>109 Conn. 365, 369 [146 A. 614 (1929)].\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Reichlin Furriers, </em>supra, 666. Under the facts of this case, the defendant warehouseman, a professional bailee, had the burden of proving actual knowledge on the part of the plaintiff or a justifiable belief on his part that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>such knowledge in order to be exculpated under the limitation of liability clauses in the documents involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The defendant does not claim that the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the limitation of liability provision but, rather, claims that her conduct would warrant a reasonable belief that she had assented to the terms of defendant\u2019s exculpatory provisions. We do not agree. The court credited, as it was entitled to, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that she was unaware of the limitation language on the warehouse receipt as well as the work order. The fact that she received a copy of the warehouse receipt, or for that matter a copy of the work order, does not compel the result claimed by the defendant. The plaintiff, at the time of the bailment to the defendant, a professional bailee for hire, was no more than a member of the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s conversation with an employee of the defendant on the condition of various items of her property listed on the warehouse receipt fuels its claim that the evidence, when reasonably viewed, demonstrates that she assented to the limitation. This claim lacks merit. This conversation occurred when, having received the receipt after she moved to Florida, the plaintiff called the employee of the defendant whose name appeared on the receipt. She was upset because some symbols next to certain items of her property listed thereon seemed to indicate to her that \u201cthey were just battered . . . .\u201d That conversation, including her reiteration of what the defendant\u2019s employee said to her at that time, moreover, disclosed nothing about any limitation of liability. There was no evidence that she read or was aware that the contents of that receipt con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tained any terms other than the list of items she had stored, the symbols referred to, and the name of the employee who signed it. There was no evidence that she ever read or had knowledge of the limitation of liability language in the work order even though she signed that form.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court\u2019s conclusion that the provisions seeking to limit the defendant\u2019s liability as a bailee did not become part of the. bailment contract was not clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error attacks the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiff. In attacking the amount of the award including the valuation of the items the plaintiff claims were destroyed, the defendant maintains that the amount of the award is unsupported by the evidence. In doing so, it alleges that \u201cthe damages were not proven by the Plaintiff, and determined by the trial court, with reasonable certainty.\u201d The defendant notes that the trial court indicated that it was aware of the escalating prices of silver.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It also argues that, in making its final determination, the trial court valued some items of silver equally with the values \u201cestablished by the Plaintiff\u2019s testimony\u201d but that the court\u2019s valuation of other items of silver was less than that testified to by the plaintiff and such decreases were not \u201cin any particular ratio or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>proportion.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As to the bailed items other than the silver pieces, the defendant also alleges some values were set at the same level as the plaintiff\u2019s testimony indicated, with others set at a level less than her testimony indicated and, again, not \u201cin accordance with any clear or standard method.\u201d On the other hand, the plaintiff, pointing out the unavailability of the bailed goods about which she testified, argues that the extent of her economic loss was presented with as much certainty as the circumstances of the ease permitted and that the amount of the award should stand.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u201c \u2018The measure of damages for conversion of the subject-matter of a bailment, or its loss through negligence of the bailee, is the value of the property at the time of its conversion or loss, with interest from that time, such value being fixed by the terms of the contract, if any, or, in the absence of contract, the market value. <em>Stoll v. Judd [Co.], </em>106 Conn. 551, 560, 138 Atl. 479 [1927] ; 6 Corpus Juris, 1164.\u2019 <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Torkomian, </em>107 Conn. 99, 100, 139 Atl. 506 [1927].\u201d <em>Beaudette and Graham </em>v. <em>Tator, </em>107 Conn. 712, 715, 142 A. 458 (1928).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>That damages may be difficult to assess is, in itself, insufficient reason for refusing them once the right to damages has been established. See <em>Ball </em>v. <em>T. J. Pardy Construction Co., </em>108 Conn. 549, 551, 143 A. 855 (1928). \u201cThere is no unbending rule as to the evidence by which damages are to be determined, but the object of the parties ought to be attained as nearly as possible.\u201d <em>Southern New England Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>165 Conn. 644, 661, 345 A.2d 550 (1974) ; see <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>164 Conn. 463, 468, 323 A.2d 553 (1973) ; <em>Bartolotta </em>v. <em>Calvo, </em>112 Conn. 385, 395, 152 A. 306 (1930) ; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>85 Conn. 212, 214, 82 A. 186 (1912). We recognize that there can be circumstances where the proof of damages may be difficult. Nevertheless, the \u201ccourt must have evidence by which it can calculate the damages, which is not merely subjective or speculative, but which allows for some objective ascertainment of the amount.\u201d <em>Bronson &amp; Townsend Co. </em>v. <em>Battistoni, </em>167 Conn. 321, 326-27, 355 A.2d 299 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Shortly after she learned of the loss, the plaintiff compiled a list of the items \u201cthat [she] could remember,\u201d the most important of which she had received as wedding gifts.

There was also evidence from her sister, who had run a dry goods store, who had given her a lot of the things she had stored in her hope chest which was included in the bailment to the defendant.

The trier is the judge of the credibility of all the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. <em>Riccio </em>v. <em>Abate, </em>176 Conn. 415, 418, 407 A.2d 1005 (1979) <em>; Raia </em>v. <em>Topehius, </em>165 Conn. 231, 235, 332 A.2d 93 (1973); <em>Giambartolomei </em>v. <em>Rocky DeCarlo &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>143 Conn. 468, 473, 123 A.2d 760 (1956). It is settled that the trier of fact has the right to accept part and disregard part of the testimony of a witness. <em>Rood </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>161 Conn. 1, 3, 283 A.2d 220 (1971) ; <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Pinto, </em>147 Conn. 109, 111, 157 A.2d 596 (1960); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Haggard, </em>141 Conn. 668, 674, 109 A.2d 358 (1954). \u201c\u2018That a witness testified to a fact without direct contradiction is not of itself sufficient; the trial court must be the judge of the credit to be given a witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sachem\u2019s Head Assn. </em>v. <em>Lufkin, </em>168 Conn. 365, 368, 362 A.2d 519 (1975); see <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>169 Conn. 85, 86, 362 A.2d 907 (1975) ; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Chicken Delight, Inc., </em>164 Conn. 317, 319, 321 A.2d 456 (1973). The trier is not bound by the opinion of value even where there is expert testimony. See <em>Investors Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Schiott, </em>143 Conn. 61, 65, 118 A.2d 897 (1955) ; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Haggard, </em>supra. This court cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 497, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975) ; <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 561, 316 A.2d 394 (1972). The items were, of course, not available, and indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>evidence of value was all that could be offered. See <em>Saporiti </em>v. <em>Austin A. Chambers Co., </em>supra, 479. From the very nature of the circumstances, the amount of the loss could not be proven with exactitude and all that is required is that the evidence, with such certainty as the nature of the particular case may permit, lay a foundation which will enable the trier to make a fair and reasonable estimate. See <em>Stern &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>International Harvester Co., </em>146 Conn. 42, 45-46, 147 A.2d 490 (1958) ; <em>Ball </em>v. <em>T. J. Pardy Construction Co., </em>supra, 551. In a ease such as this where the cause of the unavailability of the goods has been fixed, this serves to establish a reasonable basis in the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s award. Mindful that the plaintiff must prove her damages, we are aware that it is not enough that evidence be offered which could be credited and which, if credited, would be sufficient, because it is proof, and not merely evidence, that is required. Proof, of course, includes only evidence actually credited by the trier. See <em>Stern &amp; Co </em>v. <em>International Harvester Co., </em>supra, 46. We find that there was sufficient proof of damages in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"> In its brief the defendant argues that the trial court found, against the evidence, that the plaintiff\u2019s property was stored at the defendant\u2019s warehouse on Donald Street in Hartford rather than in another warehouse on Center Street in Hartford also owned by the defendant. This claim is without merit because, in its answer the defendant admitted, without qualification or later amendment, the paragraph of the complaint which alleged \u201c[t]he Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>placed and kept said goods in a Warehouse owned by it located at 9-11 Donald Street in Hartford.\u201d This judicial admission was conclusive on the defendant.
