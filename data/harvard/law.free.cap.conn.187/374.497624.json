J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHC\">In this action, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant tortionsly interfered with an employment contract between the plaintiff and her employer. The plaintiff has appealed from the summary judgment rendered for the defendant, claiming that the trial court erred in concluding that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The plaintiff in her complaint alleges that she had been employed since March, 1976 by David W. Mabee as a housekeeper and that she also provided various personal services and personal care for Mabee. She further alleges that the defendant, who was a long-time friend of the elderly Mabee, interfered with this employment contract by trying to dismiss the plaintiff on the purported authority of Mabee\u2019s power of attorney which was held by the defendant. She also alleges that the attempted dismissal was contrary to the express wishes of Mabee and that the power of attorney held by the defendant was invalid. The plaintiff claims, inter alia, both injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">After her complaint was filed, the plaintiff sought and obtained a temporary restraining order. An agreement between the parties continued the plaintiff\u2019s employment after the expiration of the temporary restraining order. Subsequently, conservators were appointed for Mabee and the plaintiff\u2019s employment apparently continued under their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s employer, David Mabee, died on June 4,1978. Thereafter, by way of special defense<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by a motion for summary judgment, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ant alleged that the ease has become moot because of the death of Mabee. The trial court, in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, apparently agreed that the case is moot. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its judgment, the trial court concluded that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The question before us is whether there remains a genuine issue as to any material fact after the death of the plaintiff\u2019s employer. We conclude that the case is not moot and that the summary judgment was erroneous because there is a genuine issue as to material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The death of the plaintiff\u2019s employer obviously renders moot any claim for additional injunctive relief, but the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages because of the defendant\u2019s previous alleged interference is not moot. A plaintiff may recover damages for tortious interference with a contract not only where the contract is thereby not performed; 4 Bestatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 <em>766</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but also where the interference causes the performance \u201cto be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>expensive or burdensome . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 766A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is not essential to the cause of action that the tort has resulted in an actual breach of contract.\u201d <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>169 Conn. 407, 415, 363 A.2d 86 (1975); see <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Feinberg, </em>130 Conn. 671, 674, 37 A.2d 355 (1944) ; <em>Skene </em>v. <em>Carayanis, </em>103 Conn. 708, 714, 131 A. 497 (1926). A plaintiff states an actionable cause by alleging that the defendant intentionally interfered with a business or contractual relationship of the plaintiff and that the plaintiff, as a result, has suffered an actual loss. <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In her complaint, the plaintiff alleges that \u201c[a]t diverse times during the course of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, the defendant interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s contractual relations with David W. Mabee, and with the plaintiff\u2019s ability to carry out her responsibilities under said contract of employment.\u201d That allegation, together with the claim for damages, is sufficient to state a eause of action for damages resulting from the defendant\u2019s alleged interference with the contract, which action is in no way affected by Mabee\u2019s subsequent death. The specifics of the damages which the plaintiff is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>claiming are given in the plaintiff\u2019s reply<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>defendant\u2019s special defense,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which is a part of the pleadings. These damages are also described in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. See 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 774A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">A motion for summary judgment may be granted only when there is no genuine issue as to material facts. Practice Book \u00a7 384.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages has not been mooted by the death of Mabee, there are material facts which are in genuine dispute. The summary judgment, therefore, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> The defendant\u2019s \u201cSpecial Defense\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">\u201c1.
