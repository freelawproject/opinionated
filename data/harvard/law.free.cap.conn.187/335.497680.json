Mac Buckley, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-10\"><em>Ernest J. Diette, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>John M. Bailey, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Herbert Appleton, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"As9\">The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in permitting the state to introduce relevant evidence in rebuttal which could have been introduced earlier in the state\u2019s case and which contradicted the defendant\u2019s testimony and other evidence presented by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">After a trial to a jury, the defendant was found guilty of violation of an act relating to dependency-producing drugs; General Statutes \u00a719-480 (a); and was sentenced to a term of not less than two nor more than five years. The defendant was accused of selling heroin to an undercover police officer, after having been introduced to the officer by an informant, a friend of the defendant. As part of the state\u2019s case, the police officer testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>sale took place in the kitchen of the house where the defendant had been temporarily residing, but that the informant had left the room before the transaction occurred specifically so the informant would not be a witness to the sale and consequently be in a position to have to testify as part of the state\u2019s case. As part of his defense, the defendant introduced the testimony of the defendant and his two sisters, all of whom had been outside the house washing cars and smoking marijuana when the informant and the police officer had arrived, who each testified that the three men never were in the kitchen together and that the informant had never left the presence of the defendant during the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">After the defense had rested, the trial court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, permitted the state to introduce the testimony of the informant in rebuttal. The informant had been available under subpoena in the lobby outside the courtroom throughout the trial. The state had offered his testimony \u201cfor the limited purpose of testifying in rebuttal as to whether or not he was present at the time.\u201d As grounds for objecting and taking an exception to the ruling, the defendant argued that the state could have called the informant during its case-in-chief, and therefore was precluded from introducing his testimony for the first time in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">On direct examination by the state, the informant testified that after the three men entered the kitchen, he left when the defendant reached into his pocket presumably for heroin. On cross-examination he testified that he left the room after the defendant took heroin out of his pocket. Other than this discrepancy, the informant corroborated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>testimony of the police officer. The defendant claims that the informant\u2019s testimony was exculpatory because it contradicted the testimony of the police officer which had been central to the state\u2019s case. If that testimony had been introduced during the state\u2019s case, the defendant contends that he \u201cmight very well have not elected\u201d to testify in his own defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based upon that alleged prejudice, the defendant claims to have been denied due process of law by the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The admission of rebuttal evidence is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>180 Conn. 589, 599, 430 A.2d 1306 (1980) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 299, 334 A.2d 468 (1973) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Leopold, </em>110 Conn. 55, 67, 147 A. 118 (1929). Ideally, rebuttal evidence is that which refutes the evidence presented by the defense, rather than that which merely bolsters the state\u2019s case, thus avoiding the possibility of jury confusion or unfairness to the defendant who has relied upon the case as presented. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Addazio, </em>169 Conn. 416, 427, 363 A.2d 153 (1975) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grayton, </em>163 Conn. 104, 110, 302 A.2d 246, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1045, 93 S. Ct. 542, 34 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>159 Conn. 296, 301, 268 A.2d 649 (1970) ; cf. <em>DiMaio </em>v. <em>Panico, </em>115 Conn. 295, 298-99, 161 A. 238 (1932). This court will affirm a trial court\u2019s admission of rebuttal evidence which would have been normally presented as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>case-in-cMef unless the party claiming error sustains his burden of establishing harmful error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaskin, </em>176 Conn. 220, 221, 405 A.2d 652 (1978) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Addazio, </em>supra, 427 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>88 Conn. 177, 183, 90 A. 225 (1914) ; see also <em>Belden </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>61 Conn. 173, 175, 23 A. 963 (1891); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 545-46, 442 A.2d 927 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The fact that the informant\u2019s testimony with respect to the moment of his departure from the kitchen contradicted the police officer\u2019s recollection is not exculpatory when considered in the context of the informant\u2019s other testimony which contradicted the defendant\u2019s version of the facts. Moreover, the defendant concedes that the state\u2019s offer of proof on rebuttal was made in good faith, was not intentionally misleading and offered relevant rebuttal evidence. Neither the state nor the trial court knew that the testimony would not conform to the offer of proof. The defendant\u2019s speculation that if the police officer\u2019s credibility had been drawn into question by the informant\u2019s testimony during the state\u2019s case, then the defendant might not have testified, does not meet his burden of establishing harmful error, and hence an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> The defendant testified that he had three prior felony convictions and had served time in prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> We note that the defendant did not believe himself to be sufficiently prejudiced at trial so as to move for a mistrial; Practice Book \u00a7 887; but that he did incorporate the present claim of error into a motion for acquittal after the jury returned the verdict; Practice Book \u00a7 899; which motion the trial court denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
