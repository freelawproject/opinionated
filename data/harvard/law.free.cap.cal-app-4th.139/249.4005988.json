Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under a categorical exemption for urban in-fill development projects set forth in the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Guidelines) adopted by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency (the Secretary).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Guidelines, \u00a7 15332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Real parties in interest and respondents, developers Mi Arbolito, LLC, and 1700 Investors, LLC, and architect Martinez + Cutri Corporation (collectively, the Developer) propose to construct a 14-unit, 14-story multifamily residential building at 3415 Sixth Avenue in San Diego, with underground parking (the Project). The site of the Project is a 10,247-square-foot vacant lot located on the northeast comer of Sixth Avenue and Upas Street, which is zoned for multiresidential use. Across the street from the Project is the north west comer of Balboa Park\u2014an approximately 1,100-acre developed urban park containing theaters, museums, restaurants and other public facilities. Approximately one block away from the Project, on Seventh Avenue, is the historic Marston House, a designated historical landmark, with other historic residences nearby. Directly to the east of the lot, on Upas Street, is a high-rise condominium building referred to as Del Prado, which is approximately the same height as the building proposed for the Project, but three and a half times as wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The Developer first proposed the Project to the City in March 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In November 2003, the City approved a shoring and grading permit, authorizing the Developer to begin site preparation work, including excavation for the parking garage. Approximately two months later, in January 2004, the City issued a building permit for pad footings for the building\u2019s underground parking garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Appellant Banker\u2019s Hill, Hillcrest, Park West Community Preservation Group (the Preservation Group) filed a petition for a writ of mandate, alleging that the City had violated CEQA by approving the Project without conducting an environmental review under CEQA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In March 2004, the trial court denied the Preservation Group\u2019s application for preliminary injunctive relief on the basis, among others, that the City was in the process of considering what kind of environmental review to undertake for the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">After preliminary discussions between the Developer and the City staff regarding CEQA\u2019s application to the Project, the Developer submitted a formal request to the City on March 26, 2004, for a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>exemption from CEQA. On March 29, 2004, the City\u2019s Development Services Department issued a notice of exemption pursuant to CEQA section 21152(b). The notice of exemption stated that the Project is exempt from CEQA for two separate reasons. First, the Project requires only ministerial approval by the City, and thus is exempt under CEQA section 21080(b)(1) and Guidelines section 15268, which exempt ministerial approvals from CEQA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the Project is an urban in-fill development project, and thus is exempt from CEQA under Guidelines section 15332.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The Preservation Group appealed the notice of exemption to the City Council. (See CEQA, \u00a7 21151(c).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on further investigation, the City Manager submitted a report to the City Council, which recommended that the City Council deny the appeal. Because of evidence that the Project may end up being constructed as a condominium project, the City Manager did not recommend that the City Council find the Project to be exempt on the ground that it would require only ministerial approvals. Instead, the City Manager recommended that the City Council rely solely on the exemption for urban in-fill development under Guidelines section 15332.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Following a public hearing, the City Council denied the appeal and enacted a resolution stating that \u201cthe Project meets the conditions described in State Guidelines section 15332 and therefore qualifies for a categorical exemption and ... no exceptions as described in [Guidelines] section 15300.2 apply to the Project.\u201d The resolution makes specific findings regarding zoning, traffic, noise, air quality, and water quality, among other things. It states that \u201c[a]pproval of the Project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.\u201d Based on the resolution, the City filed a notice of exemption on October 8, 2004, citing the exemption for urban in-fill development in Guidelines section 15332.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Following the City Council\u2019s determination, the Preservation Group filed a second amended petition for writ of mandate on November 14, 2004. The trial court denied the petition, agreeing with the City that the Project is exempt from CEQA under Guidelines section 15332. On the basis, among others, that the issue had not been raised during the administrative proceedings, the trial court also rejected the Preservation Group\u2019s contention that the City impermissibly reviewed the Project in a piecemeal manner by approving the grading, shoring and pad footings permits before conducting a preliminary review of whether to approve the entire Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Preservation Group appeals, contending that the City incorrectly determined the Project was exempt from CEQA and that the City impermissibly reviewed the Project in a piecemeal manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In considering a petition for a writ of mandate in a CEQA case, \u201c[o]ur task on appeal is \u2018the same as the trial court\u2019s.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, we conduct our review independent of the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>(Quail Botanical Gardens Foundation, Inc. v. City of Encinitas </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602, fn. 3 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 470] <em>(Quail Botanical Gardens).) </em>Accordingly, we examine the City\u2019s decision, not the trial court\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">An important threshold question in this case is the standard by which we review the City\u2019s decision. To better define our inquiry, we first turn to an overview of the CEQA process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">\n<em>Overview of the CEQA Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">CEQA establishes \u201ca three-tiered process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.\u201d We explain these three steps in detail below. <em>(Davidon Homes </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 112 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 612] <em>(Davidon); </em>see also Guidelines, \u00a7 15002(k) [describing three-step process].)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">1. <em>First Step in the CEQA Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">The first step \u201cis jurisdictional, requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether CEQA applies to a proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>activity.\u201d <em>(Davidon, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 112; see also Guidelines, \u00a7 15060.) The Guidelines give the agency 30 days to conduct this preliminary review. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15060.) As part of the preliminary review, the public agency must determine the application of any statutory exemptions or categorical exemptions that would exempt the proposed project from further review under CEQA. (See Guidelines, \u00a7 15282 [listing statutory exemptions]; Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15300-15333 [listing 33 classes of categorical exemptions].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The categorical exemptions are contained in the Guidelines and are formulated by the Secretary under authority conferred by CEQA section 21084(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If, as a result of preliminary review, \u201cthe agency finds the project is exempt from CEQA under any of the stated exemptions, no further environmental review is necessary. The agency may prepare and file a notice of exemption, citing the relevant section of the Guidelines and including a brief \u2018statement of reasons to support the finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Davidon, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 113, citing Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15061(d), 15062(a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">2. <em>Second Step in the CEQA Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">If the project does not fall within an exemption, the agency proceeds to the second step of the process and conducts an initial study to determine if the project <em>may </em>have a significant effect on the environment. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15063.) If, based on the initial study, the public agency determines that \u201cthere is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record . . . that the project may have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental impact report [(EIR)] shall be prepared.\u201d (CEQA, \u00a7 21080(d).) On the other hand, if the initial study demonstrates that the project \u201cwould not have a significant effect on the environment,\u201d either because \u201c[t]here is no substantial evidence, in light of whole record\u201d to that effect or the revisions to the project would avoid such an effect, the agency makes a \u201cnegative declaration,\u201d briefly describing the basis for its conclusion. (CEQA, \u00a7 21080(c)(1); see Guidelines, \u00a7 15063(b)(2); <em>Davidon, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The Guidelines and case law further define the standard that an agency uses to determine whether to issue a negative declaration. \u201c[I]f a lead agency is presented with a <em>fair argument </em>that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>have a significant effect.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15064(f)(1), italics added.) This formulation of the standard for determining whether to issue a negative declaration is often referred to as the \u201cfair argument\u201d standard. (See <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1134-1135 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 231, 864 P.2d 502] <em>(Laurel Heights II).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">3. <em>Third Step in the CEQA Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">If no negative declaration is issued, the preparation of an EIR is the third and final step in the CEQA process. <em>(Davidon, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 113; Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15063(b)(1), 15080; CEQA, \u00a7\u00a7 21100, 21151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\n<em>The Issue Presented Here Concerns the First Step in the CEQA Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">At issue in this case is only <em>the first </em>step in the CEQA process: whether the Project is exempt from further CEQA review because it falls under a categorical exemption. Here, the City concluded that the Project was exempt because it satisfied each of the elements of the categorical exception for urban in-fill development set forth in Guidelines section 15332. (See <em>Communities for a Better Enviroment </em>v. <em>California Resources Agency </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 126-130 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 441] [upholding the validity of Guidelines, \u00a7 15332].) Guidelines section 15332 states that urban in-fill development is exempt from CEQA if it meets the following conditions (the urban in-fill exemption):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">\u201c(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">\u201c(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">\u201c(c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">\u201c(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-15\">\u201c(e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The first issue in this appeal is whether the urban in-fill exemption fails to apply by its own terms, either because (1) the Project is inconsistent with the applicable general plan; (2) the Project is not \u201csubstantially surrounded by urban uses\u201d; or (3) approval of the Project would result in significant effects relating to traffic.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">An exemption may also be inapplicable because of a blanket <em>exception </em>to the categorical exemptions, as set forth in Guidelines section 15300.2. According to this exception, \u201c[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15300.2(c).) As the second main issue in this appeal, the Preservation Group contends there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will create a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, and thus the urban in-fill exemption does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Based on the above, the two main issues in this appeal are (1) whether the urban in-fill exemption applies according to its own terms; and (2) whether the <em>exception </em>to the exemption set forth in Guidelines section 15300.2(c) applies because there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. Keeping in mind the two main issues in this appeal, we next examine the standards that apply to our review of the City\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\n<em>Applicable Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">CEQA establishes the basic standard of review in a mandamus proceeding. \u201cThe standard of review in an action to set aside an agency determination under CEQA is governed by [CEQA] section 21168 in administrative mandamus proceedings, and [CEQA] section 21168.5 in traditional mandamus actions. The distinction between these two provisions \u2018is rarely significant. In either case, the issue before the . . . court is whether the agency abused its discretion. Abuse of discretion is shown if (1) the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or (2) the determination is not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 945 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] <em>(County of Amador).)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">1. <em>The Standard Governing the City\u2019s Determination That No Exception to the Urban In-fill Exemption Applied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We first address the standard that applies to the City\u2019s determination that the <em>exception </em>set forth in Guidelines section 15300.2(c) was inapplicable, i.e., that there was no reasonable possibility of a significant effect to the environment due to unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The Preservation Group had the burden on that issue at the administrative level. \u201cIn categorical exemption cases, where the agency establishes that the project is within an exempt class, the burden shifts to the party challenging the exemption to show that the project is not exempt because it falls within one of the exceptions listed in Guidelines section 15300.2.\u201d <em>(Davidon, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 115.) The challenger has the burden \u201cto \u2018 \u201cproduce substantial evidence that the project has the potential for a substantial adverse environmental impact\u201d \u2019 [citations]; in other words, that one of the exceptions to categorical exemption applies.\u201d <em>(Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 786, 796 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 731] <em>(Santa Monica Chamber).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">a. <em>Divergence in the Case Law Between the Fair Argument Standard and the Traditional Substantial Evidence Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The authorities have purported to describe a \u201csplit\u201d in the case law on the issue of how a court should review an agency\u2019s decision that there is no <em>reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment </em>under Guidelines section 15300.2(c).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Fairbank </em>v. <em>City of Mill Valley </em>(1999) 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1243, 1259-1260 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 233] <em>(Fairbank); Santa Monica Chamber, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 795-797.) One approach would apply a fair argument standard to the question of whether substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s decision, similar to the standard applied in reviewing an agency\u2019s decision to issue a negative declaration. (See, e.g., Guidelines, \u00a7 15064(f)(1) [setting forth the fair argument standard in a negative declaration context].) Under that standard, the court would review the record to determine whether it contained evidence of a fair argument that the project <em>may </em>have a significant effect on the environment. The other approach would apply what is referred to as the \u201ctraditional\u201d substantial evidence review. (See, e.g., <em>Association for Protection etc. Values v. City of Ukiah </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 720 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 488] <em>(Ukiah).) </em>Under that approach, a court will uphold an agency\u2019s decision if there is <em>any </em>substantial evidence in the record that there will be <em>no </em>significant effect on the environment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>As we will explain, the type of analysis conducted by a reviewing court will depend on the type of inquiry the agency has conducted, i.e., whether the agency itself has applied a fair argument or a traditional approach. Under one type of inquiry by an agency, the agency will <em>weigh evidence </em>and <em>make a finding </em>as to whether there will be a significant effect. This is the traditional approach. Under another type of inquiry by an agency, it will simply inquire whether, as a matter of law, the record contains credible evidence <em>to support an argument </em>that there may be a significant effect, but the agency would not <em>weigh the evidence </em>or <em>resolve any conflict. </em>This is the fair argument approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">To better illustrate the two approaches, we provide the following example. Suppose that an agency is faced with two credible expert reports reaching different conclusions about whether a project will create a significant effect on the environment. The first approach (the traditional approach) would have the agency <em>decide between </em>the credible expert reports and <em>make a finding, </em>after weighing the reports, as to whether a project will cause a significant effect. The second approach (the fair argument approach) would have the agency take note of the fact that credible expert reports disagree, and without weighing the reports or making any further findings, conclude that there is necessarily a <em>reasonable possibility </em>of a significant effect, since at least one credible expert report reached that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In the context of an agency\u2019s decision not to issue a negative declaration, our Supreme Court and the Guidelines have directed that agencies follow the fair argument approach: an agency is merely supposed to look to see if the record shows substantial evidence of <em>a fair argument </em>that there may be a significant effect. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15064(f)(1) [\u201cif a lead agency is presented with a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not have a significant effect\u201d]; <em>No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66] <em>(No </em>Oil) [adopting fair argument standard].) In other words, the agency is not to weigh the evidence to come to its own conclusion about whether there will be a significant effect. It is merely supposed to inquire, <em>as a matter of law, </em>whether the record reveals a fair argument. As one court has explained, \u201c \u2018[t]he lead agency\u2019s determination is . . . largely legal rather than factual; it <em>does not resolve conflicts in the evidence </em>but determines only whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the prescribed fair argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gentry v. City of Murrieta </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1400 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 170] <em>(Gentry), </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The application of the fair argument approach by an agency necessarily impacts a reviewing court\u2019s analysis. Because the fair argument approach ultimately presents a question of law about the presence of certain evidence in the record, not a question about whether evidence supports an agency\u2019s <em>factual finding, </em>\u201c[i]n effect ... the determination before the court raise[s] only <em>a question of law, </em>namely, the sufficiency of the evidence to support a fair argument. Such a question, under that decision, may be independently analyzed by the courts regardless of the scope of judicial review.\u201d <em>(Bowman </em>v. <em>City of Petaluma </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1065, 1073 [230 Cal.Rptr. 413], italics added.) \u201c[T]he reviewing court\u2019s \u2018function is to determine whether substantial evidence supported the agency\u2019s conclusion as to whether the prescribed \u201cfair argument\u201d could be made.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Quail Botanical Gardens, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 1602, fn. omitted, italics added.) Thus, the reviewing court effectively conducts an independent review, also applying the fair argument standard, to determine whether the record contains evidence of a fair argument that a proposed project will have a significant effect on the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In contrast, when a reviewing court examines an agency\u2019s finding under the traditional approach, the reviewing court is presented with an uncomplicated question of whether the agency\u2019s factual finding is supported by substantial evidence. (See CEQA, \u00a7\u00a7 21168, 21168.5; <em>County of Amador, supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 945.) Because the agency has made a factual finding of whether a proposed project will have a significant effect on the environment rather than a determination as a matter of law of whether the record contains evidence supporting a fair argument of such effects, the reviewing court need not conduct the independent review required by the fair argument approach. Instead, the court will affirm the agency\u2019s finding if the record contains \u201c \u2018relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate support for a conclusion\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bhatt, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 928), on the issue of whether a proposed project will create a significant effect on the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">As we will explain, we conclude that an agency must apply a fair argument approach in determining whether, under Guidelines section 15300.2(c), there is no reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. Accordingly, as a reviewing court we independently review the agency\u2019s determination under Guidelines section 15300.2(c) to determine whether the record contains evidence of a fair argument of a significant effect on the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">b. <em>The Fair Argument Standard Applies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Our conclusion that the fair argument standard applies to an agency\u2019s determination under Guidelines section 15300.2(c) is based on two considerations: (1) the close textual similarities between Guidelines section 15300.2(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and CEQA section 21151, from which the fair argument standard was originally derived; and (2) the applicability of the policy reasons behind the original adoption of the fair argument standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">First, we explain the close textual similarities. \u201c[T]he \u2018fair argument\u2019 test was derived from an interpretation of the language of, and policies underlying, [CEQA] section 21151 itself.\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights II, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1135.) That provision states that an EIR is required \u201con any project . . . which <em>may </em>have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d (CEQA, \u00a7 21151(a), italics added.) Based on this language, and on the policy of interpreting CEQA \u201c \u2018to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language,\u2019 \u201d our Supreme Court decided that CEQA requires preparation of an EIR \u201cwhenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project <em>may </em>have significant environmental impact.\u201d <em>(No Oil, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at pp. 75, 83, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Similar to the focus in CEQA section 21151(a) on whether a project <em>\u201cmay </em>have a significant effect on the environment\u201d (italics added), the application of Guidelines section 15300.2(c) turns on whether there is \u201ca <em>reasonable possibility </em>that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment\u201d (ibid., italics added). Our Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe word \u2018may\u2019 connotes a \u2018reasonable possibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>(No Oil, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 83, fn. 16.) Thus, the phrases <em>\u201cmay </em>have a significant effect\u201d and <em>\u201ca reasonable </em>possibility\u201d of a significant effect are substantively identical. Because the fair argument standard was derived from a phrase in CEQA section 21151(a), which is substantively identical to the phrase in Guidelines section 15300.2(c), it is logical to apply the fair argument standard to both of them. Both provisions reasonably can be read, as <em>No Oil </em>read CEQA section 21151, as calling on the agency to determine whether the record reflects a <em>reasonable possibility </em>of a significant effect rather than to make findings and weigh evidence to determine if there <em>will be </em>a significant effect. Indeed, precedent favors applying a fair argument standard when the inquiry at issue is substantially similar to the inquiry made in CEQA section 21151. <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1317 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 473] [concluding that the fair argument standard applied to an agency\u2019s decision whether to prepare a tiered EIR for a later project because the relevant provision required the agency to determine whether the later project <em>may </em>cause significant effects on the environment, which was similar to the provision in CEQA section 21151 that gave rise to the fair argument standard].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Next, we analyze whether the policy behind the adoption of the fair argument standard for CEQA section 21151 is applicable here as well. As our Supreme Court has stated in adopting the fair argument standard, CEQA should be interpreted to \u201c \u2018afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>(No Oil, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 84.) Application of the fair argument standard to Guidelines section 15300.2(c) is consistent with that policy, as the language of the provision reasonably can be interpreted to call for the agency to determine whether there is a fair argument for a significant effect. Applying that standard would afford more protection to the environment than an interpretation that allowed us to uphold an agency\u2019s determination whenever the record contained <em>any </em>substantial evidence supporting a finding that a project <em>would not </em>have a significant effect on the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We further conclude that it is consistent with the policy behind CEQA to preclude an agency from relying on a categorical exemption when there is a fair argument that a project will have a significant effect on the environment, because, as our Supreme Court has noted, the Secretary \u201cis empowered to exempt <em>only </em>those activities which do not have a significant effect on the environment. [Citation.] It follows that where there is <em>any reasonable possibility </em>that a project or activity may have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption would be improper.\u201d <em>(Wildlife Alive v. Chickering </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205-206 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537] <em>(Chickering), </em>italics added.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This important limitation on the Secretary\u2019s authority, as established by CEQA, is best upheld by disallowing an exemption for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>project where the record reflects a fair argument that there may be a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Thus, we conclude that the City was required to apply the fair argument approach with respect to the issue raised by Guidelines section 15300.2(c), and accordingly, we will independently review the record using that standard. If, in independently reviewing the record, we perceive evidence of a fair argument that there may be a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, we will conclude that the City abused its discretion because its decision to the contrary is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">2. <em>The Standard Governing the City\u2019s Determination That the Urban In-fill Exemption Applied by Its Own Terms</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Next we examine how the standard of review should be applied to the question of whether the urban in-fill exemption applies, by its own terms, to the Project. Except for one issue, which we discuss below, the application of the substantial evidence standard of review as set forth in CEQA sections 21168 and 21168.5 in this context is relatively straightforward. The authorities are in agreement that \u201cthe substantial evidence test governs our review of the city\u2019s factual determination that a project falls within a categorical exemption.\u201d <em>(Fairbank, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251; see also <em>Davidon, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 115 [\u201cOn review, an agency\u2019s categorical exemption determination will be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence that the project fell within the exempt category of projects\u201d]; <em>Magan </em>v. <em>County of Kings </em>(2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 344] <em>(Magan) </em>[an agency \u201conly has the burden to demonstrate substantial evidence that the ordinance fell within the exempt category of projects\u201d]; <em>McQueen </em>v. <em>Board of Directors </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148 [249 Cal.Rptr. 439] [\u201cOur concern is whether there is substantial evidence supporting the [agency\u2019s] assertion of exemption\u201d].) Although \u201c \u2018there is no statutory requirement of a preliminary study attending an agency decision to use [an] exemption[,] ... []0 ... the administrati[ve] record must disclose substantial evidence of every element of the contended exemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>(CalBeach Advocates v. City of Solana Beach </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 529, 536 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] <em>(CalBeach Advocates) </em>[addressing statutory exemptions].) This standard is easily applied to two of the three issues presented by the City\u2019s determination that the urban in-fill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>exemption applies, namely, the City\u2019s determination that the Project (1) is consistent with the applicable general plan, and (2) is substantially surrounded by urban uses. With respect to these determinations, we simply review the record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s findings as to these elements.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">However, as the Preservation Group points out, the urban in-fill exemption contains one unique element that arguably complicates the application of the standard of review. The urban in-fill exemption states that it applies only if \u201c[ajpproval of the project <em>would not result in any significant effects </em>relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15332(d), italics added.) Because this provision requires the City\u2019s finding <em>as to significant effects, </em>it is in some respects similar to Guidelines section 15300.2(c), discussed above, which requires a determination that there is no \u201creasonable possibility that the activity will have a <em>significant effect </em>on the environment due to unusual circumstances.\u201d (Italics added.) The Preservation Group advocates that we approach the \u201csignificant effect\u201d aspect of the urban in-fill exemption in the same way that we approach the exception set forth in Guidelines section 15300.2(c), namely, by asking if the record shows substantial evidence of <em>a fair argument </em>that there could be a significant effect on the environment. As we explain, because of the differences between Guidelines section 15300.2(c) and the significant effect element of the urban in-fill exemption, we reject the Preservation Group\u2019s argument that the same standard of review should apply to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Although there are several important differences between the language of Guidelines section 15300.2(c) and the significant effect element of the urban in-fill exemption,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the dispositive difference for the purpose of our analysis is that the urban in-fill exemption does not refer to a <em>reasonable possibility </em>of a significant effect. Instead, the urban in-fill exemption requires the agency to determine that \u201c[ajpproval of the project <em>would not </em>result\u201d in a significant effect to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Guidelines, \u00a7 15332(d), italics added.) Thus, the urban in-fill exemption calls for the agency to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>a <em>definitive finding, </em>at the preliminary review stage, as to whether or not there will be a significant environmental effect. We note that the Secretary could have elected to use the term \u201cmay\u201d or \u201creasonable possibility\u201d in the significant effect element of the urban in-fill exemption, thus invoking the fair argument standard, but did not. Instead, the urban in-fill exemption simply directs the agency to determine if a project <em>\u201cwould </em>not\u201d have a significant effect. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15332(d), italics added.) The use of this language leads us to conclude that the fair argument standard does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Consistent with this analysis, a leading commentator has suggested that the fair argument standard does not apply to the significant effect element of the urban in-fill exemption because the urban in-fill exemption does not depend on whether a project <em>may </em>have a significant effect, but instead depends on if it <em>will </em>have a significant effect. \u201cHad the Resources Agency intended that a reviewing court use the more stringent \u2018fair argument\u2019 standard of review, then it would have instead used terms echoing that standard as it appears in other contexts (e.g., \u2018there is no substantial evidence that approval of the project <em>may </em>have significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality\u2019). This view is consistent with the general rule that the courts, in reviewing an agency\u2019s decision to rely on a categorical exemption, employ the \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard of review.\u201d (Remy et al., Guide to the Cal. Environmental Quality Act (10th ed. 1999) p. 117.) We agree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Having concluded that the fair argument standard does not apply to the City\u2019s finding regarding the significant effect element of the urban in-fill exemption, we apply the traditional substantial evidence standard of review. We inquire whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the City\u2019s finding that the Project will not have a significant effect. If we locate substantial evidence in the record to support that conclusion, we will uphold the City\u2019s determination, even if other evidence arguably supports a different conclusion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>Substantial Evidence Supports the City\u2019s Determination That the Urban In-fill Exemption Applied According to Its Terms</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We now turn to an analysis of the City\u2019s determination that the urban in-fill exemption applies by its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In concluding that the elements of the urban in-fill exemption were present in this case, the City made a number of subsidiary findings. At issue here are three of those findings: (a) the Project is substantially surrounded by urban uses, (b) the Project is consistent with the applicable general plan, and (c) the Project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic. We examine each of these findings in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">1. <em>Substantially Surrounded by Urban Uses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The first finding that the Preservation Group challenges is that the Project will be developed on a site <em>\u201csubstantially surrounded by urban uses.\u201d </em>(Guidelines, \u00a7 15332(b), italics added.) The Preservation Group points out that although the Project will be surrounded by urban buildings to the east, north and west, the comer of Balboa Park will be directly to the south of the Project, across Upas Street. The Preservation Group argues that Balboa Park is not an \u201curban use,\u201d and thus the Project will not be \u201csubstantially surrounded by urban uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">We have not located or been directed by the parties to any authority interpreting the phrase \u201csubstantially surrounded by urban uses\u201d as it appears in the urban in-fill exemption.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, to inform our analysis we turn to case law that has defined the term \u201curban uses\u201d in the Community Redevelopment Law (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33000 et seq.).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According to case law there defining the term \u201curban uses,\u201d \u201c[t]he term \u2018urban\u2019 is \u2018not fixed, objective, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>easily ascertainable,\u2019 \u201d but it has been \u201c \u2018defined as \u201cof, relating to, characteristic of, or taking place in a city . . . constituting or including and centered on a city ... of, relating to, or concerned with an urban and [specifically] a densely populated area . . . belonging or having relation to buildings that are characteristic of cities <em>(Friends of Mammoth v. Town of Mammoth Lakes Redevelopment Agency </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 511, 541, 544 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 334] <em>(Friends of Mammoth) </em>[as part of a CEQA analysis, determining whether a series of proposed projects related to \u201curban uses\u201d under the Community Redevelopment Law].) Accordingly, \u201c[t]he term \u2018urban\u2019 . . . refers <em>more to the location and \u2018varying characteristics\u2019 of a use </em>than to the <em>type </em>of use. [Citation.] For example, a residential dwelling can exist either in an urban area or in a rural area. . . . [][] So it is with golf courses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 545, italics added.) The <em>Friends of Mammoth </em>court, for instance, analyzed whether the golf course at issue was an urban use or a rural use by analyzing its specific characteristics and location. Because it contained \u201csignificant amounts of natural and preserved forest lands\u201d and was \u201csurrounded by undeveloped forest land,\u201d the court determined that it was not \u201crelated to or characteristic of a city or a densely populated area,\u201d and thus not an urban use. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">We apply the <em>Friends of Mammoth </em>approach to determine whether Balboa Park should be considered an urban use. Doing so, we focus on the fact that Balboa Park is a quintessential urban park, heavily landscaped, surrounded by a densely populated area, and containing urban amenities such as museums, theaters and restaurants. Accordingly, it is \u201ccharacteristic of a city or a densely populated area,\u201d and we conclude that it constitutes an urban use. Having determined that Balboa Park is an urban use, we reject the Preservation Group\u2019s argument that, due to its frontage on Balboa Park, the Project is not \u201csubstantially surrounded by urban uses.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">2. <em>Consistency with the General Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">We next examine whether substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s finding that the Project \u201cis consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15332(a).) The Preservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Group does not challenge the Project\u2019s compliance with zoning requirements, but argues that the Project does not comply with the Uptown Community Plan adopted by the City Council in 1988 and amended in 1989 (the Plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The Preservation Group makes two arguments centering on the setback of the building and its effect on views of Balboa Park. It first points to a statement in the Plan dealing with general urban design guidelines, which states that \u201c[developments on comer lots of existing streets which serve as public view corridors for vistas and open space need special design considerations such as being required to setback from the comer or terrace away from the street.\u201d Based on this language, the Preservation Group argues that the Project is inconsistent with the Plan because \u201cit has been unnecessarily crammed into the southern end of the lot with a minimized setback from the comer and the park.\u201d Similarly, the Preservation Group points to the Plan\u2019s stated objective in the Park West area of San Diego (in which the Project is located) to \u201c[mjaintain and enhance pedestrian and auto views of Balboa Park.\u201d The Preservation Group argues that the Project is inconsistent with this objective because it is insufficiently set back to maintain views of Balboa Park from southbound Sixth Avenue. As we will explain, we reject these arguments and determine that substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s finding that the Project is consistent with the applicable planning documents, which, as quoted above, express a general policy in favor of using setbacks to maintain view corridors.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Our conclusion is based in large part on the fact that the record contains evidence that the Project\u2019s setbacks <em>more </em>than comply with the specific applicable setback zoning provisions. Specifically relevant to the views of Balboa Park from Sixth Avenue, the Project provides a 12.5-foot setback from the property line along Upas Street where only a five-foot setback is required. Further, there will be a 20-foot setback from the face of the easterly curb on Sixth Avenue. A diagram in the record shows that because of these setbacks, drivers proceeding south on Sixth Avenue will have a view across Upas Street and to the east toward Balboa Park from at least 68 feet from the intersection with Upas Street. The use of setbacks that exceed the applicable requirements, along with evidence in the record showing that there will be sight lines of Balboa Park for southbound drivers, lead us to conclude that substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s conclusion that the Project is consistent with the Plan\u2019s policy in favor of using setbacks to maintain view corridors.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Preservation Group also contends that the Project is inconsistent with the Plan\u2019s statement that \u201cdevelopment adjacent to the north side of Balboa Park should be low density, residential uses.\u201d However, the record shows that this policy does not apply to the northeast comer of Upas Street and Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Avenue, where the Project is located. A map in the Plan shows that the low density area is located adjacent to the north end of Balboa Park <em>east </em>of Seventh Avenue and on the other side of the highway that cuts through Balboa Park. Further, other maps in the Plan show that the comer of Upas Street and Sixth Avenue is contained in a \u201cvery high density\u201d area.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We accordingly conclude that the Plan does not place the Project in a low density area, and the Project is thus not inconsistent with the Plan due to its density.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">3. <em>No Significant Effects on Traffic</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Turning to the next element of the urban in-fill exemption, we analyze whether substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s finding that \u201c[ajpproval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic . . . .\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15332(d).) As we have discussed above, in reviewing the City\u2019s finding we apply a traditional substantial evidence standard of review rather than the fair argument standard. (See pt. II.C.2, <em>ante.) </em>Thus, we will affirm the City\u2019s findings if the record contains substantial evidence that the Project will cause no significant effect relating to traffic, even if other evidence arguably supports a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The Preservation Group presents several arguments concerning the Project\u2019s impact on traffic\u2014all of which we reject based on the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">a. <em>The Offset Intersection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">First, the Preservation Group argues that the Project would have a significant effect on traffic because it will be located at a dangerous intersection. Specifically, the Preservation Group argues that the intersection of Sixth Avenue and Upas Street is an \u201coffset\u201d intersection: (1) Sixth Avenue does not line up to the north and south of Upas Street, with Sixth Avenue jogging to the west as it continues in front of the Project; and (2) Upas Street does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>line up on either side of Sixth Avenue, with a third street\u2014Balboa Drive, being directly across Sixth Avenue from the western portion of Upas Street. The Preservation Group also cites testimony from several residents attesting to the dangerous nature of this offset intersection. For example, residents explained that drivers use excessive speeds, that the signage is confusing and that accidents occur at the intersection when traffic northbound on Sixth Avenue fails to veer west at the offset intersection and runs into the lot on which the Project will be located. In contrast, police department accident records show only two reported accidents near the intersection in a one-year period, and only two accidents in the previous five years. None of the reported accidents involved drivers running into the lot where the Project will be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The observation of local residents that accidents (even if unreported) have occurred at the intersection may be properly considered here. \u201c \u2018In the context of an administrative hearing, \u201crelevant personal observations are evidence. For example, an adjacent property owner may testify to traffic conditions based upon personal knowledge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Leonoff v. Monterey County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1337, 1351-1352 [272 Cal.Rptr. 372]; see also <em>Pocket Protectors </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 928 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 791] [\u201cRelevant personal observations of area residents <em>on nontechnical subjects </em>may qualify as substantial evidence\u201d (italics added)].) However, although local residents may testify to their <em>observations </em>regarding existing traffic conditions, \u201cin the absence of a specific factual foundation in the record, dire predictions by nonexperts <em>regarding the consequences of a project </em>do not constitute substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Gentry, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1417, italics added.) \u201cUnsubstantiated opinions, concerns, and suspicions about a project, though sincere and deeply felt, do not rise to the level of substantial evidence . . . .\u201d <em>(Leonoff, </em>at p. 1352.) Thus, \u201cproject opponents must produce . . . evidence, other than their unsubstantiated opinions, that a project <em>will produce a particular adverse </em>effect.\u201d <em>(Ukiah, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at pp. 735-736, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Here, although the testimony of the local residents arguably provides some evidence of the dangerous nature of the intersection, the record contains no factual foundation for the claim that the Project would <em>exacerbate </em>that condition for pedestrians and drivers. To the contrary, a study by a traffic engineer concluded that \u201cthe [P]roject does not create a significant impact at the intersection of Sixth Avenue and Upas Street and there are no \u2018safety\u2019 or sight distance problems at the intersection.\u201d Diagrams in the record show that sight lines for drivers will not be substantially impacted by the Project, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>drivers proceeding south on Sixth Avenue and turning east onto Upas Street and drivers proceeding west on Upas Street and turning north onto Sixth Avenue able to see across the intersection from 68 feet back. Pedestrian sight lines of the intersection will also not be obstructed. Further, the intersection is controlled with traffic lights, minimizing the risk that an accident, involving either pedestrians or only vehicles, will be caused by any diminished ability to see cross-traffic. Because the Project\u2019s design calls for the placement of a series of 36-inch-tall planters along the southern and western perimeter of the site, it also takes account of the possibility that drivers northbound on Sixth Avenue will cause substantial damage if they drive onto the property. The Preservation Group presented no evidence to counter any of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Instead, the Preservation Group argues that the Project will have a significant effect on traffic because it will foreclose the City from taking certain <em>future </em>steps to address problems at the intersection, such as constructing a traffic circle, widening the sidewalks or other measures. This argument suffers from the same flaws as the Preservation Group\u2019s argument about the exacerbation of the dangerous conditions at the intersection: It is based solely on unsubstantiated lay opinion. Except for the nontechnical and unsupported lay opinion of one local resident, the record contains no evidence that the Project will foreclose the City from taking meaningful steps in the future to address any dangerous conditions that it perceives at the intersection. The record also contains the report from the City Manager, which states that it is not reasonably foreseeable that the Project would impact any plans to adjust the intersection, because no plans have been adopted. This report provided a further basis for the City to reject the Preservation Group\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Based on the above, we conclude that substantial evidence supports a finding that the Project will not have a significant effect on traffic relating to the offset intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">b. <em>Traffic Concerns Relating to the Alley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Preservation Group makes several points related to the alley located behind the Project. The alley is located to the north of the Project and connects Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue. It provides access to parking spaces for nearby apartment buildings and is where the entrance and exit to the underground parking garage for the Project will be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The Preservation Group argues that it will be dangerous for drivers to turn onto Sixth Avenue when exiting from the alley because the Project will block a driver\u2019s view of cars driving north on Sixth Avenue. However, as the record indicates, the City Manager explained that the Project fully complies with the City\u2019s requirements for visibility areas at the street and alley intersections.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Next, the Preservation Group argues that it is dangerous for drivers to enter the alley when driving southbound on Sixth Avenue if they illegally cross a double yellow line or make a dangerous U-turn at Upas Street to do so. However, the difficulty of turning left into the alley from Sixth Avenue is not a condition caused by the Project and exists whether or not the Project is built. Moreover, as the Preservation Group recognizes, the safest way to enter the alley from southbound Sixth Avenue is to make a left turn at the traffic signal on Upas Street and enter the alley from Seventh Avenue. The Project does not preclude that approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Finally, the Preservation Group also suggests that congestion in the alley will \u201cinterfere with the residents of the apartments on the other side of the alley who must park in stalls along the mid-block alley.\u201d However, as the City Manager explained, while the Project would be expected to generate some additional traffic in the alley, it would not be a significant addition, because the Project would be expected to generate an average of only seven trips in the morning peak hours and eight trips in the afternoon peak hours. Further, the Project would improve congestion problems in the alley by dedicating an additional five feet of property to widen and improve the existing 15-foot-wide alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Based on this evidence, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the City\u2019s finding that the Project would not cause any significant effects on traffic as related to the alley to the north of the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">c. <em>Effects on Parking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The Preservation Group argues the Project will have a significant adverse impact on the availability of parking spaces in the neighborhood, which are already limited because of the proximity of Balboa Park and parking congestion caused by events held at the Marston House.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The records shows that the Project will provide 28 parking spaces (two for each of the 14 units), which is more than the required 25 spaces mandated by applicable requirements. The Preservation Group nevertheless argues that the Project will negatively impact the availability of neighborhood parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(1) because it does not designate any additional space for visitor parking, and (2) it will cause the elimination of three on-street parking spaces.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We conclude that there may be some small effect on the availability of on-street parking because of the loss of three on-street parking spaces and the parking needs of visitors to the 14 single-family residences in the Project. However, the effect cannot be described as \u201csignificant.\u201d A significant effect is a \u201csubstantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change.\u201d (CEQA, \u00a7 21068; Guidelines, \u00a7 15382.) Under the Guidelines, a project will normally have a significant effect on the environment if it will \u201c[c]ause an increase in traffic which is <em>substantial in relation to </em>the existing traffic load and capacity of the street system.\u201d (Guidelines, appen. G, \u00a7 XV(a), italics added.) The slight increase in parking congestion that may result from the Project will not be \u201csubstantial\u201d in relation to the preexisting parking congestion in the area as described in the record. <em>(Fairbank, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 1260 [\u201cWhile the addition of any small building to a fully developed downtown commercial area is likely to cause minor adverse changes in the amount and flow of traffic and in parking patterns in the area, such effects cannot be deemed \u2018significant\u2019 without a showing of some feature of the project that distinguishes it from any other small, run-of-the-mill commercial building or use\u201d]; <em>City of Orange </em>v. <em>Valenti </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 240, 249 [112 Cal.Rptr. 379] [if a project concerns \u201ca commercial area of such character that a few dozen additional cars (or a few hundred depending on the economy) would be expected to be a logical part of that local environmental picture, it could then be said that the [project] would have no significant effect on the environment of that particular area\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\n<em>Substantial Evidence Supports the City\u2019s Determination That There Is No Reasonable Probability of a Significant Effect on the Environment Due to Unusual Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">We next examine the City\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is no reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances\u201d under Guidelines section 15300.2(c). As we have explained above, the fair argument standard applies to our analysis. (See pt. ILC.l.b, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The Preservation Group argues there are \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d in this case, making Guidelines section 15300.2(c) applicable, because the Project (1) is adjacent to Balboa Park; (2) is located near houses that are designated as historic; (3) abuts the Del Prado condominium building and will impact its residents\u2019 views; and <em>(4) sits </em>at a dangerous offset intersection. The Preservation Group contends that due to these purportedly unusual circumstances, there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will significantly effect (1) shadowing of Balboa Park, (2) views, (3) traffic, and (4) \u201ccommunity character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The application of Guidelines section 15300.2(c) involves two distinct inquiries. First, we inquire whether the Project presents unusual circumstances. Second, we inquire whether there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment <em>due to </em>the unusual circumstances. <em>(Azusa, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 1207 [the unusual circumstances test is satisfied \u201cwhere the circumstances of a particular project (i) differ from the general circumstances of the projects covered by a particular categorical exemption, and (ii) those circumstances create an environmental risk that does not exist for the general class of exempt projects\u201d].) \u201cA negative answer to either question means the exception does not apply.\u201d <em>(Santa Monica Chamber, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Instead of beginning our inquiry with an analysis of whether the various circumstances identified by the Preservation Group qualify as \u201cunusual,\u201d in this case our inquiry will be streamlined if we proceed directly to the question of whether, applying the fair argument standard, there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to any of those purported unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">1. <em>Shadows</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We first address the Preservation Group\u2019s contention that due to the Project\u2019s location across from Balboa Park, there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will significantly affect the environment by casting shadows on Balboa Park that will harm the park\u2019s vegetation.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We reject this argument because the record does not contain evidence creating a fair argument that the shadows cast by the Project will have an adverse effect on the park\u2019s vegetation. We reach this conclusion keeping in mind that as the party challenging the exemption, it is the Preservation Group\u2019s burden to produce substantial evidence establishing an exception to the urban in-fill exemption. <em>(Santa Monica Chamber, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 795-796.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The record contains shadow diagrams showing the shadows that would be cast by the Project. As the City Manager explained, interpreting these diagrams: \u201cOn June 21, the shadow created by the proposed [Pjroject extends to the southeast, crossing Upas Street at 5:00 p.m. and ultimately extending 130 feet into Balboa Park by sunset.\u201d However, due to the movement of the sun throughout the year, the Project would cast a shadow <em>to the north, </em>rather than to the south into Balboa Park, at other times of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Preservation Group submitted no evidence showing that the park\u2019s vegetation would be impacted by the shadow created by the Project on summer evenings. To the contrary, the only evidence in the record on that subject suggested no significant effect. The record contains evidence that there was no known significant impact on the vegetation on the <em>west </em>side of Balboa Park due to the construction of buildings there, and the City\u2019s horticulturalist for Balboa Park stated that because of the movement of the sun, \u201cit seems fair to assume that the construction of a building on the <em>north </em>end of the park,\u201d where the Project is located, \u201cwill have less of an impact than any changes in the buildings on the <em>\\w\\est </em>side of [Sixth] Avenue.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the record does not contain substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of a significant effect on the vegetation in Balboa Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">2. <em>Views</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The Preservation Group argues that due to the Project\u2019s location next to the Del Prado, views to the west from that building will be blocked. We reject this argument because \u201cobstruction of a few private views in a project\u2019s immediate vicinity is not generally regarded as a significant environmental impact.\u201d <em>(Bowman v. City of Berkeley </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 572, 586 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 814]) \u201cUnder CEQA, the question is whether a project will affect the environment of persons in general, not whether a project will affect particular persons.\u201d <em>(Mira Mar Mobile Community </em>v. <em>City of Oceanside </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 477, 492-493 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 308].)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The Preservation Group also argues that there is a reasonable possibility that the Project\u2019s location next to Balboa Park will negatively impact the public\u2019s view of Balboa Park from Sixth Avenue. However, as we have explained, the record shows that sight lines down Sixth Avenue will be preserved to a reasonable extent. The views of Balboa Park from Sixth Avenue will not be impacted in any way that can be fairly described as \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Preservation Group also contends that view from inside Balboa Park looking north will be negatively impacted because the view will consist of a wall of tall buildings. However, we agree with the City that the view toward the lot where the Project will be built, as shown from photographs in the record, consists of an unremarkable urban street, not a \u201cscenic vista\u201d with aesthetic qualities. (See Guidelines, appen. G, \u00a7 1(a) &amp; (c) [in deciding whether to prepare a negative declaration an agency may ask whether a project would \u201c[h]ave a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista\u201d or \u201c[substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings\u201d].) Further, the view already contains the Del Prado, which is three and a half times wider than the Project and substantially the same height. In light of these facts, it cannot be fairly argued that the existing character of the view looking north from Balboa Park will be significantly affected by the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">3. <em>Community Character</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Relying on the alleged inconsistency of the Project with the Plan\u2019s objectives for development adjacent to Balboa Park, the Preservation Group argues that the Project would \u201chave significant impacts with respect to community character.\u201d However, as we have discussed above, the Project is consistent with the Plan. The Preservation Group further argues that the Project would significantly impact community character because it \u201cwould be the only building higher than four stories on the east side of [Sixth] Avenue between Elm and University.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that the Del Prado, while one lot removed from Sixth Avenue, is substantially higher than four stories, and that the Project will be consistent with the community character already established by the Del Prado.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">4. <em>Traffic</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Finally, the Preservation Group makes the identical arguments that we have already discussed above with respect to traffic impacts. In support of the \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d component of the exception, the Preservation Group argues that the unusual circumstances consist of (1) the proximity to Balboa Park and the Marston House, which causes parking problems and high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>pedestrian traffic, and (2) the allegedly dangerous nature of the offset intersection. We do not reach the issue of whether these circumstances are unusual. Instead, we determine, with reference to our discussion above, that the City correctly determined that there is no reasonable possibility of a significant effect on traffic from the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we consciously apply a different standard than we applied in determining whether the elements of the urban in-fill exemption were met. Here, we ask whether the record contains any substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project will have a significant effect on traffic. (See pt. II.C.1.b, <em>ante.) </em>Applying that standard to the traffic issues discussed above, we conclude that the record does not support a fair argument that the Project (1) will exacerbate any dangerous conditions to drivers and pedestrians posed by the offset intersection, (2) will cause dangerous conditions or substantial amounts of congestion regarding the alley to the north of the Project, or (3) will have a significant effect on the parking problems in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\n<em>There Is No Merit to the Preservation Group\u2019s Argument That the City Impermissibly \u201cPiecemealed\u201d the Approval of the Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Focusing on the fact that the City issued shoring, grading and pad foot ings permits before it undertook its analysis of whether the Project was exempt from CEQA, the Preservation Group argues that the City impermissibly approached the CEQA analysis of the Project in a \u201cpiecemeal\u201d manner. The Preservation Group relies on case law holding that \u201c[a] public agency is not permitted to subdivide a single project into smaller individual subprojects in order to avoid the responsibility of considering the environmental impact of the project <em>as a whole.\u201d (Orinda Assn. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171 [227 Cal.Rptr. 688], italics added; see also <em>Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. v. Board of Port Cmrs. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 598].) The rationale behind the \u201cpiecemealing\u201d prohibition is that \u201c \u2018[t]he requirements of CEQA[,] \u201ccannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only ministerial.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Orinda, at p. 1171.) In this case, the Preservation Group\u2019s argument is that the shoring, grading permit, and pad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>footings permits should <em>not </em>have been issued as ministerial matters <em>separate </em>from the Project because they were an inseparable part of the Project.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We reject this argument on the ground that the Preservation Group failed to object to the City about the alleged piecemeal treatment of the Project and thus failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. CEQA states that an action may not be brought to challenge an agency\u2019s decision \u201cunless the alleged grounds for noncompliance with [CEQA] were presented to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing.\u201d (CEQA, \u00a7 21177(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The Preservation Group never raised the issue of piecemealing to the City.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The best it can do is to point to an unclear comment at the City Council hearing by a member of the public, who stated, \u201cNow there ha[s] also been <em>a project splitting, </em>ignoring environmental issues such as traffic and light, ignoring unusual issues as being located directly by the entrance of Balboa Park, ignoring the cumulative effects and so on.\u201d Although the Preservation Group \u201cmay assert any issues raised by <em>other </em>parties during the administrative proceedings\u201d <em>(Galante Vineyards </em>v. <em>Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1119 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 1], italics added), we do not perceive this isolated and unelaborated comment by a member of the public as fairly raising the piecemealing argument to the City. \u201c[Objections must be sufficiently specific so that the agency has the opportunity to evaluate and respond to them. Otherwise, the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine would not be served, since the courts would be called upon to step outside their limited role of reviewing the decisionmaking process of the administrative agency . . . .\u201d <em>(Evans v. City of San Jose </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1140 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 675]) Accordingly, we conclude that the Preservation Group may not advance the piecemealing argument in this proceeding because the issue was not fairly presented to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">McConnell, P.

As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Laurel Heights II, </em>the genesis of the fair argument standard in <em>No Oil, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 83-85, was \u201c[CEQA] section 21151[, which] commands that an EIR must be prepared whenever a project <em>\u2018may </em>have a significant effect on the environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Laurel Heights II, </em>at p. 1134.) The recirculation of an EIR, on the other hand, is required only if the agency finds \u201c \u2018significant new information.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because the decision whether to recirculate an EIR is <em>not </em>based on an inquiry into whether a project <em>may </em>have a significant effect on the environment, the inquiry at issue in <em>Laurel Heights II </em>is not analogous to the inquiry here: whether there is <em>a reasonable possibility </em>of a significant effect on the environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> \u201cTo implement the rule laid out in <em>Chickering, </em>Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c) was adopted\u201d <em>(Fairbank, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1251-1252), excepting from the operation of the categorical exemptions, any project that posed a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\"> The Developer contended at oral argument that because the categorical exemptions have been expressly determined by the Secretary \u201cto not have environmental impacts\u201d and \u201cthe analysis has already been done,\u201d we should not apply \u201ca low threshold rule\u201d such as the fair argument standard \u201cwhen we are dealing with categorical exemptions.\u201d We do not agree. Because the Secretary is only authorized to formulate exemptions that do not have a significant effect on the environment <em>(Chickering, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 205-206), no statutory policy exists in favor of applying categorical exemptions where a fair argument can be made that a project will create a significant effect on the environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> Of course, as to either of these elements, if we perceive a need to interpret the terms used in the exemption, we independently interpret the exemption using a de novo standard of review in our interpretation.

In contrast, Guidelines section 15300.2(c) applies to <em>all </em>types of significant environmental effects. In addition, unlike Guidelines section 15300.2(c), the significant effect element of the urban in-fill exemption, does not require <em>unusual circumstances, </em>but instead, by its terms, applies to a significant effect on traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality caused by <em>any </em>circumstance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> Similarly, comparing the language of the urban in-fill exemption to the language of CEQA section 21151(a), which, as we have explained, first gave rise to the fair argument standard, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>see that the fair argument standard originated with a provision requiring an agency to determine whether a project <em>may </em>have a significant effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\"> We recognize that because \u201c \u2018the administrative] record must disclose substantial evidence of every element of the contended exemption\u2019 \u201d <em>(CalBeach Advocates, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 536), and an agency \u201chas the burden to demonstrate substantial evidence that the ordinance fell within the [exemption]\u201d <em>(Magan, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 475), an agency will often have to conduct a fairly extensive preliminary review to develop substantial evidence that there will be no significant effect on traffic, noise, air quality or water quality for a project that appears to fall under the urban in-fill exemption. Although there may be some theoretical objection to the performance of such a study at the preliminary review stage, the need to perform a thorough analysis \u201csimply to determine whether an activity is subject to CEQA in the first instance\u201d \u201cis not absurd when we consider the principles that a[n] . . . exemption . . . should be strictly construed [citation], and that such strict construction allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>CEQA to be interpreted \u2018 \u201cin such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.\u201d \u2019 . . .

The location of urban in-fill construction next to another building, which might result in blocked views, is not an unusual circumstance for urban in-fill construction, as such construction normally takes place in an already built-up urban environment. \u201c[Wjhether a circumstance is <em>\u2018unusual\u2019 </em>is judged relative to the <em>typical </em>circumstances related to an otherwise typically exempt project.\u201d <em>(Santa Monica Chamber, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 801.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\"> The arguably more logical counterperspective, of course, is that the City issued the initial permits because, at the time, it viewed the <em>whole </em>of the Project as only requiring ministerial approvals (as the Project was proposed as an apartment building at the time), not because it viewed the grading, shoring and pad footings permits as <em>separable </em>from the Project.

The Preservation Group also argues that it clearly objected that the initial permits were issued without environmental review.
