Plaintiffs brought this wrongful death action against several physicians and nurses and their institutions who had been involved in Mrs. Mayes\u2019s treatment, including David C. Bryan, M.D., and Hill Medical Corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>(Dr. Bryan and his corporation are hereinafter referred to as defendants.) Plaintiffs\u2019 theory at trial was that Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligent postoperative interpretation of a lung scan led the other physicians involved to treat Mrs. Mayes for a pulmonary embolism even though she was suffering from a bowel obstruction, and to delay reoperation that could have prevented her death. The jury found that Dr. Bryan was negligent and his negligence was a cause of Mrs. Mayes\u2019s death. Judgment was entered against Dr. Bryan in the amount of $867,107, plus costs of $37,146.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Defendants appeal asserting instructional error. We hold that defendants invited any error in the substantial factor instruction and cannot be heard to complain on appeal. We further hold that the trial court did not err in omitting to instruct the jury on \u201cbut for\u201d causation because that instruction would have been redundant, with the result that the omission did not prejudice defendants. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal challenging the method by which the court calculated the damages Dr. Bryan owes. We affirm the damage calculation. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">1. <em>The testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Thirty-nine-year-old Mrs. Mayes was morbidly obese. She underwent elective laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery (stomach stapling) at Huntington Memorial Hospital on the afternoon of December 11, 2000. Mrs. Mayes was recovering normally the next morning and so she was cleared to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Around 12:00 noon on December 12, 2000, Mrs. Mayes began to experience pain, nausea, and vomiting, which were not controlled by medication. She was given Tylenol with codeine. Her condition deteriorated throughout the day, the postoperative nurses noted at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">Dr. Lourie, Mrs. Mayes\u2019s surgeon, visited the patient on the evening of December 12th. She was crying from pain. He concluded that she was feeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>routine postoperative pain. Around 9:00 p.m., he ordered medication for pain and nausea and postponed her discharge from the hospital. He made no notes and ordered no tests or studies. Despite being medicated, Mrs. Mayes was still suffering fairly severe pain at 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Around 12:00 midnight on December 12th, Mrs. Mayes experienced an increase in blood pressure, and upon returning from the bathroom, she complained of difficulty in breathing and chest pain, became pale and weak, and her heart rate increased beyond normal limits. The nurse paged Dr. Higley, a first-year surgical resident. Dr. Higley called Dr. Diamond, a second-year resident, and told him it looked like Mrs. Mayes had a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a small blood clot that travels along a vein into the lungs and blocks off the blood supply to the lungs. It is a common cause of postoperative death in gastric bypass patients. Dr. Diamond\u2019s first concern was pulmonary embolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">At about 1:00 a.m., on December 13th, Dr. Diamond evaluated Mrs. Mayes and found her \u201cdramatically compromised.\u201d The speed with which Mrs. Mayes\u2019s event occurred, combined with her shortness of breath, fast heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate raised concerns that she had a pulmonary embolism or had suffered a \u201ccardiac event.\u201d To confirm or rule out pulmonary embolism and other possibilities, the doctors needed more definitive tests. Among the tests they ordered were a chest x-ray, EKG, blood analyses, and a ventilation perfusion lung scan (V-Q scan or lung scan).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The lung scan took \u201c[a] little over an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The lab tests showed an elevated white blood cell count, which might occur after surgery or because of pulmonary embolus, infection, or stress. The tests also indicated that bleeding was a consideration, but that likelihood fell very low on Dr. Diamond\u2019s list of possibilities based on the patient\u2019s presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">In terms of a differential diagnosis, i.e., all the possible things that could explain Mrs. Mayes\u2019s symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory results, Dr. Higley listed: pulmonary embolism, bleeding, bowel obstruction, gastric leak, and myocardial infarction, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Mrs. Mayes\u2019s pain was also symptomatic of deep vein thrombosis, another risk associated with abdominal surgery. Mrs. Mayes did not display abdominal pain associated with a bowel obstruction, but she showed other signs of obstruction or leak, such as tenderness, vomiting, increased heart rate, and fever.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Pulmonary embolism remained at the top of Dr. Diamond\u2019s differential diagnosis list. Of the 23 observations, tests, and findings considered, all were consistent with a pulmonary embolism. Dr. Diamond felt Mrs. Mayes\u2019s situation was life threatening. At 1:45 a.m., Dr. Lourie thought she had pulmonary embolism. This was the working diagnosis before the results from the V-Q scan were received.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The lung scan was completed about 2:00 a.m. and the images were transmitted electronically to the home of Dr. Bryan, the on-call radiologist. Dr. Bryan kept no notes about, and has no memory of, his evaluation of the lung scan film. Dr. Higley testified that she spoke to Dr. Bryan on the telephone about 2:00 a.m. <em>Dr Bryan told her that the lung scan showed a \u201chigh probability\u201d of pulmonary embolism. </em>Dr. Higley had Dr. Bryan repeat the results for Dr. Diamond, who was standing next to her. <em>Dr. Higley asked, \u201cdoes that mean the patient is having a P. </em>\u00a3.?\u201d <em>Dr. Bryan responded, \u201cYes.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Dr. Diamond testified, once he was told by Dr. Bryan that the lung scan showed a pulmonary embolism, <em>he no longer considered that Mrs. Mayes was suffering abdominal bleeding, </em>despite blood test results that were consistent with postoperative bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Dr. Diamond called Dr. Lourie to report that \u201cDr. Bryan says this is a P.E.\u201d Told of the test results, including the lung scan interpretation, Dr. Lourie agreed with Dr. Diamond\u2019s assessment. The lung scan result, Dr. Lourie felt, was \u201cfurther confirmation\u201d of overwhelming clinical evidence that Mrs. Mayes had a pulmonary embolism. After receiving Dr. Bryan\u2019s analysis, Dr. Lourie decided that pulmonary critical care specialist Dr. Carmody needed to be called to assist in the evaluation of Mrs. Mayes\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Mrs. Mayes was admitted to the intensive care unit and given two units of blood. Around 2:00 a.m., the doctors considered giving Mrs. Mayes antibiotics. But infection was not high on their list of possible conditions because Mrs. Mayes did not have a temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Told of the lab test results, including Dr. Bryan\u2019s reading of the lung scan, at 3:45 a.m., Dr. Carmody diagnosed Mrs. Mayes with a pulmonary embolism. He explained that the \u201cwhole . . . clinical picture,\u201d along with the data, indicated \u201cfar [and] away\u201d that Mrs. Mayes had a pulmonary embolism. In particular, <em>the lung scan convinced him that Mrs. Mayes needed emergency treatment for pulmonary embolism. </em>Dr. Carmody explained that the \u201chigh probability\u201d result for the lung scan \u201cmade a very difficult decision easier.\u201d Without that information, Dr. Carmody would have discussed the clinical picture with the treating surgeons.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Dr. Carmody treated Mrs. Mayes for pulmonary embolism. She received TPA, a \u201cclot buster\u201d and Heparin to prevent further clots, despite the significant risk of bleeding associated with these medications, and despite obvious indications and the doctors\u2019 suspicion that Mrs. Mayes might have active abdominal bleeding or be in septic shock. Dr. Carmody explained that he weighed the risks associated with giving Mrs. Mayes the extreme measure of TPA, even though she was also showing signs of bleeding. Dr. Carmody explained, once Mrs. Mayes had the TPA, her risk of bleeding increased and she would have to be watched. Dr. Lourie concurred with Dr. Carmody\u2019s treatment. When she was given the TPA and Heparin, several parameters indicated Mrs. Mayes was improving.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Nonetheless, Mrs. Mayes\u2019s condition deteriorated further. Around 8:00 a.m., her white blood cell count was four times that preoperatively, and her temperature jumped to over 102.8 degrees, both indicative of infection and septic shock. These symptoms could have also been present with a pulmonary embolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">At 9:00 a.m., Dr. Andy Wang, a nuclear radiologist along with Dr. Bryan at Hill Medical Corporation, re-reviewed the lung scan along with the chest x-ray, and concluded there was a <em>\u201clow </em>probability\u201d of pulmonary embolism. Dr. Wang did not notify anyone of his finding because a \u201clow probability\u201d scan did not require action and he was not aware of Dr. Bryan\u2019s earlier interpretation of \u201chigh probability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>Mrs. Mayes was in septic shock by 11:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In the early afternoon, a Swan-Ganz catheter, a device that allows for more direct measurement of activity inside the patient\u2019s right atrium, was inserted in Mrs. Mayes\u2019s heart. The results showed early signs of sepsis, as had Mrs. Mayes\u2019s elevated white blood cell count and early morning fever.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Dr. Carmody learned that the lung scan showed a \u201clow probability\u201d for pulmonary embolism at about <em>2:20 in the afternoon. </em>Around this time, he also received test results that indicated changes and complications in Mrs. Mayes\u2019s abdominal area. Within minutes of learning of the scan\u2019s reinterpretation, Dr. Carmody gave the order to cease giving Heparin to Mrs. Mayes and indicated in the patient\u2019s notes <em>\u201cexpect septic </em>picture.\u201d (Italics added.) Antibiotics were first administered to Mrs. Mayes at 2:30 p.m., 12 hours after the first sign of infection appeared, and three hours after she had fallen into septic shock.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">All along, Mrs. Mayes\u2019s condition had been deteriorating as the gastric contents of her stomach leaked into the abdominal cavity. Unless she was taken to surgery to correct it and remove the fluid that had leaked from the stapling line of the stomach, she would continue to deteriorate. She was taken for an operation about 5:00 p.m. The operative findings revealed that she had suffered bleeding and gastric leak after her first operation, causing infection. In the ensuing two months, Mrs. Mayes had 43 exploratory procedures, 11 of which were operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Mrs. Mayes died on February 13, 2001, after cardiac arrest and \u201cmultisystem organ failure\u201d brought on by a bowel obstruction that caused the contents of her stomach to leak into and contaminate her abdominal cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">2. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 experts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case was that Dr. Bryan negligently interpreted and reported the lung scan as showing a \u201chigh probability\u201d for pulmonary embolism. Dr. Bryan\u2019s incorrect diagnosis led the treating physicians to waste a 12-hour window of opportunity\u2014from the evening of December 12, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>there was evidence of bowel obstruction, through the morning of December 13\u2014during which time, Mrs. Mayes\u2019s condition could have been properly identified and her death averted.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Surgeon Edward H. Phillips, testified that the death was preventable by the recognition and treatment of the bowel obstruction or early intervention after the gastric leak became obvious in the morning, by washing out the abdomen. Dr. Phillips testified that Mrs. Mayes\u2019s condition required an operation before the patient went into shock. Once a patient went into shock, the likelihood of death increased rapidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In Dr. Phillips\u2019s opinion, there was an 11- or 12-hour window of opportunity to intervene and treat Mrs. Mayes, starting in the evening of December 12th, when there was evidence of bowel obstruction and gastric leak through the morning of December 13th when Mrs. Mayes went into septic shock. Dr. Bryan read the lung scan in the middle of that 12-hour period. Had Mrs. Mayes been properly diagnosed and treated during that window, Dr. Phillips opined that, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, she would be alive today.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Dr. Phillips explained that Dr. Lourie breached the standard of care in failing to timely order gastrointestinal tests by 9:00 p.m. on December 12th, about five hours before Dr. Bryan interpreted the lung scan, because bowel obstruction is the most common, serious complication of a gastric bypass surgery. According to Dr. Phillips, Dr. Lourie\u2019s failure to order an upper gastrointestinal x-ray on the night of December 12th, and to diagnose a bowel obstruction was a significant factor in causing her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Asked to assume that Dr. Bryan told Dr. Lourie that the V-Q scan showed a \u201clow probability\u201d of pulmonary embolism when the scan was first read in the middle of the night, Dr. Phillips responded that <em>\u201cat that point it was reasonable and prudent to assume she had a leak?\u2019 </em>and do an upper gastrointestinal exam or operate. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Dr. John Morse Luce, a pulmonary and critical care physician, testified for plaintiffs that he did not \u201cbelieve that Tracy Mayes had a pulmonary embolism\u201d \u201cbecause the symptoms and signs that she showed in the early morning hours of December 13th were compatible with other diagnoses that I think were as likely as pulmonary embolism.\u201d Dr. Luce testified he believed the pulmonary embolism diagnosis was false or wrong. Once that diagnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>had been made however, Dr. Luce testified, the doctors \u201cwere reluctant subconsciously to . . . give up that diagnosis and entertain possibly other diagnoses] that might better fit the situation, [f] . . . because of that the fact the patient was actually septic, that is to say had an infection[,] was overlooked in reading of the ventilation perfusion scan . . . .\u201d According to Dr. Luce, the \u201centire chain of events leads to the patient not going to surgery until later than she should have otherwise.\u201d Dr. Luce testified that the possibility of pulmonary embolism was \u201cprobably intermediate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Dr. Fredrick A. Birnberg, plaintiffs\u2019 expert radiologist, opined that Mrs. Mayes\u2019s V-Q scan showed \u201ca low probability\u201d of a pulmonary embolism. But, he also explained why it is important to take a chest x-ray into account when looking at a V-Q lung scan, especially for on-call doctors. Many anatomic defects show up on an x-ray that can help in the interpretation of a V-Q scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">3. <em>Defendants\u2019 case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Defendants took the position that regardless of Dr. Bryan\u2019s interpretation, the doctors would have treated Mrs. Mayes for pulmonary embolism, and that the standard of care required Dr. Lourie to evaluate the gastric leak. Dr. Bryan testified as a percipient witness that Mrs. Mayes\u2019s lung scan did not show a \u201chigh probability,\u201d and there was no way he would have read that scan as showing a \u201chigh probability\u201d score. He was sure that he called it an \u201cintermediate probability,\u201d not a \u201chigh probability\u201d of a pulmonary embolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Defense expert, Dr. David Winsor, opined that regardless of whether the V-Q scan was called in as a \u201clow,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d or \u201chigh probability,\u201d \u201cthere is a significant probability that this patient ha[d] a pulmonary embolism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Defendants also relied on Dr. Birnberg\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that if there were a high clinical probability of a pulmonary embolism, and the lung scan probability were \u201chigh,\u201d then the statistical probability of the patient having the disorder was extremely high. If the clinical probability were high and the V-Q scan probability were \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cintermediate,\u201d there was still a \u201csubstantial chance that the patient could have a pulmonary embolism.\u201d That is, if all the clinical data showed a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism and the V-Q scan revealed an intermediate probability, there was a 66 percent chance of a pulmonary embolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>4. <em>The verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The jury returned a verdict finding defendants negligent in the care and treatment of Mrs. Mayes, and that the negligence was a cause of Mrs. Mayes\u2019s death. The jury found defendants 20 percent responsible and the settling doctors 80 percent responsible for the total damages. The jury assessed a total of $3 million in noneconomic damages, and $1,366,357 in economic damages for a total award of $4,366,357.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">After reducing the damages to reflect the allocation of fault, prior settlements, and the cap pursuant to Civil Code section 3333.2 (the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act or MICRA) in a manner described more fully <em>post, </em>the court entered judgment against Dr. Bryan in the amount of $867,107, plus statutory costs as prevailing party. The court denied plaintiffs\u2019 Code of Civil Procedure section 998 prejudgment interest because their offer of $1 million was more than the amount of the total judgment against the nonsettling party. Defendants and plaintiffs filed their timely appeal and cross-appeal, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">I. <em>Defendants\u2019 appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">a. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">When the sole contention on appeal concerns a jury instruction, we do not view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. Rather, to assess the instruction\u2019s prejudicial impact, we assume the jury might have believed appellant\u2019s evidence and, if properly instructed, might have decided in appellant\u2019s favor. <em>(Logacz v. Limansky </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1152, fn. 2 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 257].) \u201cAccordingly, we state the facts most favorably to the party appealing the instructional error alleged, in accordance with the customary rule of appellate review. [Citation.]\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>Viner </em>v. <em>Sweet </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1224-1225 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 533].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Still, \u201c[i]n a civil case an instructional error is prejudicial reversible error only if it is <em>reasonably probable </em>the appellant would have received a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>favorable result in the absence of the error. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Norman v. Life Care Centers of America, Inc. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1248-1249 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 765], italics added, citing Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.) \u201cAs the <em>Soule </em>court put it, the determination of prejudice depends heavily on \u2018the particular nature of the error, including its natural and probable effect on a party\u2019s ability to place his full case before the jury. [][]... Actual prejudice must be assessed in the context of the individual trial record.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Logacz </em>v. <em>Limansky, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 1156, quoting <em>Soule </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 580-581 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 882 P.2d 298].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Hence, when evaluating the evidence to assess the likelihood that the trial court\u2019s instructional error prejudicially affected the verdict, we \u201cmust also evaluate (1) the state of the evidence, (2) the effect of other instructions, (3) the effect of counsel\u2019s arguments, and (4) any indications by the jury itself that it was misled.\u201d <em>(Soule </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 580-581, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">b. <em>The \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Defendants contend the trial court instructed the jury from an erroneous version of \u201csubstantial factor.\u201d We conclude that defendants may not raise this issue on appeal, as they invited the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">1. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">According to the court clerk, <em>both parties </em>requested and the court gave the following version of the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test from BAJI No. 3.76, with the agreed-upon modifications in italics: \u201cThe law defines cause in its own particular way. The cause of an injury or <em>death </em>is something <em>more likely than not a factor in bringing about </em>the injury <em>or death.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cf. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wraxall </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 120, 132 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 658].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Because draft versions of the Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) were issued during this case, <em>both parties </em>requested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>the court instructed from the following version of CACI No. 431 on multiple causes, with the agreed-upon modifications in italics: \u201cA person\u2019s negligence may combine with another factor to cause <em>death. </em>If you find that Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligence was <em>a cause </em>of Tracy Mayes\u2019s <em>death, </em>then Dr. Bryan is responsible for the <em>death. </em>Dr. Bryan cannot avoid responsibility just because some other person, condition, or event was also <em>a cause </em>of Tracy Mayes\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">There is no transcript of the proceedings during which the jury instructions were discussed, selected, and modified. We have been provided only with the reporter\u2019s transcript from the argument concerning defendants\u2019 motion for mistrial. It shows that the following occurred: After the jury had been deliberating for six hours, counsel for defendants notified the court that she believed that CACI No. 431, as given, was improperly worded. Defendants moved either for mistrial or for an additional instruction about \u201csubstantial factor.\u201d Defendants claimed that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney surreptitiously altered the language of CACI No. 431 by excluding the word \u201csubstantial\u201d from the instruction. Defense counsel noted that she had objected during plaintiffs\u2019 closing argument but was overruled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The court responded by recounting its memory of the events. \u201cWe had gone over all the jury instructions. This is my recollection .... [j[] In going over instructions, we looked at [BAJI No.] 3.76. We all agreed for medical malpractice case it had to be tailored .... [f] ... I think there were alternatives posed to the court, one of which was CACI. I said that appears to be an appropriate instruction to give. So we tailored it. He [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] didn\u2019t tailor it. [f] [Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney] brought it in exactly the way we had talked about it <em>because I compared it.... We had talked about this particular instruction and </em>[plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] <em>brought it in exactly this way. </em>[][]... It appeared to be [jz\u2018c] order. It did not appear to be any different and we talked about it. I thereafter read to the jury. No objection whatsoever from defense. . . . There was no objection whatsoever.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney remembered that the new phrase \u201cmore likely than not\u201d in BAJI No. 3.76 was defendants\u2019 idea. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel further explained that, once they modified BAJI No. 3.76 defining \u201csubstantial factor,\u201d then CACI No. 431, which normally includes the phrase \u201csubstantial factor\u201d had to be modified. As plaintiffs\u2019 attorney stated: \u201c[T]he way the court instructed or ordered that instruction 3.76 be modified required that CACI 431 correlate to it. You can\u2019t leave \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in 431 when you have . . . taken that definition out of 3.76. [][] <em>[The </em>defense] <em>was apprised of all of that information, not just in writing, but also in discussions we had and then ultimately the copies that were brought in as was ordered by the court, to give [the </em>defense] <em>a copy. She </em>[defense counsel] <em>was going through them as 1 was doing my argument. </em>We obviously read 3.76 and CACI 431 because she [defense counsel] got up on argument and used them in argument.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Defendants\u2019 attorney denied having proposed the change and argued that she was unaware until the mistrial motion that the instruction had been changed. The court responded that the instruction had been tailored exactly as the defense wanted it. The court repeated its recollection of the events: \u201cWe talked about a legal cause. <em>We all agreed. We went over the language. You agreed. </em>[][] I read the instructions to the jury. <em>You agreed. You never once objected. </em>Now because the jury has been deliberating for some six hours, apparently you are getting nervous about the case. Now you bring this up and want to make an argument about this.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court denied defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">2. <em>Application.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Defendants contend that the court erred in giving the version of BAJI No. 3.76 on \u201csubstantial factor\u201d that it gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">\u201cIt is an elementary principle of appellate law that \u2018[a] party may not complain of the giving of instructions which he has requested. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fortman v. Hemco, Inc. </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 241, 255 [259 Cal.Rptr. 311].) \u201cThe invited error doctrine applies \u2018with particular force in the area of jury instructions. Whereas in criminal cases a court has strong sua sponte duties to instruct the jury on a wide variety of subjects, a court in a civil case has no parallel responsibilities. A civil litigant must propose complete instructions in accordance with his or her theory of the litigation and a trial court is not \u201cobligated to seek out theories [a party] might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>advanced, or to articulate for him that which he has left unspoken.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stevens v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1645, 1653 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 525].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Defendants deny having requested the modifications. As appellants, defendants bear the burden of presenting a sufficient record to establish that the claimed error was <em>not </em>invited by them, or be barred from complaining about it on appeal. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Noble </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 163, 169 [323 P.2d 385], italics added.) In the absence of a reporter\u2019s transcript of the discussions between the court and the parties, we rely on the transcript, above quoted, of the argument on defendants\u2019 motion for new trial. That record shows that defense counsel did deny requesting the change to the BAJI No. 3.76 \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction that was given. The record also shows that the trial court found to the contrary, that the defense had <em>requested the modifications made. </em>We may not second-guess the trial court\u2019s finding, particularly so when the record is inadequate. Defendants cannot be heard to complain on appeal that the instruction was improperly worded.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In their reply brief, defendants argue they objected to the modified instructions before the jury reached a verdict. Although defendants posed an objection to their own instruction during plaintiffs\u2019 closing argument, the objection seemed to the trial court to be directed to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s argument, not to the word choice in the instruction. It appears that defendants first complained that their own instruction was badly worded only after the jury had been deliberating for <em>six hours. </em>While appellate courts \u201chave broad discretion to decide whether to consider a tardily raised legal issue[, w]e are more inclined to do so when matters of important public interest or public policy are involved. [Citation.] If the matter is important enough, we may consider it even though the appellant adopted an inconsistent position in the trial court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stevens </em>v. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1654.) This case presents no urgent public interest or policy justifying reaching the issue, especially because any error was invited.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">More important, the instructions as given did not prejudice defendants. First, the BAJI No. 3.76 instruction adequately provided an alternative meaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d factor, i.e., \u201cmore likely than not\u201d a factor. <em>(Osborn v. Irwin Memorial Blood Bank </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 234, 253 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 101], quoting from Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 433B, com. b., p. 443 [plaintiff need only show \u201c \u2018it is more probable that the event was caused by tire defendant than that it was not\u2019 \u201d].) Second, the instruction did not fail to inform the jury that a substantial factor must be more than \u201cremote or trivial,\u201d as <em>more likely than not </em>is inherently more than remote or trivial. (Cf. <em>Osborn, supra, </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Cal.App.4th 234.) Finally, CACI No. 431 as given was not misleading because it used the word \u201ccause\u201d\u2014\u201cif you find that Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligence was <em>a cause of </em>Tracy Mayes\u2019s death\u201d\u2014and \u201ccause\u201d was adequately defined for the jury in the modified BAJI No. 3.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">c. <em>The \u201cbut for\u201d instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Defendants contend that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on \u201cbut for\u201d causation. We conclude there was no error, but even if there were, defendants were not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">\u201c \u2018Parties have the \u201cright to have the jury instructed as to the law applicable to all their theories of the case which were supported by the pleadings and the evidence, whether or not that evidence was considered persuasive by the trial court.\u201d [Citation.] \u201cA reviewing court must review the evidence most favorable to the contention that the requested instruction is applicable since the parties are entitled to an instruction thereon if the evidence so viewed could establish the elements of the theory presented. [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Logacz v. Limansky, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 1157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Defendants requested that the trial court instruct the jury as follows: \u201cPlaintiff must show that one or more of the defendants was a cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. To be a cause of injury, plaintiff must show that but for the alleged malpractice, it is more likely than not the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable result. [][] Based on <em>Viner v. Sweet.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court rejected defendants\u2019 proposed instruction. There is no indication that defendants withdrew their request for, or invited any error with respect to, the \u201cbut for\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">According to defendants\u2019 theory of the case, Dr. Bryan was not a cause of death because, they argue, the physicians would have treated Mrs. Mayes for pulmonary embolism anyway. That is, defendants argue, Mrs. Mayes would not have obtained a better result even if Dr. Bryan had not breached the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">1. <em>The law of causation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The proper test for proving causation is the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test. <em>(Espinosa v.

The \u201ccausation element of negligence is satisfied when the plaintiff establishes (1) that the defendant\u2019s breach of duty . . . was a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s harm and (2) that there is no rule of law relieving the defendant of liability.\u201d <em>(Leslie G. </em>v. <em>Perry &amp; Associates </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 481 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 785]; accord, <em>Rosh v.

With respect to causation, the majority in <em>Mitchell </em>disapproved as misleading BAJI No. 3.75, which contained a \u201cbut for\u201d test of causation (54 Cal.3d at pp. 1048-1049), and held that BAJI No. 3.76, which employs the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test of cause in fact (54 Cal.3d at p. 1049), should be given in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\"><em>Mitchell </em>reasoned that \u201cBAJI Nos. 3.75 and 3.76 are <em>alternative </em>instructions that <em>should not jointly be given in a single lawsuit. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1049, first italics in original, second italics added.) After concluding that BAJI No. 3.75 was grammatically confusing and conceptually misleading (54 Cal.3d at pp. 1050-1052, 1054), and after noting the praise BAJI No. 3.76 received (54 Cal.3d at p. 1052), the Supreme Court held that use of the latter instruction would avoid the confusion inherent in BAJI No. 3.75. (54 Cal.3d at p. 1054.) <em>Mitchell </em>reasoned that <em>\u201cthe \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test subsumes the \u2018but for\u2019 test. </em>\u2018If the conduct which is claimed to have caused the injury had nothing at all to do with the injuries, it could not be said that the conduct was a factor, let alone a substantial factor, in the production of the injuries.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1052, italics added.) The court explained that while the substantial factor instruction assists in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>resolution of the problem of independent causes, it is also useful in resolving two other types of cases: (1) \u201c \u2018where a similar, but not identical result would have followed without the defendants\u2019 act;\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201c \u2018where one defendant has made a clearly proved but quite insignificant contribution to the result, as where he throws a lighted match into a forest fire. <em>But in the great majority of cases, it produces the same legal conclusion as the but-for </em>test.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1052-1053, italics added.) \u201c \u2018[N]o case has been found where the defendant\u2019s act could be called a substantial factor when the event would have occurred without it; nor will cases very often arise where it would not be such a factor when it was so indispensable a cause that without it the result would not have followed.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1053.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, BAJI No. 3.76 was an adequate instruction in <em>Mitchell </em>as a substitute for the discarded instruction containing the \u201cbut for\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"AB4\">More recently, in <em>Viner v. Sweet </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1232 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 70 P.3d 1046] <em>(Viner), </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen the alleged malpractice occurred in the performance of transactional [legal] work ... the client [must] prove this causation element according to the \u2018but for\u2019 test, meaning that the harm or loss would not have occurred without the attorney\u2019s malpractice[.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1235.) <em>Viner </em>rejected the appellate court\u2019s holding that a plaintiff suing an attorney for transactional malpractice need not show that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of the attorney\u2019s negligence. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1240.) \u201cIn a litigation malpractice action, the plaintiff must establish that <em>but for </em>the alleged negligence of the defendant attorney, the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the action in which the malpractice allegedly occurred. The purpose of this requirement, which has been in use for more than 120 years, is to safeguard against speculative and conjectural claims. [Citation.] It serves the essential purpose of ensuring that damages awarded for the attorney\u2019s malpractice actually have been caused by the malpractice. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1241.) <em>Viner </em>saw \u201cnothing distinctive about transactional malpractice that would justify a relaxation of, or departure from, the well-established requirement in negligence cases that the plaintiff establish causation by showing either (1) <em>but for </em>the negligence, the harm would not have occurred, or (2) the negligence was a concurrent independent cause of the harm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1240-1241, original italics.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Defendants cite <em>Viner </em>for the proposition that even if plaintiffs demonstrated that defendants\u2019 conduct was a <em>substantial factor </em>in bringing about Mrs. Mayes\u2019s injury, that plaintiffs must also prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Yet, <em>Viner, </em>a legal malpractice case, did not require that a jury be instructed on both the \u201cbut for\u201d and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d tests. <em>Viner </em>acknowledged that <em>Mitchell </em>did not repudiate the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test. <em>(Viner, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 1239-1240, citing <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1052.) Rather, the Supreme Court has repeatedly restated its view that <em>\u201cthe \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test subsumes the traditional \u2018but for\u2019 test </em>of causation.\u201d <em>(Viner, </em>at p. 1240.) They are both tests of causation in fact. (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal.

The \u2018but for\u2019 rule has traditionally been applied to determine cause in fact. [Citations.] [][] The Restatement formula uses the term <em>substantial factor </em>\u2018to denote the fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (6 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 1185, pp. 552-553, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Indeed, the fact that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is included in the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d definition has been recognized by the Judicial Council in revising CACI No. 430, the new substantial factor instruction. The summer 2005 revision of this instruction reads: \u201cA substantial factor in causing harm is a factor that a reasonable person would consider to have contributed to the harm. It must be more than a remote or trivial factor. It does not have to be the only cause of the harm. [][] [Conduct is not a substantial factor in causing harm if the same harm would have occurred without that conduct.]\u201d (CACI No. 430 (rev. ed. Summer 2005), underscoring in original.) The directions for use of CACI No. 430 state clearly, <em>\u201cAs phrased, this definition of \u2018substantial factor\u2019 subsumes the \u2018but for\u2019 test of causation, </em>e.g., plaintiff must prove that but for defendant\u2019s conduct, the same harm would not have occurred. [Citation.] <em>The first sentence of the instruction accounts for the \u2018but for\u2019 concept. </em>Conduct does not \u2018contribute\u2019 to harm if the same harm would have occurred without such conduct.\u201d {Ibid., italics added, citing <em>Viner, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 1239-1240; accord, CACI No. 430 (rev. ed. Dec. 2005).) There is no requirement in either recent revision of CACI No. 430 that the bracketed language be used <em>in addition to </em>the first sentence of the instruction. Rather, both versions of CACI No. 430 explained that the additional bracketed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>language <em>\u201cmay </em>be used . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court is not <em>required </em>to instruct from both tests of cause in fact unless the state of the evidence suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">2. <em>Application of the law to this case; the court did not err in declining to instruct on \u201cbut for\u201d and defendants were not prejudiced by the ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Reviewing the evidence as we must <em>(Logacz v. Limansky, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 1152, fn. 2), we conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on \u201cbut for\u201d causation because the jury was instructed on \u201csubstantial factor\u201d and \u201cbut for\u201d is subsumed under the substantial factor test. <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1052; <em>Viner, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 1239-1240.) Hence, a \u201cbut for\u201d instruction would have been redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">On this record there is no likelihood that, instructed on \u201cbut for,\u201d the jury could have found Dr. Bryan was <em>not </em>a cause in fact of Mrs. Mayes\u2019s death. Defendants contend that the clinicians would have treated Mrs. Mayes for pulmonary embolism anyway.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They cite Dr. Winsor\u2019s testimony that \u201cthere is a significant probability that this patient ha[d] a pulmonary embolism\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Dr. Bimberg\u2019s testimony as support for their assertion that there was a 66 percent chance of a pulmonary embolism.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although Dr. Winsor found a significant probability that the patient had a pulmonary embolism, <em>there was no evidence that the clinicians would have treated Mrs. Mayes for that problem if Dr. Bryan had reported a \u201clow\u201d or even \u201cintermediate\u201d probability, </em>defendants\u2019 assertion to the contrary notwithstanding. To the contrary, the testimony from Drs. Carmody, Diamond, and Luce is that the clinicians considered gastric leak and bowel obstruction as possibilities, albeit low on the differential diagnosis list, until they received Dr. Bryan\u2019s scan interpretation because that interpretation <em>conclusively influenced </em>the decision to treat Mrs. Mayes for pulmonary embolism and to <em>cease </em>considering other diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">There is no evidentiary support for defendants\u2019 contention that Mrs. Mayes would have died even had Dr. Bryan not acted negligently. Apart from the many witnesses who testified that the \u201chigh probability\u201d analysis persuaded them that Mrs. Mayes had a pulmonary embolism, and Dr. Luce\u2019s testimony that the treating physicians were misled by Dr. Bryan\u2019s interpretation, Dr. Carmody specifically testified that <em>without </em>Dr. Bryan\u2019s lung scan analysis of \u201chigh probability,\u201d he would have discussed the entire clinical picture with the treating doctors. Instead, he rushed in on an emergency basis to give her \u201cclot busting\u201d medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Defendants assert that \u201ca low probability interpretation would <em>not </em>have yielded the decedent a better result.\u201d To the contrary, the evidence shows that immediately upon learning that Dr. Wang reinterpreted Mrs. Mayes\u2019s scan and found it to show a \u201clow probability,\u201d Dr. Carmody ordered that the treatment for pulmonary embolism be stopped. Asked to assume that Dr. Bryan reported a \u201clow probability\u201d interpretation, Dr. Phillips testified, \u201cat that point it was reasonable to assume she had a leak.\u201d The only logical conclusion that the jury could reach from this testimony was that had it not been for Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligent interpretation of the V-Q scan, the 12-hour window of opportunity would not have been squandered and Mrs. Mayes could have been properly treated in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>In short, the evidence does not support defendants\u2019 contention that the clinicians would have treated Mrs. Mayes for pulmonary embolism regardless of Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Moreover, even if, per <em>Viner, </em>courts in medical malpractice cases must now instruct juries on both \u201csubstantial factor\u201d and \u201cbut for,\u201d we conclude on the whole record here that no prejudice resulted from the lack of \u201cbut for\u201d instruction. <em>(Soule v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 580-581.) Looking at the instructions on causation given <em>(id. </em>at p. 580), the jury was instructed on \u201csubstantial factor,\u201d and the concept of \u201cbut for\u201d is necessarily included within. Not only would a \u201cbut for\u201d instruction have been redundant according to <em>Mitchell, Viner, </em>and the revised versions of CACI No. 430 that defendants cite, but the jury impliedly found \u201cbut for\u201d causation when it found that Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligent interpretation of the lung scan was a substantial factor in causing Mrs. Mayes\u2019s death. This is so because for the jury to find that Dr. Bryan was a substantial factor in Mrs. Mayes\u2019s mistreatment, it necessarily concluded that Mrs. Mayes\u2019s injury would not have happened without Dr. Bryan\u2019s negligence. There was no likelihood that the jury was misled. The verdict was not close; the jury found causation by a ratio of 11 to 1. It did not request a rereading of the instructions. Nor was anything said in the closing arguments that could be construed as reasonably misleading. Consequently, it is not reasonably probable defendants would have received a more favorable result even had the court instructed on \u201cbut for\u201d causation. <em>(Soule v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 580-581.) The trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on \u201cbut for\u201d did not prejudice defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">II. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 sole assignment of error lies in the court\u2019s calculation of damages, specifically, the computation of noneconomic damages. They posited two approaches, either of which, together with costs of $37,146.22, would have permitted plaintiffs to obtain their Code of Civil Procedure section 998 prejudgment interest on their offer of $1 million in settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The jury awarded plaintiffs $3 million in noneconomic damages, and $1,366,357 in economic damages, for a total verdict of $4,366,357. The jury determined that defendants\u2019 proportionate liability was 20 percent, and the settling parties\u2019 was 80 percent. Plaintiffs recovered a total of $650,000 from the settling defendants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>Following <em>Gilman v. Beverly California Corp. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 121 [283 Cal.Rptr. 17], and <em>Espinoza v. Machonga </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 268 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 498], the trial court computed the award by first reducing the noneconomic damage award from $3 million to $250,000 pursuant to MICRA, for a total damage award of $1,616,357 ($1,366,357 + $250,000). Based on this new number, the court then calculated the ratio of economic to total damages to be 84.5 percent ($1,366,357 = 84.5% x $1,616,357). The court then calculated that defendants were entitled to a benefit setoff of $549,250 from the economic portion of the proceeds of the settlement with the settling defendants (84.5% x $650,000 = $549,250). The court finally considered the jury\u2019s allocation to defendants of 20 percent liability pursuant to Proposition 51 for a total of $50,000 in noneconomic damages. The equation looked like this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">$1,366,357 Total economic damages awarded</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGY\">- 549,250 Economic portion of settlement subject to setoff</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApB\">$817,107 Defendants\u2019 share of remaining economic damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATz\">+ 50,000 Defendants\u2019 20 percent share of MICRA cap</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY1\">$867,107 Defendants\u2019 liability to plaintiffs</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that it was unfair for the court to first reduce the noneconomic verdict of $3 million to the statutory MICRA maximum of $250,000 and then reduce it further under Proposition 51 to reflect the percentage of fault attributed to the settlement plaintiffs received.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">The issue here is the interplay between MICRA (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3333.2), Proposition 51 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1431.2), and settlements with other tortfeasors who are subject to MICRA. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Civil Code section 3333.2, an essential part of MICRA, limits the size of any award of noneconomic damages in an action for injury against a health care provider based on professional negligence. <em>(Johnson v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 869, 878 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 650].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Proposition 51 eliminated joint and several liability for noneconomic damages but retained it for economic damages. <em>(DaFonte v. Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 600 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140].) Accordingly, Civil Code section 1431.2, subdivision (a) states, \u201cIn any action for personal injury . . . based upon principles of comparative fault, the liability of each defendant for noneconomic damages shall be several only and shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>joint. Each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant\u2019s percentage of fault, and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Under section 877, \u201ca good faith settlement cuts off the right of other defendants to seek contribution or comparative indemnity from the settling defendant [and] the nonsettling defendants obtain in return a reduction in their ultimate liability to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Abbott Ford, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 858, 873 [239 Cal-Rptr. 626, 741 P.2d 124].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In support of their contention that the court should have applied Proposition 51 before reducing noneconomic damages to the $250,000 MICRA cap, plaintiffs rely on <em>McAdory v. Rogers </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1273 [264 Cal.Rptr. 71]. In a medical malpractice action, the <em>McAdory </em>jury found that the plaintiff had suffered noneconomic damages of $370,000 and was herself 22 percent comparatively negligent. The appellate court held that the trial court had erred in reducing the noneconomic damages to the MICRA limit first and then apportioning each party\u2019s fault. <em>McAdory </em>explained that MICRA was intended to cap the recovery of noneconomic damages rather than the damages the plaintiff actually suffers. The appellate court reasoned that as the result of MICRA, the plaintiff was \u201calready recovering an amount less than the jury determined he or she was damaged by the tortious conduct of others .... No purpose would be served by further reducing that plaintiff\u2019s award.\u201d (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 1279.) The <em>McAdory </em>court saw \u201cno legitimate or logical reason for reducing [the noneconomic damage] award to the $250,000 cap . . . <em>before </em>reducing it further due to Mrs. McAdory\u2019s 22 percent comparative fault.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1281, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\"><em>Atkins v. Strayhom </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1380 [273 Cal.Rptr. 231] followed <em>McAdory </em>in holding that the trial court had properly applied the jury\u2019s <em>comparative fault </em>finding before reducing the noneconomic damages under MICRA. <em>(Atkins, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1392-1393.) <em>Atkins </em>also reasoned that the language of Civil Code section 3333.2 limited \u201cthe <em>recovery </em>rather than the value of noneconomic damages as a means of protecting the insurability of health care providers.\u201d <em>(Atkins, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1393.) <em>McAdory </em>and <em>Atkins </em>involved the interplay between MICRA and the plaintiffs\u2019 comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>By contrast, <em>Gilman v. Beverly California Corp., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d 121, relied on by the trial court here, construed the relationship between MICRA and Proposition 51. (231 Cal.App.3d at p. 128.) In <em>Gilman, </em>the children of a nursing home patient brought a wrongful death action based on medical malpractice against the operator of the nursing home. The decedent\u2019s physician was insolvent and not joined in the action but his fault was assessed. <em>(Gilman, supra, </em>at p. 126.) <em>Gilman </em>held that the trial court must apply the MICRA cap to the total noneconomic damage award before it determined the pro rata liability of each defendant. (231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 128-130.) The reason, according to <em>Gilman, </em>was that because the plaintiff could not recover more than $250,000 in noneconomic damages from all health care providers for one injury, the noneconomic damages should be apportioned based on the relative fault of each health care provider. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><em>Gilman </em>distinguished <em>McAdory </em>and <em>Atkins, </em>explaining that neither case \u201cdealt with the interplay between Proposition 51 and the MICRA cap. Rather, they dealt with the interrelationship between <em>comparative negligence principles </em>and MICRA.\u201d <em>(Gilman v. Beverly California Corp., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 126, italics added.) By comparison, <em>Gilman </em>explained, \u201cProposition 51 . . . implicates very different considerations from those implicated in the <em>McAdory </em>and <em>Atkins </em>cases. Prior to the adoption of Proposition 51, multiple tortfeasors were ordinarily jointly and severally liable for <em>all </em>damages caused to an injured plaintiff where their acts contributed to the injury. This resulted in \u2018some situations in which defendants who bore only a small share of fault for an accident could be left with the obligation to pay all or a large share of plaintiff\u2019s damages if other more culpable tortfeasors were insolvent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gilman </em>v. <em>Beverly California Corp., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 127, original italics, quoting <em>Evangelatos v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1198 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585].) In <em>Gilman, </em>because more than one responsible defendant was subject to the MICRA, the court apportioned the MICRA limit among them. <em>(Gilman, </em>at pp. 128-129.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\"><em>Gilman </em>rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the court should first deduct from the jury\u2019s verdict the percentage of fault attributable to the other joint or concurrent tortfeasors and then reduce the amount to $250,000. \u201c[I]t is clear that apportioning damages in this manner would effectively defeat the stated purposes of Proposition 51\u2014to limit the potential liability of an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>defendant for noneconomic damages to a proportion commensurate with that defendant\u2019s personal share of fault.\u201d <em>(Gilman v. Beverly California Corp., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The <em>Gilman </em>plaintiffs also argued they should be compensated up to the MICRA limit even if some tortfeasors had not paid their share of the noneconomic damages. <em>Gilman </em>rejected that argument, stating: \u201cIf any of the concurrent tortfeasors is insolvent, the liability of the other tortfeasors remains unchanged.\u201d <em>(Gilman v. Beverly California Corp., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 129, fn. 10.) Unlike cases involving the comparative liability of the plaintiff, when fashioning an award under both Proposition 51 and MICRA, the court should \u201cnot take into account whether <em>other tortfeasors </em>paid their proportional share. This is clearly the import of Proposition 51.\u201d <em>(Gilman, </em>at p. 130, italics added.) \u201cThe express purpose of Proposition 51 was to eliminate the perceived unfairness of imposing \u2018all the damage\u2019 on defendants who were \u2018found to share [only] a fraction of the fault.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Da<em>Fonte v. Up-Right, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 603.) Hence, under Civil Code section 1431.2, a \u201c \u2018defendant\u2019s]\u2019 liability for noneconomic damages cannot exceed his or her proportionate share of fault <em>as compared with all fault responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, </em>not merely that of \u2018defendant^]\u2019 present in the lawsuit. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(DaFonte, supra, </em>at p. 603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">In this case, where more than one defendant shares responsibility for plaintiffs\u2019 injury, and plaintiffs were not at fault, the trial court properly followed the <em>Gilman </em>approach. As in <em>Gilman, </em>this case involves the interplay between MICRA and the percentages of fault of the various defendants under Proposition 51. <em>McAdory </em>and <em>Atkins </em>are irrelevant because neither case involved the allocation of fault to multiple defendants at issue here, and both cases involved an offset to damages for <em>the plaintiff\u2019s own comparative fault, </em>whereas comparative negligence principles are not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Applying the reasoning of <em>Gilman, </em>each defendant is only responsible for the percentage of noneconomic damages in proportion to his or her proportionate fault. The $250,000 MICRA maximum for noneconomic damages must be apportioned according to Proposition 51. <em>(Gilman v. Beverly California Corp., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 127-128.) Defendants are not responsible for making up the amounts the settling parties did not pay. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 129.) Hence, the trial court here properly reduced the noneconomic verdict to the $250,000 MICRA cap before it applied the Proposition 51 percentage to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>Plaintiffs proposed that the proportion of economic damages to the total should be calculated <em>before </em>the MICRA cap is imposed. Hence, the proportion would be 31.31 percent ($1,366,367 total pre-MICRA divided by $4,366,357) times the settlement of $650,000 (31.31 x $650,000 = $203,450). Their math looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">$1,366,357 Economic damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">- 203,450 Economic portion of settlement subject to setoff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">+ 50,000 MICRA cap reduced by defendants\u2019 20 percent fault</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">$1,212,907</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">However, as noted, this computation runs afoul of the care of <em>Gilman </em>to assure that the liability of an individual defendant for noneconomic damages was limited to an amount commensurate with that defendant\u2019s personal share of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Alternatively, plaintiffs posited a \u201ccommon-sense approach\u201d under which they added the economic damages of $1,366,357 and the MICRA noneconomic damages of $250,000 for a total of $1,616,357. They then subtracted <em>the entire $650,000 settlement with codefendants, </em>yielding a total of $966,357.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">$1,366,357 Economic damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-12\">+ 250,000 Noneconomic damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-13\">- 650,000 Offset of entire settlement with the other defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">$966,357</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">This proposal ignores the Proposition 51 requirement that defendants\u2019 liability for noneconomic damages not exceed their 20 percent share based on the jury\u2019s determination that they were only 20 percent at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ccommon-sense approach\u201d offends Proposition 51. Plaintiffs should bear the burden of undercontribution of the settling parties. <em>(DaFonte v. Up-Right, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 604, fn. 6.) By comparison, the computation that the trial court employed here maximizes plaintiffs\u2019 recovery in that they recover all of the nonsettling defendants\u2019 20 percent responsibility for noneconomic damages, but no more. In sum, plaintiffs have shown no error in the calculation of noneconomic damages. Consequently, plaintiffs may not recover their prejudgment interest based on their Code of Civil Procedure section 998 offer to compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

Jennings </em>concerned the admissibility of expert testimony in a medical malpractice case. That testimony was struck because, among other things, it was too speculative to satisfy the standard that it was <em>\u201cmore probable than not </em>[that] the negligent act was a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1118.)
