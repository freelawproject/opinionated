The assignee brought three lawsuits, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1800, to avoid and recover preferential transfers. In the published portion of this opinion, we disagree with the majority opinion in <em>Sherwood Partners, Inc. v. Lycos, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 394 F.3d 1198 <em>(Sherwood </em>Partners), and conclude that Code of Civil Procedure section 1800 is not preempted by the federal Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">On August 1, 2001, Carolyn\u2019s Country Pies, Inc. (Carolyn\u2019s) executed a voluntary general assignment for the benefit of creditors. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 493.010.) Plaintiff David R. Haberbush (Haberbush) was the assignee. In his capacity as assignee for the benefit of Carolyn\u2019s creditors, Haberbush brought three lawsuits, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1800, to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1634\">*1634</page-number>and recover certain payments as preferential transfers. Haberbush obtained judgments in each of the three cases, subject to a setoff of $150,000 for sums advanced to Haberbush that were found to have accrued to the benefit of Carolyn\u2019s creditors. The defendants in each case\u2014Charles and Dorothy Cummins Family Limited Partnership (Cummins FLP), Barry L. Vantiger (Vantiger) and Gemmel Pharmacy Group, Inc. (Gemmel)\u2014appealed, and Haberbush cross-appealed on the setoff issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">We summarize first the applicable legal principles. Then, in the unpublished portion of the opinion, we describe the general substance of the lawsuits Haberbush filed and the proceedings in the trial court that resulted in the judgments for Haberbush.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">I. <em>The Legal Principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1800, the assignee of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors may recover any transfer of the property of the assignor\u2014to whom we will refer as the debtor\u2014under certain conditions. Transfers of the debtor\u2019s property may be recovered by the assignee if the transfer was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-8\">(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-9\">(2) on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before the transfer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-10\">(3) while the debtor was insolvent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-11\">(4) within 90 days before the assignment, or between 90 days and one year before the assignment if the creditor, at the time of the transfer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-12\">(a) was an \u201cinsider,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-13\">(b) had reasonable cause to believe the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-14\">(5) the transfer enables the creditor to receive more than another creditor of the same class. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1800, subd. (b).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-15\">There are several exceptions to the assignee\u2019s power to recover transfers, such as contemporaneous exchanges for new value given to the debtor, payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee, and so on. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1800, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1635\">*1635</page-number>II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">I. <em>Code of Civil Procedure Section 1800 Is Not Preempted by the Federal Bankruptcy Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">After these appeals were filed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion in <em>Sherwood Partners, </em>supra, 394 F.3d 1198. Over a dissent, the majority in <em>Sherwood Partners </em>concluded the federal Bankruptcy Code (title 11 of the United States Code) preempts the California statute giving the assignee the power to void preferential transfers. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1800.) Cummins FLP, Vantiger and Gemmel raised the issue of preemption in their brief on appeal. Because preemption is a question of subject matter jurisdiction (see <em>De Tomaso v. Pan American World Airways, Inc. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 517, 520, fn. 1 [235 Cal.Rptr. 292, 733 P.2d 614]), and in this case presents a question of law not dependent upon any factual determinations, the issue is properly before this court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">We begin with a review of the principles governing the question whether a state law has been preempted by federal law, as summarized in <em>Sherwood Partners. </em>Congress has the authority to preempt state laws. Whether it has done so in a particular case is a question of congressional intent. Congress may preempt state laws expressly, or its intent to do so may be inferred \u201cwhere it is clear from the statute and surrounding circumstances that Congress intended to occupy the field, leaving no room for state regulation.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1200.) The United States Supreme Court has observed that, while various expressions of the governing principle have been employed, the court\u2019s primary function in deciding a preemption issue is to determine whether the state\u2019s law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 52, 67 [85 L.Ed. 581, 61 S.Ct. 399] <em>(Hines); </em>see <em>Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at pp. 1200-1201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1636\">*1636</page-number>According to the <em>Sherwood Partners </em>majority, the assignee\u2019s powers to avoid and recover preferential transfers cannot peaceably coexist with the federal bankruptcy scheme. The assignee\u2019s avoidance powers, the court concluded, are inconsistent with the operation of the bankruptcy system, and \u201ctrench too close\u201d upon the exercise of the federal trustee\u2019s power to avoid preferential transfers. <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at pp. 1202, 1204-1206.) <em>Sherwood Partners </em>explains that the Bankruptcy Code embodies two goals: a fresh start for the debtor and the equitable distribution of the debtor\u2019s assets among competing creditors. Because state statutes purporting to discharge debtors from their obligations (the first goal) are preempted (e.g., <em>Pobreslo </em>v. <em>Joseph M. Boyd Co. </em>(1933) 287 U.S. 518, 524-525 [77 L.Ed. 469, 52 S.Ct. 262, 53 S.Ct. 262] <em>(Pobreslo)), Sherwood Partners </em>asserts that \u201cstate statutes that implicate the federal bankruptcy law\u2019s other major goal, namely equitable distribution,\u201d are likewise preempted. <em>(Sherwood Partners, </em>at p. 1203.) The reasoning of the <em>Sherwood Partners </em>majority is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-4\">\u2014The trustee\u2019s power to avoid preferential transfers and recover the funds for distribution to creditors is exercised under the supervision of the federal courts, and the trustee is appointed by the United States Trustee or elected by the creditors, not hand-picked by the debtor (as is the assignee under state law). Federal law protects creditors from the trustee\u2019s possible conflicts of interest and other possible sources of self-dealing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-5\">\u2014If a state assignee under Code of Civil Procedure section 1800 recovers a preferential transfer and distributes its proceeds to creditors, a federal trustee will be precluded from recovering the same sum if a federal bankruptcy proceeding is begun. \u201cThe distribution of the recovered sum will then have been made by a state assignee subject to state procedures and substantive standards, rather than by the federal trustee subject to bankruptcy law\u2019s substantive standards and procedural protections.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1204.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-6\">\u2014Once state proceedings are commenced, \u201cthey will affect the incentives of various parties as to whether they wish to avail themselves of federal bankruptcy law.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1205.) The creditor whose transfer the assignee avoids \u201cmay have a new incentive to begin an involuntary federal proceeding; other creditors . . . may have diminished incentives\u201d because they may share in the funds recovered by the assignee \u201cand might therefore have no interest in invoking the potentially more expensive and time-consuming federal processes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>According to the <em>Sherwood Partners </em>majority, Congress did not contemplate \u201cstate laws that would sharpen or blunt the effect\u201d of statutory incentives for the initiation of federal bankruptcy proceedings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1637\">*1637</page-number><em>Sherwood Partners </em>thus concludes that \u201cstatutes that give state assignees .. . avoidance powers beyond those that may be exercised by individual creditors trench too close upon the exercise of the federal bankruptcy power.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">We are constrained to disagree with the analysis in <em>Sherwood Partners, </em>as we find it impossible to conclude that Code of Civil Procedure section 1800 is inconsistent with \u201cthe essential goals and purposes of federal bankruptcy law . . . .\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">First, it is undisputed that Congress intended, in general, to permit the coexistence of state laws governing voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors. As <em>Sherwood Partners </em>necessarily concedes, voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors have \u201ca venerable common-law pedigree\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1205, fn. 8) and were expressly upheld in <em>Pobreslo, supra, </em>287 U.S. at page 526: \u201cAnd, quite in harmony with the purposes of the federal Act, the provisions of [Wisconsin law] that are regulatory of such voluntary assignments serve to protect creditors against each other and go to assure equality of distribution . . . .\u201d (See also <em>Stellwagen </em>v. <em>Clum </em>(1918) 245 U.S. 605, 615 [62 L.Ed. 507, 38 S.Ct. 215] <em>(Stellwagen) </em>[Ohio statute permitting appointment of a receiver to take charge of all assets of the debtor and administer them for the equal benefit of all creditors, in a suit by creditors seeking to void a transfer made in contemplation of insolvency and designed to prefer one or more creditors, \u201cis not opposed to the policy of the bankruptcy law or in contravention of the rules and principles established by it with a view to the fair distribution of the assets of the insolvent\u201d].) Indeed, the Bankruptcy Code expressly makes state law on voidable transfers available to the bankruptcy trustee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">Second, <em>Sherwood Partners </em>reaches too far in suggesting that any state statute that \u201cimplicate[s]\u201d the federal bankruptcy law\u2019s second major goal of equitable distribution is preempted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1203.) The statutes upheld against preemption challenges in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1638\">*1638</page-number><em>Pobreslo </em>and <em>Stellwagen </em>obviously implicate the federal bankruptcy law\u2019s goal of equitable distribution. Indeed, <em>Pobreslo </em>and <em>Stellwagen </em>expressly refer to that goal in upholding the state statutes. <em>(Pobreslo, supra, </em>287 U.S. at p. 526 [state law assures \u201cequality of distribution\u201d]; <em>Stellwagen, supra, </em>245 U.S. at p. 615 [state law \u201cis not opposed to the policy of the bankruptcy law . . . with a view to the fair distribution of the assets of .the insolvent\u201d].) In short, the mere fact that a state law \u201cimplicate[s]\u201d the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s goal of equitable distribution is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the state law \u201cstands as an obstacle\u201d to that goal. <em>(Hines, supra, </em>312 U.S. at p. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Third, the <em>Sherwood Partners </em>conclusion that Code of Civil Procedure section 1800 is preempted rests, in essence, on a two points: (1) the fact that section 1800 gives the assignee powers beyond those that may be exercised by individual unsecured creditors; and (2) the proposition that the assignee\u2019s powers to avoid preferential transfers will \u201caffect the incentives of various parties as to whether they wish to avail themselves of federal bankruptcy law[,]\u201d thereby interfering with the code\u2019s goal of equitable distribution of a debtor\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1205.) However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-6\">\u2014As Judge Nelson points out in her dissent, \u201c[s]tate voluntary assignments, by definition, give the assignee more power than may be exercised by an individual creditor.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1206 (dis. opn. of Nelson, J.).) The majority\u2019s reliance on this distinction thus would cast doubt on the validity of all voluntary assignment statutes, not merely those allowing the assignee to avoid preferential transfers. Yet Supreme Court precedents clearly reject the notion that voluntary assignments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1639\">*1639</page-number>generally are incompatible with federal bankruptcy law. <em>(Pobreslo, supra, </em>287 U.S. at p. 526; <em>Stellwagen, supra, </em>245 U.S. at p. 615.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Y\">\u2014As for the alteration of incentives to use federal bankruptcy law, we do not doubt that incentives may be affected by the existence of an alternative to formal bankruptcy proceedings\u2014particularly an alternative that may be less \u201cexpensive and time-consuming ....\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1205.) Again, however, incentives to use bankruptcy law may be affected by any voluntary assignment laws, whether or not the assignee has the power to avoid preferential transfers. The only pertinent question is whether the state statute\u2019s effect on those incentives somehow interferes with or is an obstacle to the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s objective of equitable distribution. In our view, the <em>Sherwood Partners </em>majority provides no cogent explanation of how the assignee\u2019s avoidance powers conflict with that objective. As Judge Nelson correctly observed, because the common law right to make an assignment of property for the benefit of creditors is well established, it is \u201cillogical that state laws that provide a forum for the equitable distribution of that property should be preempted by federal bankruptcy law.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1207 (dis. opn. of Nelson, J.).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Fourth, the <em>Sherwood Partners </em>majority correctly points out that if a preferential transfer is recovered by the assignee, the same sum could not be recovered if a federal bankruptcy proceeding were filed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, as Judge Nelson observes: \u201cBut California\u2019s preference recovery provision is, by design, virtually identical to the bankruptcy code\u2019s preferential transfer statute. [Citations.] If the same transfer can be avoided in both the state and federal systems, how does the state system interfere with bankruptcy\u2019s goal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1640\">*1640</page-number>of equitable distribution? Both the state and federal statutes serve to ensure equality of distribution and to deter the race to recover assets before insolvency. [Citations.] That California\u2019s voluntary assignment system has such a provision makes it more capable of effectuating the equality of distribution that is the aim of the bankruptcy law; it does not necessarily interfere with bankruptcy\u2019s goal of achieving equal distribution.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at pp. 1207-1208 (dis. opn. of Nelson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">Finally, as Judge Nelson also pointed out, federal regulation should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power absent \u201c \u2018persuasive reasons\u2014 either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, supra, </em>394 F.3d at p. 1208 (dis. opn. of Nelson, J.), quoting <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 132, 142 [10 L.Ed.2d 248, 83 S.Ct. 1210].) This is not such a case. Voluntary assignments and the bankruptcy system have coexisted since the inception of bankruptcy law, and state laws regulating the rights and obligations of debtors or their assignees and creditors are often expressly incorporated in bankruptcy law. <em>(Sherwood Partners, </em>at p. 1201 [citing examples].) Congress has not indicated that voluntary assignments generally or preferential transfer avoidance laws specifically are to be preempted. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1208 (dis. opn. of Nelson, J.).) Under these circumstances, we can discern no persuasive reason to conclude that California\u2019s \u201cless stigmatic, and less costly, voluntary assignment scheme\u201d (ibid.)\u2014which, like the federal bankruptcy system, serves to ensure equality of distribution of a debtor\u2019s assets\u2014\u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment ... of the full purposes and objectives\u201d of the federal bankruptcy system. <em>(Hines, supra, </em>312 U.S. at p. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">Accordingly, we conclude Code of Civil Procedure section 1800 is not preempted by the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">II. <em>The Judgments Must Be Reversed and the Causes Remanded for Further Proceedings Because Evidence Necessary for Haberbush\u2019s Prima Facie Case Was Presented in a Manner Unauthorized by Statute or Court Rules.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1641\">*1641</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">The judgments are reversed, and the causes are remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the judgments and conduct further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.

This is because in most cases three creditors are required to force the debtor into bankruptcy. Further: \u201c[T]he action of the state assignee may diminish the likelihood that [the creditor] will be able to obtain the consent of other creditors. After all, if the state assignee succeeds in recovering the preferential transfer under state law, the other creditors may share in that bounty and might therefore have no interest in invoking the potentially more expensive and time-consuming federal processes.\" <em>(Ibid.) Sherwood Partners </em>thus rejected the argument that a creditor can prevent action by the state assignee by filing an involuntary federal bankruptcy petition, which would have the effect of preempting the state proceedings. However, the Supreme Court in <em>Pobreslo, supra, </em>287 U.S. at page 526, specifically adopted that very argument, observing that, because proceedings under state voluntary assignment law \u201cmay be terminated upon petition of creditors filed . . .

The majority observes that if individual unsecured creditors can sue to recover preferences under state law, the same powers are available to a bankruptcy trustee under 11 U.S.C. section 544(b), and \u201cthere is obviously no conflict then between federal law and state law giving those powers to an assignee.\u201d <em>(Sherwood Partners, </em>at p. 1204, fn. 6.) That is plainly so, because section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code gives the trustee the power to avoid any transfer voidable under state law by an unsecured creditor. However, we fail to discern why a conflict between federal and state law arises simply because the assignee has powers that individual unsecured creditors do not have. After all, the bankruptcy trustee can avoid preferential transfers under section 547(b), as well as under section 544(b), so the assignee does not have powers not available to the trustee. We find unconvincing the distinction <em>Sherwood Partners </em>draws between a state assignment scheme where only the assignee has avoidance powers and an assignment scheme in which individual unsecured creditors also have those powers. In either case, if the assignee or the individual creditor recovers the transfer and distributes its proceeds under state law, the federal trustee will not be able to do so. In neither case does the state law stand as an obstacle to the federal goal of equitable distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1306-8\"> See foonote, <em>ante, </em>page 1630.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
