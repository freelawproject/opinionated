J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">Water Systems Support, Inc., and its president (collectively WSSI) brought an action against two former independent contractors and their business entity (collectively defendants), alleging defendants violated their confidentiality agreements and made false statements about WSSI to WSSI\u2019s customers and governmental agencies. Defendants unsuccessfully moved to strike four of the 13 causes of action under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute. (Code Civ. Proc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 425.16.) Defendants appealed, and this court held the trial court correctly denied the motion on three of the causes of action, but the court erred in denying the motion as to one cause of action. <em>(Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 90 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 215] <em>(Mann).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">On remand, defendants sought attorney fees of $64,065 under section 425.16, subdivision (c), which states a defendant prevailing on an antiSLAPP motion \u201cshall be entitled to recover his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d WSSI opposed the motion on several grounds, including that defendants were not prevailing parties because they were unsuccessful in striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>three of the four challenged causes of action. After a hearing, the court found defendants were prevailing parties within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (c) and awarded defendants $57,000 in attorney fees plus $1,906 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">WSSI challenges the attorney fees award on appeal. We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in determining defendants were prevailing parties on the anti-SLAPP motion. We determine, however, the court erred in failing to reduce the fees to reflect that defendants were only partially successful on the motion. Because of this court\u2019s familiarity with this case and the fact the underlying case has settled except for the attorney fees issue, we modify the order rather than remanding the matter to the trial court. We conclude defendants are entitled to $32,032.50, which is 50 percent of their claimed fees incurred in bringing the anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\n<em>Background Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">WSSI\u2019s complaint alleges the following.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> WSSI, a company that maintains industrial water systems, hired Kent Radford and Robert Caslava as independent contractors. Radford and Caslava agreed to keep confidential WSSI\u2019s customer information and work guidelines. Several years later, Radford and Caslava formed a competing company, and then solicited WSSI\u2019s customers by using the confidential information and making fraudulent and disparaging statements about WSSI, including that it used illegal and carcinogenic chemicals in its cleaning process. Defendants also allegedly engaged in numerous acts of harassment, including reporting WSSI to the National Response Center and the National Terrorist Hotline, falsely claiming that WSSI was \u201c \u2018pouring illegal carcinogenic chemicals into public drainage systems throughout Southern California.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Based on these and additional facts, WSSI filed a complaint asserting 13 causes of action against Radford and Caslava, and their business entity. Defendants filed an anti-SLAPP motion on four of those claims: interference with contractual relationship, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, defamation, and trade libel. Defendants argued the claims were subject to the anti-SLAPP statute because (1) defendants\u2019 reports to the government agencies were in furtherance of their constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>petition the government; and (2) defendants\u2019 statements were made in connection with a \u201cpublic issue.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(2), (4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In opposition to the motion, WSSI filed its president\u2019s declaration, stating that defendants made false reports about WSSI to the National Response Center and the National Terrorist Hotline, and defendants had made false statements to WSSI\u2019s customers. WSSI\u2019s president denied that WSSI used illegal chemicals or poured them into city or storm drains. WSSI also filed a declaration from a WSSI client, stating that Caslava and Radford informed him that WSSI was using an illegal chemical and illegally dumping the sanitizing solution down storm drains.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The trial court denied the motion to strike, finding the challenged claims did not \u201c \u2018arise from\u2019 \u201d an act in furtherance of defendants\u2019 right of petition or free speech. On appeal, we affirmed the order denying the motion on all causes of action, except that we reversed on the trade libel cause of action. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 103-112.) In so doing, we applied well-settled law that requires a party moving to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute to show the challenged cause of action arose from a specified protected activity, and if this burden is met the plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on the claim. (120 Cal.App.4th at p. 102.) We further followed precedent holding that the anti-SLAPP statute applies if a cause of action alleges both protected and unprotected activity unless the protected conduct is merely incidental to the unprotected conduct. (120 Cal.App.4th at p. 103.) Rejecting defendants\u2019 arguments, we clarified that an anti-SLAPP motion must be denied if the plaintiff shows a probability of prevailing on any theory underlying the \u201cmixed\u201d cause of action. (120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 105-106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Under these legal principles, we held WSSI\u2019s defamation and trade libel claims were mixed causes of action, subject to the anti-SLAPP statute because they were based, in part, on defendants\u2019 act of reporting a suspected crime to interested governmental agencies and seeking a governmental investigation. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 104; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(2).) As to the reports to government agencies, we recognized they were absolutely privileged (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b)), thus eliminating any actionable theory arising from defendants\u2019 alleged false reports to the government. As to the statements to customers, we determined that WSSI met its burden to show a probability of prevailing on its defamation claim, rejecting defendants\u2019 evidentiary objections and contentions that their alleged wrongful communications with WSSI\u2019s customers were privileged. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>at pp. 106-109.) On the trade libel claim, we held WSSI did not show a probability of prevailing because WSSI did not present any evidence showing it had suffered a specific pecuniary loss as a result of the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>communications with WSSI customers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 109; see <em>Erlich v. Etner </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 69, 73 [36 Cal.Rptr. 256] [unlike defamation, trade libel requires evidence of specific pecuniary loss].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On WSSI\u2019s interference claims, we held these claims were not subject to the anti-SLAPP statute because they arose from defendants\u2019 communications with WSSI\u2019s customers, and not from statements made to governmental agencies. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 110.) We rejected defendants\u2019 alternate contention that the interference causes of action were subject to the anti-SLAPP statute because they were based on protected speech in connection with an issue of public interest. (120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 110-111.) We reasoned that \u201c[although pollution ... is a matter of general public interest, the focus of the anti-SLAPP statute must be on the specific nature of the speech rather than on generalities that might be abstracted from it. . . . [f] . . . [Defendants\u2019 alleged statements were not about pollution or potential public health and safety issues in general, but about WSSI\u2019s specific business practices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We thus affirmed the court\u2019s order to the extent it <em>denied </em>defendants\u2019 motion to strike the two interference claims and the defamation claim, and reversed the order to the extent it denied the motion on the trade libel claim. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 112.) We awarded defendants costs on appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>Attorney Fees Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Shortly after we remanded the case and before the parties began discovery on the merits of the remaining 12 causes of action against defendants, defendants moved in the superior court for attorney fees pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c), which states \u201ca prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d In support, defendants\u2019 counsel submitted a billing summary showing defendants incurred attorney fees of $25,120 for time spent on the antiSLAPP motion in the trial court, and $33,245 for time spent on the appeal. Defendants also stated they incurred $5,700 in fees for time spent in bringing the attorney fees motion. Thus, defendants sought a total of $64,065 as \u201cprevailing parties\u201d in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In a supporting declaration, defense counsel confirmed the accuracy of the time records, and stated that counsel was required to conduct \u201cextensive research\u201d on the issue of whether a \u201cmixed\u201d cause of action is subject to the anti-SLAPP statute and that each of the challenged causes of action concerned similar legal issues pertaining to the applicability of the anti-SLAPP statute. Counsel asserted that the time spent was reasonable given numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>unsettled issues in SLAPP law at the time the case was brought and considering the \u201cdifficulty of the litigation, the skill required, the attention given to the matter, and the success of Defendants\u2019 attorneys\u2019 efforts.\u201d Counsel further stated: \u201cWe worked efficiently, but at the same time we took the necessary steps to prepare our briefing and for the oral argument before the reviewing court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In opposing the attorney fees request, WSSI argued: (1) defendants were not the prevailing parties because the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s order refusing to strike three of the four challenged causes of action; and (2) even assuming defendants were \u201cprevailing parties,\u201d the attorney fees award should be limited to reflect that defendants prevailed on only one cause of action and that they did not achieve \u201cany level of success relative to the entire litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In reply, defendants argued that the court need not decide the \u201cprevailing party\u201d issue because \u201cthe Court of Appeal already has decided it\u201d by awarding defendants their costs on appeal. Defendants thus asserted that \u201call that remains for this Court to do is to fix the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to be awarded . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">After oral argument, the court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permitted the parties to file additional briefing on the apportionment issue, i.e., whether the court should award attorney fees only with respect to work performed on the successful portions of the motion. The court thereafter granted defendants\u2019 motion, awarding defendants $57,000 in attorney fees and $1,906 in costs. The court explained its ruling as follows: \u201cDefendants ultimately prevailed on [the motion to strike] plaintiffs\u2019 trade libel cause of action. Moreover, the Court of Appeal determined that defendants are the prevailing party given the Court of Appeal found that defendants are entitled to costs on appeal. As the prevailing party, defendants are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to [section] 425.16. ... []Q ... [1] Apportionment of attorney fees is improper given that the same facts, law, and damages were involved in all causes of action challenged in the [anti-SLAPP motion]. The Court in this ruling, however, awards a lesser sum of attorney fees to defendants. That lesser sum is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">WSSI contends the court erred in finding that defendants were prevailing parties on the anti-SLAPP motion, and alternatively, in failing to reduce the attorney fees to reflect defendants\u2019 limited success on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">I. <em>Prevailing Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Section 425.16, subdivision (c) provides that \u201ca prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this provision, \u201cany SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees.\u201d <em>(Ketchum v. Moses </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d <em>377, </em>17 P.3d 735] <em>(Ketchum).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In <em>ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625] <em>(ComputerXpress), </em>the court considered the issue of whether a defendant who partially prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion (where the court strikes some but not all of the challenged causes of action) is a \u201cprevailing\u201d defendant under section 425.16, subdivision (c). <em>(ComputerXpress, </em>at pp. 1016-1020.) In examining this question, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Civil Code section 1717 and instead focused on the statutory distinction between prevailing defendants and prevailing plaintiffs. <em>(ComputerXpress, </em>at pp. 1016-1018.) Unlike a prevailing defendant who is entitled as a matter of right to attorney fees, a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees only if the anti-SLAPP motion was \u201cfrivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c).) Finding this distinction reflected the Legislature\u2019s strong preference for awarding attorney fees to successful defendants, the court stated the phrase \u201cprevailing party\u201d should be interpreted broadly to favor an award of attorney fees to a partially successful defendant. <em>(ComputerXpress, supra, </em>at p. 1018.) The <em>ComputerXpress </em>court additionally relied on similar judicial interpretations of statutory schemes that likewise distinguish between prevailing plaintiffs and defendants in the fee-shifting analysis. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1018-1020; see <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 424, 429 [76 L.Ed.2d 40, 103 S.Ct. 1933] <em>(Hensley) </em>[42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988]; <em>Los Angeles Times v. Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1390-1392 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 29] [Gov. Code, \u00a7 6259, subd. (d)]; see also <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Consumers Cooperative of Berkeley, Inc. </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 836, 846 [216 Cal.Rptr. 649] [\u00a7 1021.5].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Based on these authorities, the <em>ComputerXpress </em>court held the defendants were prevailing parties because they were successful in striking five of the nine challenged causes of action alleged in the complaint. (ComputerXpress, <em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1020.) The court stated the defendants\u2019 lack of success on a portion of the motion was relevant to the amount of fees awarded, and not on the issue of whether they were prevailing parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1019.) The court thus remanded for the trial court to determine the attorney fees incurred for bringing the anti-SLAPP motion challenging the causes of action stricken from the complaint. (93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1020-1021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Distinguishing <em>ComputerXpress, </em>a Court of Appeal recently held the defendants who were successful in striking only one cause of action were not \u201cprevailing\u201d parties under the anti-SLAPP statute. <em>(Endres </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 952, 955-956 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 786].) In <em>Endres, </em>the plaintiffs alleged the defendants had committed numerous torts and engaged in a conspiracy as a part of a wrongful attempt to control a church. The defendants moved to strike the entire complaint under section 425.16, but were successful only as to the conspiracy cause of action. <em>(Endres, </em>at p. 954.) The trial court declined to award attorney fees to the defendants, finding that the relief granted was minimal compared to the objectives of their motion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The appellate court affirmed, emphasizing that the defendants \u201caccomplished nothing\u201d by bringing the motion: \u201cThe possible recovery against defendants did not change. The factual allegations which defendants had to defend did not change. The work involved in trying the case did not change. Defendants\u2019 burden concerning their jurisdictional defense did not change. The case was essentially the same after the ruling on the special motion to strike as it was before. The results of the motion were minimal and insignificant, fully justifying the court\u2019s finding that defendants should not recover fees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 955.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We agree with the legal analysis and results reached by both the <em>ComputerXpress </em>and <em>Endres </em>courts. Given the express legislative preference for awarding fees to successful anti-SLAPP defendants, a party need not succeed in striking every challenged claim to be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of section 425.16. A contrary conclusion would require a partially prevailing defendant to bear the entire cost of the anti-SLAPP litigation at the outset of the case. This would create a strong disincentive for a defendant to bring the motion, undermining the legislative intent to encourage defendants to utilize the anti-SLAPP procedure to eliminate SLAPP claims and to discourage plaintiffs from bringing meritless SLAPP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>claims. (See <em>Ketchum, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 1131.) On the other hand, there is no reason to encourage a defendant to bring an anti-SLAPP motion where the factual and legal grounds for the claims against the defendant remain the same after the resolution of the anti-SLAPP motion. <em>(Endres </em>v. <em>Moran, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at pp. 955-956.) Where the results of the motion are \u201c \u2018minimal\u2019 \u201d or \u201cinsignificant\u201d a court does not abuse its discretion in finding the defendant was not a prevailing party. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 957 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.); see <em>Los Angeles Times v. Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1391-1392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">We thus hold that a party who partially prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be considered a prevailing party unless the results of the motion were so insignificant that the party did not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion. The determination whether a party prevailed on an anti- SLAPP motion lies within the broad discretion of a trial court. (See <em>Jackson v. Homeowners Assn. Monte Vista Estates-East (2001) 93 </em>Cal.App.4th 773, 789 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 363].) We review this determination on an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Applying these principles, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining defendants were prevailing parties in the underlying litigation. Defendants successfully eliminated the trade libel cause of action. Although trade libel bears similarity to the defamation claim that remained in the litigation, the two causes of action are not identical. Whereas defamation concerns injury to the reputation of a person or business, trade libel involves false disparagement of the quality of goods or services. <em>(Guess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 473, 479 [222 Cal.Rptr. 79]; <em>Erlich v. Etner, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.2d at pp. <em>73-74.) </em>The elimination of the trade libel cause of action thus had the potential to narrow the litigation with respect to the damage issues and the focus of the claimed false statements. Additionally, the <em>Mann </em>court\u2019s acknowledgment that an absolute privilege applies to defendants\u2019 reports of WSSI\u2019s activities to government entities precluded WSSI from thereafter pursuing any recovery based on defendants\u2019 communications with government agencies. <em>(Mann, supra, 120 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 108.) By bringing the anti-SLAPP motion, defendants thus successfully narrowed the scope of the lawsuit, limiting discovery, reducing potential recoverable damages, and altering the settlement posture of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In its reply brief, WSSI contends that even assuming there was a factual basis for the trial court to have found defendants were prevailing parties, the order must be reversed because the trial court did not exercise its discretion on this issue. WSSI argues that the trial court erroneously based its prevailing party finding on this court\u2019s award of appellate costs to defendants in the prior appeal. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 113.) We agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the trial court\u2019s reliance on the appellate cost award in <em>Mann </em>was improper. A \u201cprevailing party\u201d with respect to an appellate cost award is not necessarily the same as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the anti-SLAPP statute. (Compare \u00a7 425.16, subd. (c) with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 27.) Moreover, although a prevailing party is generally entitled to costs on appeal, appellate courts have the discretion to deviate from the general \u201cprevailing party\u201d rule in \u201cthe interests of justice,\u201d and make any award or apportionment of costs that it determines is appropriate. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 27(a)(4); see Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2004) \u00b6 14:61, p. 14-12; see <em>Dobbins v. Hardister </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 798 [51 Cal.Rptr. 866]; <em>Stuckey v. Stuckey </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 382, 387 [41 Cal.Rptr. 792].) Because the <em>Mann </em>decision was silent on the reason for the cost award, the trial court erred in inferring the award reflected a determination that defendants were the prevailing parties for purposes of the antiSLAPP proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The court\u2019s reliance on the appellate cost award, however, was not prejudicial because it was merely an alternate basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion on the prevailing party issue. In its written order, the court stated it found defendants were the prevailing parties based on their success in striking the trade libel cause of action. Absent a contrary indication, we presume this finding constituted an independent ground for the prevailing party finding. An order is presumed correct; all inferences are drawn in favor of the order and error must be affirmatively shown. (See <em>Howard v. Thrifty Drug &amp; Discount Stores </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 424, 443 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 362, 895 P.2d 469]; <em>Corenevsky v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 307, 321 [204 Cal.Rptr. 165, 682 P.2d 360]; <em>Denham v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">II. <em>Amount of Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">WSSI alternatively contends the court erred in refusing to reduce the claimed attorney fees to reflect that defendants were unsuccessful on three of the challenged causes of action and that these causes of action remained in the litigation after the anti-SLAPP motion was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The trial court awarded defendants $57,000, which constituted its claimed fees of $64,065 minus $7,065. The court did not explain the basis for this amount or the reduction, except to state that it found the $57,000 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201creasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also expressly declined to apportion the fees between the successful and unsuccessful causes of action because it found the same legal and factual theories were involved on each of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The California Supreme Court has upheld the lodestar method for determining the appropriate amount of attorney fees for a prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion. <em>(Ketchum, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 1136.) Under this method, a court assesses attorney fees by first determining the time spent and the reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1131-1132.) The court next determines whether that lodestar figure should be adjusted based on various relevant factors <em>(id. </em>at p. 1132), including a plaintiff\u2019s limited success in the litigation <em>(Sokolow v. County of San Mateo </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 249 [261 Cal.Rptr. 520]; <em>Californians for Responsible Toxics Management v. Kizer </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 961, 973-975 [259 Cal.Rptr. 599]; see also <em>Feminist Women's Health Center </em>v. <em>Blythe </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1641, 1674 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 189]). In determining the lodestar amount, a prevailing party generally may not recover for work on causes of action on which the party was unsuccessful. (See <em>ComputerXpress, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1020.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Defendants do not dispute these general principles, but contend a reduction was inappropriate in this case because the facts and law were essentially the same on the cause of action for which they were successful (the trade libel claim) and the causes of action on which they did not prevail (the defamation and interference claims). They argued below, and the court agreed, that because the legal work on each of the causes of action was overlapping, apportionment was improper because it was not possible to separate the claims. They rely on judicial interpretations of various fee-shifting statutes, in which the courts have held that attorney fees need not be reduced for work on unsuccessful claims if the claims \u201care so intertwined that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the attorney\u2019s time into compensable and noncompensable units.\u201d <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Vista Unified School Dist. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 687 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 263]; see, e.g., <em>Reynolds Metals Co. v.

The issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of the proper amount of fees to be awarded when an attorney\u2019s time is attributable to recoverable and nonrecoverable claims depends on the legislative intent and policies underlying the specific fee-shifting scheme at issue. (See <em>Carver v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 498, 504-505 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 467] [interpreting Cartwright Act to hold that fees on common issues should not be awarded to defendant on contract claims because the award would undermine legislative intent underlying the Cartwright Act]; <em>Cassim v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 811 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 374, 94 P.3d 513] <em>[Brandt </em>fees may not be obtained for all attorney services even if claims are overlapping]; <em>Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. 424 [court should reduce for partial success even where work on claims was overlapping <em>(Brandt v.

In examining this issue in the context of section 425.16, subdivision (c), we find instructive the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The <em>Hensley </em>court considered an attorney fees award to the prevailing plaintiffs in a federal civil rights action under which a prevailing plaintiff is presumptively entitled to fees. <em>(Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 429; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.) Although the plaintiffs prevailed on some claims but not others, the district court awarded the plaintiffs their fees attributable to all claims because the court found overlapping factual and legal issues involved in those claims and a reduction would fail to \u201cconsider\u201d several relevant factors, including \u201c \u2018the relative importance of various issues\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the extent to which [plaintiffs] [prevailed] on [the] issues.\u2019 \u201d (461 U.S. at p. 438.) The Supreme Court held that because of \u201cthe interrelated nature of the facts and legal theories,\u201d the district court \u201cdid not err in refusing to apportion the fee award mechanically on the basis of respondents\u2019 success or failure on particular issues.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court, however, remanded the case for the court to exercise its discretion as to whether the attorney fee award should be reduced to account for the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of success on several claims. The court explained that \u201c[w]here the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney\u2019s fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised. <em>But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 440, italics added.) In conducting this analysis, a court \u201cmay attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, <em>or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\u201d (Id. </em>at pp. 436-437, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Accordingly, under <em>Hensley, </em>a partially prevailing party is not necessarily entitled to all incurred fees even where the work on the successful and unsuccessful claims was overlapping. <em>(Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 440; see <em>Harman v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1312 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 589].) Instead, the court must consider the significance of the overall relief obtained by the prevailing party in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation and whether the expenditure of counsel\u2019s time was reasonable in relation to the success achieved. <em>(Hensley, </em>at p. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Although <em>Hensley </em>interpreted the federal civil rights statute, the court\u2019s approach is consistent with the policies underlying the anti-SLAPP statute. The fee-shifting provisions of section 425.16, subdivision (c) were enacted to impose litigation costs on those who assert meritless claims burdening the exercise of the defendant\u2019s constitutional free speech and petition rights. <em>(Ketchum, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 1131.) The Legislature also sought to encourage private representation for defendants who might not otherwise have the financial resources to retain an attorney. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, when a defendant is only partially successful in challenging portions of the complaint, these policies to ensure prompt and meaningful redress for the defendants subject to SLAPP suits must be balanced with the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>constitutional right to petition for redress of his or her claims. If, after a court rules on an anti-SLAPP motion, a partially successful plaintiff is required to bear the entire cost of the anti-SLAPP litigation even though the defendant achieved only a relatively minor benefit and the essential thrust of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint remains viable, this could impose a potential financial barrier to the plaintiff continuing with the lawsuit, burdening the plaintiff\u2019s <em>right to </em>exercise his <em>or her </em>right to petition for the redress of grievances. The Legislature recently declared that \u201cthere has been a disturbing abuse of Section 425.16 . . . which has undermined the exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,\u201d and that it is \u201ccontrary to the purpose and intent of Section 425.16\u201d to \u201cchill[]\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s petitioning rights through the use of the anti-SLAPP procedure. (\u00a7 425.17, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">An award of attorney fees to a partially prevailing defendant under section 425.16, subdivision (c) thus involves competing public policies: (1) the public policy to discourage meritless SLAPP claims by compelling a SLAPP plaintiff to bear a defendant\u2019s litigation costs incurred to eliminate the claim from the lawsuit; and (2) the public policy to provide a plaintiff who has facially valid claims to exercise his or her constitutional petition rights by filing a complaint and litigating those claims in court. (\u00a7\u00a7 425.16, 425.17; see <em>Ketchum, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 1131.) In balancing these policies, we conclude a defendant should not be entitled to obtain <em>as a matter of right </em>his or her entire attorney fees incurred on successful and unsuccessful claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>merely because the attorney work on those claims was overlapping. Instead, the court should first determine the lodestar amount for the hours expended on the successful claims, and, if the work on the successful and unsuccessful causes of action was overlapping, the court should then consider the defendant\u2019s relative success on the motion in achieving his or her objective, and reduce the amount if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">This analysis includes factors such as the extent to which the defendant\u2019s litigation posture was advanced by the motion, whether the same factual allegations remain to be litigated, whether discovery and motion practice have been narrowed, and the extent to which future litigation expenses and strategy were impacted by the motion. The fees awarded to a defendant who was only partially successful on an anti-SLAPP motion should be commensurate with the extent to which the motion changed the nature and character of the lawsuit in a practical way. The court should also consider any other applicable relevant factors, such as the experience and abilities of the attorney and the novelty and difficulty of the issues, to adjust the lodestar amount as appropriate. (See <em>Ketchum, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 1132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Applying these principles, we conclude the court erred in failing to reduce the attorney fees award for fees attributable to the causes of action that remained in the litigation. Although the amount to be awarded could not be calculated through a purely mechanical approach by allocating particular hours to particular claims, the court should have considered the significance of the overall relief obtained by defendants in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation and whether the expenditure of counsel\u2019s time was reasonable in relation to the success achieved. We are required to presume all facts to support the court order (see <em>Ketchum, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 1140), but the trial court\u2019s statement declining to apportion the fees necessarily reflects that the court did not consider defendants\u2019 relative lack of success in determining the appropriate amount of fees. Moreover, a reduction of approximately $7,000 to account for defendants\u2019 lack of complete success was clearly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In this regard, we are unpersuaded by defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to all of their attorney fees because their efforts established new law in California. The issue of first impression in Mann\u2014whether a court should deny an anti-SLAPP motion if the plaintiff proves a probability of prevailing on only a portion of the SLAPP claim\u2014resulted in a holding rejecting <em>defendants\u2019 </em>legal arguments. <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 106.) On this issue, we held a plaintiff meets its burden to oppose an anti-SLAPP motion if the plaintiff proves a probability of prevailing on any one theory underlying the claim. (120 Cal.App.4th at p. 106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Although normally we would remand for the court to exercise its discretion on the issue of the proper amount of attorney fees, we conclude that under the particular circumstances of this case it is appropriate that we perform the analysis here. The basis of the broad discretion afforded to the trial judge in ruling on an attorney fee motion is the judge\u2019s familiarity with the proceedings and the work performed by the attorneys. (See <em>PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511].) Here, the trial judge did not preside over the underlying litigation, and the court did not have firsthand knowledge of the work because defendants did not submit the underlying trial or appellate court briefs to support their attorney fees request. In contrast, this court is familiar with the case and the attorneys\u2019 work based on our prior appellate review and the record is sufficiently explicit that we can properly perform the necessary calculations. Additionally, counsel have advised this court that the matter has settled, except for the attorney fees issue. Under these circumstances, it would be wasteful to remand and invite a new round of litigation. (See <em>Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 437 [warning courts against turning fee applications into major collateral litigation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">After conducting the analysis, we conclude defendants are entitled to recover $32,032.50 (50 percent of the claimed fees). This amount fairly compensates defendants for the results achieved in pursuing the anti-SLAPP motion and avoids reimbursing them for the objectives that were not attained. Militating against compensation, defendants had only limited success, and WSSI was compelled to defend the anti-SLAPP motion notwithstanding that two of the challenged causes of action were not even governed by the anti-SLAPP statute and there were facts showing a probability of prevailing on the defamation cause of action subject to the statute. Further, defendants did not achieve one of their anti-SLAPP objectives\u2014to strike all claims based on defendants\u2019 alleged false statements to WSSI\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">On the other hand, the practical impact of the motion was far more significant than the mere dismissal of the trade libel cause of action. In <em>Mann, </em>we recognized defendants\u2019 reports to government agencies were absolutely privileged (Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b)), thus eliminating any actionable theory arising from the alleged false statements to these agencies. By establishing this legal principle, defendants effectively restricted the factual allegations, reduced viable theories of recovery, limited discovery, lessened the work involved, and permitted both sides to more realistically evaluate liability, damages and future legal expenses. An award of $32,032.50 reflects the fact that defendants prevailed on important issues that materially changed the litigation, but does not reward them for legal efforts that were meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>In our view, allowing partially successful defendants to recover virtually all of their fees because the facts and legal theories are so intertwined that they cannot be segregated underestimates the ability of attorneys and experienced trial judges to evaluate the value of legal services associated with limited success. By contrast, an approach that concentrates on the practical impact of a partially successful motion on the overall litigation advances the objectives of the anti-SLAPP statute and minimizes abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We affirm the order to the extent it finds defendants were the prevailing parties on the anti-SLAPP motion, but strike the $57,000 amount awarded and modify the order to award defendants $32,032.50. As so modified, we affirm. Each party to bear its own costs on appeal.
