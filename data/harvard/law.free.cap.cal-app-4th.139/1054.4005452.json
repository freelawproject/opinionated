He contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to substitute retained counsel Richard Hove for his appointed counsel. The trial court denied the motion because attorney Hove had an actual conflict of interest in that Hove had previously represented defendant\u2019s brother, Rodney Baylis, in prosecutions for two other sexual assaults. Rodney Baylis had also previously been charged with the very offenses involved in defendant\u2019s case. Defendant\u2019s anticipated trial strategy was to implicate his brother in the offenses. In the published portion of the decision, we hold that in these unusual circumstances the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate defendant\u2019s right to counsel by denying the motion to substitute attorneys. In the unpublished portion of the decision, we reject defendant\u2019s instructional claims and his claims under <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531].</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In October 2003, the District Attorney for the County of Alameda filed a second amended information alleging that defendant Patrick Baylis committed four counts of rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2); counts 1-4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of penetration with a foreign object (\u00a7 289; count 5), one count of forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c); count 6), one count of kidnapping with the intent to commit rape or oral copulation (\u00a7 208, former subd. (d); count 7), and one count of robbery (\u00a7211; count 8). As to counts one through six, it was alleged that defendant kidnapped the victim and that the movement of the victim substantially increased the risk to her (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (d)(2) &amp; (e)(1)) and that defendant personally used a firearm (\u00a7\u00a7 667.61, subd. (e)(4), 12022.3). As to counts seven and eight, it was alleged that defendant personally used a firearm. (\u00a7 12022.5.) Defendant was represented at trial by an attorney other than Hove. A jury found defendant guilty on all counts and found that all the alleged enhancements were true. In April 2004, the trial court imposed a total prison term of 44 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">\n<em>The Prosecution Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">On the morning of February 23, 1997, as the victim was walking to work, a man she described as Black and heavyset walked toward her. He grabbed her arm, put his hand over her mouth, and put a gun to her cheek. He told her not to scream or he would kill her, and he told her to keep walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">They walked through a parking lot and he covered her face with her jacket. The assailant forced her into a car and drove her to an apartment in Hayward. He led her to a walk-in closet, covered her eyes with a T-shirt, and told her to take off her clothes. He forced her to have intercourse in the closet and on a mattress in another room, and, holding a gun to her head, made her orally copulate him. As the assailant handed the victim her clothes, she heard him go through her pockets. She later discovered that approximately $17 was missing. The assailant told the victim that he should just kill her, led her back to the mattress, and forced her to have intercourse again.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">They left the apartment. The assailant drove for a while and told the victim to get out of the car. She contacted the police, describing her assailant as a Black male in his early 30\u2019s, five feet five inches tall, about 200 pounds, with a full beard and closely cut hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">In a photo lineup, the victim picked out defendant\u2019s brother, Rodney Baylis, as her assailant. She was not confident of the identification, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>she did not say so that day to the detective in charge of the investigation, Frank Daley. She did tell Audrey Pinkney, who accompanied her to the police station, that the photo she picked out resembled her assailant but that she did not really think it was him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">One night about a month later, the victim saw the car her assailant had driven parked across the street from her house. She saw three men approach the car and told Pinkney, with whom she was living, that one of the men was her assailant. They called the police, who arrived soon afterwards and drove the victim and Pinkney to where the car had been stopped by other officers. The victim identified defendant as her assailant. One of the officers said she was confusing defendant with his brother, but the victim never changed her mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Because Detective Daley had identified Rodney as the primary suspect in the rape, defendant was not taken into custody. Another officer who was present during the identification admitted that he falsely wrote in his report that the victim did not make an identification. He testified that Daley asked him to write a supplemental report falsely stating that the victim reported that the person the police had detained looked like the assailant but that the assailant was actually shorter (defendant is over six feet tall and Rodney is approximately five and a half feet tall). A couple of days later the victim told Daley that defendant was her assailant; he corrected her, admonishing that her assailant was actually the defendant\u2019s brother, whom she had identified in the photo lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Rodney was charged with the rape, along with separate sexual assaults in Alameda and Oakland. At the preliminary hearing in August 1997, the victim identified Rodney as the person who had raped her. However, she had concerns about the accuracy of her identification. After the hearing, she told Pinkney that the man she identified was not her assailant. When she made the identification during the hearing, she trusted Daley\u2019s judgment more than her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In June 1999, DNA analysis of a semen sample on the victim\u2019s underpants excluded Rodney. Defendant and the victim\u2019s boyfriend, Robert Pinkney, could not be excluded as sources of the semen. Assuming Robert Pinkney was one source of the semen, the odds of a person taken at random being another contributor were approximately one in 690 billion Caucasian males and one in 10 billion African-American males. Not assuming that Robert Pinkney was a source of the semen, the odds of a person taken at random being one of the contributors was one in 8,200 Caucasian males and one in 890 African-American males.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>Based on information obtained from a car dealership, the police determined that the car the assailant drove matched the description of a 1996 Hyundai registered to a Cathrell Golston. The investigation also led the police to an apartment on Vermont Street in Hayward, which the victim subsequently identified as the location where she was raped. The victim\u2019s and defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found in the Vermont Street apartment; Rodney\u2019s were not. Golston lived in the Vermont Street apartment but moved out before February 23, 1997. Golston previously was in a romantic relationship with defendant. The romantic relationship ended in December 1996, but she continued to allow defendant to drive her car and defendant had keys to the Vermont Street apartment. Rodney had never been to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>The Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Defendant challenged the victim\u2019s identification. The parties stipulated that a victim-witness assistance counselor would testify that the victim never told her that Rodney was not her assailant and did not express any doubt about the identification of Rodney. Similarly, defendant\u2019s sister testified that she saw the victim at Rodney\u2019s preliminary hearing, and the victim saw defendant and did not say anything about him.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Defendant testified. He denied raping, kidnapping, or having any contact with the victim. He did admit that he had a key to Colston\u2019s apartment on Vermont Street and that he drove her car with her permission. The night before the victim was kidnapped and raped, the defendant picked up Rodney from a BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station and gave him Golston\u2019s car, as well as the keys to the apartment on Vermont Street. Later that night, defendant and two friends, Mike and Tanya, went to a bowling alley in Hayward. Afterwards, they went to the Vermont Street apartment, and defendant had sex with Tanya. Defendant left the apartment early the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In February 1997, defendant\u2019s hair was about three or four inches long, not closely cut. He had a goatee but not a full beard. He went to the police department voluntarily after he heard the police were looking for Rodney. He was interviewed by two detectives but was not arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">I. <em>Denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Substitute Attorneys</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Defendant contends that denial of his motion to substitute retained counsel Hove for his appointed counsel violated his right to counsel under the federal and state Constitutions. In particular, defendant contends that because the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>court found that he freely and voluntarily waived Hove\u2019s conflict of interest arising from Hove\u2019s former representation of Rodney, he was entitled under the federal and state Constitutions to substitute Hove for his appointed counsel. He also contends that the trial court erred both in concluding that Rodney was required to waive the conflict and that Rodney\u2019s waiver was inadequate. We hold that the trial court properly concluded that Rodney did not adequately waive the conflict raised by representation of defendant by Hove and that denial of the substitution motion was not an abuse of discretion or a violation of defendant\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">A. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In 2003, well before trial, defendant requested that Richard Hove be substituted as counsel of record in place of appointed counsel, Michael Berger. The prosecutor opposed the request on the ground that Hove had previously represented Rodney in prosecutions for sexual assaults that occurred in Alameda in August 1996 and in Oakland in April 1997. The rape at issue in this case occurred in Hayward in February 1997. Originally Rodney was charged with the Hayward offenses as well, and the victim identified Rodney as her assailant at the preliminary hearing, but the charges were dismissed after DNA analysis implicated defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Hove never represented Rodney in relation to the Hayward offenses. Rodney\u2019s attorney at the preliminary hearing on the charges arising out of the Alameda, Oakland, and Hayward incidents was Roger Patton. Hove represented Rodney at trial for the Alameda and Oakland incidents. Hove raised a mistaken identity defense and pointed to Patrick as the assailant who committed the Oakland sexual assault. Rodney testified that the last time he had seen the gun used in the Oakland assault Patrick had it. Hove attempted to question Rodney about the misidentification in <em>this </em>case, but the trial court did not allow the questioning. Hove called Patrick as a witness, and he admitted ownership of the gun used in the Oakland assault but refused to answer whether he took the gun to the store where the rape took place; the trial court struck Patrick\u2019s testimony about the gun. In closing, Hove argued that Patrick was responsible for the Oakland assault. Rodney was convicted of both the Alameda and Oakland offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>The trial court found that an actual conflict of interest would exist were Hove to represent defendant. The trial court explained: \u201cRodney Baylis, defendant\u2019s brother, was originally identified as the perpetrator of the crimes for which defendant now stands accused. The sexual assault in Oakland, for which Rodney Baylis was convicted, occurred within a few months of the instant incident. Therefore, notwithstanding the alleged DNA evidence, mistaken identification remains a potentially viable defense in this case. Defendant admits that he may introduce evidence that his brother, Rodney Baylis, committed the offenses in this case . . . Mr. Hove will be placed in the untenable position of presenting evidence inculpating his former client, Rodney Baylis, directly contradicting the position taken at Rodney Baylis\u2019 trial, in which Mr. Hove attempted to prove that Patrick Baylis committed this rape. (The Court notes that double jeopardy has not attached to Rodney Baylis in this case.) [f] Other potential conflicts of interest exist. The District Attorney asserts that he may call Mr. Hove as a witness in this case because, during Mr. Hove\u2019s representation of Rodney Baylis, Mr. Hove had discussions with the defendant Patrick Baylis regarding the events involving the instant charges. Those discussions are not privileged attorney client communications because the defendant was not Mr. Hove\u2019s client at the time. Furthermore, the District Attorney points out the possibility that Mr. Hove\u2019s privileged communications with Rodney Baylis may be subject to disclosure at trial, given that Rodney Baylis, as Hove\u2019s former client, must also waive the conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Defendant submitted two declarations purporting to waive the conflict of interest. The court appointed independent counsel to advise defendant regarding the conflict. Independent counsel was charged with explaining to defendant the \u201cexistence, implications, and ramifications of having Mr. Hove represent him in this matter and to explain the consequences of defendant\u2019s purported waiver of conflict-free counsel.\u201d The trial court held two hearings on the issue and questioned defendant extensively regarding his understanding of Hove\u2019s conflict of interest at each hearing. Ultimately, the trial court found that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived the conflict of interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">However, the trial court denied the substitution request because it found that Rodney had not adequately waived the conflict. The court concluded that the Rules of Professional Conduct required Hove to obtain Rodney\u2019s consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>before undertaking the representation of defendant. The court emphasized its \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d The sum of Rodney\u2019s declaration read, \u201cI understand that Patrick Baylis is now seeking to have Mr. Hove represent him. Since I was represented by Mr. Hove and was charged with these offenses, I have been advised that a conflict of interest may exist with Mr. Hove representing Patrick Baylis. I am aware of this and herby [sic] waive any conflict of interest regarding same.\u201d After explaining the inadequacy of Rodney\u2019s waiver and reviewing case authority, the trial court concluded: \u201cMr. Hove\u2019s former client, Rodney Baylis, has not submitted an intelligent and knowing waiver of the conflict of interest nor has he waived the confidentiality of his attorney-client communications. When representing Rodney, Mr. Hove attempted to place responsibility for the instant charges upon defendant. Now, he seeks to implicate his former client for these crimes. To that end, Mr. Hove will have the benefit of what he learned when he represented Rodney at trial. Mr. Hove may be called to testify in this case and could possibly be forced to disclose privileged communications. Under these facts, the Court finds Rodney Baylis\u2019 written waiver to be wholly insufficient and further finds that Mr. Hove\u2019s representation of Patrick Baylis, if allowed, poses a significant threat to the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">B. <em>The Existence of a Conflict Implicating Counsel\u2019s Duties to Rodney</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that there was a conflict requiring a waiver from Rodney. We disagree. Professional ethics demand that an attorney avoid conflicts of interest in which duties owed to different clients are in opposition. <em>(Flatt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 275, 282, &amp; fn. 2 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 885 P.2d 950] <em>(Flatt); </em>Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3-310.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A conflict of interest may arise from an attorney\u2019s concurrent or successive representation of clients with adverse interests. <em>(Flatt, </em>at pp. 283-284.) These two situations implicate distinct ethical concerns and public policies. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The trial court focused on rule 3-310(C), which relates to concurrent representation and requires informed written consent from clients where an attorney seeks to represent in a single matter multiple clients with potential or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>actual conflicts or where an attorney seeks to represent clients with adverse interests in separate matters. (Rule 3-310(C).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Concurrent representation of clients with adverse interests compromises an attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty. <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1146 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 980 P.2d 371] <em>(SpeeDee Oil).) </em>Defendant contends that his substitution request did not implicate rule 3-310(C) because Hove did not seek to represent defendant and Rodney concurrently either in a single matter or in separate matters. Respondent counters only that the \u201crecord does not affirmatively show that Hove was not representing Rodney in some capacity\u201d at the time the trial court considered the substitution request. On this record, we cannot determine whether the substitution request would have created a concurrent representation conflict implicating rule 3-310(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Whether or not granting the substitution request would have led to a concurrent representation, it is clear that the substitution request implicated ethical concerns applicable to the successive representation of clients with adverse interests. (See rule 3-310(E).) In the successive representation context, \u201cthe chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client <em>confidentiality </em>not loyalty. <em>(Flatt, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 283; accord, <em>SpeeDee Oil, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1146.) The former client\u2019s expectation of confidentiality must be preserved to ensure \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe right of every person to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law, and skilled in its practice, in order that the former may have adequate advice and a proper defense.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(SpeeDee Oil, </em>at p. 1146.) The attorney must maintain those confidences inviolate and preserve them at every peril to himself or herself. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (e).) Because of this duty, an attorney in actual possession of material confidential information from a former client may not represent an adverse party without the former client\u2019s consent. (Rule 3-310(E).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rule 3-310(E) addresses the conflict between a lawyer\u2019s duty to use all information at his or her disposal in order to represent a current client competently and the lawyer\u2019s continuing duty of loyalty to a former client with respect to information obtained during the course of the prior representation. (See Cal. State Bar, Com. on Prof. Responsibility, Ethics Opn. No. 1998-152 (1998) p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>When a conflict arises out of the successive representation of a former and a current client, disqualification turns on whether there is a substantial relationship between the former representation and the current representation. <em>(SpeeDee Oil, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1146; <em>Flatt, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 283.) \u201cWhere the requisite substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations can be demonstrated, access to confidential information by the attorney in the course of the first representation (relevant, by definition, to the second representation) is <em>presumed </em>and disqualification of the attorney\u2019s representation of the second client is mandatory . . . .\u201d <em>(Flatt, </em>at p. 283.) A substantial relationship is said to exist when it appears, by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client, that confidential information material to the current representation \u201cwould normally have been imparted to the attorney.\u201d <em>(Pour Le Bebe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Guess? Inc. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 810, 823 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 442] <em>(Pour Le Bebe).) </em>The court should focus on the similarities in the facts involved in the two representations, the legal questions posed, and the nature and extent of the attorney\u2019s involvement in each case. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Here, the trial court stated, \u201cWhen representing Rodney, Mr. Hove attempted to place responsibility for the instant charges upon defendant. Now, he seeks to implicate his former client [Rodney] for these crimes. To that end, Mr. Hove will have the benefit of what he learned when he represented Rodney at trial.\u201d Reasonably interpreted, this is an implicit finding that due to a substantial relationship between the two representations, it can be presumed that Hove obtained confidential information material to the prosecution of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Defendant contends that there is no substantial relationship between the two representations because the charges against Rodney for the Hayward rape had been dismissed by the time Hove became Rodney\u2019s attorney. But defendant disregards the undisputed facts that, in representing Rodney, Hove sought to implicate defendant in the Oakland sexual assault and to introduce evidence of the misidentification of Rodney in the Hayward case. Both representations involved the Hayward offenses, the subsequent police investigation, and misidentification by the victim; both representations involved the legal strategy of mistaken identification of the brothers; and Hove was intimately involved with the former representation as trial counsel for Rodney on the Alameda and Oakland offenses. (See <em>Pour Le Bebe, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 823.) In preparing for trial, Rodney would normally have imparted confidences to Hove, for example, regarding his whereabouts at the time of the Hayward kidnapping and rape; any involvement he had before, during, or after the crime; his knowledge of any of the persons or locations involved in the crime; any information inculpating or exculpating defendant in the offenses; and any insights he had about mounting a defense based on the physical similarities between the brothers. On the undisputed facts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>trial court properly concluded that there is a substantial relationship between the former representation of Rodney and the proposed representation of defendant. Hove was disqualified from representing defendant, absent an effective waiver of the conflict by Rodney.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">C. <em>Adequacy of Rodney\u2019s Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Defendant contends that even if there was a conflict of interest arising from Hove\u2019s former representation of Rodney, Rodney waived the conflict. The trial court concluded that Rodney\u2019s brief written waiver was inadequate, stating \u201c[Rodney\u2019s waiver] is not the full and complete, knowing and intelligent waiver that this Court believes is required here. Rodney Baylis does not acknowledge the possibility that his brother, Patrick, will seek to inculpate him as the perpetrator of these offenses. The waiver makes no mention of the possibility that the District Attorney may attempt to call Mr. Hove as a witness or that Mr. Hove may be forced to disclose otherwise privileged attorney-client communications made to Mr. Hove. . . . The waiver is silent as to the possibility that information that Mr. Hove gained while representing Rodney may be used to assist Patrick, to Rodney\u2019s possible detriment. In sum, in contrast to Patrick Baylis\u2019 waiver, Rodney\u2019s waiver contains no evidence that he is aware of the drawbacks to waiving the conflict of interest.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Denial of defendant\u2019s substitution request was effectively a determination that Hove was disqualified from representing Patrick. The trial court\u2019s power to disqualify an attorney derives from Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(5), which authorizes a trial court to \u201ccontrol in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it . . . .\u201d (See <em>People v. Jones </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 234, 244, fn. 2 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 579, 91 P.3d 939] <em>(Jones).) </em>This section applies in criminal cases, and the trial court\u2019s decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court\u2019s authority to deny a motion to substitute rests on similar grounds and should be given similar deference on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring an <em>informed </em>waiver from Rodney in the circumstances of this case. Where a defendant seeks to waive his counsel\u2019s conflict of interest, the waiver must be a knowing and intelligent act \u201c \u2018done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number><em>Mroczko </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 86, 109-110 [197 Cal.Rptr. 52, 672 P.2d 835].) A waiver may be properly taken where the court has assured itself that (1) the defendant has discussed the potential drawbacks of joint representation with his attorney or outside counsel, (2) the defendant has been made aware of the dangers and possible consequences of joint representation in the case, (3) the defendant knows of his right to conflict-free representation, and (4) the defendant voluntarily wishes to waive that right. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 110.) That exacting standard is calculated to ensure a legitimate waiver of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to conflict-free counsel and to insulate any conviction from a later challenge on appeal based on the conflict. (See <em>Alcocer v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 951, 959 [254 Cal.Rptr. 72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Also instructive is the standard for former client consent under the Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 3-310(E) requires the former client\u2019s \u201cinformed written consent\u201d to any subsequent adverse representation implicating the duty of confidentiality. Such consent requires the former client\u2019s written agreement to the representation following written disclosure of the relevant circumstances and of the actual and reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences to the former client. (Rule 3-310(A).) The \u201cinformed written consent\u201d requirement of rule 3-310(E) may not literally apply here. The State Bar\u2019s Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility and Conduct has indicated that the fact that a court presumes that counsel possesses material confidential information due to a substantial relationship between two representations does not necessarily mean that absent consent the counsel is subject to discipline under rule 3-310(E), because the rule requires the <em>actual </em>possession of confidential information. (Cal. State Bar, Com. on Prof. Responsibility, Ethics Opn. No. 1998-152, <em>supra, </em>at p. 8, fns. 7 &amp; 8.) Nevertheless, the extent of disclosure required under the rule indicates that only an <em>informed </em>waiver of rights is adequate to protect the former client\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Under any standard or definition of informed waiver, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Rodney\u2019s waiver inadequate. The waiver simply states that \u201cI have been advised that a conflict of interest may exist with Mr. Hove representing Patrick Baylis. I am aware of this and herby [szc] waive any conflict of interest regarding same.\u201d This language reflects no awareness of the nature and seriousness of the conflict involved. As the trial court pointed out, the waiver does not specifically address any of the potential adverse consequences of the representation, including that Hove\u2019s representation of defendant would likely involve an effort to implicate him in the Hayward rape, including by undermining the DNA evidence that exonerated Rodney. At the second to last hearing on the motion to substitute, the trial court told Hove that he should consider supplementing Rodney\u2019s \u201cfairly general\u201d written waiver, but Hove declined to obtain a more detailed waiver. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>In the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in concluding that Rodney\u2019s waiver was inadequate and denying the motion to substitute on that ground.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Defendant contends that Rodney\u2019s written waiver was adequate to waive any conflict arising from Hove\u2019s representation of defendant. Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 884, 892 [164 Cal.Rptr. 746], which held that a defendant, by failing to object, \u201cimpliedly consented\u201d to being prosecuted by a district attorney who previously was the head of a law office that represented the defendant on a prior criminal complaint based on the same facts. Defendant contends that if the <em>Johnson </em>defendant could impliedly consent, then Rodney\u2019s express written consent must be adequate. <em>Johnson </em>is distinguishable, because there the defendant failed to object, entered a guilty plea, and then attempted to overturn the sentence on appeal. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant thereby denied the trial court an opportunity to develop a factual record and determine whether an actual conflict existed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly distinguishable are decisions in civil cases such as <em>River West, Inc. v. Nickel </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1297 [234 Cal.Rptr. 33], in which a former client was found to have impliedly consented to an adverse representation. There, the former client had knowledge of the adverse representation but unreasonably delayed asserting an objection; a finding of implied waiver was appropriate because of the unreasonableness of the delay and the great prejudice that would have resulted to the current client if disqualification were granted. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1309, 1313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In this case we are not confronted with an attempt by a defendant to overturn a conviction by raising a conflict that he could have\u2014but did not\u2014raise before the trial court. Neither are we confronted with an untimely motion to disqualify by a former client in a civil matter. Instead, we are dealing with denial of a motion to substitute due to the trial court\u2019s pretrial concerns about the adequacy of a former client\u2019s waiver. Where a trial court preparing for a criminal trial is confronted with an actual conflict of interest that may affect the integrity of those proceedings, the trial court is not obligated to accept as adequate a consent or waiver in whatever form it appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">D. <em>Defendant\u2019s Constitutional Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Finally, we mm to defendant\u2019s contention that even if there was a conflict involving Rodney and even if Rodney did not adequately waive that conflict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>denial of the motion to substitute was an unconstitutional infringement on defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Defendant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Broadly speaking, this case implicates the tension between the trial court\u2019s power to disqualify counsel to maintain ethical standards in the successive representation context and the defendant\u2019s right to choose counsel. Under both the state and federal Constitutions, a defendant in a criminal case has a right to the assistance of counsel <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 808, 833 [254 Cal.Rptr. 298, 765 P.2d 460]), and that right embraces the right to retain counsel of one\u2019s own choice, within limits <em>(Yorn v. Superior Court </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 669, 674 [153 Cal.Rptr. 295] <em>(Yorn)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The \u201cessential aim\u201d of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cis to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d <em>(Wheat v. United States </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 153, 159 [108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140] <em>(Wheat).) </em>Under the federal Constitution, trial courts are allowed \u201csubstantial latitude\u201d in refusing a defendant\u2019s waiver of a conflict of interest. <em>(Wheat, </em>at p. 163.) Some California courts have rejected the <em>Wheat </em>court\u2019s \u201cpaternalistic treatment\u201d of defendants, concluding that the state Constitution makes a defendant \u201cmaster of his own fate.\u201d <em>(Alcocer v. Superior Court, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 956-957.) Under <em>Alcocer, </em>California law broadly protects a defendant\u2019s right to waive a conflict of interest on the part of retained counsel. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 956-957; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Burrows </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 116, 122 [269 Cal.Rptr. 206].)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Respondent contends that <em>Alcocer v. Superior Court, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 951, is not good law and that, under both the state and federal Constitutions, trial courts have substantial latitude in refusing a waiver of a conflict of interest. (See <em>Wheat, supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 163.) The California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th 234, may be read to offer support for this contention. The court upheld removal of a defendant\u2019s appointed counsel over the defendant\u2019s objection because counsel had a conflict of interest involving a former client who may have been involved in the murder for which the defendant was on trial. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 237-238, 241-242, 244-245.) The court questioned whether certain of its earlier decisions, offering broad protection for a defendant\u2019s right to choose counsel, were decided under the federal or state Constitutions, reasoning that if they were decided under the federal Constitution they were superseded by <em>Wheat. (Jones, </em>at pp. 243-244.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>Nevertheless, <em>Jones </em>declined to overrule Alcocer, stating \u201c[w]e need not decide whether the state Constitution permits a defendant to insist on being represented by a <em>retained </em>attorney who has a potential conflict of interest, for here defendant\u2019s attorney was appointed by the court, not privately retained by defendant.\u201d <em>(Jones, </em>at p. 245, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We need not decide whether <em>Alcocer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 951, is still good law after <em>Jones, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th 234, because, even if we assume that the California Constitution is more protective of a defendant\u2019s right to choose retained counsel, disqualification of Hove was not unconstitutional. If the state Constitution is more protective, then the applicable standard, set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Crovedi </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 199, 208 [53 Cal.Rptr. 284, 417 P.2d 868], is that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice may be forced to yield only where it would result in a \u201cdisruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d (See <em>Jones, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 251-252 (conc. opn. of Werdegar, J.) [stating that the rule under the more expansive reading of the California Constitution is set forth in <em>Crovedi, </em>quoted in <em>People v. McKenzie </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 616 [194 Cal.Rptr. 462, 668 P.2d 769]].) This stringent test has been satisfied because to allow Hove to represent defendant would create an actual and substantial conflict of interest implicating Hove\u2019s duty of confidentiality to his former client Rodney; as discussed <em>ante, </em>Rodney did not adequately waive the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">This case presents different considerations than those discussed in <em>Alcocer v. Superior Court, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 951. The question before us is not whether defendant could waive the conflict but whether the trial court could disqualify Hove to enforce ethical standards meant to protect Rodney\u2019s interests. That a defendant is \u201cmaster of his own fate\u201d does not mean that the trial court must disregard the interests of others potentially adversely affected by the representation and the effect of the conflict on the integrity of the judicial process. Defendant could not waive those considerations. <em>(People v. Peoples </em>(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1592, 1599 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 173].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">It is established that a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his or her choosing may be forced to yield in order to enforce the duty of confidentiality where the former client is a codefendant. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Leversen </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 530 [194 Cal.Rptr. 448, 668 P.2d 755], \u201cAn attorney is forbidden to use against a former client any confidential information that was acquired during that client relationship. [Citations.] Moreover, the attorney has a duty to withdraw, or apply to a court for permission to withdraw, from representation that violates those obligations. [Citation.] So important is that duty that it has been enforced against a defendant\u2019s attorney at the [insistence] of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>former client (who was also a codefendant) even at the expense of depriving the defendant of his choice of counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 538, citing <em>Yorn, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In <em>Yorn, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 669, defendant Yorn retained Attorney Morgan. Yom\u2019s codefendant, Hesemeyer, sought to disqualify Morgan because Morgan had previously represented Hesemeyer and had obtained confidential information relevant to the pending case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.) The trial court granted the motion to disqualify and Yom filed a petition for writ of mandamus, contending the removal of Morgan violated his constitutional right to counsel of his own choice. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 673.) The court noted that the case demonstrated a classic confrontation between an accused\u2019s right to counsel of choice and counsel\u2019s duty to preserve his former client\u2019s confidences. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 674.) Although Yom was willing to waive any error arising from Morgan\u2019s conflicting interests, Yom could not waive Hesemeyer\u2019s right to confidentiality. The court concluded, \u201cYom\u2019s qualified right to be represented by counsel of choice is outweighed by significant countervailing considerations ... to submit to Yom\u2019s claim of unfettered choice of counsel would work an unnecessary but serious prejudice to the interests of his codefendant and unreasonably infringe upon her own right of due process. [][] Balancing Yom\u2019s limited right to retain counsel of his own choice against his codefendant\u2019s right to a fair trial coupled with the paramount objective of maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the courts and the integrity of its professional bar, the former must yield 1 \u201cto considerations of ethics which mn to the very integrity of our judicial process.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Here, Rodney was a former indicted suspect who conceivably could have been prosecuted again<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had Hove been successful in implicating him or had Hove been successful in undermining the DNA evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although Rodney signed a declaration waiving the conflict of interest, there is no indication that Rodney was actually aware of the potential adverse consequences of the representation. Furthermore, this case involved denial of a motion to substitute rather than involuntary <em>removal </em>of a defendant\u2019s counsel. Removal of counsel poses a greater threat to the right to counsel because the removal interferes with an attorney-client relationship that has already been established. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>It appears that defendant would have us adopt a blanket rule that a conflict involving a former client who is not a codefendant will not justify denial of a motion to substitute so long as the defendant on trial freely and intelligently waives the conflict. It would seriously impact the integrity of the judicial process and subvert the basic purpose of the relevant standards of professional responsibility were we in every instance to compel trial courts to disregard defense counsel\u2019s serious ethical conflicts affecting nondefendant former clients in the name of preserving the defendant\u2019s right to choose counsel. (See <em>People v. Peoples, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1599; <em>Yorn, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at p. 676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">\u201c[U]ltimately the issue involves a conflict between a client\u2019s right to counsel of his choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility. \u2018The preservation of public trust both in the scrupulous administration of justice and in the integrity of the bar is paramount. . . . (The client\u2019s recognizably important right to counsel of his choice) must yield, however, to considerations of ethics which run to the very integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Comden v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 906, 915 [145 Cal.Rptr. 9, 576 P.2d 971]; accord, <em>SpeeDee Oil, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1145.) <em>Comden </em>applies in a criminal case presenting a sufficiently serious ethical conflict. (See <em>People v. Peoples, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1599.) Even if the California Constitution is interpreted as more protective of the right to retained counsel of choice than the federal Constitution, a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice may be forced to yield where it would result in a \u201cdisruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crovedi, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 208.) Here, the trial court was faced with the possibility that Hove would use confidential information acquired during the representation of Rodney in order to implicate Rodney in the offenses with which defendant was charged. \u201cProtecting the confidentiality of communications between attorney and client is fundamental to our legal system.\u201d <em>(SpeeDee Oil, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1146; see also <em>Yorn, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at p. 675.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that where confronted with an actual and substantial conflict of interest involving counsel\u2019s duty of confidentiality to a former client, a trial court may exercise its discretion to disqualify the conflicted attorney absent an informed waiver from the former client.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Jones, P.
