In these circumstances, we hold that neither section 673 nor section 677.2 requires the insurer to provide notice of cancellation to an additional named insured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">Cross-complainant The Gorham Company, Inc. (Gorham), appeals from the summary judgment granted in favor of cross-defendant First Financial Insurance Company (First Financial) on Gorham\u2019s first amended cross-complaint. Gorham also challenges the denial of its own motion for summary adjudication. The issues in this appeal arise from Gorham\u2019s contention that First Financial, the insurer of one of Gorham\u2019s subcontractors on a construction project for which Gorham was the general contractor, had a duty to defend Gorham when it was sued for construction defects allegedly caused by the subcontractor\u2019s negligent work. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">A. <em>The Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">In January 1997, Gorham contracted with the City of Los Angeles Harbor Department (the City) to be the general contractor for the construction of a publicly owned community center. Gorham\u2019s wood framing subcontractor on the project was Reza Ebrahimi doing business as PDC Associates (PDC). PDC was insured by First Financial, which issued a commercial lines policy to PDC for the policy period September 5, 1997 to September 5, 1998 (the PDC policy). The additional-insured endorsement of the PDC policy made Gorham an \u201cinsured\u201d for any liability arising out of PDC\u2019s work for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>Gorham.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PDC financed the policy premium through a lender, Arizona Premium Finance Co., Inc. (APFC). As part of the financing agreement, PDC assigned its right to cancel the policy to APFC in the event PDC did not pay its premium. On November 25, 1997, on instructions from APFC, First Financial cancelled the policy for nonpayment of the premium. Gorham did not receive notice of the cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">PDC continued to work on the project until July 8, 1998, when Gorham terminated PDC. PDC had not finished its work. In November 1998, Gorham terminated its contract with the City, and left the project. The City then replaced Gorham with another general contractor, who finished construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">B. <em>The Underlying Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Complex litigation involving the City, Gorham and PDC ensued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The various actions ultimately were deemed related and assigned to a single judge. As here relevant, in March 1999, Gorham sued the City for various claims, contending that the City\u2019s plans were defective. The City then filed a cross-complaint against Gorham alleging, among other things, that Gorham breached its contract, and that its negligent work caused many defects in construction. Gorham then filed a cross-complaint of its own against its subcontractors, including PDC, alleging that the construction defects identified by the City were caused by the subcontractor\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">To fund its defense to the City\u2019s cross-complaint, Gorham tendered its defense not only to its own liability carriers, but also to its subcontractors\u2019 carriers, including First Financial, relying on its status as an additional insured under the subcontractors\u2019 policies. Gorham\u2019s liability carriers, and the carriers for several subcontractors, accepted Gorham\u2019s defense. First Financial, however, was not among them. First Financial denied the tender on various grounds, including that no property damage covered by the PDC policy had occurred while the policy was active.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Ultimately, with the exception of Gorham\u2019s cross-complaint against PDC, the underlying litigation settled. Included among the settled claims was the City\u2019s cross-complaint against Gorham.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>C. <em>The Instant Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">First Financial commenced the instant case by filing a complaint for declaratory relief against PDC and Gorham. First Financial was funding PDC\u2019s defense to Gorham\u2019s still pending cross-complaint in the underlying litigation. First Financial\u2019s declaratory relief complaint in the instant case sought a declaration that First Financial had no duty to defend and indemnify PDC against Gorham\u2019s claims. In a ruling not involved in this appeal, the trial court granted summary judgment for First Financial on its declaratory relief complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">However, before that ruling, Gorham filed a cross-complaint in the instant action against First Financial, seeking damages for First Financial\u2019s failure to participate in funding Gorham\u2019s defense to the City\u2019s cross-complaint in the underlying litigation. Gorham\u2019s operative pleading is its first amended cross-complaint, and it is that pleading which is in issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Gorham\u2019s first amended cross-complaint alleges that Gorham was an additional insured under PDC\u2019s policy, and that First Financial had a duty to defend Gorham against the City\u2019s claims. Gorham alleges causes of action for breach of contract (on first-party and third-party-beneficiary theories), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">D. <em>First Financial\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">First Financial moved for summary judgment on Gorham\u2019s first amended cross-complaint. Its motion raised two grounds: (1) under the terms of the PDC policy, there was no potential for coverage for damages sought by the City\u2019s cross-complaint in the underlying litigation; and (2) because other insurers defended and indemnified Gorham in the underlying litigation, Gorham suffered no damage from First Financial\u2019s failure to participate in the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">E. <em>Gorham\u2019s Motion for Summary Adjudication</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">Gorham moved for summary adjudication on its first amended cross-complaint. However, its notice of motion failed to identify the issues on which summary adjudication was sought. Its memorandum of points and authorities identified two issues: (1) whether First Financial\u2019s cancellation of the PDC insurance policy was effective as to Gorham; and (2) whether damage done by PDC invoked coverage under the PDC policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>F. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">The trial court granted First Financial\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded that under the language of the PDC policy, First Financial had no duty to defend Gorham against the City\u2019s cross-complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court therefore did not discuss the second issue raised by First Financial\u2019s motion\u2014whether Gorham suffered any damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">The court denied Gorham\u2019s motion for summary adjudication because the notice of motion failed to state the issues sought to be adjudicated. In the alternative, the court ruled that the issue of whether the PDC policy was cancelled was not a proper issue for summary adjudication. Further, the court observed that the issue of whether First Financial had a duty to defend Gorham was resolved by the ruling on First Financial\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">On appeal, Gorham challenges both the grant of summary judgment, and the denial of summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">I. First Financial\u2019s Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">As noted, the trial court granted First Financial\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Gorham\u2019s first amended cross-complaint. All of Gorham\u2019s causes of action depend on the existence of a duty by First Financial to defend Gorham against the City\u2019s cross-complaint in the underlying litigation. Because Gorham is an additional named insured under the PDC policy, First Financial\u2019s duty to defend under that policy extends to Gorham if any of the City\u2019s claims sought damages possibly covered by the PDC policy. (See <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 21, 29, 34 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">Gorham contends, in substance, that the City\u2019s cross-complaint in the underlying litigation alleged claims that invoked the \u201cproperty damage\u201d coverage of the PDC policy. Therefore, according to Gorham, First Financial had a duty to defend Gorham against the City\u2019s claims, and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>The evidence necessary to determine the existence of such a duty\u2014the language of the policy, and the circumstances under which the policy was canceled\u2014are undisputed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether there is a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 860 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].) We conclude that there is no possibility of coverage under the PDC policy. The policy period ended on November 25, 1997, when the policy was cancelled. Any damage caused by PDC\u2019s work within the scope of the City\u2019s cross-complaint in the underlying litigation occurred after that date, and was the result of PDC\u2019s ongoing operations. Therefore, the damage was not covered by the PDC policy, and the trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">A. <em>Cancellation of the Policy Under Section 673</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The \u201cInsuring Agreement\u201d section of the PDC policy obligates First Financial to \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d It also obligates First Financial \u201cto defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.\u201d Subject to various exclusions, the policy defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d to include \u201c[pjhysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property.\u201d To be covered, such \u201cproperty damage\u201d must \u201coccur[] during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">Setting aside for the moment the precise boundaries of \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the policy, we first decide whether the policy was effectively canceled on November 25, 1997, thereby ending the policy period. We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">The undisputed evidence shows that PDC financed the purchase of its policy by entering a \u201cpremium finance agreement\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 18564) with APFC, an \u201cindustrial loan company\u201d (Fin. Code, former \u00a7 18003).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As part of its premium finance agreement with APFC, PDC assigned its right to cancel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>the policy to APFC in the event PDC did not pay its premium under the agreement.* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The PDC insurance policy gave PDC, as \u201c[t]he first Named Insured shown in the Declarations,\u201d the right to cancel the policy \u201cby mailing or delivering to [First Financial] advance written notice of cancellation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">Upon PDC\u2019s failure to make a required installment payment, APFC sent notice of cancellation to First Financial, instructing First Financial to cancel the policy effective November 25, 1997. The notice stated that APFC was canceling the policy for nonpayment of the premium. As instructed, First Financial canceled the policy effective November 25, 1997. Neither APFC nor First Financial sent notice of cancellation to Gorham.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Gorham contends that because it received no notice of the cancellation, policy coverage for Gorham as an additional named insured did not terminate. Section 673, however, provides otherwise. Section 673 governs cancellation of an insurance policy by a lender for nonpayment of the premium. We set forth the provisions relevant to this case in the margin, and discuss them individually as necessary to resolve the issues in this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>Subdivision (b) of section 673 states: \u201cNo lender shall exercise the right to cancel a financed insurance policy because of the default of the insured under a premium payment loan agreement except in accordance with this section.\u201d In relevant part, the term \u201cexercise the right to cancel\u201d is defined by subdivision (a) of section 673 as \u201cthe act of formally electing to use the right of the insured to cancel any insurance policy in accordance with and subject to the provisions of that policy,\u201d when the right has been assigned in writing to the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">When the lender is an industrial loan company (Fin. Code, \u00a7 18003), the relevant procedure for cancellation is provided by section 673, subdivision (d). The procedure of subdivision (d) involves three steps, none of which requires the lender or insurer to give notice of cancellation to additional named insureds such as Gorham.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">First, subdivision (d) provides that the \u201cindustrial loan company shall, <em>in giving the insured 10 days\u2019 notice of its intent to cancel pursuant to Section 18608 of the Financial Code, </em>furnish a copy of such notice to the insurance agent or insurance broker indicated on the premium finance agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 673, subd. (d), italics added.) Financial Code section 18608 requires the lender to \u201cmail to the insured, to his last known address or to the address shown on the premium finance agreement at least 10 days prior to cancellation, a notice of its intent to cancel the insurance contract or contracts.\u201d The \u201cinsured\u201d entitled to such notice is \u201cthe person who has purchased or arranged to purchase an insurance contract and who enters into a premium finance agreement with a premium finance agency.\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 18562.) The term \u201cinsured\u201d does not encompass an additional named insured such as Gorham. Therefore, the notice required by the first step of section 673, subdivision (d), does not include additional insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">Second, \u201c[a]fter expiration of the 10-day period, the industrial loan company may thereafter, in the name of the insured, cancel the insurance contract or contracts by mailing to the insurer a written notice of cancellation, and the insurance contract shall be cancelled as if the notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured person, but without requiring the return of the insurance contract or contracts.\u201d (\u00a7 673, subd. (d).) Thus, the lender\u2019s notice of cancellation, sent to the insurer, effects a cancellation of the policy in the same manner as if the insured had exercised the right to cancel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>Third, \u201c[t]he industrial loan company shall also mail a notice of cancellation, setting forth the effective date of cancellation of the finance insurance contract, to <em>the insured </em>at his or her last known address and to the insurance agent or insurance broker indicated on the premium finance agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 673, subd. (d), italics added.) As we have noted, \u201cthe insured\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (d) is the person who purchased the policy through the premium finance agreement. The term \u201cinsured\u201d does not include additional named insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Thus, section 673, subdivision (d) does not require the lender to provide notice of cancellation to an additional named insured. Nor does it impose that duty on the insurer. Indeed, with limited exceptions listed in subdivision (f) (discussed below), the insurer is <em>relieved </em>of any duty of notification. Section 673, subdivision (i) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn insurer relying upon written exercise of that right [i. e., the lender\u2019s exercise of the insured\u2019s right to cancel the policy] containing a confirmation of cancellation date . . . <em>shall be relieved from complying with any other duty or form of cancellation required by this code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Therefore, when the insurer terminates the policy after receiving the industrial loan company\u2019s notice that it is exercising the insured\u2019s right to cancel, the insurer has no further duty of notification to effect cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">Gorham contends that it was entitled to notice from First Financial under subdivision (f) of section 673. Subdivision (f) states a limited exception requiring the insurer to notify governmental agencies, mortgagees, or other third parties when required by statute, regulation, or contract. Subdivision (f) provides: <em>\u201cAll statutory, regulatory, and contractual restrictions providing that the financed insurance policy may not be canceled unless notice is given to a governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party shall apply where cancellation is effected under this section. </em>The insurer shall give the prescribed notice on behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party on or before the fifth business day after the day it receives ... a written notice of cancellation from an industrial loan company, pursuant to subdivision (d), and shall, for purpose of the notice, determine the effective date of cancellation as to those persons mentioned in this subdivision only, taking into consideration the number of days\u2019 notice required to complete the cancellation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Gorham asserts that it is a \u201cthird party\u201d entitled to notice under subdivision (f). Yet Gorham points to no regulatory or contractual restrictions providing <em>that the </em>financed policy <em>may not be cancelled unless </em>Gorham receives notice. Gorham suggests that there is a statutory restriction that requires notice from the insurer\u2014section 677.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>Section 677.2 \u201capplies only to cancellations pursuant to Section 676.2.\u201d (\u00a7 677.2, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For purposes of section 677.2 (and 676.2 as well), the term \u201c 1 [cancellation\u2019 means termination of coverage by an insurer <em>(other than termination at the request of the insured) </em>during a policy period.\u201d (\u00a7 660, italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When such a cancellation by the insurer occurs for nonpayment of the premium, section 677.2 requires that the insurer provide 10 days\u2019 written notice to \u201cthe named insured.\u201d (\u00a7 677.2, subd. (b).) In <em>Kotlar v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1121 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 246], the court construed the term \u201cnamed insured\u201d to include additional insureds named in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">Contrary to Gorham\u2019s contention, section 677.2 is inapplicable to cancellation of the PDC policy under section 673. As noted, section 677.2 applies only to termination of the policy other than at the insured\u2019s request. Termination of the policy under 673, however, is treated the same as termination at the request of the insured: the lender formally elects to use the insured\u2019s right to cancel the policy (\u00a7 673, subd. (a)); the lender gives notice of cancellation to the insurer \u201cin the name of the insured\u201d (\u00a7 673, subd. (d)); and the insurer cancels the insurance \u201cas if the notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured person\u201d (\u00a7 673, subd. (d)). Because the cancellation is treated as if made at the request of the insured, and because the insurer is \u201crelieved from complying with any other duty or form of cancellation required by\u201d the Insurance Code (\u00a7 673, subd. (i)), section 677.2 is not a \u201cstatutory . . . restriction[] providing that the financed insurance policy may not be canceled unless notice is given to [a] third party\u201d (\u00a7 673, subd. (f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Gorham argues that interpreting section 673 so as to permit cancellation of the policy without notice from the insurer to additional named insureds would be absurd, and would defeat the purpose of the statute. According to Gorham, additional named insureds must be given the opportunity to reinstate the policy in order to protect themselves, and to protect persons who might suffer bodily injury or property damage. Although courts may disregard literal interpretation of a statute to avoid absurd results <em>(California School Employees Assn. v. Governing Board </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>340 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 878 P.2d 1321]), they should do so rarely, and only in \u201cextreme cases\u201d\u2014those in which, as a matter of law, the Legislature did not intend the statute to have its literal effect. <em>(Unzueta v. Ocean View School Dist. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1689, 1698, 1700 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 614] <em>(Unzueta).) </em>Gorham\u2019s case does not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">The legislative history of section 673 shows that the statute was intended to require premium financers to provide the insured who financed the policy with advance notice of intent to exercise the insured\u2019s right to cancel the insurance, and to provide confirming notice of actual cancellation. The notice requirements were designed to permit the insured to obtain replacement insurance, and to notify any third-party claimants as to whether the insurance was in effect. (See Enrolled Bill Rep., Assem. Bill No. 1850 July 21, 1970; Sen. Finance Com. Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 1850 (1970 Reg. Sess.).) Where longer notice periods might be required by law or contract for third parties such as mortgage lenders or governmental agencies, subdivision (f) of section 673 was designed to delay cancellation of the policy as to those parties until the longer notice was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Nothing in the legislative history suggests that the Legislature intended section 673 to require insurers to provide notice of cancellation to persons named in additional-insured endorsements, absent some independent contractual or legal requirement for such notice. Therefore, we do not disregard the literal for an embellished reading of the statute that would require notice to additional named insureds. <em>(Unzueta, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1698, 1700.) Such a reading would not be statutory interpretation, but statutory revision with no basis in the statutory language or legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">We conclude that Gorham was not entitled to notice of APFC\u2019s intent to cancel the policy. First Financial\u2019s termination of the policy on November 25, 1997, based on APFC\u2019s notice, was effective, and the policy period ended on that date. To be covered by the PDC policy, any property damage caused by PDC\u2019s work must have occurred before the cancellation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">B. <em>Property Damage Coverage</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">II.
