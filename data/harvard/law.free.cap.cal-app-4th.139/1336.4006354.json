J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (the CERL) (Gov. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 31450) establishes retirement allowances for persons classified as \u201cgeneral members\u201d (see \u00a7 31670 et seq.) and more generous retirement allowances for persons classified as \u201csafety members\u201d (see \u00a7 31662 et seq.). Although safety members receive more generous benefits, they must contribute to their county retirement systems at a higher rate than general members. (Compare \u00a7 31620 et seq. with \u00a7 31639 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Section 31469.4 defines safety members to include \u201cpersons employed as probation officers,\u201d but provides, \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not be applicable in any county until the board of supervisors by resolution make the provisions applicable.\u201d When a county adopts the provisions of section 31469.4, the employees affected must elect, within one year, to be treated as safety officers. (\u00a7 31558.6.) When by amendment to the CERL the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>of safety members is expanded, affected employees may also elect to have their previous service treated as service of a safety member. (\u00a7 31639.7.) However, the employees must make this election at the time they elect to be treated as safety members and arrange to contribute the difference between their prior contributions and the higher contributions required of safety members plus interest. (\u00a7 31639.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Following a collective bargaining agreement with its probation officers, defendant and respondent County of San Diego (the County) made section 31469.4 applicable in San Diego as of January 1, 1999, and by virtue of the collecting bargaining agreement, then-current probation officers elected to become safety members of defendant and respondent San Diego County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association (the Association).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Plaintiffs and appellants Gary Bonner, Jeffrey Flynn and Merrie L. Birkenbach (collectively, appellants) are former probation officers, each of whom ceased being a County employee prior to January 1, 1999. At the time they left County employment, each of the appellants was eligible to leave their \u201caccumulated contributions in the [County\u2019s] retirement fund and be granted a deferred retirement allowance,\u201d which they could begin to collect at the time they could have retired if they had remained in county service. (\u00a7 31700.) Each of the appellants elected deferred retirement when they left the County\u2019s employ prior to January 1, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Each of the appellants applied to the Association for a retirement allowance after January 1, 1999. Although they had not elected to have their earlier service treated as safety member service or contributed the difference between their general member contributions and the amount required of safety members, they asserted that they were entitled to the benefit of the County\u2019s adoption of section 31469.4. They relied on section 31705 which provides that persons on deferred retirement are entitled to have their \u201cretirement allowance . . . calculated according to the provisions of [the CERE] as they exist at the time of the commencement of the retirement allowance.\u201d (\u00a7 31705.) The Association declined to provide the appellants with safety member allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Appellants filed this action against the County and the Association (collectively, respondents). In their complaint, appellants claimed the Association improperly failed to calculate their retirement benefits in accordance with section 31705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment in which they claimed the Association did not violate section 31705 in calculating appellants\u2019 retirement allowances because appellants were not entitled to be reclassified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>from general to safety members, since they were not County employees at the time section 31469.4 became applicable in the County. The trial court granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment and subsequently entered judgment in favor of respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">We affirm. Although the CERL allows certain employees who are leaving County service to elect deferred retirement, the CERL does not give them the right to make any further elections which may thereafter be afforded County employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Appellants are former probation officers in the County who left County employment prior to January 1, 1999. Upon leaving County service, each appellant elected deferred retirement from the County and became employed with another public agency within the CERL system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In December 1998 the San Diego County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution that provides in pertinent part: \u201cIT IS RESOLVED that the Board of Supervisors of the County of San Diego hereby determines that effective January 1, 1999, the provisions of Government Code section 31469.4 [defining safety members to include \u2018persons employed as probation officers\u2019] are applicable in the County of San Diego.\u201d As the County notes, this resolution was adopted as a part of a collective bargaining process between the County and the San Diego County Probation Officers Association (the Union). The County and the Union had agreed that probation officers would have safety member status prospectively and could purchase, on a revenue neutral basis, credit for past safety service.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">In March 2002 Bonner and Flynn each retired and began receiving retirement benefits from the Association.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In March 2003 appellants brought an action against respondents,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Appellants sought, among other forms of relief: (1) a judicial determination that respondents had violated section 31705 by calculating appellants\u2019 retirement benefits under provisions of the CERL that were in effect at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>they went on deferred status, rather than according to the provisions of the CERL as they existed at the time payment of appellants\u2019 retirement allowances commenced; and (2) an injunction prohibiting respondents from making such incorrect calculations in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">In November 2003 respondents filed a joint motion for summary judgment on the ground that section 31469.4 did not apply to appellants because they were not employed as safety members on the date section 31469.4 became applicable in the County. Appellants opposed the motion. After oral argument, the trial court granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in their favor. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Appellants claim that although they were not County employees as of the date section 31469.4<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> became applicable in the County, they are entitled to receive safety member allowances from the Association when they retired. In particular, appellants claim that section 31639.7<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requires that the Association allow them to purchase safety member credit for service performed prior to the effective date of section 31469.4 in the County.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellants claim the trial court erred in granting respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">\u201cPursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), summary judgment is proper where the papers submitted demonstrate that there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Barbee v. Household Automotive Finance Corp. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 525, 530 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 406].) \u201c[I]t is well settled that on appeal following summary judgment the trial court\u2019s reasoning is irrelevant, and the matter is reviewed on appeal de novo.\u201d <em>(Jimenez </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 133, 140 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">\n<em>General Principles of Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">\u201cIn construing any statute, \u2018[w]ell-established rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018We first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent. [Citation.] The words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.\u2019 [Citation.] If the statutory language is unambiguous, \u2018we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Whaley </em>v. <em>Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 479, 484-485 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 88] <em>(Whaley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">We also recognize that \u201c[a]ny ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of pension legislation must be resolved in favor of the pensioner, but such construction must be consistent with the clear language and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>(Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. v. Board of Retirement </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 483, 490 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 940 P.2d 891].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Finally, as we explain more fully below, of some import here is the rule of statutory construction that \u201ca later, more specific statute controls over an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>earlier, general statute.\u201d <em>(Woods v. Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315, 324 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">\n<em>Section 31469.4 Is a Later, More Specific Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">By its terms the safety member classification provided to probation officers and other employees by section 31469.4 is \u201cnot. . . applicable in any county <em>until </em>the board of supervisors by resolution make the provisions applicable.\u201d (Italics added.) Read in isolation, section 31469.4 is strictly prospective and provides no enhancement with respect to prior service. It applies solely to those who are <em>employed </em>by a county at the time it is adopted by the County. In contrast, section 31705 provides that the retirement allowance of deferred retirees be calculated according to \u201cthe provisions of this chapter as they exist at the time of the commencement of the retirement allowance.\u201d Because section 31705 only impacts the prior service of deferred employees, in its application section 31705 is entirely retrospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Here, where a deferred retiree argues he is entitled to the benefits of section 31469.4, the challenge we face is largely a matter of harmonizing the prospective terms of section 31469.4 and the retrospective application of section 31705. In meeting this analytical challenge we are assisted by the statutory rule which gives precedence to a later, more specific enactment over an earlier, general provision. (See <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 324.) In this regard we note that section 31705 is part of article 9 of the CERL, which sets forth a County employee\u2019s right to defer retirement. Article 9 provides the right to defer retirement to <em>\u201c[a]ny member, </em>whether over or under the minimum age of voluntary service retirement, who leaves county service after completing five years of service or who leaves service and within 90 days . . . becomes a member of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System.\u201d (\u00a7 31700, italics added.) Article 9, including the retrospective provisions of section 31705, was enacted in 1947. (Stats. 1947, ch. 424, \u00a7 1, p. 1279.) Section 31469.4 applies only to \u201cprobation officers, juvenile hall or juvenile home group counselors, and group supervisors who are primarily engaged in the control and custody of delinquent youths\u201d and only in counties where it has been adopted by the board of supervisors. Section 31469.4 was enacted in 1969. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1463, \u00a7 1, p. 2983.) Plainly, article 9 and section 31705 are provisions of broader and more general application than the far narrower focus of the later provisions of section 31469.4. Thus, our initial and primary focus must be on section 31469.4 and whether its provisions can be interpreted in a manner which extends its benefits to deferred employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">\n<em>Supportive Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">As we have noted, under the express terms of section 31469.4 the safety member classification provided by the statute is available to those employed by a county and is \u201cnot applicable until\u201d it has been adopted by a county. The most commonsense interpretation of this language is that it is limited to current employees and excludes prior service from classification as safety service. Our consideration of closely related provisions of the CERL confirms this strict interpretation of section 31469.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Section 31469.4, even when adopted by a board of supervisors, is not self-executing. Section 31558.6 provides in pertinent part that \u201ceach person <em>who is employed </em>in a position, the principal duties of which consist of juvenile hall group counseling and group supervisor as defined in Section 31469.4 on the date the provisions of Section 31469.4 are made applicable in a county . . . and <em>who files with the board written election </em>to become a safety member on or prior to one year after Section 31469.4 are made applicable in a county by the board of supervisors, <em>shall become a safety member.\"</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>Although by its express terms section 31469.4 prevents retrospective reclassification of a member\u2019s service, arguably section 31639.7 provides an express exception to this rule. Under section 31639.7 affected employees may <em>elect </em>to have their prior service treated as safety service. However, this election must be made at the same time the employees elect to become safety members and must be in the form of an election to pay into a county\u2019s retirement fund the difference between their prior contributions as general members and the contributions that would have been required of them as safety members plus interest. (\u00a7 31639.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">As the County points out, section 31469.5, subdivision (c)(3), also provides an express exception to the prospective provisions of section 31469.4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Like section 31639.7, it requires an employee to make an election to pay into a covered county\u2019s retirement fund the difference between prior general contributions and safety member contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Neither of these exceptions is available to appellants. Appellants did not make an election within the meaning of section 31558.6 and hence could not make an election under the terms of section 31639.7.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 31469.5 is not available because it does not apply to San Diego County. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31469.5, subd. (a), 28020, 28031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Although they are not available to appellants, the Legislature\u2019s provision for these express exceptions is helpful. The provision of an exception to a general rule strongly suggests that other exceptions to the rule are not intended. \u201cThe statutory construction doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>means \u2018 \u201cthe expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other things not expressed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(United Farm Workers of America v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 303, 316 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 696].)  \u201c \u2018[W]here exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute, other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 402, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>410 [267 Cal.Rptr. 589, 787 P.2d 996].) Here, although there are exceptions to prospective application of section 31469.4 for employees who file an election, there is no express provision of the CERL which permits deferred retirees to obtain such a retrospective reclassification at the time they commence collecting a retirement allowance. In particular, as we explain more fully below, there is no such exception in section 31705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">\n<em>Section 31705 Applies to the Calculation of Retirement Allowances and Not to the Reclassification of Deferred Members from General Members to Safety Members</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">A. <em>The text of section 31705 provides that the calculation of a deferred member\u2019s retirement allowance\u2014but not his eligibility for safety member status\u2014is provided by the version of the CERL in effect at the time of the commencement of the member\u2019s retirement allowance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Section 31705 prescribes the version of the CERL to be applied in calculating the retirement allowance of a person on deferred retirement: \u201cThe retirement allowance shall be calculated according to the provisions of this chapter as they exist at the time of the commencement of the retirement allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Section 31664 provides a mathematical formula for calculating a safety member\u2019s retirement allowance. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the current service pension or the current service pension combined with the prior service pension is an additional pension for safety members purchased by the contributions of the county or district sufficient when added to the service retirement annuity to equal the fraction of one-fiftieth of the member\u2019s final compensation set forth opposite his or her age at retirement taken to the preceding completed quarter year in the following table, multiplied by the number of years of current service or years of current and prior service with which the member is entitled to be credited at retirement, but in no event shall the total retirement allowance exceed the limitation of the safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>member\u2019s final compensation as set forth in Section 31676.1 as it now reads or may hereafter be amended to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-5\">\u201cAge at retirement Fraction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-6\">\u201c 41 .6258</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-7\">\u201c 41-1/4 .6350 [1] . . . [f|</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-8\">\u201c 55 and over 1.3099\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Similarly, section 31676.1 provides a mathematical formula for calculating a general member\u2019s retirement allowance. It provides in relevant part: \u201cThis section may be made applicable in any county on the first day of the month after the board of supervisors of such county adopts, by majority vote, a resolution providing that this section shall become applicable in such county. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter the current service pension or the current service pension combined with the prior service pension is an additional pension for members purchased by the contributions of the county or district sufficient, when added to the service retirement annuity, to equal the fraction of one-sixtieth of the member\u2019s final compensation set forth opposite the member\u2019s age at retirement, taken to the preceding completed quarter year, in the following table multiplied by the number of years of current service or years of current and prior service with which the member is entitled to be credited at retirement, but in no event shall the total retirement allowance exceed the member\u2019s final compensation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-10\">\u201cAge of retirement Fraction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-11\">\u201c 50 .7091</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-12\">\u201c 50-1/4 .7183 H] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-13\">\u201c 65 and over 1.4593\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">In determining the scope of section 31705, we begin by noting that the statute provides that a deferred member\u2019s retirement allowance shall be \u201ccalculated\u201d by the version of the CERL that exists when the member begins to receive a retirement allowance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cCalculate\u201d means \u201cto determine by mathematical processes.\u201d (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2006) p. 174.) As noted above, the CERL prescribes various mathematical formulas for calculating a member\u2019s retirement allowance. The member\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>status as either a general or safety member determines which formula is to be used. Section 31705 uses the verb \u201ccalculate,\u201d which is associated with mathematics, in describing its subject matter. Accordingly, the text of section 31705 suggests that its purpose is to provide that the formula contained in either section 31676.1 or section 31664 (or the local option tables described in fns. 7 and 8, <em>ante), </em>that is in effect at the time a member begins to receive his retirement allowance, is to be used in calculating the amount of the member\u2019s retirement allowance, absent some other applicable statutory provision prescribing the use of a different formula. The text of section 31705 does <em>not </em>indicate that a deferred member\u2019s eligibility for safety member benefits is to be determined by changes to the CERL that are made after the member takes deferred retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">B. <em>Related statutory provisions support the conclusion that section 31705 does not mandate that a deferred member\u2019s eligibility for safety member benefits is to be determined by amendments to the CERL that occur after the member takes deferred retirement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">With respect to general members, there is a separate statutory provision that defines the proper method for calculating the member\u2019s retirement allowance when a county has changed the statutory table it uses for calculating such benefits. Section 31678 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any member of a retirement association established in any county pursuant to this chapter, who upon retirement receives a retirement allowance calculated in accordance with Sections 31676.1, 31676.11, 31676.12, 31676.13, 31676.14, and 31676.15, shall have his or her retirement allowance calculated under each such section only for the period of time that the section was effective in the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">\u201cThe Legislature recognizes that counties subject to this chapter may adopt two or more of the enumerated retirement allowance calculation sections when changing from a section providing a lesser allowance to a section providing a larger allowance and thereby creates a windfall for a person who retires immediately after the adoption of a section providing the larger allowance because the retirement allowance is calculated as if the section had been in effect during the entire career of the member. The purpose of this section is to prevent this practice. This section shall apply only to persons who become members of the retirement system after January 1, 1981.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Section 31678 provides the method by which to apply the CERL to a general member who is subject to more than one retirement allowance calculation section of the CERL. The provisions of section 31678 support the conclusion that section 31705 does not require the Association to reclassify appellants as safety members for two reasons. First, the text of section 31678 refers to a member who has his <em>\u201cretirement allowance calculated </em>in accordance with Sections 31676.1, 31676.11, 31676.12, 31676.13, 31676.14, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>31676.15\u201d and refers to these sections as <em>\u201cretirement allowance calculation </em>sections.\u201d (\u00a7 31678, italics added.) Thus, in section 31678, the Legislature used the phrase \u201cretirement allowance calculated\u201d to refer to the process of calculating a member\u2019s retirement allowance <em>within </em>a particular statutory formula, and not to refer to the determination of <em>which </em>statutory formula applies to the member. The Legislature repeatedly uses the phrase \u201cretirement allowance calculated\u201d or a derivation thereof, in related statutory provisions of the CERL to refer to the process of calculating a retirement allowance within a given statutory formula. (See \u00a7 31678.2 [referring to a \u201csection of this chapter prescribing a formula for calculation of retirement benefits\u201d]; \u00a7 31664.65 [referring to a \u201cretirement allowance calculated pursuant to Section 31644\u201d].) This suggests that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cretirement allowance shall be calculated\u201d to have that same meaning in section 31705. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Coker </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 581, 588 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 553] [\u201c \u2018 \u201cTo understand the intended meaning of a statutory phrase, we may consider use of the same or similar language in other statutes, because similar words or phrases in statutes in pari materia [that is, dealing with the same subject matter] ordinarily will be given the same interpretation\u201d].) These related statutory provisions support the conclusion that section 31705 provides that the calculation of a deferred member\u2019s retirement allowance within a given statutory formula\u2014but not the classification of the member as a general member or safety member\u2014is provided by the version of the CERL that is in effect at the commencement of the member\u2019s retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Second, section 31678 eliminates the \u201cwindfall\u201d many general members would otherwise receive by retiring soon after an increase in benefits was passed, a windfall that would otherwise be expressly authorized for members on deferred retirement pursuant to section 31705. Section 31678 does so by providing that when a county adopts a more favorable formula for calculating retirement benefits for its members, use of the new formula is restricted to service that is rendered <em>after </em>the adoption of the formula.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It would be anomalous to construe section 31705 to provide members on deferred retirement with a potentially greater windfall, i.e., the reclassification from general to safety member status, given that the Legislature has drastically limited the impact of the broad rule set forth by section 31705 by enacting section 31678.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>Additional support for our construction of the phrase \u201cretirement allowance shall be calculated\u201d in section 31705 is found by examining the statutes that expressly address the classification of a member as a safety member. These statutes do not refer to such classification as the process of \u201ccalculating a member\u2019s retirement allowance,\u201d but instead use language not found in section 31705. For example, section 31639.7 discusses the manner by which members who are \u201cbrought within [the] field of safety membership\u201d may receive credit for service completed prior to an amendment to the CERL reclassifying the member as a safety member. Similarly, section 31470.8 provides: \u201cIn cases of doubt as to whether a person is eligible to become a safety member, the board shall decide.\u201d Such language is consistent with the conclusion that section 31705 refers only to the calculation of a member\u2019s retirement allowance, and not to the member\u2019s eligibility to receive safety member benefits. (Cf. \u00a7 20968 [distinguishing between the \u201cretirement purposes\u201d of \u201cbenefit <em>eligibility </em>and <em>calculations </em>of retirement allowances\u201d], italics added; see also <em>In re Marriage of Loh </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 325, 337 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 893] [\u201c \u2018[Determining or modifying\u2019 are broad words in this statutory context [that] go beyond mere calculation\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">C. <em>The only published case considering the scope of section 31705 is consistent with our interpretation of the statute and is distinguishable on its facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">In <em>Maffei </em>v. <em>Sacramento County Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 993 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 279] <em>(Maffei), </em>the only published case to consider the scope of section 31705, the court considered whether section 31705 required a county to grant a former employee on deferred retirement status the benefit of a statute, enacted after she had taken a deferred retirement with the county, that established reciprocity between the county\u2019s retirement system (SCERS) and the retirement system of her current employer (STRS). The <em>Maffei </em>court explained that the reciprocity provisions of the CERL allow \u201can employee to defer retirement in the first job and then retire from both jobs simultaneously and have the retirement allowance for both jobs be based on the employee\u2019s highest compensation for either.\u201d <em>(Maffei, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 995.) The <em>Maffei </em>court further noted that if the member were to receive \u201creciprocal retirement benefits, her retirement from SCERS will be about $700 more per month than it would be without reciprocal retirement benefits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 996.) The <em>Maffei </em>court held: \u201cGovernment Code section 31705, a part of CERL, provides: \u2018The retirement allowance shall be calculated according to the provisions of this chapter as they exist at the time of the commencement of the retirement allowance.\u2019 Maffei has not begun receiving a retirement allowance from SCERS because, when she resigned her job with the County, she deferred her retirement. When she retires from both SCERS and STRS simultaneously, she will begin receiving a retirement allowance from SCERS. At that time, the retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>allowance will be calculated according to the provisions of CERL. If, at that point, SCERS and STRS remain reciprocal, as they now are, she will be entitled to the benefit of the reciprocity in determining her retirement allowance.\u201d <em>(Maffei, supra, </em>103 Cal.App. 4th at pp. 997-998.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Although the <em>Maffei </em>court did not explain the precise manner in which the application of the CERL reciprocity provisions would increase the member\u2019s pension in that case, the court noted that the reciprocity provisions affected how a member\u2019s \u201chighest compensation\u201d is measured. <em>(Maffei, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 995-996.) \u201cFinal compensation\u201d is one of the components of the formula for calculating a member\u2019s retirement allowance in the CERL. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31664 [using \u201cfinal compensation\u201d as part of the formula for calculating a safety member\u2019s retirement allowance], 31676.1 [same with respect to general members].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The changes in the CERL that were at issue in <em>Maffei </em>were essentially changes to the variables contained within the formulas used to calculate a member\u2019s retirement allowance. Unlike in <em>Maffei, </em>the change in the CERL<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> at issue in this case does not merely alter the manner by which a retirement allowance of a member is calculated within a given statutory formula. Rather, the effect of the adoption of section 31469.4 by the County is to change the <em>classification </em>of a group of persons, with the result that their retirement allowances will be calculated using a different statutory formula. Thus, the question presented in <em>Maffei </em>is distinguishable from that presented in ornease, and the holding of <em>Maffei </em>is consistent with our construction of section 31705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Finally, we note that in <em>Maffei </em>the court imprecisely used the term \u201cdetermined\u201d as a synonym for \u201ccalculated\u201d in describing the scope of section 31705: \u201cGovernment Code section 31705 makes it clear that, as a general proposition, the version of CERL existing at the time of retirement is used to <em>determine </em>a member\u2019s retirement allowance. Nothing in CERL suggests this general provision concerning <em>determination </em>of the retirement allowance does not apply to Maffei\u2019s situation. Accordingly, we reject SCERS\u2019s argument that Maffei is not entitled to the benefits of reciprocity. Her retirement allowance will be <em>determined </em>by applying CERL as it exists when she retires.\u201d <em>(Maffei, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 998, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Although perhaps immaterial to the resolution of the issues before the <em>Maffei </em>court, we think it significant that the Legislature did <em>not </em>state that a deferred member\u2019s retirement allowance is to be \u201cdetermined\u201d by the provisions of the CERL that are in effect at the time of the commencement of the retirement allowance, but instead used the narrower and more precise verb \u201ccalculated\u201d in section 31705. (See <em>In re Marriage of Loh, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number><em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 337.) As discussed above, the use of the verb \u201ccalculate\u201d indicates that the purpose of section 31705 is to provide that the formula contained in either the section 31676.1 sequence of tables (\u00a7\u00a7 31676.01-31676.18) or the section 31664 sequence of tables (\u00a7\u00a7 31664-31664.2) that is in effect at the time a member begins to receive his retirement allowance is to be used to calculate the member\u2019s retirement. Section 31705 does <em>not </em>provide that classification of a deferred retiree\u2019s prior service \u201cshall be determined\u201d according to the provisions of this chapter as they exist at the time of the commencement of the retirement allowance, and we decline to interpret it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">By its terms section 31469.4 applies only to those employed at the time the County adopted that section. It does not authorize retrospective reclassification of prior service and nothing in section 31705 alters application of section 31469.4 according to its express terms. Although other statutes provide express exceptions to the prospective terms of section 31469.4, those exceptions are not available to appellants. Thus, the trial court properly granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondents are entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b1020-9\">AARON, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">Appellants contend that because Government Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 31705 provides that the retirement allowances of members on deferred retirement are to be calculated <em>under the provisions of the County Employees Retirement Law (CERL) as they exist at the time the retirement allowance commences, </em>and because section 31469.4 was (or, in the case of appellant Birkenbach, will be) applicable in the County at the time appellants\u2019 retirement allowances commenced, section 31705 requires that they be deemed safety members for purposes of the calculation of their retirement allowances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 argument regarding the scope of section 31705 is thus a necessary predicate to their claim for relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">As noted in section V of the majority opinion, section 31705 provides only that the retirement allowance of a member on deferred retirement is to be <em>calculated </em>under the provisions of the CERL as they exist at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>retirement allowance commences. Section 31705 does not purport to affect the <em>classification </em>of members as either general or safety members. The majority\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 argument as to the scope of section 31705 is, in my view, dispositive of appellants\u2019 contentions. The discussion of additional provisions of the CERL in other parts of the opinion is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">Accordingly, I concur in the result and join in section V of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 26, 2006, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 16, 2006, S144840.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-13\"> All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\"> Section 31831 authorizes members who leave County service for employment with another entity with a retirement system established under the CERL to take deferred retirement from the County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\"> We have taken judicial notice of the collective bargaining agreement and correlative provisions of the Association\u2019s by-laws solely for the purpose of recognizing the context in which the County adopted section 31694.4.

Appellants\u2019 complaint claimed the Association violated section 31705 by failing to calculate their retirement allowances in accordance with the CERL as it existed at the time of the commencement of such allowances and cited and quoted section 31705 in their complaint. Appellants were not required to cite in the complaint all statutes within the CERL that are relevant to this claim. To the extent the Association was uncertain as to the basis of the claimed violation, it could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>demurred on this ground. It did not do so. In addition, appellants claimed in their opposition to the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment that they were entitled to make contributions pursuant to section 31639.7. Thus, appellants clearly have not forfeited reliance on section 31639.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">In light of our conclusion, we deny appellants\u2019 motion that we disregard a portion of the Association\u2019s brief arguing that appellants are barred from relying on section 31639.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"> We have taken judicial notice of the legislative history of section 31558.6 prepared by the Legislative Intent Service and submitted by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Although section 31558.6 does not mention probation officers, as we interpret the statute it includes all employees covered by section 31469.4. As the County points out, section 31469.4 was enacted in 1969 (Stats. 1969, ch. 1463, \u00a7 1, p. 2983) and section 31558.6 was enacted shortly thereafter. (Stats. 1970, ch. 396, \u00a7 3, p. 810.) Initially, both sections originally applied only to \u201cjuvenile hall group counselors and group supervisors.\u201d However, section 31469.4 was amended in 1971 to allow counties to include two additional groups within the definition of safety members, to wit: probation officers and juvenile group counselors/supervisors. (Stats. 1971, ch. 107, \u00a7 2, p. 143.) Through obvious oversight, section 31558.6 was not similarly amended to provide the same election procedure for probation officers and juvenile group counselors/supervisors. There is simply no rationale under which probation officers and juvenile group counselors/supervisors would be excused from the election requirements of section 31558.6 imposed on juvenile hall group counselors and group supervisors. Indeed, other provisions of the CERL plainly assume section 31558.6\u2019s election requirement applies to those employees. Section 31469.5 provides safety membership for probation officers in certain counties and directs that \u201c[notwithstanding [s]ection 31558.6,\u201d probation officers in these counties must elect safety membership within 120 days from the implementation of section 31469.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Although a court\u2019s power to effectively rewrite statutes because of drafting errors must be used with great restraint, where as here the error is clear and correction will best carry out the intent of the Legislature, we have the power to do so.
