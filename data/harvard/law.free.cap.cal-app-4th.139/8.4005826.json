Petitioners, the County of Los Angeles (County), the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department (LASD), and Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, challenge an order of respondent court directing them to produce certain documents generated by the chair of the Quality Assurance Committee for the Jail Mental Health Services Division of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. We hold that the documents are exempt from disclosure under sections 1157 and 1157.6. Accordingly, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">In July 2002, Ramon Gavira Camarillo was found hanging in his cell at the Los Angeles County jail, where he was incarcerated after having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>arrested for driving under the influence. Plaintiffs, who are Mr. Gavira\u2019s widow and children, contend that during the 72 hours he was in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff, Mr. Gavira was beaten repeatedly by sheriff\u2019s deputies. Plaintiffs also contend that although Mr. Gavira was \u201cdepressed, anxious, fearful and nervous,\u201d and suffered from auditory hallucinations and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, he was not given medications that a county doctor prescribed and instead was moved to a \u201cdiscipline isolation module\u201d where the medication was not available. Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, against the County, LASD, Sheriff Baca, and several LASD supervisory personnel and deputy sheriffs, sets forth eight causes of action: (1) violation of civil rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) causing wrongful death; (2) failure to train and supervise, causing constitutional violations; (3) policy, custom or practice causing constitutional violations;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (4) conspiracy to intentionally destroy evidence that delays, hinders, and obstructs plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights to justice; (5) violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.; ADA); (6) violation of Civil Code section 51.7 et seq. (freedom from violence and intimidation); (7) general negligence; and (8) medical negligence. Pertinent to this proceeding, plaintiffs allege in their second cause of action that the County, LASD, and its supervisory personnel failed in their duty to, among other things, \u201cprovide mental/medical intervention and attention to injured, ill, or potentially suicidal arrestee[s] or inmates\u201d and to periodically \u201cmonitor an inmate\u2019s serious mental/medical condition and suicidal prevention which may result in serious injury or loss of life\u201d; \u201cmonitor the quality of mental/medical care, attention and treatment provided to ill inmates and arrestees\u201d; and \u201cmonitor the adequacy of mental/medical custodial staffing to ensure adequacy of medical care, treatment, and attention rendered to ill inmates and arrestee[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In May 2004, plaintiffs served on LASD and Sheriff Baca demands for production and inspection of documents, including documents generated by the Mental Health Services Division of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health and Dr. Stephen Shea, a psychiatrist who chairs the division\u2019s Quality Assurance Committee (the Committee). The County interposed various objections. Plaintiffs filed motions to compel production, which the County opposed. The parties resolved some issues through a \u201cmeet and confer\u201d process. On November 17, 2005, at respondent court\u2019s direction, the parties produced joint statements outlining the remaining items in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">On December 9, 2005, respondent court issued its ruling granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel production of the following documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 16 [to LASD]: All writings reflecting any and all monthly reports prepared by Dr. Shea regarding his review of complaints for the period of January 1, 1997 to the date of production. <em>(This request is clarified to be limited to medical/mental health care. </em>Plaintiff[s] agreed to narrow the request to the period of January 2000 to January 2005.)\u201d In granting the request, respondent court stated: \u201cThis goes toward the issue of notice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">\u201cREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 7 [to Sheriff Baca]: All periodic analysis or statistical evaluations and/or analysis by Dr. Shea and/or his quality assurance nurse, regarding mental health care and treatment, for the time period of January 1, 1999 to the date of production.\u201d In granting the request for production, respondent court stated: \u201cThis is narrowly tailored and goes to notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Petitioners had the burden in the trial court of establishing that the discovery requested was protected by the privileges defined in sections 1157 and 1157.6. <em>(Willits v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 90, 104-105 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 348]; <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 711, 727 [220 Cal.Rptr. 236].) A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to compel discovery of privileged matters is evaluated under the abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>(2,022 Ranch v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1387 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 197].) In addition, if the trial court reached its decision after resolving conflicts in the evidence, or inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, we review those factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>There was no such factual dispute here, however. Respondent court had to determine whether the documents at issue, which were indisputably authored by Dr. Shea, were exempt from discovery as a matter of law under the criteria set forth in sections 1157 and 1157.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The County established that the documents at issue here met the criteria of sections 1157 and 1157.6. There is no exception in sections 1157 and 1157.6 for discovery requests merely because the request is \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d or relevant to the \u201cissue of notice.\u201d Thus, respondent court was required to deny the motion to compel. <em>(D. I. Chadbourne, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 723, 729 [36 Cal.Rptr. 468, 388 P.2d 700].)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The Legislature enacted section 1157<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in 1968 in response to <em>Kenney v. Superior Court </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 106 [63 Cal.Rptr. 84], which held that the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action could discover hospital staff records. A number of years later, the same court that decided <em>Kenney </em>opined that what prompted the Legislature to enact section 1157 was its belief that \u201cexternal access to peer investigations conducted by staff committees stifles candor and inhibits objectivity. [Section 1157] evinces a legislative judgment that the quality of in-hospital medical practice will be elevated by armoring staff inquiries with a measure of confidentiality. [][] This confidentiality exacts a social cost because it impairs malpractice plaintiffs\u2019 access to evidence. In a damage suit for in-hospital malpractice against doctor or hospital or both, unavailability of recorded evidence of incompetence might seriously jeopardize or even prevent the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. Section 1157 represents a legislative choice between competing public concerns. It embraces the goal of medical staff candor at the cost of impairing plaintiffs\u2019 access to evidence.\u201d <em>(Matchett v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 623, 629 [115 Cal.Rptr. 317], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In 1982, the Legislature enacted section 1157.6<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which extended the same discovery exemption provided by section 1157 to quality assurance committees \u201chaving the responsibility of evaluation and improvement of the quality of mental health care rendered in county operated and contracted mental health facilities . . . .\u201d The Legislature found that the \u201c \u2018implementation of quality assurance has been impeded in part because of concerns by county mental health professionals over the current status of their immunity while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>serving on official quality assurance committees. [][] It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to provide mental health professionals employed by counties and county-contracted facilities with the same immunities presently possessed by medical societies and hospital medical staffs while serving on quality assurance committees.\u2019 \u201d (Historical and Statutory Notes, 6 West's Ann. Civ. Code (2006 supp.) foll. \u00a7 43.7, p. 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\n<em>The County\u2019s Jail Mental Health Services Division, Which Includes the Inmate Treatment Facility at the Los Angeles County Jail, Is a Health Care Facility Covered by Sections 1157 and 1157.6</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Section 1157 exempts from disclosure documents generated by a \u201cpeer review body, as defined in Section 805 of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d That section defines \u201cpeer review body\u201d in several ways, two of which are relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Business and Professions Code section 805, subdivision (a)(1)(A) defines \u201cpeer review body\u201d as a \u201cmedical or professional staff of any health care facility or clinic licensed under Division 2 (commencing with Section 1200) of the Health and Safety Code . . . .\u201d Health and Safety Code section 1250, subdivision (j)(l) in turn provides that a \u201ccorrectional treatment center,\u201d is \u201ca health facility operated by ... a county, city, or city and county law enforcement agency that, as determined by the state department, provides inpatient health services to that portion of the inmate population who do not require a general acute care level of basic services. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Business and Professions Code section 805 also includes within the definition of \u201cpeer review body\u201d a \u201ccommittee organized by any entity consisting of or employing more than 25 licentiates of the same class that functions for the purpose of reviewing the quality of professional care provided by members or employees of that entity.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 805, subd. (a)(1)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The County submitted evidence below that establishes the documents in issue here fall within sections 1157 and 1157.6. In a declaration supporting the County\u2019s opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motions to compel, Dr. Shea stated as follows: The Jail Mental Health Services Division is \u201cresponsible for overseeing and/or providing mental health services to the inmates at the Los Angeles County Jail.\u201d The division \u201cemploys 25 licensed physicians (psychiatrists) and over 25 licensed clinical psychologists who provide professional care to inmates at the Los Angeles County Jail.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He personally reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>documents contained in the County\u2019s privilege logs* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that apply to the Committee for the Jail Mental Health Services Division, and authored many of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">As part of a continuous quality improvement program for mental health services, the County \u201corganized a committee that functions for the purpose of reviewing the quality of professional care provided by employees of the County.\u201d Dr. Shea\u2019s duties include managing the Committee and the documents produced by the Committee. Each of the documents identified on the County\u2019s privilege log that pertain to the Committee \u201ccontain information about the evaluation and improvement of the quality of mental health care rendered in the Los Angeles County Jail, which included County operated mental health facilities.\u201d The documents also \u201ccontain information on how the County intends to improve the quality of mental health care provided to [both male and female] inmates assigned to [various inpatient and outpatient programs] and the Inmate Reception Center,\u201d and \u201cinformation about audits of individual patient\u2019s charts including personal identifying information for those patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Another declaration was filed by Helen Hud, R.N., who coordinated and maintained the records of the Committee. Nurse Hud declared, \u201cThe Committee routinely holds confidential meetings to evaluate and improve the quality of medical care provided to inmates at the Los Angeles County Jail. Committee members discuss processes and procedures for problem identification and also make corrective action determinations regarding specific problems that apply generally to all medical staff at the Medical Services Bureau. Certain members of the Committee then meet in confidence to discuss physician performance in the form of peer review, [f] Once a specific problem has been identified and a course of corrective action is determined, the Committee monitors to make sure the improvement is accomplished and the problem is resolved. The Committee, in addition to identifying specific problems and methods for preventing problems, also tracks and discusses medical standards, methods and improvements at other medical facilities in the community in order to implement them at the Los Angeles County Jail as part of a continuous quality improvement process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The declarations of Dr. Shea and Nurse Hud established that the Committee meets all the criteria for a \u201cpeer review body\u201d within the meaning of section 1157. Accordingly, the Committee\u2019s records, including the reports prepared for the Committee by Dr. Shea, are exempt from disclosure. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Committee is comprised of the medical or professional staff of a health care facility. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 805, subd. (a)(1)(A).) \u201cHealth care facility\u201d includes a \u201ccorrectional treatment center,\u201d which in turn includes a \u201chealth facility operated by ... a county . . . law enforcement agency that provides inpatient health care services to . . . the inmate population.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1250, subd. (j)(l).) Furthermore, the division employs \u201cmore than 25 licentiates of the same class,\u201d whose purpose as a Committee is \u201creviewing the quality of professional care provided by members or employees\u201d of the Jail Mental Health Services Division. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 805, subd. (a)(1)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\n<em>The Peer Review Committee Exemption Applies to Reports Prepared by Dr. Shea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Respondent court ordered disclosure of Dr. Shea\u2019s monthly reports concerning complaints received each month, as well as statistical reports and evaluations summarizing that data. Plaintiffs contend these reports are not protected by the peer review exemption because they were prepared by an individual, and \u201can individual is not a committee.\u201d Plaintiffs do not cite any California authority to support their assertion that a \u201cpeer review committee\u201d report must be authored by the entire committee. The Illinois case on which plaintiffs rely, <em>Roach v. Springfield Clinic </em>(1993) 157 Ill.2d 29 [623 N.E.2d 246, 191 Ill.Dec. 1], is factually distinguishable because it involved evidence of a conversation between a doctor and a nurse which the court found had \u201cnothing to do with any physician peer-review committee.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 40.) Here, the evidence shows the documents were prepared by Dr. Shea in connection with his responsibilities for the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\n<em>Penal Code Section 6030 Is Inapplicable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Plaintiffs contend section 1157 applies only to hospital medical negligence cases and not to correctional medical facilities at all, because those facilities are regulated by Penal Code section 6030, and the quality of care at such facilities is subject to investigation by the United States Department of Justice pursuant to a memorandum of agreement. Plaintiffs contend that nothing in Penal Code section 6030 or its companion regulations \u201cpropose that jail medical quality assurance or peer review records are to be protected from discovery or that they should fall within the purview of [section] 1157.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">As we noted <em>ante, </em>section 1157 applies to \u201ccorrectional treatment facilities,\u201d which includes the Jail Mental Health Services Division. Penal Code section 6030 is a general statute that directs the Correctional Standards Authority to establish minimum standards for state and local correctional facilities. These standards include, but are not limited to, \u201chealth and sanitary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>conditions, fire and life safety, security, rehabilitation programs, recreation, treatment of persons confined in state and local correctional facilities, and personnel training.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6030, subd. (b).) The fact that the quality of medical care in the Los Angeles County jail has drawn the scrutiny of federal authorities is irrelevant to the issue here, which is whether this court should apply state evidentiary rules in this state civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Federal Claims Do Not Render Sections 1157 and 1157.6 Inapplicable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Plaintiffs have asserted claims under the federal civil rights statute. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.) They contend Dr. Shea\u2019s reports are discoverable because state law \u201crestrictions on discovery\u201d do not apply where the plaintiff has asserted a federal civil rights claim. Plaintiffs cite numerous federal civil rights cases in which the federal courts have declined to apply state evidentiary rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Plaintiffs did not file their case in federal court, however. Although federal law controls the substantive aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 federal civil rights claim, state rules of evidence and procedure apply unless application of those rules would affect plaintiffs\u2019 substantive federal rights. <em>(Felder v. Casey </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 131, 138 [101 L.Ed.2d 123, 108 S.Ct. 2302]; see also <em>Wilson v. Garcia </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 261, 280 [85 L.Ed.2d 254, 105 S.Ct. 1938] [state statute of limitations for personal injury actions applies to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims]; <em>City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 1, 12-13 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 52 P.3d 129] [\u00a7 1045, subd. (b)(1), temporal limitation on disclosure of citizen complaints against police officers does not violate supremacy clause even though application of the limitation might deprive plaintiff of relevant evidence]; <em>Denari v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1488, 1495 [264 Cal.Rptr. 261] [right of privacy contained in Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1, as well as Pen. Code section prohibiting release of criminal records, applied to bar discovery of names, addresses and telephone numbers of plaintiffs\u2019 fellow arrestees]; <em>Shotwell v. Donahoe </em>(2004) 207 Ariz. 287, 290 [85 P.3d 1045] [application of state evidentiary rule in employment discrimination case did not affect plaintiff\u2019s substantive federal rights].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In <em>Felder, </em>the plaintiff filed a state court action against the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, its police chief and several police officers for civil rights violations that occurred in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. The defendants moved to dismiss the action because the plaintiff had not complied with Wisconsin\u2019s notice-of-claim statute, a prerequisite to filing suit against a governmental entity or officer in state court. The Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201cStates may establish the rules of procedure governing litigation in their own courts. By the same token, however, where state courts entertain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>federally created right of action, the \u2018federal right cannot be defeated by the forms of local practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Felder </em>v. <em>Casey, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 138, citing <em>Brown v. Western R. Co. of Alabama </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 294, 296 [94 L.Ed. 100, 70 S.Ct. 105].) The Supreme Court held that Wisconsin\u2019s notice-of-claim statute was not merely a rule of procedure because the purpose of the state statute\u2014to minimize governmental liability\u2014was \u201cmanifestly inconsistent with the purposes of the federal statute.\u201d <em>(Felder v. Casey, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 141.) \u201cWe think it plain that Congress never intended that those injured by governmental wrongdoers could be required, as a condition of recovery, to submit their claims to the government responsible for their injuries.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In <em>Felder, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery under title 42 United States Code section 1983 was conditioned upon whether the he complied with Wisconsin\u2019s notice-of-claim statute. Because failure to comply with the statute would have barred the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights claim altogether, the Supreme Court held that application of the state statute was inconsistent with the aims of Congress when it enacted the federal Civil Rights Act. That is not the situation here. As respondent court noted in its order below, defendants have produced thousands of pages of documents in this case. Plaintiffs have failed to make any showing that denying them discovery of the few documents at issue would, in their words, \u201cimmunize the County Sheriff\u2019s Department and the Sheriff\u2019s conduct from liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\n<em>\u201cPatient Information\u201d Is Not Discoverable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Plaintiffs contend that even if section 1157 applies to exempt the documents at issue, information concerning a patient which is disclosed to a quality assurance committee is subject to discovery under section 1156.1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as long as the identity of the patient is not disclosed. However, that section does not, as plaintiffs suggest, apply to any patient information that is before the Committee, but merely provides that patient information (minus the patients\u2019 names) that is part of a quality assurance committee\u2019s \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cmedical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>or psychiatric\u201d studies may be subject to discovery in a civil action but \u201cshall not be admitted as evidence in any action or before any administrative body, agency, or person.\u201d Nothing in the record here suggests that the documents at issue here resulted from a formal study or research conducted by the Committee. Rather, they are simply a summary of statistical data assembled on a monthly basis by Dr. Shea.* *****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The petition for writ of mandate is granted. A peremptory writ shall issue directing respondent court to vacate its order of December 9, 2005, granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel production of documents with respect to reports and analysis of Dr. Shea, and enter a new and different order denying the motion.

But there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>evidence of this in the record, and plaintiffs do not have any support for their claim that the \u201c25 licentiates\u201d be located at one specific facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> The privilege logs were prepared in response to plaintiffs\u2019 motions to compel and include the documents at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> Section 1156.1 provides: \u201c(a) A committee established in compliance with Sections 4070 and 5624 of the Welfare and Institutions Code may engage in research and medical or psychiatric study for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality, and may make findings and recommendations to the county and state relating to such purpose.
