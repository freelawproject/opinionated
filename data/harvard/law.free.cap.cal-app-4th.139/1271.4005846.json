We conclude that the statute does not offend constitutional principles, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to one count of felony driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)), and admitted that he suffered two prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol within the past 10 years (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23550.5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a state prison term of 16 months, to run concurrently with a six-year sentence imposed in a separate Contra Costa County Superior Court action. Over objection by the defense, the trial court also ordered defendant to \u201csubmit to DNA testing\u201d and provide print impressions pursuant to Penal Code section 296, subdivision (a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Defendant challenges the constitutionality of section 296, subdivision (a)(1), which specifies that a DNA sample and print impressions must be provided for collection and storage in a state database by \u201cany person, including any juvenile, who is convicted of or pleads guilty or no contest to any felony offense, or is found not guilty by reason of insanity of any felony offense, or any juvenile who is adjudicated under Section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code for committing <em>any felony offense.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.) Section 296 in its present form was enacted as part of the 2004 DNA Fingerprint, Unsolved Crime and Innocence Protection Act (Prop. 69). (\u00a7 295, subd. (a).) Section 296 and the remainder of the DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Data Bank Act (Pen. Code, pt. 1, tit. 9, ch. 6) govern the collection of DNA samples and specimens from persons convicted of all felonies, rather than only enumerated crimes as provided under the former statute. <em>(Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 809, 814 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 59].) The California Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for implementing the act (\u00a7 295, subd. (h)), the DNA Laboratory, Department of Corrections, Board of Corrections, and Department of the Youth Authority have the authority to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>policies and enact regulations for the implementation of the act (\u00a7 295, subds. (h)(1), (i)(1)), and the county sheriffs or chief administrative officers at jails or other county facilities have responsibility for collection of samples in accordance with approved procedures. (\u00a7 295, subd. (i)(1), (2); <em>People v. Dial </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 657, 661 [30 Cal.Rptr. 3d 252].) The DOJ then serves as a repository for the collected samples, performs a DNA analysis, and maintains the DNA profiles for comparison to samples taken at other crime scenes, in order to establish the identity and origin of those crime scene samples. (\u00a7\u00a7 295.1, subds. (a), (c), 297, subd. (a); <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 814.) The provisions of the act are mandatory and automatic upon conviction of a felony. <em>(People v. Brewer </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1298, 1302 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 293]; <em>People v. Hong </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1071, 1083 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 23].) The persons specified in the act\u2014that is, anyone convicted of any felony offense\u2014\u201c \u2018shall\u2019 \u201d provide samples, \u201cand the requirements of the chapter (Pen. Code, pt. 1, tit. 9, ch. 6; \u00a7\u00a7 295-300.3) \u2018shall apply to all qualifying persons regardless of sentence imposed ... or any other disposition rendered in the case of an adult. . . , or whether the person is diverted, fined, or referred for evaluation ....\u2019(\u00a7 296, subd. (d).)\u201d <em>(People v. Dial, supra, </em>at p. 662.)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The trial court acted under the authority of the current version of section 296, subdivision (a)(1), by ordering defendant to submit a DNA sample as a result of his felony conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol. In this appeal, defendant presents several constitutional objections to the forced extraction and collection of DNA samples from <em>all felony </em>offenders: that the intrusion upon his privacy rights violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures; that his equal protection rights were violated; that the statute is overbroad and offends due process principles; and that as applied to him the statute constitutes an ex post facto law. He requests that we modify his sentence to \u201cexclude the mandatory sampling required by section 296,\u201d and \u201cif [the] samples have already been taken,\u201d to order the samples \u201cremoved from any data bank and destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">I. <em>The Claim of Mootness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Before we proceed to the substance of the constitutional claims presented by defendant, we deal with respondent\u2019s contention, made almost in passing, that defendant\u2019s appeal is \u201cmoot because he is independently required to provide a DNA sample based on his prior felony convictions\u201d pursuant to section 296.1, subdivision (a)(2)(A)(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s position seems to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>that the availability of a basis for requiring a DNA sample from defendant other than merely his present driving under the influence conviction renders his challenge to the trial court\u2019s order moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">We do not find the present appeal moot. \u201c \u2018As a general rule, \u201can appeal presenting only abstract or academic questions is subject to dismissal as moot.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Joshua C. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1547 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 10].) \u201c \u2018When no effective relief can be granted, an appeal is moot and will be dismissed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(MHC Operating Limited Partnership </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 204, 214 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 564]; see also <em>Lester v. Lennane </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 536, 566 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 86].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt necessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide the case in favor of plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Chantiles </em>v. <em>Lake Forest II Master Homeowners Assn. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 914, 921 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLong </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 482, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 293]; <em>In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1193 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878].) Although defendant may qualify for DNA testing under section 296.1 based upon his prior felony convictions for driving under the influence, in addition to the conviction obtained in the present case, we are not prevented from rendering effective relief if the statute is found unconstitutional. Defendant has challenged the constitutionality of section 296 in its entirety, and specifically the provisions that mandate collection of DNA samples for all felony convictions and for prior convictions for driving under the influence. If we rule in favor of defendant on the constitutional claims he has raised, he will obtain the relief he seeks. Defendant has also presented us with constitutional issues of public interest that may recur between these parties or others, which we have discretion to address even if we were to consider the appeal moot. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number><em>White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 537 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 648, 68 P.3d 74]; <em>Cucamongans United for Reasonable Expansion v. City of Rancho Cucamonga </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 473, 479-480 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 202]; <em>In re Robert </em>A. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 174, 182 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].) Thus, we decline to find that defendant has raised only moot points. (See <em>Edelstein v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 164, 171-172 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 727, 56 P.3d 1029]; <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 23 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Matute </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1444-1445 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 472]; <em>People v. DeLong, supra, </em>at p. 492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">II. <em>The Validity of Section 296 Under the Fourth Amendment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s claim that section 296 \u201cas amended in 2004 violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d His argument is that the statute mandates the collection of DNA samples, without the necessity of a warrant or probable cause, for an excessively broad range of qualifying convictions that includes \u201call felonies,\u201d and particularly his current and prior convictions for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">We commence our analysis with recognition of the established principle that the compulsory, nonconsensual extraction of DNA samples constitutes a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. (See <em>Skinner [v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn, supra,] </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 602, 616 [103 L.Ed.2d 639, 109 S.Ct. 1402]; <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 757, 767 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 86 S.Ct. 1826]; <em>Loder </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 846, 867 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 927 P.2d 1200]; <em>People v. Adams </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 243, 255-256 [9 Cal.Rptr. 3d 170].) Govemmentally compelled testing also implicates the state right of privacy. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13; <em>Loder v. City of Glendale, supra, </em>at p. 896; <em>Wainwright v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 262, 267-268 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 749].) \u201c ' \u201c[S]earches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable\u201d \u2019 under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement unless they fall within one of a few narrow exceptions thereto. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 673 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640].)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">However, \u201cto find the Fourth Amendment applicable to the procedures at issue here \u2018is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such intrusions. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. King </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1371 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 220], quoting from <em>Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., supra, </em>489 U.S. 602, 619.) \u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all searches, but only those that are unreasonable.\u201d <em>(People v. Hall </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1009, 1022 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 806]; see also <em>Maryland v. Buie </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 325, 331 [108 L.Ed.2d 276, 110 S.Ct. 1093]; <em>Baughman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number><em>State of California </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 182, 190 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 82].) \u201cAlthough reasonableness in most criminal cases depends on the government\u2019s obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause, the Supreme Court has emphasized \u2018the longstanding principle that neither a warrant nor probable cause, nor, indeed, any measure of individualized suspicion, is an indispensable component of reasonableness in every circumstance.\u2019 <em>Nat'l Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>489 U.S. 656, 665 [103 L.Ed.2d 685, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 1390] (1989); <em>accord Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 624, 109 S.Ct. at 1417 (\u2018[A] showing of individualized suspicion is not a constitutional floor, below which a search must be presumed unreasonable.\u2019).\u201d <em>(Padgett </em>v. <em>Donald </em>(11th Cir. 2005) 401 F.3d 1273, 1277; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 743, 751 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 734, 968 P.2d 445].)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">\u201c \u2018The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness. [Citation.] The Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all state-initiated searches and seizures; it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 971 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044].) \u201cIf the search is reasonable, there is no constitutional problem, for the Fourth Amendment only protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Skinner </em>[v. <em>Railway Labor Executives' Assn., supra,] </em>489 U.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402. Determining whether a search is reasonable \u2018 \u201cdepends on all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself,\u201d \u2019 <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 619 .. . .\u201d <em>(United States v. Sczubelek </em>(3d Cir. 2005) 402 F.3d 175, 182.) \u201cUnder the Fourth Amendment and the parallel search and seizure clause of the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 13), the reasonableness of particular searches and seizures is determined by a general balancing test \u2018weighing the gravity of the governmental interest or public concern served and the degree to which the [challenged government conduct] advances that concern against the intrusiveness of the interference with individual liberty.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 29-30 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633], fn. omitted; see also <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 648, 654 [59 L.Ed.2d 660, 99 S.Ct. 1391]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 857, 863 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">We examine several factors to determine whether an intrusion amounts to an unreasonable search or invasion of privacy rights: \u201c(1) the individual\u2019s interest, (2) the government\u2019s interest, (3) the necessity for the intrusion, and (4) the procedure used in conducting the search. To assess the first factor, the court looks to a hierarchy of privacy interests. Reasonable expectations of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as legitimate receive the greatest level of protection; diminished expectations of privacy are more easily invaded; and subjective expectations of privacy that society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate have no protection.\u201d <em>(People v. Reyes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number><em>supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 743, 751; see also <em>Wainwright v. Superior Court, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th 262, 267-268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">In <em>People v. King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1369 <em>(King), </em>this court was presented with a Fourth Amendment challenge to former section 290.2, the predecessor of section 296, \u201cwhich required persons convicted of specified sex offenses, including rape, or of murder or felony assault and battery, and who were \u2018discharged or paroled from\u2019 a \u2018state prison, county jail, or any institution,\u2019 to \u2018provide two specimens of blood and a saliva sample\u2019 \u201d to be sent to the DOJ for \u201ca DNA analysis on the specimens, and provided that \u2018DNA analysis and other genetic typing analysis\u2019 could be used only for law enforcement purposes.\u201d The defendant in <em>King </em>contended that his convictions for murder with special circumstances, first degree burglary, sodomy and attempted rape were based upon inadmissible evidence of DNA recovered from the crime scene that matched samples previously collected from him pursuant to section 290.2. We proceeded to examine the reasonableness of the procedure \u201c \u2018 \u201cby balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>at p. 1371.) We noted that in accord with the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives' Assn., supra, </em>489 U.S. 602, 624, even without an \u201cindividualized suspicion\u201d to justify the intrusion, \u201c \u2018In limited circumstances, where the privacy interests implicated by a search are minimal, and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>at pp. 1373-1374.) In our assessment of the balancing test, we considered \u201c \u2018the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\u2019 <em>(Bell v. Wolfish </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 520, 559 [99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">We observed in <em>King </em>that in contrast to the investigation of a \u201ctypical criminal case,\u201d in which \u201cinvestigators exercise great discretion\u201d and \u201cinconvenience involved persons\u201d with searches that may \u201cgenerate fear and surprise,\u201d when the \u201c \u2018search\u2019 is the securing of blood and saliva samples for DNA analysis and profiling\u201d outside the investigation of a \u201cparticular crime,\u201d the \u201cdecision to obtain a sample from a particular person is not subject to official discretion. There is no focus on a particular person. As those who are required to provide samples doubtless know, every person of the specified class is required to provide a sample. The person supplying the samples therefore has no reason to fear that the intrusion suggests a belief by the authorities that he or she has committed any criminal offense, or that he or she may be subjected to any further investigation. The fact that the person is already incarcerated also tends to reduce the inconvenience of having to go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>a particular place to provide samples.\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1372, 1373.) We found \u201c[t]here is little reason to require a warrant in such circumstances.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1373.) We explained that a warrant \u201cprovides little or no additional protection to personal privacy when, as in the present case, the circumstances justifying the testing and the permissible limits of the intrusion are defined narrowly and specifically, these circumstances doubtless are well-known to those in the class of persons to be tested, and the decision to test is not discretionary and thus is not based on a judgment that certain conditions are present. In such circumstances \u2018there are simply \u201cno special facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate,\u201d \u2019 and it is reasonable to dispense with the warrant requirement. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Turning to an examination of the nature and scope of the intrusion, we stated: \u201cAlthough prisons are not beyond the reach of the Constitution, \u2018it is also clear that imprisonment carries with it the circumspection or loss of many significant rights.\u2019 <em>(Hudson v. Palmer </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 517, 523-524 [104 S.Ct. 3194, 3199, 82 L.Ed.2d 393].) The nature of confinement necessarily results in a significant reduction in the expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1374.) \u201cThe reduction in a convicted person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy specifically extends to that person\u2019s identity. Indeed, not only persons convicted of crimes, but also those merely suspected of crimes, routinely are required to undergo fingerprinting for identification purposes. As to convicted persons, there is no question but that the state\u2019s interest extends to maintaining a permanent record of identity to be used as an aid in solving past and future crimes, and this interest overcomes any privacy rights the individual might retain. \u2018This becomes readily apparent when we consider the universal approbation of \u201cbooking\u201d procedures that are followed for every suspect arrested for a felony, whether or not the proof of a particular suspect\u2019s crime will involve the use of fingerprint identification. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We concluded: \u201c \u2018The Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective expectations of privacy, but only those that society recognizes as \u201clegitimate.\u201d [Citation.] What expectations are legitimate varies, of course, with context [citation], depending, for example upon whether the individual asserting the privacy interest is at home, at work, in a car, or in a public park.\u2019 [Citation.] By their commissions of a crime and subsequent convictions, persons such as appellant have forfeited any legitimate expectation of privacy in their identities. In short, any argument that Fourth Amendment privacy interests do not prohibit gathering information concerning identity from the person of one who has been convicted of a serious crime, or of retaining that information for crime enforcement purposes, is an argument that long ago was resolved in favor of the government.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1375, fn. omitted.) Citing <em>Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., supra, </em>489 U.S. 602, 625, we added that blood tests have not been found to \u201c \u2018 \u201cconstitute an unduly extensive imposition on an individual\u2019s privacy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>bodily integrity.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] Moreover, again, persons such as appellant already are subject to blood tests for purposes of testing for AIDS. Again, the intrusion caused by the testing here is less than overwhelming.\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>at p. 1378.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Lastly, we considered the undeniable governmental interest \u201cin crime prevention. It has interests in solving crimes that have been committed, in bringing the perpetrators to justice and in preventing, or at least discouraging, them from committing additional crimes. The government also has an interest in ensuring that innocent persons are not needlessly investigated\u2014to say nothing of convicted\u2014of crimes they did not commit. DNA testing unquestionably furthers these interests. The ability to match DNA profiles derived from crime scene evidence to DNA profiles in an existing data bank can enable law enforcement personnel to solve crimes expeditiously and prevent needless interference with the privacy interests of innocent persons. It has been suggested that DNA profiling may act as a deterrent to future criminal activity. <em>(Roe </em>v. <em>Marcotte </em>(2d Cir. 1999) 193 F.3d 72, 79.) It also is an unfortunate truth that many offenders commit more than one crime, and recidivism is common.\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375-1376, fn. omitted.) On \u201c[t]he final question\u201d of \u201cthe efficacy of DNA testing as a means for meeting the governmental interests at stake,\u201d we declared; \u201cThere is no question but that by providing an effective means of identification, DNA testing is an efficient means of promoting the governmental interests at stake.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1378.) We thus concluded that the statutory DNA extraction and collection procedures \u201cdo not violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">When presented with subsequent versions of California statutes providing for the forced extraction of blood or saliva for inclusion in the DNA database, two cases followed <em>King </em>and similarly found no violation of the Fourth Amendment or privacy rights: first, <em>Alfaro </em>v. <em>Terhune </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 492 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 197] <em>(Alfaro); </em>then, <em>People v. Adams, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.4th 243 <em>(Adams). </em>In <em>Alfaro, </em>the plaintiffs were prisoners under sentence of death who challenged the implementation and application to them of the DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Data Bank Act of 1998 (\u00a7 295 et seq.) (Act), which provided that \u201cany person who is convicted of a specified crime must \u2018provide two specimens of blood, a saliva sample, right thumbprints, and a full palm print impression of each hand for law enforcement identification analysis.\u2019 (\u00a7 296, subd. (a)(1).)\u201d <em>(Alfaro, supra, </em>at p. 496.) The prisoners asserted that the Act violated the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and their privacy rights, \u201cbecause \u2018one of the key purposes justifying the [Act]\u2014the deterrence of future crimes\u2014is inapplicable\u2019 to those prisoners.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The court began its inquiry in <em>Alfaro </em>with the observation that \u201cDNA data base and data bank acts have been enacted in all 50 states as well as by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>federal government. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 14131-14134; and see Annot., Validity, Construction, and Operation of State DNA Database Statutes (2000) 76 A.L.R.5th 239, 252.) Various constitutional challenges to these acts have been rejected consistently. (See, e.g., <em>Roe v. Marcotte[, supra,] </em>193 F.3d 72 [Connecticut]; <em>Schlicher </em>v. <em>(NFN) Peters, I &amp; I </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 103 F.3d 940 [Kansas]; <em>Boling </em>v. <em>Romer </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 101 F.3d 1336 [Colorado]; <em>Rise v.

The court also recognized that a \u201cchallenge to former section 290.2, the predecessor of the Act, was rejected in this state by <em>People v. King[, supra,] </em>82 Cal.App.4th 1363.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIn view of the thoroughness with which constitutional challenges to DNA data base and data bank acts have been discussed,\u201d the court ventured to add only: \u201cWe agree with existing authorities that (1) nonconsensual extraction of biological samples for identification purposes does implicate constitutional interests; (2) those convicted of serious crimes have a diminished expectation of privacy and the intrusions authorized by the Act are minimal; and (3) the Act serves compelling governmental interests. Not the least of the governmental interests served by the Act is \u2018the overwhelming public interest in prosecuting crimes accurately.\u2019 [Citation.] A minimally intrusive methodology that can serve to avoid erroneous convictions and to bring to light and rectify erroneous convictions that have occurred manifestly serves a compelling public interest. We agree with the decisional authorities that have gone before and conclude that the balance must be struck in favor of the validity of the Act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 505-506, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that DNA testing has \u201cthe potential to reveal sensitive personal and biological information,\u201d the court stated that \u201cthe Act specifically limits to identification purposes the DNA and other forensic identification analyses authorized by the Act. (\u00a7 295.1.) Defendants are authorized to analyze specimens and samples \u2018in order to establish identity and origin of samples for identification purposes.\u2019 (\u00a7 297, subd. (a).) The Act exempts all DNA and forensic identification profiles and other identification information from any law requiring disclosure of information to the public, and it makes such information confidential. (\u00a7 299.5, subds. (a), (b).) As was the case in <em>Rise v. State of Oregon, supra, </em>59 F.3d at page 1561, the Act appropriately limits the state\u2019s use of the specimens, samples, and print impressions that it requires.\u201d <em>(Alfaro, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 492, 507-508, fn. omitted.) And to specifically address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that as prisoners under sentence of death the Act as applied to them did not deter or prevent future criminality, the court reasoned that DNA acts have been \u201cspecifically . . . upheld ... for the law enforcement purpose of solving crimes\u201d (98 Cal.App.4th at p. 506) and even inmates under a sentence of death are capable of committing crime. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 506-507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>The court in <em>Alfaro </em>also confronted the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that existing state and federal authority was not dispositive in resolving their challenge based upon the right to privacy, which in California is an express constitutional right broader and more protective in many respects \u201cthan the right to privacy implied in the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>(Alfaro, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 492, 508.) The court concluded: \u201cAlthough California courts applying state constitutional principles are not required to reach the same conclusion as courts of other jurisdictions, in this instance we agree with the trial court that the balancing process does not support a result contrary to the results reached in every other jurisdiction to have considered the matter. In this respect, we note that the balancing test was applied in <em>People </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pages 1377 and 1378, a California Court of Appeal decision upholding former section 290.2.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\"><em>King </em>was again approved and found dispositive in <em>Adams, </em>where the defendant argued that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of \u201cDNA-typing evidence raising the issue that the forced extraction of blood violates a person\u2019s \u2018most personal and deep-rooted expectations of privacy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Adams, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.4th 243, 255.) In support of his claim that the \u201cextraction of a prisoner\u2019s blood\u201d requires \u201creasonable suspicion or a warrant,\u201d the defendant in <em>Adams </em>asserted \u201cthere is no <em>\u2018special </em>need\u2019 for the program beyond general law enforcement purposes,\u201d citing the United States Supreme Court cases of <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 67 [149 L.Ed.2d 205, 121 S.Ct. 1281] <em>(Ferguson), </em>and <em>Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Edmond </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 32 [148 L.Ed.2d 333, 121 S.Ct. 447] <em>(Edmond),</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>asserted that more efficient law enforcement \u201c ' \u201ccan never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Adams, supra, </em>at pp. 256-257, italics added.) The court commented that the DNA collection statutes have been consistently upheld in both the federal and various state courts on either one of two theories: the \u201cbalancing test\u201d articulated in <em>King </em>and other cases <em>(id. </em>at p. 255), or the \u201c \u2018special needs\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>(Adams, supra, </em>at p. 256; see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Quander </em>(D.C.

Quoting from <em>King, </em>the court then concluded: \u201cThe individuals who are required to give samples have been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter, sexual offenses, assaults, and kidnapping (\u00a7 296, subd. (a)(1)), either by a trier of fact or by their own admission. One result of their crimes is that society has a vastly increased interest in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>identities. \u2018The Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective expectations of privacy, but only those that society recognizes as \u201clegitimate.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018By their commissions of a crime and subsequent convictions, persons such as appellant have forfeited any legitimate expectation of privacy in their identities. In short, any argument that Fourth Amendment privacy interests do not prohibit gathering information concerning identity from the person of one who has been convicted of a serious crime, or of retaining that information for crime enforcement purposes, is an argument that long ago was resolved in favor of the government.\u2019 <em>(King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 1375, fn. omitted.) The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the DNA profile evidence.\u201d <em>(Adams, supra, </em>at p. 259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Defendant maintains that the amendment of section 296, subdivision (a)(1), to include mandatory collection of DNA samples for convictions of <em>any felony offenses, </em>rather than specified violent or serious felonies, alters the Fourth Amendment balancing equation in \u201cfavor of protecting [his] Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d He claims that collection of DNA evidence for offenses that \u201cinvolved neither violence, nor bodily contact with others,\u201d such as his driving under the influence conviction, is unlikely to result in a match with \u201csimilar crimes in the past or future,\u201d and thus \u201cwill not further the government\u2019s interest in crime detection and prevention.\u201d Defendant points out that in <em>King </em>we expressed the caveat: \u201cWe, however, are not concerned with whether the state legitimately can require all such persons to provide samples, or whether persons who are not incarcerated may be required to provide samples or replace samples taken while they were in a penal institution. We determine only whether one such as appellant, imprisoned for having committed a crime involving a sexual assault, might be required to provide samples of blood and saliva for DNA analysis in accordance with the procedures outlined in ... Penal Code former section 290.2.\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">While Proposition 69 did indeed expand the scope of section 296, subdivision (a)(1), to require collection of DNA samples for any felony conviction <em>(Coffey v. Superior Court, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th 809, 814), we are not persuaded that the governmental interest furthered by the statute is thereby diminished to an extent that it offends Fourth Amendment principles under the balancing test. The legitimate governmental interest in maintaining a permanent, reliable record of identification of all convicted felons remains unassailable under the current version of section 296, subdivision (a)(1), and \u201coutweighs the minor intrusion involved\u201d in taking prisoners\u2019 saliva or blood samples \u201cand storing their DNA profiles, given prisoners\u2019 reduced expectation of privacy in their identities . . . .\u201d <em>(Padgett v. Donald, supra, </em>401 F.3d 1273, 1280; see also <em>Green </em>v. <em>Berge, supra, </em>354 F.3d 675, 678; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, 962 </em>F.2d 302, 308.) Although DNA testing may serve a more vital interest when administered to felons convicted of violent offenses, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>utility of precise identification of all felons continues to justify the search, particularly where, as here, the intrusion is minor in nature and the expectation of privacy is minimal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Jones v. Murray, supra, </em>at p. 308.) As with the more limited DNA collection statutes, the courts have uniformly found laws that include all felonies as qualifying offenses to comply with the Fourth Amendment. (See <em>Green v. Berge, supra, </em>354 F.3d 675, 679; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, </em>at p. 308; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>259 Va. 654, 671-673; <em>Doles v. State, supra, </em>994 P.2d 315, 319-320.)  We agree with the reasoning in <em>Adams, Alfaro, </em>and <em>King, </em>and decline to depart from the overwhelming weight of authority in this state and other jurisdictions that has given universal approval to DNA collection statutes. We conclude <em>that the </em>trial court\u2019s order did not violate defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment or privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">III. <em>Section 296 as a Violation of Equal Protection Rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Next, defendant argues that section 296.1 violates the equal protection rights of convicted felons. He claims that the \u201cinvoluntary extraction\u201d of DNA samples from all those convicted of felonies creates an \u201coverly inclusive classification\u201d which infringes upon the \u201cfundamental right of privacy\u201d without a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">The constitutional guarantees of equal protection as embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the California Constitution \u201c \u2018 \u201cprohibit the state from arbitrarily discriminating among persons subject to its jurisdiction.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[This guarantee] has been defined to mean that all persons under similar circumstances are given \u201c \u2018equal protection and security in the enjoyment of personal and civil rights . . . and the prevention and redress of wrongs ....\u2019\u201d [Citation.] The concept \u201c \u2018 \u201ccompels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cUnder the equal protection clause, \u2018[a] classification \u201cmust be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some grounds of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1382-1383 [24 Cal.Rptr. 3d 834].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">\u201c \u2018The equality guaranteed by the equal protection clauses of the federal and state Constitutions is equality under the same conditions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>among persons similarly situated. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

Instead of directing us to a classification between similarly situated groups, defendant has merely asserted that section 296.1, as it \u201cnow applies to all felonies,\u201d has an \u201coverly broad reach\u201d that infringes upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>right to privacy. But the statute treats all persons convicted of felonies the same. The distinction created by section 296.1 is between all felony offenders, who must provide a DNA sample, and everyone else, including those convicted of misdemeanors, who do not. Thus, defendant received the same treatment accorded to all persons in California who are convicted of a felony. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1386.) We find that at least with respect to the purpose of collecting DNA samples to identify convicted felons, solve crimes, and deter future criminal behavior, felony offenders and others, even misdemeanants, are not similarly situated. <em>(People v.

The matter of delineating the elements of crimes and prescribing the consequences of convictions for various offenses is distinctly and solely a legislative function. (See <em>People v.
