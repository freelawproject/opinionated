The trial court sentenced defendant to a determinate term of 10 years, plus an indeterminate term of 120 years to life; ordered defendant to pay a $10,000 restitution fine ordered defendant to pay a $10,000 parole revocation fine, stayed pending successful completion of parole; and awarded defendant 539 total days of time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Defendant appeals contending (1) his constitutional rights to an impartial jury and to due process were violated when the trial court failed to ask prospective jurors what effect prejudicial statements by other prospective jurors had on them, (2) his constitutional rights to a jury and due process were denied under recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi); Ring v.

We agree only with defendant\u2019s last contention. We shall affirm defendant\u2019s convictions, but vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">As defendant\u2019s claims on appeal do not require a detailed statement of the underlying facts, we only briefly summarize them, viewing the evidence as a whole, in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>(People v. Staten </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 434, 460 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 213, 11 P.3d 968].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Sometime in 1992 or 1993, when defendant\u2019s eight- or nine-year-old niece J.L. was staying at defendant\u2019s house, J.L. and one of defendant\u2019s young daughters went into defendant\u2019s bedroom. Defendant asked the girls to take off their pants and underpants and lie on their stomachs facing the television, on which a pornographic movie was playing. Defendant stared at their genitalia, then digitally penetrated J.L.\u2019s vagina four or five times. (Counts 6, 7 &amp; 8.) The first time J.L. told anyone in law enforcement about defendant\u2019s actions was October 9, 2002. The felony complaint alleging these offenses was filed on October 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In August 1995, 10-year-old D.E. came to Sacramento for a family reunion. D.E. asked to accompany defendant on some errands. Defendant drove D.E. to his house. Inside the house, defendant tickled D.E., pressed his fingers on her stomach, pinned her in a corner and asked to lick her \u201cpussy.\u201d D.E. consented only when defendant got angry. Defendant then pushed her onto the bed, removed her pants and underwear, and put her legs over his shoulders. He licked her genitals, despite her kicking and screaming at him to stop. At the same time defendant was squeezing her buttocks and periodically touching her chest. Defendant asked D.E. to orally copulate him, but she refused. (Counts 10-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In March 1996, defendant\u2019s six-year-old niece R.S. was spending the night at defendant\u2019s apartment. Defendant came into the bathroom while she was taking a bath to give her a towel. When she had wrapped herself in the towel, R.S. sat on defendant\u2019s bed and asked who was going to do her hair. Defendant said he would. Defendant sat behind R.S. and rubbed her vagina and chest. Defendant also rubbed his penis against her vagina. R.S. saw a video camera set up pointing towards the bed. (Count 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">In March 1997 or March 1998, when defendant\u2019s nephew M.S. (R.S.\u2019s brother) was four or five years old, defendant called M.S. into another room and asked M.S. to touch his (defendant\u2019s) penis. Defendant grabbed M.S.\u2019s hand and held it tight, moving it up and down and preventing M.S. from yanking it away from defendant\u2019s penis. (Count 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">When R.S. was nine or 10 years old, she and her siblings moved in with defendant\u2019s mother, her grandmother. Defendant and his wife often came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>over to babysit. R.S. remembered one night her grandmother had to go to the hospital with her grandfather. About 1:00 a.m. defendant came into R.S.\u2019s room, sat on the edge of the bed, and started touching R.S.\u2019s vagina, first over her clothes and then underneath them.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">R.S. testified there were between 15 and 40 other times defendant touched her, mostly when she was at her grandmother\u2019s house over a period of two years when she was 10 to 12 years old. The incidents usually occurred at night. R.S. estimated she saw defendant\u2019s penis on at least 10 of these occasions. About half the time defendant\u2019s penis touched her vagina. R.S. also remembered defendant touching her breasts and vagina when she was visiting another relative\u2019s house. She remembered defendant touched her breasts, rubbed her vagina, and touched her with his penis a few times when they were on camping trips. The last time R.S. remembered defendant touching her was when she was 12 years old. He came into her bedroom and asked for a hug. When he came over to give her a hug, he started rubbing her vagina. She pushed him away and told him to get out. (Counts 2-5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Evidence was admitted regarding uncharged prior bad acts of defendant. Specifically defendant\u2019s sister, R.S.\u2019s and M.S.\u2019s mother, testified defendant had molested her from the time she was six years old until she was 15 or 16. Defendant rubbed her vagina with his hand and penis, orally copulated her, put a vibrator against her vagina, and later had sexual intercourse with her. Evidence was admitted that defendant made his stepson orally copulate him on more than 10 occasions when the stepson was nine years old or younger. Evidence was admitted that defendant digitally penetrated one of his daughters and she orally copulated defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Defendant did not testify, but presented evidence of inconsistencies in statements made by D.E., denials by M.S. of being touched by defendant, denials by defendant\u2019s sister of any oral copulation or penetration of her by defendant and evidence that other family members were making M.S. and R.S. say untrue things about defendant. At trial defendant\u2019s stepson denied he ever orally copulated defendant. Defendant argued J.L., D.E., R.S., and M.S. were lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">I.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Jury Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Burden of Proof for Statute of Limitations Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Section 803(g) permits prosecution of specified sexual offenses, including a violation of section 288, subdivision (a), after the statute of limitations has expired if (1) the victim reports the abuse to law enforcement, (2) the crime involves substantial sexual conduct, (3) there is independent evidence that clearly and convincingly corroborates the victim\u2019s allegation, and (4) prosecution is commenced within one year of the victim\u2019s report. Thus, the effect of section 803(g) is to permit prosecution of specified sexual offenses with a juvenile within the statute of limitations set forth in section 800 and 801, or within one year of the victim\u2019s report of the offense, whichever is later. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 501, 505 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Defendant claims he was deprived of his federal due process and Sixth Amendment right to a jury by the trial court\u2019s instruction of the jury that the burdens of proof applicable to the section 803(g) statute of limitations allegations for counts 6 through 8 were preponderance of the evidence, and, as to the corroboration requirement, clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant contends the People were required to prove the allegations extending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>statute of limitations under section 803(g), by proof beyond a reasonable doubt because the statute of limitations is either an element of the offense or should be treated as if it were an element under recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court. <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435]; <em>Ring, supra, </em>536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556]; <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403]; <em>Booker, supra, </em>543 U.S. 220 [160 L.Ed.2d 621].) According to defendant, cases in California permitting a jury finding on statute of limitations allegations under any standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt are no longer good authority and are not binding on this court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">As a preliminary matter, we note defendant claims to have objected to the statute of limitations instructions given by the trial court. Actually, defense counsel objected only to modified CALJIC No. 2.50.2 as part of defendant\u2019s objection to the set of instructions regarding uncharged crimes. As to uncharged crimes, defendant argued the instruction improperly lowered the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof of his guilt. Defendant never mentioned the portion of the instruction relating to the statute of limitations allegations. Defendant did object to the trial court\u2019s special instruction on section 803(g), but never on the grounds he now asserts on appeal, that the burden of proof is unconstitutional. Defendant\u2019s lack of objection does not preclude review of the issue on appeal because defendant had the right to correct instructions on the applicable burden of proof and courts may review instructions for errors that affect \u201cthe substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1259; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Prieto </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 268 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 66 P.3d 1123]; <em>People v. Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 976, fn. 7 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171].) We turn to the merits of defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">As the United States Supreme Court has explained, the federal Constitution \u201cprotects every criminal defendant \u2018against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Booker, supra, </em>543 U.S. at p. 230 [160 L.Ed.2d at p. 641], quoting <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375, 90 S.Ct. 1068].) Specifically, the \u201cConstitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>(United States v. Gaudin </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 506, 511 [132 L.Ed.2d 444, 450, 115 S.Ct. 2310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Based on these principles, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435], set aside an enhanced sentence imposed by a New Jersey court based on the trial court\u2019s finding defendant\u2019s conduct in carrying a firearm for an unlawful purpose, to which the defendant pled guilty, also violated New Jersey\u2019s \u201chate crime\u201d law because it was racially motivated. The court concluded the proper inquiry was not whether a Legislature has chosen to label a fact as an element of the crime or to label it as a separate sentencing factor. The question is not one of form, but effect. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 457].) \u201c[A] fact that, if found, exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty <em>exceeding </em>the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone\u201d is the functional equivalent of an element of the crime. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 483 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 450], fn. omitted.) The court held the federal Constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, any fact, other than a prior conviction, \u201cthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum[.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In <em>Ring, supra, </em>536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556], the United States Supreme Court held it was impermissible for a trial judge to determine the presence or absence of the aggravating factors required by Arizona law for imposition of the death penalty. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 588-589 [153 L.Ed.2d at pp. 563-564].) \u201cIf a State makes an increase in a defendant\u2019s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u2014no matter how the State labels it\u2014must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602 [153 L.Ed.2d at p. 572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403], the United States Supreme Court concluded an exceptional sentence imposed by a trial judge under Washington\u2019s determinate sentencing law violated these principles. The Supreme Court clarified that \u201cthe prescribed statutory maximum\u201d sentence \u201cfor <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 303 [159 L.Ed.2d at p. 413].) In <em>Booker, supra, </em>543 U.S. 220 [160 L.Ed.2d 621], a majority of the United States Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Stevens, found no significant distinction between the mandatory federal sentencing guidelines and the Washington sentencing law at issue in <em>Blakely </em>and concluded the federal guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>(Booker, supra, </em>at p. 233 [160 L.Ed.2d at p. 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Defendant claims these decisions require a jury to find the facts necessary for a section 803(g) statute of limitations extension based on the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof. However, the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases we have just summarized all \u201cinvolve factual determinations that establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>level of punishment for which the defendant is eligible.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Betts </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1039, 1054 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 138, 103 P.3d 883] <em>(Betts).)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Together with earlier decisions of the United States Supreme Court, these recent decisions make it clear the federal Constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a jury determination, based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, of every element of the crime and every fact, however labeled, that increases the defendant\u2019s punishment beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In California the statute of limitations constitutes a substantive right. <em>(Zamora, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 538, 547.) The prosecution bears the burden of pleading and proving the charged offense was committed within the applicable period of limitations. <em>(People v. Lopez </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 233, 245, 248 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 511].) Where the pleadings do not show as a matter of law the prosecution is time-barred, the statute of limitations becomes an issue for the jury (trier of fact) if disputed by the defendant. <em>(Zamora, supra, </em>at pp. 562, 564, fn. 25; see <em>People v. Smith </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1192 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 185] [trial court need only instruct on statute of limitations when it is placed at issue by the defense as a factual matter at trial].) However, \u201cthe statute of limitations is not an \u2018element\u2019 of the offense insofar as the \u2018definition\u2019 of criminal conduct is concerned.\u201d <em>(People v. Frazer </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 737, 760, fn. 22 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 312, 982 P.2d 180] <em>(Frazer) </em>overruled on other grounds by <em>Stogner </em>v. <em>California </em>(2003) 539 U.S. 607, 609-610, 632-633 [156 L.Ed.2d 544, 550-551, 565, 123 S.Ct. 2446] <em>(Stogner).) </em>Although the right to maintain the action is an essential part of the final power to pronounce judgment, that right \u201cconstitutes no part of the crime itself.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGill </em>(1935) 10 Cal.App.2d 155, 159 [51 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Defendant cites <em>Cowan v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 367 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458, 926 P.2d 438] and <em>People v. Bunn </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 227 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 734] for the proposition the statute of limitations is an essential element of the offense. In <em>Cowan </em>the Supreme Court was concerned with the issue of whether a defendant could waive the statute of limitations. It concluded a defendant could in certain circumstances do so as the statute of limitations was not strictly jurisdictional in the fundamental subject matter sense. <em>(Cowan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 372-376.) Nowhere in the opinion did the Supreme Court state it considered the statute of limitations an element of the underlying offense. In <em>Bunn </em>the court noted other cases had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>concluded the statute of limitations was an element of the offense, but also stated the rationale of those cases was undercut by <em>Cowan. (People v. Bunn, supra, </em>at p. 233.) And the court in <em>Bunn </em>later stated the statute of limitations is not \u201can \u2018element of the offense\u2019 in the sense that it defines the actus reus or the mens rea which characterizes the crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234.) Subsequently, in <em>Frazer, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 737, the Supreme Court clearly rejected the claim the statute of limitations is an actual element of the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Nor are the facts establishing a prosecution has been timely brought facts that effect \u201cthe level of punishment for which the defendant is eligible\u201d <em>(Betts, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1054), bringing those facts within the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases. Even the facts establishing an extension of the statute of limitations under section 803(g) do not result in an increase of a defendant\u2019s punishment. This conclusion is clear from <em>Stogner, supra, </em>539 U.S. 607 [156 L.Ed.2d 544]. In <em>Stogner </em>the United States Supreme Court held section 803(g) violated ex post facto principles to the extent it could be applied to <em>revive </em>a previously time-barred prosecution. <em>(Stogner, supra, </em>at pp. 609-610 [156 L.Ed.2d at pp. 550-551].) The court found: \u201cAfter <em>{but not </em>before) the original statute of limitations had expired, a party such as Stogner was not \u2018liable to any punishment.\u2019 California\u2019s new statute therefore \u2018aggravated\u2019 Stogner\u2019s alleged crime, or made it \u2018greater than it was, when committed,\u2019 in the sense that, and to the extent that, it \u2018inflicted punishment\u2019 for past criminal conduct that (when the new law was enacted) did not trigger any such liability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 613 [156 L.Ed.2d at p. 553], italics added.) That is, only revival of a time-barred prosecution increases the defendant\u2019s punishment; extension of the time for prosecution under section 803(g) does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As the court stated in <em>People v. Zandrino </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 74 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 879], section 803(g) \u201cdoes not alter the elements of these offenses, or their punishment. . . .\u201d (100 Cal.App.4th at p. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We conclude the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases does not call into question the clear California case authority holding the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof on the statute of limitations issue is a preponderance of the evidence and as to the independent corroboration requirement, clear and convincing evidence. (\u00a7 803(g)(2)(B); <em>Zamora, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 538, 563, fn. 25, 564, fn. 26; <em>People v. Lopez, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 233, 248; <em>People v. McGill, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.2d 155, 159-160.) The trial court did not err in so instructing the jury here.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">As we conclude the trial court did not err in applying the case authorities providing for a lesser burden of proof on the statute of limitations issue, we do not need to reach defendant\u2019s additional claim the burden of proof for section 803(g) cannot be less than beyond a reasonable doubt based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>analogy to Evidence Code section 1101 et al. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zandrino, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 84, fn. 6.)

The instruction then went on to define preponderance of the evidence and to direct the jury to consider all of the evidence bearing upon every issue regardless of who produced it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The trial court also drafted and gave a special instruction on section 803(g), which stated: \u201cCounts 6-8 (PC 288(a), involving the minor [J.L.]) were filed pursuant to Penal Code Section 803(g) which extends the normal 6-year statute of limitations under which such charges must be filed. The People have the burden of proving 5 factual allegations in order for the Penal Code section 803(g) extension to apply, [ft] If you find the defendant guilty of any of the counts filed pursuant to Penal Code 803(g) (Counts 6, 7, and/or 8), you must further determine, as to each count in which you find the defendant guilty, whether the People have proved all of the following by a \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019: [ft] 1. On October 9, 2002, the named victim [J.L.], first reported to a California law enforcement agency that while under the age of 18, she was a victim of child molestation, specifically including digital penetration; [ft] 2. A complaint accusing the defendant of the crimes in Counts 6, 7, and/or 8 was filed on or before October 9, 2003; [ft] 3. The crimes involving [J.L.] involved \u2018substantial sexual conduct.\u2019 Substantial sexual conduct is defined as penetration, however slight of the genitalia of the victim by any foreign object, including the finger or fingers, [ft] 4. The normal 6-year statute of limitations for the crimes alleged in Counts 6, 7 and/or 8 had expired before the complaint in this case was filed; and [ft] 5. There is independent evidence that \u2018clearly and convincingly\u2019 corroborates the conduct described by [J.L.] \u2018Clear and convincing\u2019 evidence means evidence of such convincing force that it demonstrates, in contrast to the opposing evidence, a high probability of the truth of the facts for which it is offered as proof. \u2018Clear and convincing evidence\u2019 is a higher standard of proof than proof by a \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 (which has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>previously defined elsewhere). You should consider all the evidence bearing upon every issue regardless of who produced it.
