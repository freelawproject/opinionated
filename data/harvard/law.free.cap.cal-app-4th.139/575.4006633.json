(Buckeye), appeals from summary judgment entered on the cross-complaint of Anna Slintak and Bohumir Marik (collectively Marik) for quiet title and cancellation of a deed of trust held on property owned by Marik. The trial court held that Buckeye\u2019s right to foreclose on a deed of trust encumbering Marik\u2019s property had expired under the statute of limitations of the Marketable Record Title Act (MRTA) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 880.020 et seq.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that no exceptions or equitable tolling applied to the statute of limitations of the MRTA. We reverse on the ground the statute of limitations has not run due to the filing of lis pendens in separate, but related, litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">1. <em>Background Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On October 23, 1989, Redondo Blacksmith, Inc. (RBI),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as part of a plan to develop property in Fontana, California, gave Metro Bank (Metro) a trust deed (Metro Trust Deed) on real property located at 350 North Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, California (Redondo property). The Metro Trust Deed was intended to partially collateralize a loan (Juniper Note) Metro was making to Juniper Park Villa Investment, L.L.P. (Juniper), to purchase property in Fontana (Fontana property), and was additional collateral for the Juniper Note. The Metro Trust Deed was recorded on October 27, 1989, in the records of Los Angeles County. The Juniper Note was also secured by a trust deed on the Fontana property (Fontana Trust Deed). Juniper purchased the land in Fontana with the proceeds of the loan, but the property was not developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In 1992, RBI executed three promissory notes payable to Martin Slintak, Anna Slintak, and Jacobs Investments, and gave each of them trust deeds on the Redondo property. These notes are junior to the Juniper Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">On May 15, 1992, Metro recorded a notice of default and election to sell on the Fontana property under the Fontana Trust Deed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 21, 1992, Metro assigned the Juniper Note to MNSB Properties, Inc. (MNSB), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>wholly owned subsidiary of Metro, and the assignment of the Fontana Trust Deed was recorded on October 29, 1992. On October 22, 1992, MNSB submitted a credit bid at Metro\u2019s tmstee\u2019s sale, and acquired title to the Fontana property.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">On October 28, 1992, after the foreclosure of the Fontana Tmst Deed, Metro recorded a notice of default on the Redondo property under the Metro Tmst Deed (October 1992 Notice of Default). The October 1992 Notice of Default stated that the Juniper Note was \u201cdue on January 23, 1992.\u201d On October 21, 1992, Metro assigned the Metro Tmst Deed to its wholly owned subsidiary, MNSB Properties, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 13, 1992, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) became Metro\u2019s receiver, and the scheduled tmstee\u2019s sale of the Redondo property was not conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In 1993, RBI conveyed the Redondo property to Bohumir Marik.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On July 16, 1993, Bohumir Marik commenced an action in the United States District Court in Missouri against the FDIC as receiver for Metro for cancellation of the Metro Tmst Deed to halt the foreclosure of the Redondo property. Marik\u2019s complaint alleged that the $1.5 million Metro Tmst Deed was invalid and it did not encumber the Redondo property. On November 21, 1995, Marik filed a lis pendens based on the Missouri federal action with the Los Angeles County Recorder. This action was later terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In January 1996, Marik filed an action to quiet title in the Los Angeles County Superior Court against the FDIC. Marik alleged that the assignment of the Juniper Note to MNSB also transferred the Metro Tmst Deed to MNSB; because MNSB was not in receivership, the FDIC never acquired any interest in either the Metro Tmst Deed or the Juniper Note. The FDIC removed the action to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. In 1997, the district court agreed and found that the Metro Tmst Deed was not an asset of the FDIC because the Juniper Note had been assigned to MNSB prior to Metro\u2019s receivership. The court dismissed the FDIC action, and because federal jurisdiction no longer existed, remanded the matter to state court. The state court refused to enter judgment because a final judgment had been entered in the district court, a mling that was upheld on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">On September 21, 1999, MNSB assigned its interest in the Juniper Note and Metro Tmst Deed to the FDIC. In 1999, Marik commenced another quiet title action in the California state court against the FDIC and Juniper, and filed a lis pendens giving notice of the action with the Los Angeles County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Recorder. The action was removed to Missouri federal court, where it was dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies in September 2000. That ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In May 2001, the FDIC sold the Juniper Note to Cadle Company (Cadle) and assigned the Metro Trust Deed to Cadle. On May 15, 2001, Cadle assigned the Juniper Note to Buckeye, and recorded the notice of assignment of the Metro Trust Deed on September 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">On January 14, 2003, Buckeye commenced this action for judicial foreclosure and breach of contract. The record does not indicate a lis pendens was recorded. On April 30, 2003, Anna Slintak and her son Martin Slintak and Jacobs Investments filed a cross-complaint for quiet title and cancellation of deed of trust, naming Buckeye, RBI, and Marik, among others, as cross-defendants. On October 2, 2003, after defendants demurred to the complaint and two amended complaints, Buckeye dismissed the second amended complaint without prejudice. The cross-complaint remained pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On October 10, 2003, Buckeye recorded another notice of default and election to sell the Redondo property. On February 27, 2004, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Buckeye\u2019s trustee\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On April 14, 2004, pursuant to stipulation of the parties, cross-complainants amended their cross-complaint to change the parties to Marik and his wife Anna Slintak as cross-complainants, and Buckeye and Les Zieve as cross-defendants. Marik added claims for declaratory relief and injunctive relief and eliminated the claim for quiet title. In particular, the first amended cross-complaint alleged that any action to enforce the Metro Trust Deed was barred by the MRTA because the October 1992 Notice of Default stated the note was due and payable on January 23, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">2. <em>Cross-complainants\u2019 Summary Judgment Motion and Buckeye\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Marik moved for summary judgment on the cross-complaint, contending the power of sale of the Metro Trust Deed had expired under section 882.020, part of the MRTA, because more than 10 years had elapsed from the due date of the Juniper Note as evidenced by the October 1992 Notice of Default in the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The recorded October 1992 Notice of Default stated that with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>to the Juniper Note, \u201cthe remaining principal sum, accrued interest, default interest and late charges . . . became due January 23, 1992. . . ,\u201d* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Buckeye opposed on the grounds that the statute of limitations under the MRTA was equitably tolled by Marik\u2019s litigation activity in the federal court which prevented Buckeye from taking action to protect its rights under the Metro Trust Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The trial court granted the motion on the grounds that the power of sale in the Metro Trust Deed had expired under the 10-year limit of MRTA, section 882.020, subdivision (a). The court noted that Buckeye did not dispute the note became due and payable on January 23, 1992; this due date was ascertainable from the record (Metro\u2019s notice of default); and Buckeye\u2019s notice of default, filed October 10, 2003, was filed more than 10 years after the due date of the note. The trial court rejected Buckeye\u2019s equitable tolling defenses, finding that equitable tolling was expressly excluded under the MRTA, citing section 882.030 and legislative comments thereto; furthermore, the court found that Buckeye had failed to file a notice of intent to preserve interest under section 882.020.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Buckeye moved for relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473 from the order granting summary judgment, asserting that it received Marik\u2019s improperly mailed reply brief in insufficient time to review it prior to the hearing, and the reply brief relied on additional statutory provisions. Buckeye also argued that the Metro Trust Deed was the only document that could be relied upon under the statutory terminology \u201cascertainable from the record,\u201d and, because it contained no due date for the obligation on the note, the 60-year statute of the MRTA applied. Finally, Buckeye contended that MRTA did not apply under sections 880.240, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (MRTA inapplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>where an \u201cinterest of the United States\u201d is involved), and 880.260<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (MRTA inapplicable where an action and a lis pendens are filed). In support of its motion, Buckeye submitted copies of the two lis pendens recorded by Marik in connection with the federal litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Marik\u2019s opposition asserted that Buckeye\u2019s motion was in fact a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, and that Buckeye had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation of why the evidence or legal argument had not been presented before. Marik further contended Buckeye\u2019s arguments were of no avail because section 880.260 did not provide for tolling of the statute; instead, it only applied where a judgment affecting the interest had been obtained, and no judgment was ever obtained in any of Marik\u2019s federal or state actions. Furthermore, Marik argued that the exception for interests of the United States did not apply because the interest in this case was subject to state foreclosure laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The trial court found that Buckeye\u2019s motion for relief was a disguised motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, and that Buckeye had failed to present any explanation why the new evidence and argument was not presented at the summary judgment motion. On the merits, the trial court rejected Buckeye\u2019s arguments that the reply was not timely served and that \u201cascertainable from the record\u201d could only refer to the trust deed. The trial court found that section 880.260 did not render the statutory limitations period inapplicable, but instead provided a mechanism by which an interest could be preserved by the filing of a lawsuit and a lis pendens within the statutory period. The trial court also found section 880.240 did not apply because Buckeye had provided no support for its argument that the statutory language \u201can interest of the United States\u201d also applied to an agency of the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The court entered judgment on the cross-complaint in favor of Marik.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On appeal, Buckeye raises four defenses to the application of the MRTA\u2019s 10-year limitations period to the Metro Trust Deed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, it contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the due date of the Juniper Note was not \u201cascertainable from the record\u201d because the due date is not stated in the Metro Trust Deed. Second, it contends that the trial court failed to apply the exception of section 880.240, subdivision (b) to the interest of the FDIC (MRTA does not apply where an interest is held by the United States). Third, it contends that under section 880.030, Marik is barred by waiver, estoppel, and laches, which have either abrogated or extended the limitations period. Lastly, Buckeye contends Marik\u2019s federal lawsuits and the two recorded lis pendens barred the applicability of the statute of limitations pursuant to section 880.260, or at the very least, tolled it during the pendency of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">As we explain, section 880.260 is ambiguous and specifies no outside time limit for expiration of the power of sale in a deed of trust once litigation is commenced and a lis pendens filed. Because an unlimited extension of the expiration date would be inconsistent with the other statutory provisions, we conclude that under section 880.260, the filing of a lis pendens within the initial 10-year statutory period should commence a new 10-year statute of limitations during which the power of sale remains valid. Here, because less than 10 years has elapsed from the filing of the last lis pendens, the power of sale in the Metro Trust Deed has not expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review and Principles of Statutory Construction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u201c[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (See also <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493] <em>(Aguilar).) </em>\u201cOnce the [movant] has met. that burden, the burden shifts to the [other party] to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action. . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(1); see also <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 849.) A triable issue of material fact exists where \u201cthe evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.\u201d <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 850.) Where summary judgment has been granted, we review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo, \u201cconsidering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion (except that which the court properly excluded) and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.\u201d <em>(Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In interpreting statutory language, the first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>commonsense meaning. <em>(Hughes </em>v. <em>Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 775 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641].) If there is no ambiguity in the statutory language, a court must presume that the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs. <em>(Lennane v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].) \u201cAn interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided [citation]; each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme [citation]; and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations, the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed [citation].\u201d <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) At all times, \u201c[o]ur foremost task remains ascertainment of the legislative intent, including consideration of \u2018the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Long Beach v. California Citizens for Neighborhood Empowerment </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 302, 306 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 473].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">B. <em>The Power of Sale in the Metro Trust Deed Has Not Expired.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">1. <em>The 10-Year Statute of Limitations Applies Because the Due Date of the Obligation May Be Stated in a Document Other Than the Trust Deed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Prior to 1982 in California, the running of the statute of limitations on a note secured by a deed of trust barred any action on the note as well as judicial foreclosure. However, the power of sale under a trust deed had no statute of limitations; rather, the power of sale would \u201cnever outlaw.\u201d The rule was based upon the equitable rationale that the mortgagor should not be able to quiet title against his or her encumbered property without first paying the underlying debt. <em>(Miller v. Provost </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1703, 1707 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 288] <em>(Miller).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In 1982, the Legislature overturned the rule that the power of sale in a trust deed \u201cnever outlaws.\u201d The purpose of the MRTA was to make real property more freely alienable and marketable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To that end, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>sought to simplify real estate transactions by enabling persons to determine the status and security of recorded titles from an examination of the record. <em>(Worthington </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1404, 1409 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 374].) The Legislature provided for two limitations periods, the 10-year period of section 882.020, subdivision (a)(1) where \u201cthe final maturity date or the last date fixed for payment of the debt or performance of the obligation is ascertainable from the record,\u201d and a 60-year period for all other trust deeds in section 882.020, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In <em>Miller, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th at page 1709, the promissory note containing the maturity date was not recorded. Although the deed of trust itself had been, the due date of the obligation was not ascertainable from the record. \u201c[T]he purpose of the statute is not merely to give notice that the property is encumbered, but to provide a specific date for the expiration of the encumbrance.\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>Nicolopulos </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Nicolopulos) </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 304, 310 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 626] [where note not recorded, due date not \u201cascertainable from record\u201d where trust deed silent as to payment date].) Both <em>Miller </em>and <em>Nicolopulos </em>imply that had the note itself been recorded, the shorter 10-year statute would have applied because a recorded note would provide a due date \u201cascertainable from the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Here, the October 1992 Notice of Default was recorded and contained the due date of the Juniper Note (as extended); thus, the due date is \u201cascertainable from the record\u201d and the shorter 10-year limitations period of section 882.020, subdivision (a)(1) applies. Buckeye\u2019s argument amounts to a contention that \u201cascertainable from the record\u201d means \u201cascertainable from the recorded trust deed.\u201d That argument too narrowly constricts the statutory language, and is unsupported by any authority. On the contrary, a commonsense reading of \u201cascertainable from the record\u201d means that any recorded document that contains the due date of the note secured by the trust deed in question will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">2. <em>The Filing of the Two Lis Pendens in Marik\u2019s Federal and State Court Actions Reset the Time Limits Under MRTA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Buckeye argues that under section 880.260, Marik\u2019s litigation and the lis pendens that were filed in those actions either tolled the application of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>882.020 or rendered it inapplicable. We conclude the filing of the two lis pendens in Marik\u2019s federal and state court actions reset the time limits under MRTA so that a 10-year period of limitations runs from the filing date of the last lis pendens filed within the original time limits of MRTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Section 880.250 subdivision (a) provides that the time limits of the MRTA \u201care absolute and apply notwithstanding any disability or lack of knowledge of any person or any provisions for tolling a statute of limitation and notwithstanding any longer time applicable pursuant to any statute of limitation.\u201d The Legislature did, however, enact a mechanism to extend the statute. Section 882.020, subdivision (a)(3) provides that a notice of intent to preserve interest may be filed within the statutory periods of section 882.020, subdivision (a) and operates to extend the statutory period 10 years from the date of filing of the notice. (\u00a7 882.020, subd. (a)(3).) This extension is in effect a one-time-only provision. (See Legislative Com. com., Senate, 1982 Addition, 7 West's Ann. Civ. Code foll. \u00a7 882.020, (2006 Supp.) pp. 229-230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Legislature also recognized the operation of lis pendens. Section 880.260 provides in relevant part that: \u201cAn interest in real property, as specified in this title, does not expire or expire of record and is not unenforceable pursuant to this title at the time prescribed in this title if within the time an action is commenced to enforce, establish, clear title to, or otherwise affect the interest and a notice of the pendency of the action is recorded as provided by law.\u201d As stated in the Law Revision Commission comments, \u201c[s]ection 880.260 makes clear that there is no expiration of an interest in real property by operation of law pursuant to this title if a lis pendens is recorded before expiration. This is a specific application of the general provisions governing the effect of a lis pendens.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Law Rev. Com. com., 7 West's Ann. Civ. Code, <em>supra, </em>foll. \u00a7 880.260, p. 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">A lis pendens provides constructive notice of the litigation, such that any judgment later obtained in the action relates back to the filing of the lis pendens. <em>(Bishop Creek Lodge </em>v. <em>Scira </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1721, 1734 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 745].) A lis pendens clouds title until the litigation is resolved or the lis pendens is expunged, and any party acquiring an interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>property after the action is filed will be bound by the judgment. <em>(BGJ Associates v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 952, 966, 967 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 693].) Even after judgment, a lis pendens remains effectively on the record unless a statutory ground for expungement is established. <em>(Knapp Development &amp; Design v. Pal-Mal Properties, Ltd. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 786, 791 [240 Cal.Rptr. 920].)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">However, section 880.260 does not provide any time limits (an interest \u201cdoes not expire or expire of record and is not unenforceable pursuant to this title\u201d) where an action has been filed \u201cto enforce, establish, clear title to, or otherwise affect the interest\u201d and a lis pendens is recorded. Although it is fair to infer that the Legislature presumed that such an action would clear title to the property, leaving no ancient interests outside the record to impair marketability of title, the statutory mechanism is not limited to such a case. Because all that section 880.260 requires is the commencement of an action, coupled with the recording of a lis pendens, the action itself could fail to come to judgment, or could fail to result in the clearing of title, and an ancient mortgage could remain viable and subject to litigation beyond the time limits contemplated by the statute. Such was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">If the statute were read to permit a lis pendens to cloud title indefinitely under section 880.260, this would impede the purposes of the MRTA. To further the Legislature\u2019s stated intent to promote marketability of title by removing ancient mortgages from the record by operation of law, we must harmonize section 880.260 with section 882.020, subdivision (a)(3), the other provision permitting extension of the time limits of MRTA by a party. In that circumstance, the Legislature adopted the 10-year limit applicable where the due date is ascertainable. There is no reason to infer that it or the Legislature would intend a longer period in the analogous extension of section 880.260. The lis pendens is a fact ascertainable from the record and serves to give notice of a date certain from which the statute may run. This is consistent with the apparent legislative purpose of permitting the parties to conclude their litigation by providing that an interest \u201cdoes not expire or expire of record and is not unenforceable pursuant to this title\u201d if an action is commenced and a lis pendens filed. (\u00a7 880.260.) However, if no limit were applied when a lis pendens is filed, a lawsuit not brought to judgment could cloud title indefinitely, despite the statutory purpose to limit such uncertainty. Such a result does not appear to serve the statutory scheme and is inconsistent with the choice to limit to 10 years the extension of a recorded interest where a fixed date appears on the record. Therefore, under section 880.260, if an action is commenced and a lis pendens filed, the running of the limitations period under the MRTA is reset and a 10-year limitations period commences on the date of the recording of the lis pendens. After the expiration of the recommenced 10-year period, the power of sale in the trust deed expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Therefore, the statute has not yet run in this case because the last lis pendens was recorded in 1999, within the 10-year time period provided by section 882.020, subdivision (a)(1), and this lis pendens recording generated an additional 10-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed.
