Hernandez appeals from judgment entered following a jury trial in which he was convicted of possession of cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351); possession of marijuana for sale (\u00a7 11359); transportation of cocaine (\u00a7 11352, subd. (a)); and transportation of marijuana (\u00a7 11360, subd. (a)). He admitted that he had three prior convictions within the meaning of Penal Code section 1203, subdivision (e)(4) and Health and Safety Code section 11370.2, subdivision (a), and had served two prior prison terms within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b). Sentenced to prison for a total of nine years, he contends the judgment of conviction must be reversed because the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to discharge his retained counsel prior to trial resulted in a denial of his state and constitutional rights to counsel and due process of law. For reasons explained in the opinion, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">As appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of evidence to support his convictions, it will suffice to observe that on August 31, 2004, Los Angeles police officers stopped a van in which appellant was the front seat passenger. In the van and within arm\u2019s reach of appellant and the van\u2019s other occupants, the officers found a large bag containing two large bricks of marijuana and a large amount of cocaine. Also recovered was $2,030 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Following advisement and waiver of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, appellant stated he had asked his brother, the driver of the van, to drive him to the vicinity of Arleta and San Jose streets to meet with codefendant Olivares,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the van\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>third occupant. Olivares was to provide appellant with marijuana and cocaine in exchange for the $2,000 he had with him. Appellant stated he had saved this money from working, but he also admitted he was unemployed. Appellant stated he intended to sell the marijuana and cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">It was stipulated that 27.91 grams of cocaine and 9.5 pounds of marijuana were recovered from the van and that the person or persons who possessed the drugs possessed them for purposes of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Appellant contends the denial of his request to discharge retained counsel prior to trial resulted in the denial of his state and constitutional rights to counsel and due process of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">On January 4, 2005, on day \u201csix of ten,\u201d the court discussed offers made by the prosecution to appellant and his codefendant. Defense counsel told the court appellant wanted to address the court. The court stated it did not talk to persons represented by counsel, but that it did know appellant was not happy with the offer made by the prosecution and wanted \u201cto dump [defense counsel].\u201d The court observed that the prosecution\u2019s offer would be the same regardless of who the defense attorney was and that appellant\u2019s counsel had done all he could to get the prosecution to accept appellant\u2019s counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Appellant\u2019s counsel advised the court that appellant wanted to ask the court to appoint the public defender or private appointed counsel in the case. The court responded it would not appoint private counsel unless the public defender was unable to represent him. The court noted that since the public defender\u2019s office had previously represented appellant, it appeared it could represent him but that appellant had chosen to relieve that office and have new and different counsel at his own expense. The court stated that no good reason had been presented why appellant should be returned to the public defender\u2019s office which was over burdened, it was day six of 10 heading for trial, and a jury would be ordered in two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">On Friday, January 7, 2005, defense counsel informed the court there was a request from appellant to either have a public defender reappointed or have a \u201cconflict attorney.\u201d In response, the court indicated to the prosecution it was \u201cinclined to listen to [appellant] and learn for [itself] if there is some problem of such magnitude that, in fact, [the court] should [accede] to his request.\u201d The record indicates that the prosecution stepped out of the courtroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">The court addressed appellant stating, \u201cI\u2019m told that you want to ask this court to relieve [defense counsel] of further obligation to you because you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>feel either that he\u2019s not representing you in an effective way or that there is such a conflict between the two of you that you cannot appropriately work together. Is that basically what\u2019s on your mind, sir? Just yes or no to start out.\u201d When appellant stated yes and that he was willing to speak, the court informed him, \u201cThen I\u2019m telling you what you need to do ... is to convince [the court] what is the basis for this request that you believe that [the court] should be relieving [defense counsel] of the obligation that he\u2019s undertaken at your request\u2014you have already relieved public defender. You asked for him. You or someone on your behalf has paid for his services, and now you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want him any more. So let me have you go forward now to tell me why you think the public defender or some other attorney should be appointed by the court to represent you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Appellant responded the first point of disagreement was that from the second court appearance he had asked his counsel to make a suppression motion pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5 and counsel had not followed that request. Appellant added that he and his counsel had not been able to agree on anything because appellant insisted that counsel present the suppression motion. Counsel answered \u201che was 100% sure if that motion were to be presented it was going to be denied [by the court].\u201d Appellant stated that he had asked his attorney \u201cfor Carlos Oliveros, who was also a passenger in the vehicle in which [they] were in.\u201d The court inquired whether he was a defense witness to which appellant answered, not necessarily, but he wanted to know where he was. The court indicated that had nothing to do with whether his attorney would be relieved. Appellant added, \u201cI didn\u2019t get the answer for which I had paid for the service, so I don\u2019t want to continue being with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion the court stated, \u201cNo matter that you would like to have a motion to suppress, this attorney and any other attorney who represents you would not be obligated to run that motion just because you wanted it run. The attorney has to evaluate what would happen, how it would affect you, what\u2019s the likely outcome of the motion and other things that Mr. Montanez may have discussed with you. So I will not relieve you of Mr. Montanez\u2019s representation because he had a different point of view about whether or not to run a 1538.5 motion. Secondly, even if you\u2019d like to know where Carlos Oliveros is and you feel in some way it would benefit you personally, your attorney is not an investigator. He has no obligation to try to look for people who aren\u2019t people that would be used for trial or for some other defense purpose or to provide information that would assist in your defense. So the fact that he hasn\u2019t been able to or has chosen not to locate Carlos Oliveros is not grounds for the court to relieve him from further representation of you; and so I decline to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Our Supreme Court has stated, \u201cThe right of a criminal defendant to counsel and to present a defense are among the most sacred and sensitive of our constitutional rights. [Citation.] While we have recognized competing values of substantial importance to trial courts, including the speedy determination of criminal charges, the state should keep to a \u2018necessary minimum its interference with the individual\u2019s desire to defend himself in whatever manner he deems best, using any legitimate means within his resources\u2019 [citation]. A criminal defendant\u2019s right to decide how to defend himself should be respected unless it will result in \u2018significant prejudice\u2019 to the defendant or in a \u2018disruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.\u2019 [Citation.] In other words, we demand of trial courts a \u2018resourceful diligence directed toward the protection of [the right to counsel] to the fullest extent consistent with effective judicial administration.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 975, 982-983 [275 Cal.Rptr. 191, 800 P.2d 547].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201cThe right of a nonindigent criminal defendant to discharge his retained attorney, with or without cause, has long been recognized in this state [citations], and is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision 2 [citations],[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] The right to discharge retained counsel is based on \u2018 \u201cnecessity in view both of the delicate and confidential nature of the relation between [attorney and client], and of the evil engendered by friction or distrust.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] In order to ensure effective assistance of counsel, a nonindigent defendant is accorded the right to discharge his retained attorney: \u2018the attorney-client relationship . . . involves not just the casual assistance of a member of the bar, but an intimate process of consultation and planning which culminates in a state of trust and confidence between the client and his attorney. This is particularly essential, of course, when the attorney is defending the client\u2019s life or liberty.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, we conclude that the right to counsel of choice reflects not only a defendant\u2019s choice of a particular attorney, but also his decision to discharge an attorney whom he hired but no longer wishes to retain.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 983, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201cA nonindigent defendant\u2019s right to discharge his retained counsel, however, is not absolute. The trial court, in its discretion, may deny such a motion if discharge will result in \u2018significant prejudice\u2019 to the defendant [citation], or if it is not timely, i.e., if it will result in \u2018disruption of the orderly processes of justice\u2019 [citations], . . . [f] While we do require an <em>indigent </em>criminal defendant who is seeking to substitute one <em>appointed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>attorney for another to demonstrate either that the first appointed attorney is providing inadequate representation [citation], or that he and the attorney are embroiled in irreconcilable conflict [citation], we have never required a <em>nonindigent </em>criminal defendant to make such a showing in order to discharge his <em>retained </em>counsel.\u201d <em>(People v. Ortiz, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 983-984.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As appellant contends, the trial court here held what was in essence a <em>Marsden </em>hearing, requiring appellant to demonstrate his counsel was providing inadequate representation or that he and his attorney were embroiled in an irreconcilable conflict. Upon demand by the trial court and in the absence of the prosecuting attorney, appellant stated his reasons for wanting to discharge his retained counsel: he disagreed with his counsel regarding trial tactics; he wanted his attorney to make a suppression motion and to contact Mr. Oliveros, the third person in the van at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest and the person from whom appellant stated he purchased the drugs; and he believed he was not getting the service for which he was paying this privately retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, finding the difference in trial tactics was not a sufficient reason to discharge counsel. Since appellant\u2019s counsel was not appointed counsel but rather retained counsel, this <em>Marsden </em>hearing was \u201cthe inappropriate vehicle in which to consider appellant\u2019s complaints against his retained counsel.\u201d <em>(People v. Lara </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 139, 155 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 201].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">A case with similar facts, <em>People v. Munoz </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 860 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 842], recently reversed defendant\u2019s conviction because the trial court erred in addressing the defendant\u2019s request to relieve his retained attorney utilizing the <em>Marsden </em>standard, as compared to the standard enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 975. In <em>Munoz, </em>the defendant made his request after conviction but before sentencing. The Attorney General argued the stricter <em>Marsden </em>standard should be utilized but the Court of Appeal disagreed: \u201cFirst of all, there is nothing in <em>Ortiz </em>that suggests it is limited to the pretrial context. To the contrary, the Supreme Court framed its holding in broad terms: \u2018[W]hen a criminal defendant makes a timely motion to discharge his retained attorney he should not be required to demonstrate the latter\u2019s incompetence, as long as the discharge will not result in prejudice to the defendant or in an unreasonable disruption of the orderly processes of justice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Munoz, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 867, citing <em>People v. Ortiz, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Respondent argues that although the trial court did not expressly make findings upon which to deny appellant\u2019s request to discharge retained counsel, the record demonstrates the trial court \u201cbelieved that the motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>untimely and would result in \u2018disruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case\u2019 \u201d and that was the basis for the denial of the motion. The Attorney General made the same argument in <em>Munoz </em>and it was rejected: \u201cThat brings us to the issue of timeliness. According to the Attorney General, defendant\u2019s motion to relieve [counsel] was untimely because he waited until after the verdict to make it. The Attorney General notes that had [counsel] been relieved at that juncture, \u2018new counsel would have [had] to order all the transcripts and review them in order to file a motion for a new trial.\u2019 However, this does not mean substantial delay in the administration of justice was inevitable. While the trial court may have been correct <em>had it made such a finding, there is nothing in the record to suggest any such inquiry was made. </em>The trial court, quite reasonably, but we think incorrectly, <em>assumed </em>them to be the case\u2014as it would be in many cases, [f] \u2018[A] court faced with a request to substitute retained counsel must balance the defendant\u2019s interest in new counsel against the disruption, if any, flowing from the substitution. [Citation.]\u2019 ... \u2018To exercise the power of judicial discretion [in ruling on motion to relieve retained counsel], all material facts and evidence must be both known and considered, together with legal principles essential to an informed, intelligent and just decision.\u2019 [Citation.] Furthermore, \u2018The trial court. . . must exercise its discretion reasonably: \u201ca myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Munoz, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 870, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In this case, there appears to have been an adequate basis to deny appellant\u2019s late request for appointed counsel. As we have seen, the request was made almost immediately before jury selection was to begin in a two-defendant case. It is almost inconceivable that the public defender (or alternate counsel) would be able and willing to defend the case without a material postponement of the trial date, a circumstance that may have justified denial of the request. But, as in <em>Munoz, </em>the trial court made no inquiry on the point and did not refer to it in its decision to deny appellant\u2019s request. Instead, its decision appears to have been based entirely on application of a <em>Marsden </em>analysis. As we also have discussed, that does not suffice in a case such as this, when the defendant is represented by retained counsel and is or may be eligible to have appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Because the trial court utilized the wrong standard, it did not adequately address the issue of delay. Reversal is automatic where, as here, a defendant has been deprived of his right to defend with counsel of his choice. <em>(People v.
