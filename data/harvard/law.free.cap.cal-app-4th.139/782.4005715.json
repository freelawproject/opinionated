J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuZ\">Joe Amall Walker previously raped and assaulted two women, one of whom was a prostitute (Irma P.) and one of whom was not (Dorothy B.), and assaulted a second prostitute after she had agreed to have sex with him (Stephanie L.). During Walker\u2019s trial for the asphyxiation murder of Kathryn M. Waters, also a prostitute, the People were allowed to introduce evidence of Walker\u2019s three prior sexual assaults on these women to establish identity, motive and intent pursuant to Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as to prove Walker\u2019s predisposition to commit the current offense pursuant to section 1108, subdivision (a). The jury convicted Walker of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Evidence of Walker\u2019s attacks on Irma P. and Stephanie L. was properly admitted at Walker\u2019s murder trial on the issues of motive and intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>and, with respect to Irma R, as to identity as well. However, because Walker was not accused of a sexual offense within the meaning of section 1108, it was error to permit the People to introduce evidence of Walker\u2019s prior criminal conduct to prove his propensity to kill Waters. It was also error to admit evidence of Walker\u2019s assault and rape of Dorothy B. because of the dissimilarity between the circumstances of that crime and Waters\u2019s murder. Nonetheless, the court\u2019s improper admission of evidence and its related error in instructing the jury concerning the purposes for which that evidence could be considered were harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">1. <em>The Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In an amended information filed on October 14, 2004, Walker was charged in a single count with the first degree murder of Waters (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)). The information alleged Walker had suffered a prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and had served four separate prison terms for prior felony convictions (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Walker pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">2. <em>Waters\u2019s Murder and Evidence of Walker\u2019s Involvement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Kathryn Waters worked as a prostitute to support her heroin addiction. Her badly bruised body was found in a parking lot in Monterey Park on February 23, 2003. Waters had been strangled and died of asphyxia; the bruises on her head and face were caused by blunt trauma force; the bruises on her left hand and wrist were consistent with defensive injuries. DNA from semen found on Waters\u2019s external genitalia and one nipple matched Walker\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Walker, a freelance automobile mechanic, resided at a sober living facility in Carson and attended a rehabilitation program for recovering addicts in downtown Los Angeles. The rehabilitation program was housed in a building adjacent to the apartment complex in which Waters lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Jon Wilson, Waters\u2019s boyfriend, told a detective from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department he last saw Waters on February 22, 2003, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>she left her apartment to meet a customer she referred to as \u201cthe mechanic.\u201d According to Wilson, Waters had engaged in prostitution with \u201cthe mechanic\u201d in her apartment two or three times in the month prior to her death. Wilson provided a description of \u201cthe mechanic\u201d that matched Walker\u2019s description; he then identified Walker as \u201cthe mechanic\u201d from a photograph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Walker\u2019s telephone number and the name \u201cJoe\u201d were written on a business card found in Waters\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The People and Walker stipulated that a postmortem sexual assault examination was performed on Waters, that the findings were consistent with sexual contact (full or partial or attempted sexual penetration) during the hours or days just prior to Waters\u2019s death and that there was no medically valid way to determine whether the sexual contact occurred with or without Waters\u2019s consent. That stipulation was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">3. <em>The Defense Theory and Contradictory Trial Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The defense indirectly suggested at trial that Waters may have been killed by her boyfriend Wilson, a drug dealer with a criminal record involving prior assaults and corporal injury to a spouse or cohabitant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In an interview with investigators from the sheriff\u2019s department approximately five weeks after Waters\u2019s body was discovered,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Walker-\u2014who did not testify at trial\u2014acknowledged knowing Waters but denied ever having sex with her and attempted to establish an alibi. Walker contended that on February 22, 2003, the day before Waters\u2019s body was found, he was working on a car at 118th Street and Wilmington Avenue in south Los Angeles, where it had broken down, and later on Wilmington Avenue, after the car broke down again. Walker maintained he worked on the car until dark and then returned to the sober living house in Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Records for Walker\u2019s cellular telephone introduced at trial, however, were inconsistent with his alibi.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The documents show that an outgoing call was made at 1:00 p.m. from a location near Waters\u2019s residence in downtown Los Angeles. A series of outgoing calls were made between 4:15 p.m. and 6:24 p.m from Huntington Park, an industrial area about six miles from 118th Street and Wilmington Avenue. A call was then made at 7:47 p.m. from the vicinity of Temple City, where Walker had once lived and which is in the opposite direction from the sober living house.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In addition, at trial Stephen Brame, who had resided in the same sober living house and attended the same drug rehabilitation program as Walker, testified Walker told him he had paid sex with Waters in her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">4. <em>Admission of Evidence of Prior Sexual Assaults Committed by Walker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Prior to trial the court granted the People\u2019s motion pursuant to sections 1101 and 1108 to introduce evidence of three prior sexual assaults committed by Walker. In July 1981 Walker was convicted of assaulting Dorothy B. with a deadly weapon. According to Dorothy B.\u2019s testimony, the incident occurred when she was hitchhiking from Chino, where she had visited her boyfriend, to her home in Chatsworth. Because her boyfriend was a truck driver who made deliveries in Los Angeles and Dorothy B. had been with him on some of those occasions, she made her way to a truck stop in Los Angeles to look for someone she might know to give her a ride. Not recognizing anyone, Dorothy B. began asking for a ride from the truck drivers present. Walker told Dorothy B. he was a truck driver and could give her a ride. As they walked through a dark, remote train yard to Walker\u2019s truck, Walker said he had a weapon and forced Dorothy B. into an empty train car where he had intercourse with her against her will. Walker would not let Dorothy B. leave; he said he had a gun and threatened to \u201cblow [her] head off.\u201d Just before morning, as Walker was walking Dorothy B. back to the truck stop, gripping her arm, she managed to break free.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In April 1983 Walker was convicted of raping Irma P. Irma P. testified she was a heroin-addicted prostitute who worked at a truck stop in Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>that Walker frequented almost daily. On December 14, 1982, Walker approached Irma P. as she left a restaurant in the area at approximately 3:00 a.m. Walker asked her to walk with him and then pulled out a knife. With the knife pressed to her side, Walker took Irma P. into a vacant building; told her to remove her clothes; and, after she took her pants off, began hitting her in the ribs and face and choking her. He raped her and stated several times \u201cthat he hated fucking whores.\u201d Irma P. was able to escape after telling Walker she heard a noise and thought someone was with them in the building. As they left the building, Walker released Irma P.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">According to the testimony of Christopher Schaper, who at the time was an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department, at approximately 7:15 p.m. on December 14, 1982, the same day as the rape and assault of Irma R, he and his partner saw Walker walking with a woman they believed was a prostitute, Stephanie L., in the area where Irma P. had been raped. The officers followed the pair to see whether they would engage in an act of prostitution. After Walker and Stephanie L. turned into a dead-end alley, the officers waited about 15 seconds and then heard a woman screaming. Schaper jumped out from his position and saw Stephanie L. lying face down on the ground with Walker sitting on top of her, trying to cut the back of her neck with a large hair comb. Stephanie L. told the officers she had agreed to have sex with Walker, but as soon as they got in the alley he knocked her down, jumped on her, tried to pull her pants off and then started cutting the back of her neck. After the officers took Walker into custody and were walking him to their police car, Irma P. approached the officers and started yelling that Walker was the man who had attacked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">5. <em>Jury Instructions Concerning Other-crimes Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to CALIIC No. 2.50 that evidence of other crimes committed by Walker, if believed, may be considered for the limited purpose of determining if it tends to show the identity of the person who committed the crime, the existence of the intent that is a necessary element of the crime charged, a motive for the commission of the crime charged or a characteristic method or plan in the commission of criminal acts similar to that used in the commission of the offense for which Walker was being tried such that it tended to show either the identity of the person who committed the crime or the existence of the intent that is a necessary element of the crime charged.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury was also instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.50.01 that evidence had been introduced to show Walker had engaged in a sexual offense on one or more occasions other than that charged in the pending case and, if it found Walker had committed one or more prior sexual offenses, it may infer that he had a disposition to commit sexual offenses and may further infer he was likely to commit and did commit the crime charged.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court admonished the jury, in the language of CALJIC No. 2.50.1, that it must not consider the evidence Walker had committed other crimes or sexual offenses unless it finds that he had done so by a preponderance of the evidence and further cautioned the jury, \u201c[Bjefore a defendant can be found guilty of any crime charged [or any included crime] in this trial, the evidence as a whole must persuade you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of that crime.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>6. <em>The Jury\u2019s Verdicts and Walker\u2019s Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The jury convicted Walker of one count of second degree murder. In a bifurcated trial the jury found true the special allegation that Walker had suffered a prior serious felony conviction (his 1983 conviction for the rape of Irma P.) within the meaning of both the Three Strikes law and Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a), and that he had also suffered four felony convictions for which he had served separate prison terms (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). Walker was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 38 years to life (15 years to life for second degree murder, doubled under the Three Strikes law, plus a five-year enhancement for the prior serious felony and three one-year enhancements for the prior prison term).* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Walker contends evidence of his prior sexual assaults was not admissible under either section 1101 or section 1108 and, even if admissible under section 1101, the court committed prejudicial error by instructing the jury it could consider that evidence to infer he had a predisposition to commit sexual offenses and was therefore likely to have committed the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">A trial court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of evidence of uncharged offenses is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Kipp </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 349, 369 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 716, 956 P.2d 1169] <em>(Kipp) </em>[\u201cOn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>appeal, the trial court\u2019s determination of this issue, being essentially a determination of relevance, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1149 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 759, 117 P.3d 476] <em>(Carter).)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To the extent the trial court\u2019s ruling depends on the proper interpretation of the Evidence Code, however, it presents a question of law; and our review is de novo. <em>(Kavanaugh </em>v. <em>West Sonoma County Union High School Dist. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 811, 62 P.3d 54].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">2. <em>General Principles Governing Evidence of Uncharged Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">California law has long precluded use of evidence of a person\u2019s character (a predisposition or propensity to engage in a particular type of behavior) as a basis for an inference that he or she acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion: Section 1101, subdivision (a),* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cprohibits admission of evidence of a person\u2019s character, including evidence of character in the form of specific instances of uncharged misconduct, to prove the conduct of that person on a specified occasion.\u201d <em>(People v. Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 393 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757] <em>(Ewoldt).) </em>Indeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he rule excluding evidence of criminal propensity is nearly three centuries old in the common law. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Falsetta </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 913 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 847, 986 P.2d 182] <em>(Falsetta).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Section 1101, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> clarifies, however, that this rule \u201cdoes not prohibit admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct when such evidence is relevant to establish some fact other than the person\u2019s character or disposition.\u201d <em>(Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 393; see <em>Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 914 [\u201cthe rule against admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s other bad acts to prove his present conduct was subject to far-ranging exceptions,\u201d citing \u00a7 1101, subd. (b)].) \u201c \u2018[E]vidence of uncharged crimes is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>admissible to prove, among other things, the identity of the perpetrator of the charged crimes, the existence of a common design or plan, or the intent with which the perpetrator acted in the commission of the charged crimes. [Citation.] Evidence of uncharged crimes is admissible to prove identity, common design or plan, or intent only if the charged and uncharged crimes are sufficiently similar to support a rational inference of identity, common design or plan, or intent. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1147.) \u201cAs Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) recognizes, that a defendant previously committed a similar crime can be circumstantial evidence tending to prove his identity, intent, and motive in the present crime. Like other circumstantial evidence, admissibility depends on the materiality of the fact sought to be proved, the tendency of the prior crime to prove the material fact, and the existence <em>vel non </em>of some other rule requiring exclusion.\u201d <em>(People v. Roldan </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 705 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 360, 110 P.3d 289]; see Simons, Cal. Evidence Manual (2006) \u00a7 6.10, p. 422.) When a defendant pleads not guilty, he or she places all issues in dispute, and thus the perpetrator\u2019s identity, intent and motive are all material facts. <em>(Roldan, </em>at pp. 705-706; see also <em>People v. Beyea </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 176, 195 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254] [\u201cIn a prosecution for murder, proof of motive is material to a finding of premeditation and deliberation [citation]\u201d].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In addition to its relevance to an issue other than predisposition or propensity, to be admissible under section 1101, subdivision (b), the probative value of the evidence of uncharged crimes \u201cmust be substantial and must not be largely outweighed by the probability that its admission would create a serious danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d <em>(Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 371; see also <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Notwithstanding the general rule prohibiting evidence of prior acts of misconduct to prove predisposition or propensity, in 1995 the Legislature enacted section 1108 authorizing in sexual offense cases the admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s other sexual offenses to prove his or her propensity to commit the charged sex offense. \u201cIn a criminal action in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>the defendant is accused of a sexual offense, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of another sexual offense or offenses is not made inadmissible by Section 1101, if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to Section 352.\u201d (\u00a7 1108, subd. (a).) \u201cAvailable legislative history indicates section 1108 was intended in sex offense cases to relax the evidentiary restraints section 1101, subdivision (a), imposed, to assure that the trier of fact would be made aware of the defendant\u2019s other sex offenses in evaluating the victim\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s credibility. In this regard, section 1108 implicitly abrogates prior decisions of this court indicating that \u2018propensity\u2019 evidence is per se unduly prejudicial to the defense.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 911; see <em>People v. Britt </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 500, 505-506 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 290] [\u201c \u2018In enacting Evidence Code section 1108, the Legislature decided evidence of uncharged sexual offenses is so uniquely probative in sex crimes prosecutions it is presumed admissible <em>without regard to the limitations of Evidence Code section 1101.' </em>[Citation.] When section 1108 swept away the general prohibition on character evidence set forth in section 1101, it rendered moot the exceptions to that prohibition created by section 1101, subdivision (b).\u201d].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Because the trial court allowed evidence of Walker\u2019s prior sexual assaults under both sections 1101, subdivision (b), and 1108, we can find error in its admission only if the testimony was inadmissible under both sections. (See <em>People v. Branch </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 274, 280-281 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 870].) However, even if the evidence of Walker\u2019s other crimes was properly admitted, the propriety of the court\u2019s instructions concerning the purposes for which that evidence could be considered\u2014and, in particular, whether it was error to instruct the jury that it could consider the evidence as proof of Walker\u2019s criminal disposition\u2014necessarily depends on whether the evidence was admissible under section 1101 or section 1108 or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">3. <em>Walker Was Not Accused of a \u201cSexual Offense\u201d Within the Meaning of Section 1108</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Section 1108 permits the trier of fact to consider a defendant\u2019s prior sexual offenses as propensity evidence only in \u201ca criminal action in which the defendant is accused of a sexual offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1108, subd. (a); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 893, 897-900 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 397].) Section 1108, subdivision (d)(1), defines \u201csexual offense\u201d as a crime under the law of a state or of the United States involving either conduct proscribed by a series of enumerated Penal Code sections or nonconsensual sexual contact. It also includes in the definition, in subdivision (d)(1)(E), any crime that involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\u201c[deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury, or physical pain on another person.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In their pretrial motion to permit evidence of Walker\u2019s prior sexual offenses, the People argued that, although murder was not an enumerated offense, section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(E), was applicable in this case because Walker had a history of inflicting bodily injury and physical pain while engaged in sexual encounters with prostitutes or women he perceived to be prostitutes \u201cwith the stated motivation that he \u2018hate[s] fucking whores.\u2019 \u201d The motion papers asserted Walker acted with the same motivation when he murdered Waters. The trial court agreed, \u201cMy initial thought was that since there is no sexual offense charged, under my view of what [a] sexual offense is, that is one of the listed offenses, that I was not going to let [the evidence] in, but it does appear that the definition . . . appears to be broader than what I\u2019ve come ... to believe are sexual offenses, that are things that contain sexual elements in the actual charge. It appears that 1108 (d)(1)(E), expands the definition of sexual offense sufficiently to include the offense that\u2019s charged in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Although murder, standing alone (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)), is not one of the offenses enumerated in section 1108, subdivision (d)(1), there can be no question certain murder charges would qualify as \u201csexual offenses\u201d within the meaning of that provision\u2014for example, a charge of first degree murder alleging special circumstances under Penal Code section 190.2, subdivision (a)(17)(C), (D), (E), (F) and (K) (murder committed while the defendant was engaged in, or accomplice in, commission of, attempted commission of, or immediate flight after committing, or attempting to commit rape, sodomy or other specified sexual crimes). In such a case the defendant is accused of a crime that involves conduct proscribed by section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(A). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at pp. 898-899 [assault with intent to commit rape was a sexual offense within the meaning of \u00a7 1108 prior to amendment to statute to expressly include assaults with the intent to commit specified felonies that require sexual intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>The question presented by the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case, however, is whether section 1108, subdivision (d)(l)(E)\u2019s inclusion in the definition of sexual offense of crimes that involve \u201c[deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury, or physical pain on another person\u201d authorizes use of evidence of other sexual offenses when the circumstances under which a violent crime has been committed suggest the defendant derived sexual pleasure or gratification from the victim\u2019s pain, even though sexual pleasure or gratification is neither a necessary element of the charged offense nor alleged in the information as an enhancement or aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Without directly deciding the point, Division Six of this court in <em>People v. Pierce, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 893 indicated the answer to that question might be yes. In <em>Pierce </em>the defendant was charged with attempted kidnapping and assault with intent to commit rape in violation of Penal Code section 220 after he grabbed a 17-year-old girl walking home alone and attempted to pull her toward a dark area. (104 Cal.App.4th at p. 896.) When questioned by police, Pierce confessed he had attacked the victim and said \u201che was motivated by a sexual impulse\u2014the same impulse he had 20 years earlier with a girl.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>At the time of the offense section 1108 did not contain current subdivision (d)(1)(B), which includes within the definition of \u201csexual offense\u201d a crime involving \u201c[a]ny conduct proscribed by section 220 of the Penal Code, except assault with intent to commit mayhem.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rejecting Pierce\u2019s argument that, absent the specific reference to Penal Code section 220, assault with intent to commit rape was not a sexual offense within the meaning of section 1108, Division Six held such an assault is an aggravated form of attempted rape and thus involves conduct proscribed by the offenses listed in section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(A). Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision overruling Pierce\u2019s objection to evidence of his prior Santa Barbara rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">As an alternate ground for concluding Pierce\u2019s prior sexual offense was properly admitted under section 1108, Division Six held, \u201cPierce also comes within section 1108, subdivision (d) because his offense involves \u2018[a]n attempt... to engage in conduct described in this paragraph.\u2019 [Citation.] The instant offense was committed to derive \u2018sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury or physical pain on another person.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at p. 898.) The court thus held evidence a crime had been committed to derive sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury or physical pain on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>another person was relevant to the determination whether the defendant was accused of a sexual offense within the meaning of section 1108. Yet the court did not conclude Pierce\u2019s admission the crime was \u201cmotivated by a sexual impulse,\u201d by itself, was sufficient to convert an otherwise nonsexual crime (for example, attempted kidnapping) into a \u201csexual offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The analysis in <em>Pierce </em>notwithstanding, the language of section 1108, although by no means definitive, points to a construction of subdivision (d)(1)(E) that limits its application to crimes in which deriving sexual pleasure or gratification through inflicting physical pain is an element of the charge (or applicable enhancement or aggravating factor) and not simply a circumstance of the crime\u2019s commission. Section 1108, subdivision (a), limits the statute\u2019s scope to criminal actions in which the defendant is \u201caccused of a sexual offense\u201d; and subdivision (d)(1) defines \u201csexual offense\u201d to mean a \u201ccrime . . . that involvefs]\u201d certain categories and enumerated types of sexual misconduct. In ordinary usage these terms connote that the requisite sexual transgression must be an element or component of the crime itself without regard to the evidence establishing a specific violation.

The \u201cleast adjudicated elements\u201d test of <em>Castro </em>means that \u201cfrom the elements of the offense alone\u2014without regard to the facts of the particular violation\u2014one can reasonably infer the presence of moral turpitude.\u201d (Pe<em>ople v.

By a parity of reasoning, whether a crime involves deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from inflicting physical pain should also be determined from the elements of the offense alone and not from the evidence establishing a particular violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 903, which upheld the constitutionality of section 1108, further supports our conclusion the section is properly limited to crimes in which sexual misconduct is an element of the charged offense (and of the offenses offered as evidence of the defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit the charged offense). In rejecting a constitutional challenge to the statute, the <em>Falsetta </em>court emphasized the limited scope of section 1108\u2019s authorization for the use of propensity evidence in sexual offenses cases: \u201cHad section 1108 allowed unrestricted admission of defendant\u2019s other \u2018bad acts,\u2019 character, or reputation, his due process argument would be stronger. But on its face, section 1108 is limited to the defendant\u2019s <em>sex offenses, </em>and it applies only when he is charged with committing <em>another sex offense. </em>No far-ranging attacks on the defendant\u2019s character can occur under section 1108.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, </em>at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Finally, this more limited interpretation of section 1108 is reinforced by the section\u2019s legislative history, which establishes the Legislature\u2019s intent to permit the admission of propensity evidence in a specific subset of crimes\u2014 the traditional sexual offenses enumerated in section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(A), such as rape, sexual battery and lewd or lascivious acts, where the outcome of the prosecution frequently turns on determining the relative credibility of victim and defendant: \u201cAs the legislative history indicates, the Legislature\u2019s principal justification for adopting section 1108 was a practical one: By their very nature, sex crimes are usually committed in seclusion without third party witnesses or substantial corroborating evidence. The ensuing trial often presents conflicting versions of the event and requires the trier of fact to make difficult credibility determinations. Section 1108 provides the trier of fact in a sex offense case the opportunity to learn of the defendant\u2019s possible disposition to commit sex crimes.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 915; see <em>id. </em>at p. 912 [\u201cAs a letter by the author of the legislation, contained in the Assembly Journal, states, section 1108 \u2018 \u201cpermits courts to admit such evidence on a common sense basis . . . and permits rational assessment by juries of evidence so admitted. This includes consideration of the other sexual offenses as evidence of the defendant\u2019s disposition to commit such crimes, and for its bearing on the probability or improbability that the defendant has been falsely or mistakenly accused of such an offense.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">This interpretation does not limit sexual offenses to crimes enumerated in section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(A) and (B), and thus render superfluous the other portions of subdivision (d)(1) defining \u201csexual offense.\u201d The definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of sexual offense not only triggers application of section 1108 but also describes those types of uncharged misconduct that can be offered as propensity evidence in a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of a sexual offense. Because evidence of such uncharged sexual offenses may include crimes under the laws of not just California but of any state or the United States, it would be impractical to attempt to identify all covered offenses. Consequently, by including the broader language of section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(C), (D) and (E), the statute encompasses sexual offenses from other jurisdictions that may not have exact counterparts under California law. (See generally <em>Garcia v. McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 476 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906] [discussing \u201crule of statutory interpretation that requires us, if possible, to give effect and significance to every word and phrase of a statute\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Because murder is not one of the sexual offenses enumerated in section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(A) or (B) and the crime with which Walker was charged did not involve as one of its necessary adjudicated elements deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from inflicting death, bodily injury or physical pain on his victim, the trial court erred in allowing the People to introduce evidence of Walker\u2019s three prior sexual attacks on women as evidence of his propensity to commit the charged offense. However, even if we were to agree with the People and conclude the trial court properly interpreted section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(E), to authorize proof of prior sexual assaults when the circumstances under which the charged crime has been committed indicate the defendant derived sexual pleasure or gratification by injuring the victim, the People in this case failed to present any evidence\u2014either at the time of their pretrial motion or at trial\u2014Walker\u2019s murder of Waters was sexually motivated. To be sure, evidence was introduced that Walker said he hated prostitutes and had in the past beaten the victims of his sexual attacks. But, unlike the situation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at page 896, in which the defendant admitted his attack had been motivated by a sexual impulse, here, other than the challenged propensity evidence itself, there was no evidence Walker\u2019s sexual contact with Waters was nonconsensual and similarly no evidence her murder was motivated by Walker\u2019s desire for sexual gratification (as opposed, for example, to impulsive violence linked to rage or humiliation). Thus, even under a broad reading of section 1108, it was error to admit evidence of Walker\u2019s prior sexual assaults to prove his propensity to murder Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">4. <em>Evidence of Walker\u2019s Prior Sexual Assaults on Prostitutes Was Admissible Under Section 1101, Subdivision (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In addition to arguing evidence of Walker\u2019s three prior sexual assaults was admissible under section 1108, the People\u2019s pretrial motion asserted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>evidence was admissible under section 1101, subdivision (b), to prove Walker\u2019s identity as the perpetrator, his criminal intent in beating and choking his victim (as opposed to death resulting from mistake or accident in connection with consensual rough sex) and his \u201ccommon motive of animus against prostitutes resulting in violent batteries interrupting the completion of the sex act . . . .\u201d The trial court agreed, finding the evidence admissible to prove Walker\u2019s identity, motive and intent; it additionally ruled the evidence need not be excluded pursuant to section 352 because it would not be unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">a. <em>Evaluating the admissibility of uncharged misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u201cEvidence of uncharged crimes is admissible to prove identity, common design or plan, or intent only if the charged and uncharged crimes are sufficiently similar to support a rational inference of identity, common design or plan, or intent.\u201d <em>(Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 369.) \u201cThe least degree of similarity (between the uncharged act and the charged offense) is required in order to prove intent.\u201d <em>(Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 402.)

Both victims were drug-addicted prostitutes. Walker engaged in sexual activity with both women before they were assaulted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Both victims were beaten in the face, resulting in significant bruising around the face and eyes, and strangled.

Because Walker was interrupted by law enforcement officers moments after beginning to attack Stephanie L., the fact he did not actually begin a sex act, beat her in the face or strangle her does not significantly reduce the similarities between the two incidents. In addition, the assault on Stephanie L. occurred the night after, and in the same location as, Walker\u2019s rape and assault on Irma P. Although these similarities may not be sufficient to support an inference regarding identity, the trial court plainly did not abuse its discretion in concluding they were sufficient to allow testimony regarding the attack on Stephanie L. on the issues of intent and motive (animus towards prostitutes). (Cf. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1148 [\u201cAlthough the evidence of Kim\u2019s death did not share the distinctive features of the murders charged in the present case, it clearly was relevant on the issues of intent and a common plan.\u201d]; <em>People v.

Dorothy B. was not a prostitute nor was there any evidence Walker believed she was. She was not beaten in the face or choked; and there was no nexus or relationship between the two occurrences to support its admission to demonstrate motive.

Other factors affecting the probative value include the extent to which the source of the evidence is independent of the evidence of the charged offense, the amount of time between the uncharged acts and the charged offense and whether the evidence is \u201cmerely cumulative regarding an issue that was not reasonably subject to dispute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 404-406; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Balcom </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 414, 427 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 666, 867 P.2d 777].) The primary factors affecting the prejudicial effect of uncharged acts are whether the uncharged acts resulted in criminal convictions, thus minimizing the risk the jury would be motivated to punish the defendant for the uncharged offense, and whether the evidence of uncharged acts is stronger or more inflammatory than the evidence of the charged offenses. <em>(Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 405; see also <em>People v.

It validated the evidence and minimized the chance a jury would punish him for the prior offense, for which he had already been punished.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The probative value of the evidence regarding Irma P. was substantial. Walker exclaimed to Irma P. he hated prostitutes; thus the evidence of his rape and beating of her established his motive to brutalize other prostitutes. Because of the similarities in the two crimes discussed <em>ante, </em>that evidence was also relevant to prove Walker\u2019s identity as Waters\u2019s murderer and to establish Walker\u2019s intent was to kill her, as opposed to her death occurring accidentally during an act of prostitution that involved rough sex.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Although the time between the two offenses is significant, more than 20 years, Walker was incarcerated for approximately 11 of those years, thus minimizing the remoteness. The distinctive similarities of the two crimes further offset any prejudice resulting from remoteness. (See <em>People v. Pierce, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th at p. 900 [23-year-old rape conviction when defendant was incarcerated for 12 years was not too remote; \u201c \u2018[substantial similarities between the prior and the charged offenses balance out the remoteness of the prior offenses. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d].) Additionally, the potential for prejudice was minimized because Walker had been convicted of raping Irma P.; and the evidence regarding her beating and rape was less inflammatory than the evidence of Waters\u2019s brutal beating and murder and was thus unlikely to evoke an emotional response from jurors. (Cf. <em>Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1150 [other-crimes murders were not significantly more inflammatory than the charged murders and rapes]; <em>Kipp, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 372 [evidence of uncharged rape and murder was not significantly more inflammatory than charged attempted rape and murder].)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The probative value of the evidence regarding Walker\u2019s sexual attack on Stephanie L. was similar to that of his rape of Irma P. Regarding the potential for prejudice, although Walker was not convicted of any crime as a result of his assault on Stephanie L., this offense was relatively minor in comparison to the viciousness of Waters\u2019s murder. On this record, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in determining the substantial probative value was not outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. <em>(Carter, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>5. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Errors in Admitting Evidence of Walker\u2019s First Sexual Attack and Instructing the Jury Concerning the Proper Use of the Prior Crimes Evidence Were Harmless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">a. <em>The improper admission of evidence of Walker\u2019s assault on Dorothy B. was harmless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Although the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Walker\u2019s assault on Dorothy B. under both section 1101, subdivision (b), and section 1108, subdivision (a), \u201cthe erroneous admission of prior misconduct evidence does not compel reversal unless a result more favorable to the defendant would have been reasonably probable if such evidence were excluded.\u201d <em>(People v.

The properly admitted testimony regarding Walker\u2019s rape and beating of Irma P. and his attack on Stephanie L. provided strong evidence implicating Walker in Waters\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In marked contrast, the improperly received evidence regarding Walker\u2019s assault on Dorothy B. was neither highly probative nor unduly prejudicial to Walker for the same reason it was not admissible: The facts are too dissimilar from Waters\u2019s murder. It is, in short, highly unlikely the evidence had any significant impact on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">b. <em>The erroneous instruction the jury could consider evidence of Walker\u2019s other sexual offenses on the issue of his disposition to commit murder was harmless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Because testimony concerning Walker\u2019s assaults on Irma P. and Stephanie L. was properly before the jury pursuant to section 1101, subdivision (b), the court\u2019s error in also allowing the evidence under section 1108 affects only the purpose for which the jury could consider the evidence (and thus the court\u2019s instructions to the jury), not the admissibility of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>itself.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 186 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664] [trial court erred in instructing jury that evidence admitted pursuant to \u00a7 1101, subd.

As previously discussed, the jury was instructed with CALJIC No. 2.50.01, which informed the jury it could infer from the evidence of Walker\u2019s other offenses he had a disposition to commit sexual offenses and, if he had such a disposition, it could also infer he was likely to commit and did commit the charged offense (murder). Asserting the error was of constitutional dimension and citing <em>Garceau </em>v. <em>Woodford </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 275 F.3d 769, revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom. Woodford v.

Garceau, </em>supra, 6 Cal.4th at page 186, in affirming Robert Garceau\u2019s first degree murder conviction and death sentence for the brutal killing of his girlfriend and her 14-year-old son, the Supreme Court held an improper instruction permitting the jury to consider evidence Garceau had previously murdered one of his drug partners for any purpose, including his propensity to commit murder, was harmless error. In concluding the error did not prejudice Garceau, the court assumed without deciding that the federal harmless-error standard articulated in <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824] (federal constitution^ error requires proof of harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt) was applicable. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mower </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 457, 484 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 326, 49 P.3d 1067] [\u201cIf a trial court\u2019s instructional error violates the United States Constitution, the standard stated in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824] requires the People, in order to avoid reversal of the judgment, to \u2018prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error . . . did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 [Citation.] But if a trial court\u2019s instructional error violates only California law, the standard is that stated in <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], which permits the People to avoid reversal unless \u2018it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].) Even under that more exacting standard, the Supreme Court concluded, the error was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence of Garceau\u2019s guilt.

The district court held Garceau was not entitled to habeas relief on the merits; but the Ninth Circuit reversed in a two-to-one decision, concluding both that the erroneous instruction permitting the jury to consider Garceau\u2019s propensity to commit murder \u201cso offended fundamental conceptions of justice and fair play as to rise to the level of a constitutional violation\u201d <em>(Garceau </em>v. <em>Woodford, supra, </em>275 F.3d at p. 775) and that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201cThe evidence against Garceau was not weighty; in fact, there was no direct physical evidence implicating Garceau and the conviction turned on the testimony of potentially biased witnesses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 777.) \u201cVirtually every single one of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses had some connection to the murder of the [victims] or some other self-interested reason for testifying against Garceau.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 772.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Even under the more exacting <em>Chapman </em>standard,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s erroneous instruction permitting the evidence of Walker\u2019s attacks on Irma P. and Stephanie L. to be considered with respect to his predisposition to commit murder was harmless. Unlike the situation in <em>Garceau, </em>direct physical evidence linked Walker to Waters and supported the conclusion (contrary to his denials) he had engaged in sex with her shortly before her death. The testimony that Walker had raped and beaten Irma P. and sexually attacked Stephanie L., considered for proper, limited purposes, provided additional compelling evidence of Walker\u2019s guilt.
