That prior suit was brought under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (the unfair competition law (UCL))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by an established, Gilroy-based Ford automobile dealership and its president/shareholder (Bob Lynch Ford, Inc., and Scott Lynch, respectively, and hereafter, collectively, Lynch).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After filing a series of demurrers, Paulus ultimately prevailed in the prior suit after the court sustained his demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">In September 2004, Paulus brought this action against Lynch for claims arising out of the prior suit, including a cause of action for malicious prosecution. Lynch brought a special motion to strike Paulus\u2019s complaint under the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After granting the motion, the court awarded Lynch $40,000 and $1,819.96 in attorney fees and costs, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Paulus appeals from these two orders. He claims (among other things) that the motion to strike should have been denied because he presented a prima facie case of malicious prosecution\u2014including showing that Lynch lacked probable cause to bring the prior suit and that Lynch prosecuted it with malice. We conclude that Paulus did not meet his burden under section 425.16 of demonstrating the probability that he would prevail on the merits of any of his claims. Specifically, Paulus did not show that Lynch lacked probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>cause to bring the prior suit\u2014an essential element of a malicious prosecution claim\u2014because (1) malicious prosecution is a disfavored tort that is maintainable only if the underlying suit was one that no reasonable attorney would believe to be objectively tenable, (2) the UCL is a broad statute intended to protect both consumers and competitors against business practices that are unlawful, unfair or fraudulent, and (3) no authority expressly precluded the bringing of Lynch\u2019s UCL claim under the circumstances alleged in the prior suit. In addition, Paulus forfeited any challenge to the granting of the motion to strike his claims for abuse of process and intentional interference with contractual relations; in any event, he made no prima facie showing below in support of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We therefore find no error. Accordingly, we affirm the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion to strike. We also affirm the order awarding attorney fees and costs to Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">I. <em>Prior Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Lynch filed suit against Paulus and others on July 23, 2003. The complaint named the City of Morgan Hill (City) and related City entities and alleged that Lynch was \u201c[a]cting as [an] injured competitor[] and as private attorney[] general\u201d in bringing suit to enforce the UCL. In general, the complaint alleged that Paulus sought to establish a Ford automobile dealership in Morgan Hill on an 8.65-acre site (Dealership); the City Council approved several land-use applications submitted by Paulus for the Dealership; and that approval of the applications violated the Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.), the City\u2019s general plan, and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.). Lynch sought injunctive relief and mandamus to prevent development of the Dealership and to void the land-use-application approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Lynch thereafter filed a first amended complaint. Again alleging that it had brought suit both \u201cas [an] injured competitor[] and ... as private attorney[] general,\u201d Lynch invoked the UCL for alleged violations of Planning and Zoning Law, the City\u2019s general plan, CEQA, and \u201c[section] 1094.5, the statu[t]e requiring written finding[s] for quasi-judicial administrative decisions.\u201d The first amended complaint sought injunctive relief and mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Paulus, City, and related City entities filed jointly a demurrer to the first amended complaint. The demurring defendants argued, inter alia, that (1) Lynch had no legal standing to challenge the City\u2019s approval of the land-use applications for the Dealership, because it was not a \u201cbeneficially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>interested\u201d party as required for administrative mandamus proceedings brought under section 1086 in general and under section 1094.5 in particular; (2) public entities such as the City are immune from potential liability under the UCL; and (3) Paulus\u2019s acts taken in obtaining approval of the land-use applications did not constitute unfair business practices under the UCL. The court rejected the first and third arguments<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the demurring defendants and adopted the second argument; accordingly, it sustained the demurrer of the City and related City entities and otherwise overruled the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Lynch filed a second amended complaint. Lynch again alleged that it had brought the action both as an injured competitor and \u201cfor the interests of the general public as private attomey[] general ... to enforce the [UCL]\u201d for alleged violations of section 1094.5, the Planning and Zoning Law, the City\u2019s general plan, and CEQA. The pleading contained a new allegation that \u201cthe City Council authorized the City Manager to do everything necessary and appropriate to execute a development agreement with the private defendants which development agreement may result in the City paying the private defendants up to $1,225,000.00 of partial sales tax rebates over a period of 10 years,\u201d and that these potential rebates significantly threatened competition between Lynch and Paulus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Paulus, the City, and the related City entities filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint, arguing that (1) the City and its related entities were immune from liability under the UCL; and (2) Lynch failed to allege facts that Paulus had engaged in unfair competition under the UCL by committing unlawful business practices\u2014the allegation was merely that Paulus had performed the <em>lawful </em>act of submitting a development application based upon land-use approvals granted by the City.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court sustained the demurrer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the City and related City entities without leave to amend and sustained Paulus\u2019s demurrer with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Lynch filed a third amended complaint. It contained substantially the same allegations that had appeared in the second amended complaint. The new pleading did allege more specifically that Lynch had brought the action under the UCL to address, among other alleged violations, \u201c[a] discriminatory government subsidy significantly threatening competition.\u201d The third amended complaint also alleged for the first time that Paulus had conspired with, and aided and abetted the \u201cmunicipal defendants\u201d through his submission of the land-use applications and by obtaining the application approvals that Lynch claimed were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Paulus filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint, which Lynch opposed. Paulus argued that Lynch had failed to state a claim under the UCL for unfair competition based upon either alleged unfair or unlawful business acts or practices. The court sustained this demurrer without leave to amend. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court dismissed the action on March 30, 2004, following its order sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Lynch filed a petition for writ of supersedeas and a petition for an emergency stay with this court. We denied both petitions on April 16, 2004 (No. H027269). Lynch sought review by the Supreme Court, which was denied on May 19, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">II. <em>The Present Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">On September 21, 2004, Paulus filed the present action against Lynch. The unverified complaint contained three claims: malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and intentional interference with contractual relations. Paulus alleged that the prior suit was filed by Lynch against Paulus, was concluded in his favor, was brought and prosecuted without probable cause, and was brought and prosecuted by Lynch maliciously. Paulus also alleged that Lynch \u201cmisused the legal system by bringing and prosecuting\u201d the prior suit and that by doing so, Lynch interfered with Paulus\u2019s contract to purchase land to establish the Dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Lynch filed a special motion to strike the complaint under section 425.16. It contended that (1) Paulus\u2019s suit arose out of Lynch\u2019s protected activity (i.e., petitioning the court through the prior suit); (2) Paulus bore the burden under the anti-SLAPP statute of presenting admissible evidence showing a reasonable probability that he would prevail on his claims; (3) the malicious prosecution claim was without merit because Lynch had probable cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>maintaining the prior action; and (4) the abuse of process and interference with contract claims were without merit because they were barred by the litigation privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In his opposition to the motion to strike, Paulus focused on the sufficiency of his malicious prosecution claim. Paulus argued that (1) the prior suit was undeniably terminated in Paulus\u2019s favor, thereby satisfying one malicious prosecution element; (2) the prior suit was founded upon legal theories that were patently without merit and Lynch therefore lacked probable cause in prosecuting the prior suit; (3) Lynch acted with malice in initiating and prosecuting the prior suit; and (4) because the motion to strike was frivolous, Paulus should be awarded attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Paulus filed two declarations with his opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion. Paulus declared that (1) he had sustained damages as a result of the prior suit, including lost profits and expenses associated with delay in completing the transaction in which he acquired the property for the Dealership; (2) Lynch\u2019s Ford dealership in Gilroy was in direct competition with Paulus\u2019s Dealership; (3) an existing automobile dealership may challenge the creation of a new dealership within a 10-mile radius by filing a protest with the New Motor Vehicle Board; (4) Paulus had established the Dealership outside of this 10-mile radius so that it would not be subject to such a protest by Lynch; and (5) he believed that Lynch had brought the prior suit as a subterfuge because it was unable to challenge Paulus\u2019s Dealership through an administrative protest. Attached to his attorney\u2019s declaration were copies of two letters written to Lynch\u2019s counsel requesting that the prior suit be dismissed, along with a copy of one letter in response from Lynch\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">On January 25, 2005, the court heard argument and took the matter under submission. It thereafter granted the motion to strike the complaint. In striking the complaint, the court reasoned that Paulus had failed to meet his burden of showing a probability that he would prevail on his complaint. Specifically, the court held that Paulus had not established by competent evidence that Lynch lacked probable cause and acted with malice in prosecuting the prior action. The court also held that Lynch was entitled to its attorney fees and costs associated with the motion pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Lynch filed a motion for attorney fees and costs, seeking an award of $60,786 in fees and $1,694.96 in costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Paulus filed opposition to the motion, noting that he did not dispute Lynch\u2019s entitlement to an award of attorney fees, but that he objected to a claimed \u201clack of documentation supporting the award.\u201d The court granted Lynch\u2019s motion and awarded it $40,000 in attorney fees and $1,819.96 in costs. Paulus filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders striking the complaint and awarding attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">I. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Paulus raises the following issues in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">1. Whether the trial court erred by granting Lynch\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion because Paulus presented a prima facie case of malicious prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">2. Whether the trial court erred by granting the motion to strike as to Paulus\u2019s abuse of process claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">3. Whether the trial court erred by granting the motion to strike as to Paulus\u2019s intentional interference with contractual relations claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">4. Whether the trial court erred by awarding Lynch attorney fees and costs as the party prevailing on the anti-SLAPP motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">We address each of these claims of error <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">II. <em>Anti-SLAPP Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">A SLAPP suit is \u201ca meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant\u2019s exercise of First Amendment rights. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 809, 815, fn. 2 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 446], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 68 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685] <em>(Equilon).) </em>In other words, a lawsuit that is a SLAPP arises from constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>protected speech or petitioning activity that \u201clacks even minimal merit.\u201d <em>(Navellier v. Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703] <em>(Navellier).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">SLAPP suits may be disposed of summarily by a special motion to strike under section 425.16, commonly known as an \u201canti-SLAPP motion.\u201d The statute provides: \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) As is relevant to this appeal, the statute defines \u201c \u2018act in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue\u2019 \u201d to \u201cinclude[]: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">A motion to strike under section 425.16 is analyzed and resolved by \u201cthe court . . . engaging] in a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant\u2019s burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken \u2018in furtherance of the [defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u2019 as defined in the statute. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u201d <em>(Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 67.) Thus, \u201c[o]nly a cause of action that satisfies <em>both </em>prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning <em>and </em>lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The anti-SLAPP statute, as specified in a 1997 amendment, \u201cshall be construed broadly.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1997, ch. 271, \u00a7 1.) In keeping with this policy, the Supreme Court has rejected a number of arguments deemed to have been unwarranted, narrow constmctions of section 425.16. (See, e.g., <em>Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 728 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 74 P.3d 737] <em>(Jarrow Formulas) </em>[malicious prosecution claim potentially subject to anti-SLAPP statute, rejecting contention that such a construction of section 425.16 would deprive malicious prosecution victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>of a remedy]; <em>Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 66-67 [defendant making anti-SLAPP motion need not demonstrate that plaintiff brought action claimed to be SLAPP with intent of chilling defendant\u2019s exercise of free speech or petition rights]; <em>City of Cotati </em>v. <em>Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 75 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695] [defendant not required to show that action claimed to be SLAPP had actual effect of chilling defendant\u2019s exercise of free speech or petition rights]; <em>Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1109 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564] [antiSLAPP statute does not require defendant to show separately that its constitutionally protected activity \u201cconcem[s] an issue of public significance\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">III. <em>Appellate Review of Order Granting Anti-SLAPP Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">An order granting an anti-SLAPP motion to strike is a proper subject for appeal. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (i); see also <em>Kyle v. Carmon </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 901, 906 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].) We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to strike under section 425.16 by \u201cconducting an independent review of the entire record. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers Title Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 786]; see also <em>Siam </em>v. <em>Kizilbash </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1563, 1569 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 368].)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Thus, our review is conducted in the same manner as the trial court in considering an anti-SLAPP motion. In determining whether the defendant (Lynch) has met its initial burden of establishing that the plaintiff\u2019s (Paulus\u2019s) action arises from protected activity, we consider \u201cthe pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(2); see also <em>City of Cotati </em>v. <em>Cashman, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 79; <em>Navellier, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 89.) The second prong\u2014i.e., whether the plaintiff (Paulus) has shown a probability of prevailing on the merits\u2014is considered under a standard similar to that employed in determining nonsuit, directed verdict or summary judgment motions. <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1010 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625].) \u201c[I]n order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing [citation], the plaintiff need only have \u2018 \u201cstated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] \u2018Put another way, the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Navellier, supra, </em>at pp. 88-89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">As is true with summary judgment motions, the issues in an anti-SLAPP motion are framed by the pleadings. <em>(Church of Scientology v. Wollersheim </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 655 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 620], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 68, fn. 5.) The plaintiff may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>rely solely on its complaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible evidence. <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1010.) In reviewing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the court does not weigh it; rather, it simply determines whether the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of facts necessary to establish its claim at trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We review the court\u2019s order granting Lynch\u2019s motion to strike Paulus\u2019s complaint as a SLAPP suit with the above standard of review in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">IV. <em>The Order Striking Paulus\u2019s Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aen\">A. <em>Paulus\u2019s Malicious Prosecution Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Paulus does not dispute that the malicious prosecution action arose from an \u201cact ... in furtherance of [a] person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u201d within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1); see also <em>id., </em>subd. (e).) He therefore concedes that Lynch met its initial burden of proof in the motion to strike. The burden thus shifted to Paulus to establish that he had a probability of prevailing on his claim. <em>(Equilon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">A malicious prosecution claim requires that the plaintiff \u201cdemonstrate \u2018that the prior action (1) was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his, plaintiff\u2019s, favor [citations]; (2) was brought without probable cause [citations]; and (3) was initiated with malice [citations].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel Co. </em>v. <em>Albert &amp; Oliker </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 863, 871-872 [254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498] <em>(Sheldon Appel), </em>quoting <em>Bertero </em>v. <em>National General Corp. </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 43, 50 [118 Cal.Rptr. 184, 529 P.2d 608].) The parties do not dispute that Lynch\u2019s prior suit terminated in Paulus\u2019s favor. Accordingly, our focus here is upon the second and third elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Paulus contends that the court below erred in finding that he had not met his burden of establishing a prima facie claim of malicious prosecution. He asserts that he presented evidence sufficient to establish that Lynch had prosecuted the prior suit without probable cause and with malice; Paulus having thus met his burden (he argues), the anti-SLAPP motion should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Before addressing these arguments, we must first take a brief detour to set forth basic principles concerning malicious prosecution claims and claims brought under the UCL. These principles are essential for us to properly evaluate Paulus\u2019s contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>1. <em>Malicious prosecution claims generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">It is a long-recognized fact that claims for malicious prosecution are viewed with disfavor due to their potential to exert an \u201cundue \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on the ordinary citizen\u2019s willingness to report criminal conduct or to bring a civil dispute to court.\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 872; but see <em>Casa Herrera, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beydoun </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 336, 349 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 97, 83 P.3d 497] [malicious prosecution claim will not be barred simply because of tort\u2019s disfavored status].) It is for this reason, as our Supreme Court has observed, that \u201cthe elements of the tort have historically been carefully circumscribed [in California] so that litigants with potentially valid claims will not be deterred from bringing their claims to court by the prospect of a subsequent malicious prosecution claim.\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel, supra, </em>at p. 872.) Acknowledging that the flood of litigation in recent years has caused a reassessment of the \u201c \u2018disfavored\u2019 status of the malicious prosecution tort\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>our high court declined the invitation to \u201cabandon or relax the traditional limitations on malicious prosecution recovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 874; see also <em>Wilson v.

Some cases have applied the <em>Cel-Tech </em>test to UCL consumer cases as well. For instance, in <em>Schnall v.

(See also <em>Gregory v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 845, 854 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 389].) Other courts have noted that the court in <em>Cel-Tech, </em>while critical of existing standards for determining unfairness in consumer cases under the UCL, declined to provide a definitive test.

We focus first on the element of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Lynch alleged a UCL claim both on its own behalf as Paulus\u2019s competitor and as a private attorney general. The essence of its claim was that the proposed Dealership was based upon unlawful land-use approvals by the City and, further, that Paulus would receive, in effect, an illegal public subsidy of over $1.2 million to establish and operate the Dealership. Through this public subsidy (Lynch alleged), Paulus would gain an unfair competitive advantage in the marketplace to the detriment of Lynch. The proposed Dealership allegedly threatened both Lynch and competition in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As we discuss <em>post, </em>irrespective of whether Lynch\u2019s UCL claim is evaluated under the \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d prong, it was objectively tenable. Because the prior suit was not one that \u201c <em>'all </em>reasonable lawyers [would] agree totally lack[ed] merit\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jarrow Formulas, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 728, 743, fn. 13), the element of absence of probable cause essential to Paulus\u2019s malicious prosecution claim was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">First, Lynch\u2019s claim, on its face, appeared to have been consistent with the UCL\u2019s broad purpose of \u201cprotecting] both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.\u201d <em>(Kasky v. Nike, Inc., supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 949.) At least superficially, <em>the </em>prior suit alleged that the proposed Dealership threatened competition because the allegedly illegal public subsidy to Paulus would promote an unlevel playing field. Lynch averred that the public would be harmed by development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>of the Dealership because it would have the effect of eliminating Lynch as a competitor; as a result of the allegedly illegal public subsidy, Paulus would be able to significantly undercut Lynch\u2019s prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Second, \u201c[virtually any law or regulation\u2014federal or state, statutory or common law\u2014can serve as [a] predicate for a [Business and Professions Code section] 17200 \u2018unlawful\u2019 violation.\u201d (Stern, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 Practice (The Rutter Group 2006) \u00b6 3:56, p. 3-13.) Thus, examples of UCL claims properly alleging \u201cunlawful\u201d conduct, while not boundless, are seemingly so. As may be relevant here, for instance, violations of environmental statutes may serve as predicates for a UCL claim based on \u201cunlawful\u201d business acts or practices.

Moreover, violations of local ordinances may be \u201cborrowed\u201d to establish a UCL claim based upon \u201cunlawful\u201d acts or practices. <em>(City and County of San Francisco v.

(Cf. <em>Hewlett, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 532 [violation of conditional use permit]; <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 840-841 [allegations that court reporters charged disparate rates for services and that parties charged higher rates were not informed of disparity sufficient to support UCL claim under either the \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d prong].)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Third, \u201c[t]he \u2018unfair\u2019 prong of the UCL [citation] intentionally provides courts with broad discretion to prohibit new schemes to defraud [citation].\u201d (Rushing et al., Matthew Bender Practice Guide: California Unfair Competition and Business Torts (2006) Unfair Competition, \u00a7 2.11 [1], p. 2-32; see also <em>Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Times Mirror Co. </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 735, 740 [162 Cal.Rptr. 543].)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that the challenged practice or act was not previously condemned by statute or case authority presents no impediment to a finding that it is \u201cunfair\u201d under the UCL. (See, e.g., <em>Allied Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Co. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 432, 450-451 [249 Cal.Rptr. 872]; <em>People v. James </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 25, 35-36 [177 Cal.Rptr. 110] <em>(James).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In <em>James, </em>the defendants\u2014a liquor store owner and the proprietor of a towing company\u2014allegedly engaged in unfair practices, namely, towing vehicles parked at the liquor store without adequately warning patrons of the possibility that their vehicles would be towed, and charging excessive towing and related fees. <em>(James, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at pp. 29-31.) The appellate court specifically rejected the store owner\u2019s contention that he could not be held liable for unfair business practices under the UCL because no court had previously denounced the specific practices at issue: \u201cWhen we apply the principles enunciated in <em>Barquis[, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 94, 101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817] to the instant case, the business practices which defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>were shown to be engaged in were manifestly \u2018unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent.\u2019 Vehicles were hoisted or towed away without sufficient warning; drivers were subjected to payment of fees to have their cars \u2018let-down\u2019 in the parking lot; they were coerced into paying either by physical intimidation or misrepresentation concerning the existence of liens or other rights of the tower; they were charged unconscionable fees to retrieve their vehicles from hoisting and impoundment; and they were forced to waive claims for damage to their property in order to get it back. There was also evidence that [defendant store owner] participated in these practices by authorizing the impounds and taking kickbacks on fees. The fact that defendants\u2019 scheme had never been dealt with by the appellate court does not render it any less fundamentally dishonest, unfair, or unlawful. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 35-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Here, Paulus\u2019s contention that Lynch lacked probable cause to bring the underlying UCL suit implies the argument specifically rejected in <em>Allied Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Co., supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 432, and <em>James, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d 25: That, because the alleged conduct of acting on illegally approved land-use applications and accepting improper public subsidies had never been declared \u201cunfair\u201d under the UCL by any court, it was therefore a legally untenable claim under the UCL. We reject that implicit contention. Further, while we cannot say definitively that the alleged conduct challenged in the prior suit was \u201cunfair\u201d under the UCL, we cannot conclude that no reasonable attorney\u2014utilizing any of the various tests for \u201cunfairness\u201d (see pt. IV.A.2, ante)\u2014would reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Fourth, no cases have held that matters of the nature alleged by Lynch in the prior suit cannot as a matter of law serve as a basis for a UCL claim. We find this fact to be also relevant on the question of whether the prior suit was objectively tenable. Paulus argues that, to the contrary, <em>Saad v. City of Berkeley </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1206 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 95] <em>(Saad), </em>is direct authority that Lynch\u2019s UCL claim was not maintainable. That case did hold that administrative mandamus \u201cunder . . . section 1094.5 is the exclusive remedy for judicial review of the quasi-adjudicatory administrative action of local level agencies,\u201d such as action on a land-use permit or variance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1211.) But <em>Saad </em>concerned a direct challenge by the permittee to municipal action. It did not involve a claim by a third party alleging that it was adversely affected by a municipality granting allegedly illegal land-use applications. And the plaintiff in <em>Saad </em>did not allege that any actions taken constituted a violation of the UCL. Accordingly, we disagree with Paulus that <em>Saad </em>precluded an action under the UCL of the kind filed by Lynch.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>In evaluating the probable cause element in a malicious prosecution claim, we are mindful that we must render \u201ca sensitive evaluation of legal principles and precedents\u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 875), and we \u201cmust properly take into account the evolutionary potential of legal principles.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 886.) Because of (1) the disfavored status of malicious prosecution claims, (2) the \u201crather lenient standard\u201d of probable cause <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 817), (3) the broad scope of the UCL, and (4) the UCL\u2019s intended purpose of addressing, among other things, unfair conduct that \u201cmay run the gamut of human ingenuity and chicanery\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co. of Cal., supra, </em>201 Cal.App.2d at p. 772), we conclude that Paulus failed to make a prima facie showing that Lynch\u2019s UCL claim (under either the \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d prongs) lacked probable cause.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In light of our conclusion that Paulus did not make a prima facie showing that the prior suit lacked probable cause, we hold that the trial court properly granted Lynch\u2019s special motion to strike the malicious prosecution claim under section 425.16.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">B. <em>Abuse of Process and Intentional Interference with Contract Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Paulus offered no opposition below to Lynch\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion to strike the claims for abuse of process and for intentional interference with contractual relations. The court therefore granted the motion to strike as to those causes of action, noting that Paulus made \u201cno independent factual or legal arguments regarding the strength of these claims.\u201d Similarly, Paulus did not argue in his opening brief that the court erred in striking the abuse of process and interference with contract claims. The opening brief says nothing about these claims beyond the conclusory statement in its penultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>sentence: \u201cPaulus has met his burden to show a prima [facie] case for malicious prosecution, abuse of process and intentional interference with contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We deem Paulus to have abandoned any challenge to the order striking these two claims because of his failure to address the matter in his opening brief. Courts will ordinarily treat the appellant\u2019s failure to raise an issue in his or her opening brief as a waiver of that challenge. <em>(Tisher v. California Horse Racing Bd. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 349, 361 [282 Cal.Rptr. 330].) Paulus\u2019s conclusory statement at the end of his opening brief does not preserve the issue for appeal. (See <em>Osornio v. Weingarten </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 304, 316, fn. 7 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 246]: \u201c \u2018Issues do not have a life of their own: if they are not raised or supported by argument or citation to authority, we consider the issues waived.\u2019 \u201d) And Paulus\u2019s belated attempt to address the abuse of process and interference with contract claims in his reply brief\u2014after the respondents\u2019 brief noted his failure to address the striking of these claims\u2014 did not salvage these abandoned issues. <em>(Shade Foods, Inc. v.

An appellate court reviews the amount of mandatory attorney fees awarded by the trial court to a defendant who successfully brings an anti-SLAPP motion for abuse of discretion. <em>(Dowling v.

Likewise, the interference with contract claim appears barred by the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b). <em>(Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 1187, 1202-1203 [litigation privilege rendered the defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cabsolutely immune from civil tort liability, including plaintiff\u2019s interference with contract and related claims\u201d]; see also <em>Rusheen </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 516, 128 P.3d 713].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> Paulus\u2019s record designation did not include the reporter\u2019s transcript from the hearing on that motion for attorney fees. Accordingly, the record on appeal does not include this transcript. (See <em>Maria P. v. Riles </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1295-1296 [240 Cal.Rptr. 872, 743 P.2d 932] [burden on party challenging attorney fee award to provide adequate record on appeal in order to assess claim of error].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> Paulus argues in his reply brief\u2014based on the assumption that the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion must be reversed as to the malicious prosecution claim\u2014that the attorney fee award should be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court to assess the amount of fees incurred by Lynch solely in connection with moving to strike the abuse of process and interference with contract claims. Because we have concluded that the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion should be affirmed as to all three causes of action of Paulus\u2019s complaint, we obviously reject this untimely contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
