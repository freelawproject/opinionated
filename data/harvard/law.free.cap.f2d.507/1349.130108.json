He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>asserts that the jury was improperly instructed on the definition of \u201cextortion.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rejecting this and other assignments of error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Price at all relevant times was Chairman of the Charleston (South Carolina) County Council. In late November 1973 the Royal Scotsman Inn Corporation was nearing completion of construction of a motel in Charleston County. Utilization of module construction, however, caused certain building code deficiencies, resulting in refusal of a certificate of final inspection and prompt issuance of an occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">Harris, a Scotsman executive, sought immediately to resolve the occupancy permit problem. A series of meetings and conversations during the next week among Harris, Price, and Balliet, the co-conspirator, culminated in the payment by Scotsman (through Harris) of $12,000 in cash<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Price in exchange for the latter\u2019s assurance that the motel would obtain its occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">Price asserts that since he, as County Council Chairman, had no <em>de jure </em>power to issue the occupancy permit the money was not obtained \u201cunder color of official right.\u201d After instructing the jury that \u201cunder color of official right\u201d was a \u201cwrongful taking by a public officer of money not due him, or his office,\u201d the trial court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-7\">[I]t is not necessary [for conviction] that you conclude that the defendant could in fact assure the issuance of an occupancy permit .... The issue . is not whether the defendant had the power to withhold the permit, but whether it was reasonable for [Scotsman to believe] that he . had such power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">Transcript at 850 \u2014 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">We hold the foregoing a correct instruction under \u00a7 1951\u2019s definition of extortion, United States v. Emalfarb, 484 F.2d 787, 789 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1064, 94 S,Ct. 571, 38 L.Ed.2d 469 (1973), and that it fully applied here, where the victim\u2019s belief was predicated upon the appellant\u2019s assertion of <em>de facto </em>power over the issuance of the permit. Price told Harris before the money was exchanged that (1) there were several county employees \u201changing by a thread\u201d whose jobs would be terminated if they didn\u2019t obey appellant; (2) if Harris had asked appellant for help earlier there would have been no problems; (3) if Scotsman were to build another motel in the area, Harris should come to appellant to get \u201ceverything taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-14\">We reject Price\u2019s contention that guilt may be predicated only upon a further finding that he perverted the <em>legal </em>or <em>statutory </em>power <em>(de </em>jure) of his public office. It is enough that he appeared to act under \u00a7 1951(b)(2)\u2019s \u201ccolor of official right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-15\">Further, we view the conviction as supportable alternatively under the \u00a7 1951(b)(2) definition of extortion relating to obtaining money with consent \u201cinduced by . fear,\u201d on which the jury was also instructed. There is ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Scotsman\u2019s fear of financial injury<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was both reasonable and substantial. Having been refused an occupancy permit, Scotsman faced monetary loss from both the possibility of substantial reconstruction and the concomitant delay in commencing operations. That the appellant\u2019s corrupt offer played upon this apprehension was certainly inferable, if not obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-18\">Accordingly, the judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">. Defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-10\">The term \u201cextortion\u201d means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">. What was thought by appellant to be a clandestine transaction in a warehouse ended with an on-the-scene arrest by the FBI, who had been contacted by Harris.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1438-20\">. Fear of economic loss is included within the Hobbs Act. <em>E. g., </em>United States v.

Pranno, 385 F.2d 387 (7th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 944, 88 S.Ct. 1028, 19 L.Ed.2d 1132 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
