Real, United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b407-17\">REAL, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">This appeal brings before this Court what is, perhaps, a classic example of the various inadequacies of a Federal Court\u2019s diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-19\">Defendant-appellant, Sterling-Salem Corporation (hereafter Sterling) appeals from a judgment rendered by the District Court on behalf of plaintiff-respondent C. R. Fedrick, Inc. (hereafter Fedrick) on a claim arising out of a purported breach of contract in which Sterling was to supply certain equipment for a construction job at Incline Village, Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-20\">Fedrick\u2019s trial theory and the basis upon which the trial court made its findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered judgment against Sterling in the sum of $56,882.95 is grounded in promissory estoppel (Restatement of the Law of Contracts, Section 90).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-21\">Sterling, an Ohio corporation, duly authorized to conduct business in California, is engaged \u2014 through its division Topeo \u2014 in the manufacture and sale of sewage pumping equipment, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>prefabricated sewage stations. In mid-1969, Topeo orally authorized one Marvin Derfler (hereafter Derfler) to act as its independent commission agent in the California area; and Derfler was so employed in the Fall of 1969 when the events now in controversy arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Fedrick is a licensed contractor in the State of California. In August, 1969, when the Incline Village General Improvements District (hereafter District) invited bids for the construction of certain sewage pump stations at Incline Village, Nevada, Fedrick \u2014 in response to said invitation and in order to meet the scheduled bid opening on September 4, 1969 \u2014 solicited price quotations on the equipment necessary for the construction of these sewage pumping stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Chas. Lowe Company (hereafter Lowe), a supplier of pumps and other construction equipment, contacted Fed-rick for the purpose of quoting prices on the equipment for what was then known as Sewage Pumping Stations Nos. 7, 8 and 9 of the District\u2019s planned Incline Village project.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Sharing office space with Lowe, but having no other connection with it,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Derfler, together with Jay Gwinn, a Lowe employee, obtained price quotations from Topeo on the equipment needed for Pumping Stations 7 and 9. Der-fler having informed Topeo that its customer in this instance was Lowe, Topeo, in the absence of Derfler, responded with price quotations to Lowe on Pumping Stations 7 and 9, at bids of $11,329.-00 and $6,115.00 respectively, for a total of $17,444.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Upon reviewing this quotation, Lowe, through its employee, Herb Roedel, then submitted a quotation to Fedrick for $45,900.00 \u2014 $21,700.00 for Station 7, $16,200.00 for Station 8, and $8,000.00' for Station 9. The variances are not totally accounted for in the evidence before the trial court. However, the difference in the Topco\u2019s quotations for Stations 7 and 9 and Lowe\u2019s quotation to Fedrick for Stations 7 and 9 is at least partially accounted for by Topco\u2019s arrangement with Derfler by which the would customarily add an amount to Topco\u2019s bid to represent his commission compensation when he in turn quoted his own bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">An additional portion of the difference between the oral quotation to Top-co\u2019s customer and its subsequent written breakdown may be attributed to Topco\u2019s correction of its obvious failure to include in its quotation to Derfler and Lowe a rotor necessary for one of the pumping stations. Derfler, however, had previously noticed the error and corrected it before submission of the bid by Lowe to Fedrick. The quotation by Topeo to Derfler was then adjusted to reflect this correction, thereby changing the price of the two stations to $21,944.-00 in lieu of the original $17,444.00 bid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">Fedrick, utilizing the quotation received from Lowe, submitted its bid to the District, with all the foregoing occurring on September 4, 1969. As required by the District\u2019s bidding procedures, the bid stated that Lowe was the supplier and Topeo<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the manufacturer of the equipment to be used on Stations 7 and 9. Equipment for Pump Station 8 was listed as supplied by Coast Pump Company and manufactured by Allis Chal-mers.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">On September 16, 1969, Fedrick executed a prime contract with the District for construction of the project, while October 29, 1969, found Fedrick directing its printed form of Purchase Order Agreement to \u201cTopeo in care of Lowe.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>This mailing was done in apparent compliance with Fedrick\u2019s common practice of addressing its purchase orders to the manufacturer of the equipment and not to the supplier. Although the evidence is far from clear, the trial court found that this purchase order eventually was mailed to Lowe\u2019s San Pedro office from its Emeryville office but never forwarded to Topeo in Ohio. Topco\u2019s Ohio office was never advised of the receipt of the purchase order in San Pedro, and the purchase order was never signed or otherwise accepted by an employee of Topeo. In addition, Lowe had never advised Topeo that it had in any way accepted Topco\u2019s price quotation for Stations 7 and 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASX\">Two or three weeks after the bid date Derfler and Roedel, Lowe\u2019s employee, met with a representative of Fedrick to deliver a Topeo Pumping Station Catalogue. Thereafter, as is customary, Topeo, through Derfler, made submittals<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to Fedrick and the District upon the equipment which it had quoted to Lowe. During the period for which these submittals were under consideration by the District, Topeo and Fedrick came to an impasse as to ability of the equipment which Topeo has offered to meet the requirements of the District. The disputes were never resolved; and on March 11, 1970, Topeo, by letter, in effect withdrew itself from consideration regarding its providing of Stations 7 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Fedrick then obtained Stations 7 and 9 elsewhere at a higher cost than that quoted by Topeo on September 4, 1969. This suit solely against Sterling followed, and damages were founded on the delay in and additional cost of the completion of the District project by Fed-rick.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">As to Sterling\u2019s liability,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the District Court\u2019s judgment on behalf of Fedrick can withstand this appeal if (a) the trial court\u2019s findings concerning agency relationship between Topeo and Lowe are not clearly erroneous, i. e., are adequately supported by the record, or (b) Topeo is estopped by force of the Restatement of Contracts, Section 90 (Revised) from denying a contractual relationship between Topeo and Fedrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">The record does not seem to support the trial court\u2019s finding of an agency relationship between Topeo and Lowe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The evidence, it appears, fis to the contrary since both Derfler and Lowe disclaimed any agency relationship. There is no evidence to the effect that Fedrick ever believed that it was dealing directly with Topeo by means of any agency with Lowe. For all that Fedrick knew, Lowe could have previously purchased the equipment from Topeo and then had it in stock for its own account. The judgment of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Court, therefore, cannot stand on this theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As an alternative, Fedrick asks this court to affirm on the Restatement of Contracts Section 90 (Revised) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201cA promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forebearance on the part of the promisee or <em>a third person </em>and which does induce such action or fore-bearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice re-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9y\">quires.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">This revised Section 90 extends to third parties the benefits that erstwhile Section 90 created solely between promisor and promisee. It brings to this court, as a matter of first impression, the application of this <em>revised </em>Section 90 to price quotations by manufacturers to general contractors. That this court should not make this extension is compelled by the facts here and, further, by a consideration of the consequences of such application to like situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">To apply Revised Section 90 here, we need address ourselves to the various elements involved in price quotation situations. Hence, there must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">1. A manufacturer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">2. An intermediary, for our purposes, independent of the manufacturer, i. e., not an agent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">3. Reasonable expectation that a <em>particular </em>third party will rely upon the manufacturer\u2019s promise <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">4. Identity of the terms of the promise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">Fedrick clearly cannot meet these requirements. Although the first two elements appear present in light of the evidence introduced in this ease, the record cannot support a finding of elements 3 and 4: (a) Topeo was dealing with Lowe as <em>its </em>customer and (b) the price quoted by Topeo to Lowe and the price quoted by Lowe to Fedrick are manifestly dichotomous.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">Section 90 (Revised) can, if interpreted in any other manner, give further concern in these situations. Under the provision of former Section 90, the possible defenses, if any, were clearly drawn between the promisor and prom-isee. Here, defenses that Topeo may have asserted against Lowe cannot be determined in a trial only between Topeo and Fedrick; nor can any defenses that Lowe may have vis-a-vis Fedrick be the subject of an inquiry by the District Court in a trial between Fedrick and Topeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">Fedrick\u2019s suggestion of the applicability of Section 90 (Revised) would turn manufacturers price listing literally on its head. An application of Fedrick\u2019s proposed interpretation of Section 90 (Revised) would import that no manufacturer could issue a price list to an independent dealer without the fear that some day (unbeknownst to him) the manufacturer might be called upon to answer to a third party for an independent dealer\u2019s price quotation to that third party, even though the price list may bear the legend in boldest possible type that \u201cprices are subject to change without notice.\u201d So, too, manufacturers may be called upon, in a litigative posture, to answer for contractual terms that may differ vastly from those originally consummated between the manufacturer and the independent dealer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">Finally, it appears, that the \u201cjustice\u201d requirement of contract law and promissory estoppel can best be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>where all parties are brought to answer for their own promises in the Superior Court of San Mateo County where this litigation properly belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">While we have reservations on the question of damages as awarded by the trial court, we need not now concern ourselves with a detailed analysis of the evidence on damages in light of our current disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">. For the record, the exact, relationship between Derfler and Lowe is uncertain. Derfler had evidently, on some occasions prior to this transaction, quoted unsuccessfully to Lowe for the sale of the equipment lie represented, but. both Lowe and Derfler disclaimed any agency relationship between them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-15\">. AVliat the quotation by Derfler to Lowe was is not indicated by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-17\">. ICedrick\u2019s bid inadvertently transmogrified \u201cTopeo\u201d into \u201cTocpo\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-5\">. Topeo was in no way involved in the equipment for Station 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">. Submittals contain information concerning operations, design and capacity, etc., n ces-sary to meet the specifications set forth in construction plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. Fedrick filed suit upon an identical claim solely against Lowe in the Superior Court of San Mateo County. That court, having the ability to obtain jurisdiction over botli Sterling and Lowe, could have comp-tently disposed of this entire litigation, thereby giving to each party the opportunity to present its individual claims and defenses in order to accomplisli complete justice among all the parties to these transactions. The unsatisfactory results accomplished in this litigation are essentially due to the inability of the court to reach all of the ramifications of price quotation procedures and the attendant liability which may be visited upon the participating parties. Just one of the typical questions involved herein is the suggestion in the evidence that Lowe\u2019s quotation to Fed-rick was an all or nothing situation. There are innumerable others. Counsel for plaintiff never did answer this Court\u2019s inquiry as to why he had not proceeded in the state court action to a resolution of all the issues. This suit simply represents another in the continuing problems facing Federal Courts in the exercise of their diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\">. We say agency in light of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact 1.6 that \u201cDerfler appointed Lowe to communicate Topco\u2019s offer to general contractors\u201d and conclusion of law 2.1 that \u201cTopeo authorized Lowe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\">.

In this case, among other tilings, the delivery terms quoted to Lowe were different than those quoted to Fedrick by Lowe. It would seem that Section 90 (Revised) should, if at all, only be applicable to third persons in complete privity with the terms of the promise made by the promisor and whose conduct of reliance is in answer to the <em>terms of the promise.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b411-6\">MERRILL, Circuit Judge, with whom BROWNING, Circuit Judge, joins,</author>\n<p id=\"A52\">concurring :</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">I concur in Judge Real\u2019s opinion for additional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">California law controls this diversity case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The California courts have recognized the principles of the original section 90 in holding that when a contractor (promisee), in submitting a construction bid, relies upon the offer of a subcontractor (promisor) to perform part of the work, that reliance makes the subcontractor\u2019s offer irrevocable, <em>see </em>Drennan v. Star Paving Co., 51 Cal.2d 409, 333 P.2d 757 (1958), at least for a reasonable time, <em>see </em>H. W. Stanfield Co. v. Robert McMullan &amp; Son, Inc., 14 Cal.App.3d 848, 92 Cal.Rptr. 669 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">So far, however, the California courts have been cautious in applying the principle of section 90 to third party beneficiaries. Where third parties have been permitted to assert rights flowing from a promise, the third party has been either an alter ego of the promisee, <em>see </em>Aronowicz v. Nalley\u2019s, Inc., 30 Cal.App.3d 27, 106 Cal.Rptr. 424 (1973), or the recipient of substantially the same promise as was made by the promisor with knowledge that the promisee would pass the promise along to a third party. <em>See </em>Burgess v. California Mut. Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, 210 Cal. 180, 186-187, 189, 290 P. 1029, 1031, 1032 (1930); Peterson Tractor Co. v. Orlando\u2019s Snack-Mobile Corp., 270 Cal.App.2d 787, 790-791, 76 Cal.Rptr. 221, 224 (1969). Moreover, in applying the principles of revised section 90 and extending the rules of promissory estoppel to third parties the California courts in my judgment would construe the revised section in a way consistent with analogous rules applicable to contracts for ordinary consideration. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 1559 (West 1954); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 135, 147 (Tent. Draft No. 3, 1967), 133 (Tent.Draft No. 4, 1968). Thus I believe that they would hold that only when a promisor knows that a third party may reasonably rely on his offer, and only when the third party so relies, may the third party enforce the promise, other requisites being satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">In limiting the beneficiaries who may enforce a promise, California courts in my view would require that the promisor intend his offer to reach the third party without undergoing change en route; that it must be the offer of the promisor and not some intervening elaboration or modification on which the third party relies. If the promise has, with the promisor\u2019s knowledge, prompted the promisee to make his own more comprehensive or simply different promise to the third party, the third party could not claim to be entitled to enforce the promisor\u2019s offer. <em>Cf. </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 133, comment e &amp; illus. 16, 18 (Tent.Draft No. 4, 1968). Courts of California have so held in the case of contracts supported by ordinary consideration. <em>See </em>Southern California Acoustics Co. v. C. V. Holder, Inc., 71 Cal.2d 719, 727-728, 79 Cal.Rptr. 319, 326, 456 P.2d 975, 982 (1969); Neptune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Gunite Co. v. Monroe Enterprises, Inc., 229 Cal.App.2d 439, 40 Cal.Rptr. 367 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Whatever the result might be had Topeo known in making its offer to Lowe that Lowe would merely repeat the offer to a contractor without offering to perform other duties and without changing the terms of Topco\u2019s offer, this is not such a case. Here Topeo had no reason to believe that Lowe would submit an offer identical to that made by Topeo. In fact Lowe not only changed the terms on which equipment for stations 7 and 9 was offered but also bid on an additional pumping station.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Topeo, then, did not intend or reasonably expect that Fedrick would rely on the promise Topeo made to Lowe. Accordingly, in my judgment, California would not extend the promissory estop-pel principles of section 90 to Fedrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">As Judge Real has indicated, this does not necessarily leave Fedrick without remedy. Assuming promises enforceable by the promisee under section 90 to have been made, Fedrick may well have a claim against Lowe and Lowe may well have a claim against Topeo, with the extent of recovery by Fedrick and Lowe depending on the specifics of the promises made to them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\">. The result would be the same should California, faced with a choice of law problem, choose to apply the law of Nevada, where performance of the promise to supply equipment would make itself felt. Nevada law is consistent with that of California on the general scope of the original Section 90, <em>see </em>American Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Stanton-Cu-dahy Lumber Co., 85 Nev. 350, 455 P.2d 39 (1969), and permits a third party, intended by a promisor to be a beneficiary of an offer, to recover from the promisor, <em>see </em>Lear v. Bishop, 86 Nev. 709, 476 P.2d 18 (1970). The Nevada courts would accord weight to California decisions in areas where Nevada law is yet unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
