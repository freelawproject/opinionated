A.B.L.E. filed an amended complaint on August 15, 1972, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against Sheriff Fair, who is responsible for the Jail\u2019s operation, and the three Allen County Commissioners, who are responsible for the Jail\u2019s equipment, structure, and staff. Appellants denied that the Jail\u2019s conditions violated the inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, but after extensive discovery they consented to an order running against \u201cDefendants Fair, Shafer, Townsend, and Thompson, their agents, employees, assigns, successors in office and all those in active concert and participation therewith.\u201d 376 F.Supp. 483 (N.D.Ohio 1973). The consent order covered several aspects of the Jail\u2019s operation, including ventilation, mail censorship, commissary privileges, visiting hours and facilities, jail population, plumbing, inmates\u2019 personal items, counseling and medical services, and a classification system. The parties could not agree on the need for additional surveillance measures, and this issue was tried to the Court. After a hearing, the District Court found the present surveillance inadequate and ordered Appellants to install an electronic surveillance system or to hire more guards. A second consent order followed, requiring Appellants to allow inmates awaiting trial a reasonable number of local telephone calls and to hold a due process hearing before an inmate could be placed in solitary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">On July 24, 1973, A.B.L.E. filed a request for attorney fees, attaching an affidavit detailing the time spent on the case. Appellants did not file an opposing memorandum. The District Court entered an order which awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>A.B.L.E. $2,000 in attorney fees for 134 hours of work. The award was \u201ctaxed as costs against both defendant Sheriff Fair and defendant Allen County.\u201d Appellants object to this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">There are two basic questions before us: whether an equitable basis exists for an attorney fees\u2019 award to A.B.L.E., and against whom and in what manner an award may be assessed. Because of the increasing frequency of cases such as this, we feel it necessary to treat these issues fully, so as to resolve confusion and to set forth the proper considerations for district courts to take into account in deciding whether and in what manner to assess attorney fees against local defendants in suits to enforce civil rights under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The first issue is whether an equitable basis exists for an attorney fees\u2019 award, leaving aside the question of who should pay the assessment. There are two elements to this problem: \u25a0 whether this case lies within an exception to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d against awards of attorney fees and whether A.B.L.E. is a proper recipient of an attorney fees\u2019 award, notwithstanding its partial public subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d is that \u201cattorney\u2019s fees are not ordinarily recoverable in the absence \u00f3f a statute or enforceable contract providing therefor.\u201d Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714, 717, 87 S.Ct. 1404, 1407, 18 L.Ed.2d 475 (1967). This general rule was recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, in the context of ordinary commercial litigation. F. D. Rich Co., Inc. v. Industrial Lumber Co., Inc., 417 U.S. 116, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Persons who -have vindicated public interests through \u00a7 1983 litigation, however, have been awarded attorney fees under several exceptions to the general rule, all of which rest on the traditional equitable powers of the federal courts to shift litigation expenses from one party to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">One exception is that \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded to a successful par-. ty when his opponent has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>F. D. Rich Co., Inc., </em>417 U.S. at 129, 94 S.Ct. at 2165. <em>See </em>Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U.S. 527, 530-531, 82 S.Ct. 997, 8 L.Ed.2d 88 (1962); Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402 n. 4, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968); Milburn v. Huecker, 500 F.2d 1279, 1282 (6th C.ir. 1974); Gates v. Collier, 489 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1973); Sims v. Amos, 340 F.Supp. 691, 694 (M.D.Ala.), aff\u2019d, 409 U.S. 942, 93 S.Ct. 290, 34 L.Ed.2d 215 (1972); Mc-Enteggart v. Cataldo, 451 F.2d 1109, 1112 (1st Cir. 1971). The basis for a \u201cbad faith\u201d award is punitive, as it serves to deter and punish unwarranted personal conduct, both before and during litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">A second exception is that a successful party will be reimbursed for his legal fees when his litigation confers \u201ca substantial benefit on the members of an ascertainable class, and where the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit makes possible an award that will operate to spread the costs proportionately among [the members of the class].\u201d Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 393-394, 90 S.Ct. 616, 626, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970). <em>See </em>Sprague v. Ticonic Nat. Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939); Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973); Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527, 26 L.Ed. 1157 (1882); Milburn v. Huecker, 500 F.2d 1279, 1282 (6th Cir. 1974). The rationale for the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d exception is the desire to spread litigation costs among all who benefit from litigation undertaken by only a few.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">A third exception, which has recently become well established, is that one party may be ordered to pay the legal fees of another who has acted as a \u201cprivate attorney general.\u201d When private litigants vindicate a strong public policy and provide widespread public benefit through their efforts, attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>fees should be paid by the adverse party. <em>See </em>Taylor v. Perini, 503 F.2d 899 (6th Cir. 1974); Bradley v. School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006 n. 25, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), rev\u2019g, 472 F.2d 318, 330-331 (4th Cir. 1972); Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968); Wilderness Society v. Morton, 495 F.2d 1026 (D.C.Cir. 1974) <em>(en </em>banc) cert. granted, -U.S.-, 95 S.Ct. 39, 42 L.Ed.2d 47 (Oct. 15, 1974) ; Natural Resources Council v. Environmental Protection Agency, 484 F.2d 1331, 1333 (1st Cir. 1973); Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 353 F.Supp. 1219 (C.D.Cal.1973); Knight v. Auciello, 453 F.2d 852 (1st Cir. 1972) ; Cooper v. Allen, 467 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1972); N.A.A.C.P. v. Allen, 340 F.Supp. 703, 710 (M.D.Ala.1972); La Raza Unida v. Volpe, 57 F.R.D. 94, 98 (N.D.Cal.1972); Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., 444 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rationale for the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d exception is that worthy claimants should not be discouraged from asserting rights embodying important public interests because of a lack of financial resources. Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. 964; Stolberg v. Trustees for State Colleges, 474 F.2d 485, 489-491 (2d Cir. 1973). Since someone must bear the cost of litigation, it is better that the adverse party do so, even though he may not have acted in bad faith. Otherwise, the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d would be penalized by the significant cost of litigation for furthering important public interests through his individual suit. Without reimbursement for attorney fees, private litigants often could not protect the rights the law grants them. There should be no price tag on the enjoyment of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. See Sims v. Amos, 340 F.Supp. 691, 694 (M.D.Ala.), aff\u2019d, 409 U.S. 942, 93 S.Ct. 290, 34 L.Ed.2d 215 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">No finding of bad faith is before us. Rather, the District Court seems to have grounded the award on the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d and \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d exceptions. Although we have doubts about the precise applicability of the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d rationale,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we agree that an equitable basis exists for an award. As the District Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0j\">The Court concludes that the interests of justice require the award to plaintiffs of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for services of <em>Able </em>connected with this case. Plaintiffs, through their suit, have sought to redress the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights of all inmates in the Allen County Jail. Although there has been no finding of liability on the part of the defendants because the parties agreed to an order of the Court disposing of most of the contested matters, plaintiffs have nonetheless substantially benefited all inmates of the Allen County Jail by insuring the protection of numerous constitutional rights through the orders of this Court affecting the Allen County Jail filed in connection with this case. The litigation at issue has not only benefited the present inmates of the jail but also all future inmates of the facility. Since all members of the general public in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Allen County and all other persons subject to the jurisdiction of the Allen County courts and law enforcement agencies are potential subjects for incarceration in the Allen County Jail, the constitutional rights of the general public have been vindicated and protected by the litigation of these plaintiffs. The Court, therefore, believes that this is a proper case for the award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The award of attorney\u2019s fees in cases like this one assures that the vindication of public constitutional rights need not depend upon the financial resources of the particular individuals who seek to secure those rights. <em>Able </em>has performed an important public service for those who are, or ever will be, confined in the Allen County Jail and the public which has benefited thereby should bear the financial responsibility for the litigation securing constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">This reasoning supports an award under the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d rationale, since Appellees\u2019 litigation served the public interest by vindicating the strong public policies favoring the protection of constitutional rights. We uphold the propriety of an award on this ground. Indeed, in the circumstances of this case the award is better described as \u201cpart of the effective remedy a court should fashion to encourage public-minded suits, . . . and to carry out congressional policy.\u201d Sims v. Amos, 340 F.Supp. at 694. <em>See </em>Knight v. Auciello, 453 F.2d 852 (1st Cir. 1973); Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., 444 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Appellant\u2019s second argument that the award is improper is based on the contention that an award should not be paid to a legal services organization which is partially funded through federal grants and which has as its purpose the vindication of public interests. In short, an award is not necessary to encourage A.B.L.E. to bring this type of suit. <em>See </em>Ross v. Goshi, 351 F.Supp. 949 (D.Haw.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The fact that Appellees\u2019 counsel was a legal services organization, partially supported by public funds, is irrelevant in determining whether an award is proper. Legal services organizations do not have unlimited resources to devote to the public interest and must confine their representation of indigents to the boundaries of their budgets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An attorney fees\u2019 award serves its purpose \u2014 to prevent worthy claimants from being silenced or stifled because of a lack of legal resources \u2014 whether it goes to private or \u201cpublic\u201d counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brandenburger v. Thompson, 494 F.2d 885 (9th Cir. 1974) ; Jordan v. Fusari, 496 F.2d 646 (2d Cir. 1974); Fairley v. Patterson, 493 F.2d 598 (5th Cir. 1974); Hoitt v. Vitek, 497 F.2d 598 (1st Cir. 1974); Wilderness Society v. Morton, 495 F.2d 1026 (D.C.Cir. 1974) (era <em>banc), </em>cert. granted,-U.S. -, 95 S.Ct. 39, 42 L.Ed.2d 47 (Oct. 15, 1974); Lea v. Cone Mills Corp., 438 F. 2d 86 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Given that attorney fees may properly be awarded to A.B.L.E., the second basic question is against whom and in what manner they should be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">The District Court awarded a total of $2,000 in attorney fees \u201cagainst both Sheriff Fair as an individual and Allen County.\u201d The District Court made no finding that Sheriff Fair had engaged in bad faith, and it did not explain why the three County Commissioners were not held for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">When an individual has engaged in bad faith before or during litigation, an award of attorney fees against him \u201cindividually\u201d is proper. Whether he is l\u2019eimbursed by his employer or insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>company is of no concern to the court assessing an award on \u201cbad faith\u201d grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In this case, however, no finding of bad faith is before us, and the District Court stated in making the award that \u201cthe public which has benefited thereby should bear the financial responsibility\u201d for Appellees\u2019 suit. Furthermore, the injunctions were drawn against Appellants in their official capacities, as they were made to run against the defendants,- \u201ctheir agents, employees, assigns, successors in office, and all those in active concert or participation therewith.\u201d It is clear, in short, that the District Court did not intend to reach the individual assets of Sheriff Fair but meant the award to be satisfied out of public funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Appellants invoke their \u201csovereign immunity\u201d as a bar to the award. The Eleventh Amendment, though a bar to awards of attorney fees that will be satisfied out of a state\u2019s treasury, Jordon v. Gilligan, 500 F.2d 701 (6th Cir. 1974), is not a bar to an award that may be satisfied out of a county\u2019s treasury. Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 10 S.Ct. 363, 33 L.Ed. 766 (1890). <em>See </em>Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 667 n. 12, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Thus, there is no constitutional bar to a federal court\u2019s awarding attorney fees against a county and its officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">There is a statutory bar within \u00a7 1983, however, which prevents direct suits against municipalities under it. The Supreme Court decided in Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 710, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), that a county may not be directly sued under \u00a7 1983. <em>See also </em>City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973); Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). Making Allen County directly liable for an attorney fees\u2019 award, then, may not rest on \u00a7 1983 liability, since the District Court had no jurisdiction over the County under that statute. One other possible ground to hold the County directly liable might be a state claim that the County is vicariously liable for the good faith actions of its officials in the performance of their duties. This was one justification for the award in La Raza Unida v. Volpe, 57 F.R.D. 94, 102 n. 11, supplementing 337 F.Supp. 221 (N.D.Cal.1972), aff\u2019d, 488 F.2d 559 (9th Cir. 1973) (without discussion of attorney fees). Since no state claim was raised below, we may not now consider whether the award may stand against Allen County on such a pendent state ground. <em>See </em>Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. at 710-717, 93 S.Ct. 1785. In the absence of a finding that an award against Allen County is justified under \u00a7 1983 or under Ohio law, the award against Allen County may not stand. Since the award against Allen County may have been in lieu of an award against the County Commissioners, it is proper to remand for consideration of an award against them, and the entire award will be subject to reconsideration by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">An award against Sheriff Fair is proper under \u00a7 1983. Jurisdiction exists over him, and he has been held liable in this litigation. As a means of effectuating its equitable decree, the District Court had the discretion to award attorney fees against him, to be paid out of public funds under his control. See Gates v. Collier, 489 F.2d 209, 302-303 (5th Cir. 1973); Brewer v. School Board of Norfolk, 456 F.2d 943 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 1778, 32 L.Ed.2d 136, 409 U.S. 892, 93 S.Ct. 109, 34 L.Ed.2d 149 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">We distinguish our conclusion as to county officials from our holding that state officials may not be assessed attorney fees when it is clear that the fees will be paid out of a state treasury, Jor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>don v. Gilligan, 500 F.2d 701 (6th Cir. 1974), on two basic grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">First, we held in <em>Jordon </em>that the Eleventh Amendment is \u201ca limitation of federal judicial power, that is, on the constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts.\u201d 500 F.2d at 706. The Eleventh Amendment is based on the <em>sovereignty </em>of states and leaves to them the choice of submitting to federal court jurisdiction in certain instances. As pointed out above, on the other hand, counties do not enjoy the absolute protection of the Eleventh Amendment. Counties may be directly suable under the general grant of federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, for instance. City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. at 513-514, 516, 93 S.Ct. 2222 (Brennan, J., concurring, joined by Marshall, J.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no equation between the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s broad immunization of states from federal court jurisdiction and the limited statutory exclusion of municipalities from \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Second, whereas the Eleventh Amendment broadly protects sovereign state treasuries from involuntary federal court assessments, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), the exclusion of municipalities from \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction was based largely on a fear that municipal liability for <em>damage </em>awards against local officials could disrupt the functioning of local government and would impose substantial liability on municipal entities bearing no direct responsibility for the unauthorized acts of their officials. <em>See </em>Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. at 187-191, 81 S.Ct. 473; City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. at 517-520, 93 S.Ct. 2222 (Appendix to Opinion of Douglas, J., dissenting in part). Congress sought to personalize liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 and to leave the question of reimbursement for damage awards against state officials to state law and municipal discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">A federal court may, however, award <em>equitable </em>relief against local officials, even though it will have a severe impact on local governmental funds, without infringing the policies behind \u00a7 1983. <em>See </em>Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955); Northcross v. Board of Education, 489 F.2d 19 (6th Cir. 1973). For instance, although back payments of illegally withheld benefits may not be awarded against state officials under the Eleventh Amendment, <em>Edelman, supra, </em>back pay awards have been assessed against municipal agencies under \u00a7 1983, on the ground that they are \u201can integral part of the equitable remedy of injunctive reinstatement.\u201d Harkless v. Sweeny Indep. School District, 427 F.2d 319, 324 (5th Cir. 1970). We find that the attorney fees\u2019 award here is part of the equitable remedy against local officials and that its payment out of local funds does not infringe Congressional policy embodied in \u00a7 1983, just as the requirement that Allen County fund the improvements in the Jail as envisioned in the injunctions against Appellants is a proper exercise of a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Given an equitable basis for an award and the absence of a constitutional immunity for Allen County\u2019s officials, the basic question resolves itself to this: what is equitable. This decision is largely within the District Court\u2019s discretion, to be exercised with a \u201cpractical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.\u201d (footnotes omitted) Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. at 756. <em>See </em>Bowles v. Skaggs, 151 F.2d 817, 820 (6th Cir. 1945). We remand to the District Court for reconsideration of against whom and in what manner the award is to be assessed, and for proper findings and conclusions, which are necessary to our proper review of its final order. <em>See </em>Taylor v. Perini, 503 F.2d 899 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>1974); Milburn v. Huecker, 500 F.2d 1279 (6th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In its reconsideration, the District Court will want to take into account many factors. <em>See, e. g., </em>Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 9 n. 13, 15 n. 23, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973) (effect of award on defendants\u2019 \u201cability to operate effectively\u201d) ; Hill v. Franklin County Board of Education, 390 F.2d 583 (6th Cir. 1968) (defendant\u2019s good faith in implementing decree); Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387, 409-410 (M.D.Ala.1972), and United States v. Gray, 319 F.Supp. 871 (D.R.I.1970) (reasonableness of fee). We mention one particular consideration. If an official is held in his official capacity, and if the purpose of an award is to spread litigation costs among the public, we believe that the proper procedure is ordinarily to draw an order against the official so that the award will be paid out of the public funds under his control. Thus, if half the source of the conditions which the consent order sought to correct is attributable to the Sheriff\u2019s operation of the Jail, and half is traceable to poor equipment and staffing, for which the County Commissioners are responsible, it seems equitable to make half the award run against the Sheriff, to be satisfied out of funds allocated to operate the Jail, and half against the County Commissioners, to be paid out of accounts for the Jail. Not only will this method make the remedy fit the violation, Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 750, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974), but it will charge the proper accounts for the expenses involved, so that the expenses of the Jail will be shown to include legal fees paid to persons who were forced into litigation by conditions which had deteriorated beyond acceptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The decision of the District Court granting attorney fees is vacated. The cause is remanded, with direction that further proceedings be held consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">. <em>See </em>Note, \u201cAwarding Attorneys\u2019 Fees to the \u2018Private Attorney General\u2019: Judicial Green Light to Private Litigation in the Public Interest,\u201d 24 Hast.L.J. 733 (1973) ; Note, \u201cAllowance of Attorney Fees in Civil Rights Litigation Where the Action is not Based on a Statute Providing for an Award of Attorney Fees,\u201d 41 U.Cin.L.Rev. 405 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">. The most basic doubt is that the award may not be spread among those who will actually benefit from the award. It is a stretch of the judicial imagination to construe the benefited class as all citizens of Allen County, and it is merely an assumption that an award against Sheriff Fair will actually be paid out of the pockets of the County\u2019s citizens. Other courts have expressed doubts about the applicability of the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d rationale in this type of case. <em>See </em>La Raza Unida, <em>supra; </em>Brewer v.
