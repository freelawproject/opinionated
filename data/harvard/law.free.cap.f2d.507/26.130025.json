On closer examination on appeal, however, the panel raises a question that no one had considered, here the applicability of the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, to statements filed in private civil litigation. After post-argument briefing, we have deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>mined that the statute is not applicable to such statements. We therefore reverse the appellant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Appellant was convicted after a jury-trial for having made false statements in an affidavit filed in a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The civil action, in which appellant was a code-fendant, was one brought in July of 1972 by Johnson Products, Inc. (Johnson), the manufacturer of the cosmetic hair preparation \u201cUltra Sheen,\u201d for damages and an injunction arising out of the sale by appellant of over 18,000 jars of a counterfeit product under the Ultra Sheen label. Appellant filed an affidavit in the civil suit dated August 8, 1972, denying knowledge of the fraudulent or counterfeit nature of the product which he sold. The prosecution here, under the so-called \u201cfalse statement\u201d statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> charged that the affidavit was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We start with the proposition that in no case has it ever been held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is applicable to a false statement made in a <em>private </em>civil action. While this would not necessarily control the question of statutory construction, it does partake of an administrative, here a prosecutorial, interpretation that the statute, in existence in essentially its present form since 1934<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and used in cases the annotations for which cover 72 pages in the Annotated Code, does not apply to false statements made in a private civil action, at least where the Government is not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The Government argues that, since the false affidavit was filed in a judicial proceeding, the statute bites, because even though civil in nature the proceeding was a \u201cmatter\u201d and one \u201cwithin the jurisdiction\u201d of the judicial \u201cdepartment.\u201d Because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6 defines \u201cdepartment\u201d to include the \u201cjudicial branch\u201d of government, United States v. Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503, 75 S.Ct. 504, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this argument is not easily answered by reference solely to the language of \u00a7 1001. Beyond the wording of the statute, a review of the case law and the legislative history, which we make below, tends to indicate that the keys for applicability may be whether the false statement in question involved a fraud upon the Government or was made to an investigative or regulatory agency of the Government in connection with some matter legitimately within the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the present case, the facts disclose neither a fraud upon the Government nor a deception upon an investigative or regulatory agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Here the Government was not a party to the suit in which the alleged false statement was made, nor was the statement one which was intended to further a scheme to defraud the Government. The Government argues, however, that \u00a7 1001 was intended to have a wider sweep, in the sense that a fraudulent statement in a court is ergo a \u201cfraud upon the Government.\u201d To be sure, there is broad language in at least one of our previous cases which suggests this conclusion. In United States v. Adler, 380 F.2d 917, 922 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1006, 88 S.Ct. 561, 19 L.Ed.2d 602 (1967) (false statement to FBI),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it was said, drawing on the language of United States v. Gilliland, 312 U.S. 86, 61 S.Ct. 518, 85 L.Ed.2d 598 (1941), that \u201c\u00a7 1001 was broadly drawn to protect the \u2018authorized functions\u2019 of federal agencies from \u2018perversion\u2019 . . . .\u201d From this it is argued that the judicial function, surely \u201cauthorized,\u201d will be \u201cperverted\u201d by failure to punish submission of false facts to the decision-making process in a private civil proceeding. But the <em>Adler </em>court was speaking to a particular case involving the argument that \u00a7 1001 did not apply to every criminal investigation. <em>Adler </em>is only one in a long line of decisions upholding prosecutions under \u00a7 1001<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where false statements have tended to \u201cimpair the basic functions entrusted by law to [the] agency.\u201d United States v. Bedore, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">United States v. Kahan, 479 F.2d 290 (2d Cir. 1973), rev\u2019d, 415 U.S. 239, 94 S.Ct. 1179, 39 L.Ed.2d 297 (1974), is also relied upon. In <em>Kahan, </em>the defendant had made statements in open court, not under oath, about his assets in connection with securing court-appointed counsel. The actual holding of this court was that these false statements could not be proven as false exculpatory statements in the course of a trial on bribery charges, a decision which was reversed by the Supreme Court. In a footnote, 479 F.2d at 292, n. 3, the <em>Kahan </em>panel did say: \u201cIf there has been willful misrepresentation by defendant of his assets, proper remedy lies in prosecution for perjury or false statement . . .\u201d Accepting the footnote statement as sound law, such a false statement again operated to defraud the Government, which has to pay assigned counsel. D\u2019Amato\u2019s fraud was not on the Government, but on Johnson, the manufacturer of Ultra Sheen.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Our less expansive view of the scope of \u00a7 1001, that it does not apply where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved, receives some support from some of the cases in other circuits, though we do not necessarily have to agree with them to sustain our holding here. In Morgan v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 309 F.2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 917, 83 S.Ct. 1306, 10 L.Ed.2d 416 (1963), it was held that an attorney who falsely represented himself as having been admitted to practice before the District of Columbia courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>could be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Although <em>Morgan </em>involved a situation where the statute in question was found to be applicable, the language of the District of Columbia court made it clear that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 applied to a limited number of statements made before a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The <em>Morgan </em>court was careful to say that the case went no further than to uphold a prosecution for a false statement made before a court in the exercise of its \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201chousekeeping\u201d functions, the court distinguishing the case then before it from one which, as here, would involve a false statement within the \u201cjudicial machinery\u201d of the court. <em>Id. </em>at 237. United States v. Er-hardt, 381 F.2d 173 (6th Cir. 1967), while relying on <em>Morgan, </em>went even beyond that case in reversing a \u00a7 1001 conviction where the appellant had produced a forged receipt and testified falsely in a criminal proceeding against him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our case is stronger than <em>Erhardt, </em>for in a criminal case where the Government is a party, it could at least be argued that the Government is defrauded by the false statement proffered; ours, however, relates to a <em>civil </em>case in which the Government is in no way involved. The Government\u2019s distinction of <em>Erhardt </em>as involving only a false document submitted in conjunction with sworn testimony, while here there was no sworn testimony, is too tenuous to warrant reply-</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Government argues finally that \u201cthe best support for not carving out such a limitation on \u00a7 1001 is by reference to the perjury statutes <em>which seek to prohibit the same type of conduct </em>at which \u00a7 1001 is aimed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And it points to the fact that to the extent a differentiation between \u00a7 1001 and the perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, may have rested on the two-witness rule incorporated in the latter, that distinction has been obliterated by new 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623, permitting prosecution on the basis of one witness\u2019s testimony for false declarations in court proceedings or before grand juries. <em>See </em>United States v. Kahn, 472 F.2d 272 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 982, 93 S.Ct. 2270, 36 L.Ed.2d 958 (1973). It may be, as the Government suggests, that \u00a7 1001 and the perjury statutes may both overlap so that the same false statement may be prosecuted under both, United States v. Greenberg, 268 F.2d 120, 122 (2d Cir. 1959), while at the same time each covers different conduct in that a perjury conviction requires proof of oath while a false statement conviction does not. <em>Id. </em>It may be that an <em>unsworn </em>false statement submitted in a private civil action cannot be prosecuted either as perjurious or as a false statement, but we do not see the horrific consequences of such a \u201cgap\u201d or of the suggested \u201cabsurd anomaly\u201d that a prosecution will lie for false statements submitted to thousands of executive agencies, but not for one submitted to a federal court in a private civil action. Generally, in any event, as here, the allegedly false statement will be sworn to<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and subject to prosecution for perjury, as of course it may be though made in a civil proceeding. Hale v. United States, 406 F.2d 476 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2129, 23 L.Ed.2d 765 (1969); United States v. Lester, 248 F.2d 329 (2d Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Such a \u201cgap\u201d or \u201canomaly\u201d is not to be wondered at in the light of the legislative history of \u00a7 1001. That section, as United States v. Bramblett, <em>supra, </em>made clear, \u201chad its origin ... in the wake of a spate of frauds upon the Government\u201d in Civil War times. 348 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>U.S. at 504, 75 S.Ct. at 506. It was originally a statute penalizing the presenting \u201cfor payment or approval\u201d of false claims \u201cupon or against the Government ... or any department or office . . . .\u201d 348 U.S. at 504-505, 75 S.Ct. at 506. False statements were proscribed only if they were made \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining, or aiding in obtaining, the approval or payment of such claim . . . <em>Id. </em>While the statute was extended in immaterial respects in various codifications, it was not until 1918, 40 Stat. 1015, that false statements were proscribed if made \u201cfor the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States\u201d as well as if made for the purpose of obtaining payment of a false claim. 348 U.S. at 506 n. 2, 75 S.Ct. at 506. In the Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 996, at the urging of the Secretary of Interior, in connection with \u201chot oil\u201d transportation, the words \u201ccheating\u201d and \u201cswindling\u201d were eliminated and the statute was no longer restricted to cases involving pecuniary or property loss to the Government. It was this amendment which the Supreme Court said in United States v. Gilliland, <em>supra, </em>indicated the congressional intent \u201cto protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result from the deceptive practices described.\u201d 312 U.S. at 93, 61 S.Ct. at 522. But the Act of 1934 was still thought of, by the Court at least, \u201cas a fitting complement\u201d to those statutes \u201cunder which, <em>in connection with the authorized action of governmental departments or agencies, the presentation of affidavits, documents, etc., is required.\u201d Id. </em>at 95\u201496, 61 S.Ct. at 523 (emphasis added). It was in the 1948 revision, Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 749, that the false claims and false statements sections were divided and assumed their present basic form as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 and \u00a7 1001 respectively. The legislative history seems to confirm the fact that this statute, originally intended to protect the Government from those who would defraud it for monetary gain, was broadened to maintain the integrity of the administrative agencies whose historical development coincides with the 1934 amendments to this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We see, in short, nothing in the case law or the legislative history which would support a prosecution under \u00a7 1001 for a false statement made in a <em>private civil action </em>even though it is made in the United States courts. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment without treating the only difficult or interesting point made by appellant, whether venue is proper in the Southern District of New York in a case where the affidavit was signed and filed in the Eastern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">. At trial, both D\u2019Amato and a codefendant, Robert Donovan, were charged with two counts of mail fraud. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. D\u2019Amato alone was charged with having made a false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Donovan\u2019s conviction on the two mail fraud counts was affirmed in open court. D\u2019Amato was found not guilty of mail fraud, but he was convicted of having made a false statement.
