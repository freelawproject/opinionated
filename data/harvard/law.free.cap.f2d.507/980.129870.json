The defendants are administrative officers of the University of Missouri and the members of its Board of Curators (hereinafter, collectively, the University). The Complaint states that plaintiff Cusumano was employed in September of 1964, under a term appointment for one year as an instructor of engineering mechanics at the University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, Missouri. At or about this time he received a copy of the Academic Tenure Regulations of the University (Regulations) to which reference will hereinafter be made. He subsequently received one-year contracts on September 1st of each year through and including the school year 1970 \u2014 1971. On March 31, 1971 he was notified that he would be appointed to a terminal one-year term for the school year 1971 \u2014 1972 but would not be rehired thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-15\">Plaintiff Harmon was employed in September of 1968 as an associate professor of mathematics at Rolla, also receiving at such time the University\u2019s Academic Tenure Regulations. He was rehired from year to year on term appointments through and including the school year 1970 \u2014 1971. In December of 1970 he was notified that his appointment for the school year 1971 \u2014 1972 was a terminal appointment and that he would not be hired thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-16\">In view of the fact that both teachers were on \u201cterm appointments\u201d as opposed to continuous or tenure appointments, neither was given reasons for his non-reappointment, the University relying upon its Regulation specifically so stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-17\">[I]t shall not be necessary for his [the term appointee\u2019s] dean or department chairman to provide him with any statement of causes or reasons for not recommending reappointment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-18\">Subsequent to the commencement of a prior related action plaintiffs were given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>a hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but they assert that it was fruitless since the hearing produced no reasons for nonreappointment. Apparently plaintiffs sought to utilize this hearing as a forum to establish their academic credentials, since they complain to us that at the hearing they \u201ccould not defend against charges concerning their professional competency because they were never informed of those charges.\u201d (Competency is not the issue presented to us, however, though it is pled as a part of the inducement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">What is presented is the claim that plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the University\u2019s refusal to give them reasons for their nonreappointment with an adequate hearing thereon. They seek damages, back pay, declaratory relief and an order requiring the University to reinstate them with \u201ctenure or continuous employment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ordinarily, under the teachings of Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) and Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), a probationary teacher has an insufficient \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the continuation of his employment past the expiration of his contract to invoke due process protections concerning the decision not to reappoint him. In this case, however, plaintiffs assert in substance that under their contracts and in the circumstances before us they have acquired a <em>\u201cde facto </em>tenure\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entitling them to such protection. The court below found otherwise and dismissed the action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">The issue presented concerns the proper interpretation of the University\u2019s Regulations which, it is conceded by both parties, are incorporated by reference in the contracts of the plaintiffs. The University of Missouri, in the year 1950, promulgated extensive and specific Academic Tenure Regulations establishing a tenure system for all academic employees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>the University. Two types of appointments are specified, terfn appointments and continuous appointments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Only holders of the latter type of appointment have permanent or continuous tenure. Term appointees have no rights thereto although their appointments cannot lawfully be terminated during the term, save \u201cfor cause.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Considering the plaintiffs in turn, Mr. Cusumano was, under his contract, an instructor. The regulations concerning the termination of his service are found in Regulations, Section 4A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\"><em>Instructor. </em>Initial appointment at the rank of Instructor shall be a term appointment for one academic year. The maximum probationary period on term appointments shall not exceed seven years. During the appointee\u2019s initial one year term, and during each succeeding term through his seventh year of service, his dean or other appropriate administrative officer shall make one of the following recommendations * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-6\">[(l)-{5) list retention alternatives.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-7\">(6) that he be reappointed Instructor for a terminal one year term, expressly stated to be such; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-8\">(7) that he not be reappointed, provided there has been timely notice as stipulated in Section 4E. A formal recommendation to this effect need not be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">With respect to Associate Professor Harmon the pertinent termination regulations are found in Section 4C:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-11\"><em>Associate Professor. </em>Initial appointment at the rank of Associate Professor normally shall be a term appointment. The maximum probationary period on term appointments shall not exceed four years. During the appointee\u2019s initial term, and during each succeeding term through his fourth year of service, his dean or other appropriate administrative officer shall take one of the following recommendations * * Hs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-13\">[(1) \u2014 (3) list retention alternatives.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-14\">(4) that he be reappointed Associate Professor for a terminal one year term, expressly stated to be such; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-15\">(5) that he not be reappointed, provided there has been timely notice as stipulated in Section 4E. A formal recommendation to this effect need not be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-16\">The notice provisions in event of non-reappointment are found in Section 4E of the Regulations and provide, substantially, that notice of not less than one year shall be given to those in the categories of these plaintiffs, but that appointment for a \u201cterminal one year term * * * expressly stated to be such\u201d (one of the University\u2019s options \u201cduring each succeeding term\u201d) \u201cshall be sufficient notice that the appointee will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>be recommended for reappointment at the end of the terminal period.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As noted, such notice need not include a .statement of reasons for the nonreap-pointment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The above Regulations as to termination of employment bear directly upon plaintiffs\u2019 basic argument, namely, that \u201cduring the period of their employment they acquired a protectable property interest in their jobs\u201d under the teachings of <em>Roth </em>and <em>Sindermann, supra. </em>This property interest, we are told, arose from \u201cthe expectancy of reemployment that is fully explained in the <em>Roth </em>and <em>Sinderman </em>[sic] cases.\u201d In view of the fact that the Regulations above quoted (Sections 4A(6), 4C(4) and 4E) clearly state that during any year of a term appointee\u2019s probationary period <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he may be subject to what amounts to a notification of discharge by appointment to a terminal one year term, and that such notifications actually were given to the plaintiffs on, respectively, December 22, 1970 (Harmon) and March 31, 1971 (Cu-sumano) specifying a terminal academic year ending over a year hence, we are unable to find any reasonable expectancy of reemployment under the teachings of <em>Roth </em>and <em>Sindermann. </em>The entire thrust of the tenure Regulations is to avoid the <em>de facto </em>tenure hypothesized in <em>Sindermann, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 602, 92 S.Ct. at 2700, amounting to \u201can unwritten \u2018common law\u2019 in a particular university that certain employees shall have the equivalent of tenure.\u201d Peculiarly applicable to the <em>de facto </em>tenure doctrine is Section 3B of the Regulations which states that \u201cHolders of academic staff positions under term appointments shall have no rights of permanent or continuous tenure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">But plaintiffs would avoid the provisions of the Regulations above cited by reliance upon Section 2 of the 1940 Statement of Principles adopted by the University and attached as an appendix to the Regulations. This 1940 Statement of Principles, we note at this point, has as its stated purpose \u201cto promote public understanding and support of academic freedom and tenure and agreement upon procedures to assure them in colleges and universities.\u201d Its origins, and the \u201cstatus\u201d of the principles enunciated are described by Machlup <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-11\">There was first the 1915 Declaration of Principles, formulated by a commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>tee of the AAUP.A This was superseded by the 1925 Conference Statement, approved by both the AAC B and the AAUP. Subsequently, after prolonged discussions over a period of six years begun in 1934, the two organizations agreed on the 1940 Statement of Principles, which is still \u201con the books\u201d and has been endorsed by 24 [42 in 1967] professional and learned societies. The principles enunciated in the 1940 Statement have the status of \u201cnorms,\u201d not merely guidelines \u2014 although, of course, they are not norms that could be enforced against those who do not observe them, but merely norms by which the profession can judge academic practices which have become the subject of complaints. [Footnotes added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-5\">A. American Association of University Professors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-6\">B. Association of American Colleges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">The above-mentioned Section 2, relied upon by plaintiffs, states in part that \u201cNotices should be given at least one year prior to the expiration of the probationary period, if the teacher is not to be continued in service after the expiration of that period.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs would read \u201cshould\u201d in the quoted sentence as \u201cmust\u201d and conclude therefrom that since notices were not given (as they \u201cmust\u201d have been) during \u201cthe penultimate year of their maximum probationary periods in the School year 1969\u2014 1970\u201d they had \u201ca property right: the expectancy of reemployment that is fully explained in the <em>Both </em>and <em>Sinderman </em>[sic] cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-16\">Our problem, of course, is to determine the effect to be given the language of the Statement of Principles, precatory on its face, when the <em>Statement </em>has been adopted as part of a teacher\u2019s contract. The Statement of Principles, it is clear, was not intended by its promulgators to be a binding legal document. The procedures of the disputed Section 2 are stated to represent \u201cacceptable,\u201d not obligatory, \u201cacademic practice.\u201d The \u201cprecise terms and conditions of every appointment,\u201d it states, should be reduced to writing \u2014 words of admonition contemplating transition from the generalities of the <em>Principles </em>to the precision of a contract. The function of the <em>Principles, </em>it has been said, is to serve as \u201cmerely norms by which the profession can judge academic practices which have become the subject of complaints.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-17\">The notification provision itself has as a principal and desirable purpose that of an economic shield: according a probationary teacher reasonable warning of impending cessation of employment with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>its attendant professional and financial dislocations and adjustments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We find no vulnerability of the University on this score. The plaintiffs, in each instance, received over a year\u2019s warning prior to their separation from the payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">But another consideration, as well, forces itself upon us. In addition to the types of tenure now existing, characterized by one writer in the field<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as \u201ctenure by law,\u201d \u201ctenure by contract,\u201d \u201ctenure by moral commitment under a widely accepted academic code\u201d and \u201ctenure by courtesy, kindness, timidity or inertia; \u201d we are asked to sanction another: tenure by default. This is clear from the arguments advanced by plaintiffs in support of their position, namely, that such \u201ccontinuous employment\u201d arises from the University\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the \u201cmandatory\u201d terms of the 1940 Statement of Principles. They argue that any teacher has \u201can absolute right to rely on the fact that if he were not notified to the contrary at least one year prior to the end of his maximum probationary period as set forth, he would be continued in service under a continuous employment contract.\u201d This, in fact, is the basis for plaintiffs prayer for injunctive relief, that due to a lack of notice in the 1969\u2014 70 school year they are \u201centitled to tenure or continuous employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">We find nothing in the 1940 Statement of Principles warranting a conclusion so drastic. It cannot serve the public welfare or promote the best interests of either the University or its professorial staff to have a body of teachers, whatever their number, the permanent tenures of whom rest upon administrative neglect or oversight as to notice of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">Section 2 of the Statement of Principles, we conclude, is not mandatory, it is not inconsistent with the University\u2019s Regulations, and furnishes no support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>for plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of <em>de facto </em>tenure.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">It seems appropriate to express a caveat: We do not, obviously, hesitate to enter the burgeoning school-teacher fray when constitutional issues are at stake. So much should be abundantly clear from the compendium cited in note 1, <em>supra. </em>But aside from such issues, the matters of the selection of teachers, their professional qualifications, and their retention are best (and, as a matter of law, properly) left to those entrusted by the state with the awesome responsibilities for the education of our young.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">We find that the probationary teachers before us had acquired no tenure, <em>de facto </em>or otherwise, in the circumstances presented, and that they had no constitutional or contractual rights to a statement of reasons for nonreappointment or a hearing thereon.

The plaintiffs\u2019 original lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the court noting in its Memorandum and Order of October 4, 1972 that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Although the complaint makes no reference thereto, it is not disputed that after the Tenure Committee of the University had heard and considered the respective cases of plaintiffs and submitted a majority and minority report with respect thereto, both plaintiffs appealed their non-retention to the Board of Curators (over a month before this suit was filed) and that said appeals were referred by the President of the Board to its Academic Affairs Committee. Thereafter, both plaintiffs through their attorney requested an opportunity to appear before the Committee and present oral arguments by themselves and by their counsel and such opportunity was afforded them, although for various reasons, one of which was related to the convenience of their counsel, the requested hearing has not yet been held. It is now scheduled for October 12, 1972. In this situation * * the procedural due process claim is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">The hearing subsequently held was not to plaintiffs\u2019 satisfaction, and they brought this second action against the University.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">.

The need for such a rule has been seen from the beginning of the American Association of University Professors in 1915 to the present moment * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-7\">The first major policy statement by this Association, the 1915 Declaration of Principles, stated that \u201cNo university teacher of any rank should, except in cases of grave moral delinquency, receive notice of dismissal or of refusal of reappointment later than three months before the close of any academic year, and in the case of teachers above the grade of instructor, one year\u2019s notice should be given.\u201d Ten years later there emerged from a conference called the American Council on Education a statement which was endorsed by the Association of American Colleges and by this Association. The 1925 Conference Statement eliminated the consideration of rank and tied the notice principle to tenure. It said: \u201cDismissal for reasons other than immorality or treason should not ordinarily take effect in less than a year from the time the decision is reached.\u201d Fifteen years later, the 1940 Statement of Principles, likewise endorsed by the Association of American Colleges and this Association, extended the right to a year\u2019s notice to all. It said: \u201cNotice should be given at least one year prior to the expiration of the probationary period if the teacher is not to be continued in service after the expiration of that period. Teachers on continuous appointment who are dismissed for reasons not involving moral turpitude should receive their salaries for at least a year from the date of notification whether or not they are continued in their duties at the institution.\u201d (Since the one-year provision places the burden of an unrealistic procedure upon an institution at the beginning of its acquaintance with a teacher, Committee A of the Association in its 1957 Recommended Institutional Regulations authorized the Washington Office to relax the requirement to this extent: during the first year of a teacher\u2019s service, notice is adequate if given by March 1; during the second year of service, notice should be given six months before the end of the academic year.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-13\">\n<em>The Year's Notice Rule in Practice.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE2\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWC\">* * * [N]o one can object to a year\u2019s notice for a professional man who has been busy doing his work and has had no time to arrange for next year.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1074-17\">. <em>Machiup, supra </em>note 4, at 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1075-16\">. We will note, merely for completion of analysis, that it is far from clear that the clause was violated, even if mandatory. The Section 2 notice in the Statement of Principles applies only if the teacher is not to be \u201ccontinued in service\u201d at the end of his probationary period. Here there was an actual continuation \u2018in service under a term appointment (\u201cbegin at a specified date and terminate at a specified date,\u201d Regulations, Section 2B), albeit the appointment was terminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1075-24\">.
