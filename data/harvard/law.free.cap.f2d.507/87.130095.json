The decree, which was filed on May 23, 1973, by Judge Young, of the District Court of the Virgin Islands, granted a divorce to both parties \u201con a \u2018no fault\u2019 basis.\u201d The decree gave both parties \u201cequal legal custody of the child,\u201d with \u201cphysical custody\u201d in the wife and \u201creasonable rights of visitation\u201d in the husband. The court ordered the husband to pay $100. per month alimony and $15.00 per week child support. Further, the wife was to have rent-free occupancy of one of two downstairs apartments located in the house which the parties had owned during their marriage as tenants by the entireties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both husband and wife were to share equally debt service, taxes, and other costs of maintaining the jointly-held property.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-20\">In July 1973, the wife filed a motion for modification of the decree and clarification of visitation rights. That motion was assigned for hearing to Judge Hoffman, of the Municipal Court of the Virgin Islands, sitting by designation in the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion was set down for hearing on September 26, 1973, to allow the taking of additional testimony. When neither the husband nor the attorneys for either party<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeared for the September 26, 1973, hearing, the matter was continued to November 21, 1973. As a result of the November 21 hearing, an order was filed December 5, 1973,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> finding the husband in contempt for failure to pay both alimony and child support, and ordering increased pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ments to be made covering current and past due amounts in order to eliminate the arrearages. No substantial change in the situation of the parties was found to warrant any modification in the amounts of alimony or child support awarded by the May 23 decree. Another hearing was set for December 10, 1973;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that hearing led only to further continuances. The case was scheduled for February 25, 1974, to accommodate the husband\u2019s attorney,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but his inability to appear led to another continuance until March 6, 1974.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon notification of the March 6 date, the husband\u2019s attorney immediately requested a continuance until April to accommodate his trial schedule. This request was denied in a letter dated February 26, 1974. The letter also suggested that the husband retain other counsel should his attorney remain unable to appear on March 6. This the husband declined to do, choosing to appear without counsel at the March 6 hearing and refusing either to testify or to cross-examine any witnesses. On the basis of the testimony at the hearing and an affidavit filed by the husband, the court orally announced its orders. Judge Hoffman determined that the husband was in contempt for continuing nonpayment of alimony and child support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No sanction was imposed for the contempt; the court merely required that payments be made in accordance with the December 5 order. The trustee whom the court had appointed to collect rents and pay the mortgages on the jointly-held property was ordered to make arrangements for selling the property. The husband\u2019s monetary obligations under the divorce decree were to be deducted from his share in the proceeds of the sale. The court also suspended the husband\u2019s rights of visitation pending his payment of alimony and child support.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No reduction was ordered in the amount of alimony or child support, as requested by the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Notice of appeal to the court of appeals was filed in the district court on March 11, 1974. Judge Hoffman\u2019s written order was filed March 14, 1974. The appeal was thus premature. See Moore, Federal Practice, II 204.14 at 981-82 (2d ed. 1973). So long as the order is an appealable one and the non-appealing party is not prejudiced by the prematurity, however, the court of appeals should proceed to decide the case on the merits, rather than dismiss on the basis of such a technicality. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); Hamilton v. Stillwell Van and Storage Co., 343 F.2d 453 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">We will consider the husband\u2019s allegations that the district court fatally erred in adjudging him in contempt and abused its discretion both in enforcing and in refusing to modify the May 23, 1973, divorce decree, as altered by the December 5, 1973, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">The husband asserts that the finding of contempt cannot stand because he was denied assistance of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>sel by Judge Hoffman\u2019s refusal to continue the March 6, 1974, hearing until April. The matter of granting a continuance is within the discretion of the trial judge. United States v. Scott, 460 F.2d 45, 47 (3d Cir. 1972); United States v. Greenberg, 419 F.2d 808, 809 (3d Cir. 1969). The refusal to grant a continuance is not, without more, a denial of the right to counsel even though the refusal prevents a party from being represented by a particular attorney because of that attorney\u2019s other professional commitments. United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 846 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1972); United States ex rel. Bronzell v. Rundle, 410 F.2d 371, 372 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964), considered a claim that denial of a motion for a continuance deprived the defendant in a contempt hearing \u201cof his constitutional right to engage counsel and to defend against the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 84 S.Ct. at 849. The Court concluded that \u201c[tjhere are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances presented in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No denial of due process was found where the defendant, an attorney charged with criminal contempt for certain court room remarks, was given five days\u2019 notice to hire counsel and prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The husband in the case now before this court received 10 days\u2019 notice that the continuance had been denied and that he should obtain other counsel. As in <em>Ungar, </em>the evidence of contempt\u2014 nonpayment of moneys owing under the decree and ability to pay \u2014 \u201cwas fresh, the witnesses and the evidence readily available, the issues limited and olear-cut. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 84 S.Ct. at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The rule in this circuit, enunciated in United States ex rel. Carey v. Rundle, 409 F.2d 1210 (3d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 946, 90 S.Ct. 964, 25 L.Ed.2d 127 (1970), is that \u201calthough the right to counsel is absolute, there is no absolute right to a particular counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215. <em>Carey </em>held that the trial court had neither abused its discretion nor denied the defendant due process by failing to grant a third continuance so that the defendant could retain private counsel. The court noted that it was \u201cdesirable\u201d for a defendant to \u201cobtain private counsel of his own choice;\u201d however, \u201cthat goal must be weighed and balanced against an equally desirable public need for the efficient and effective administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The case now before the court presents both interests identified in <em>Carey. </em>Both at the March 6 hearing and on appeal, the husband asserted a right to be represented by particular counsel. This attorney was the second to represent the husband in the case, and had appeared on the husband\u2019s behalf at only three hearings, all of which had been adjourned. Moreover, several matters relating to the case had not been handled personally by the attorney of choice, but by other attorneys in the office. No reason appears why one of these attorneys could not have represented the husband on March 6; the issues involved were not complex, either legally or factually.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">On the other hand, expeditious settlement of disputes relating to divorce decrees is essential to preserve the rights of the parties, particularly where, as here, the actual payment of sums owing is subject to manipulation by one of the parties. From the effective date of the decree, June 1, 1973, to the entry of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>order appealed from, March 14, 1974, the husband had paid only $120.00 in child support; he had paid no alimony. The husband had also failed to make any of the mortgage payments ordered by the decree. As a result of this non-compliance, the jointly-held property was subject to foreclosure, which threatened the loss of the parties\u2019 substantial equity. An immediate sale of the property was possible and could avoid this loss, to the advantage of both parties. March 6, 1974, hearing, N.T. 25, 28. In addition, there was testimony that the wife and child were facing financial hardship. The case had been scheduled and rescheduled 10 times. Order of March 14, 1974, at 1 \u2014 2. The nonappearance of the husband\u2019s attorney at the February 25 hearing demonstrated that there could be no certainty he would appear even if the requested continuance were granted. In light of the economic necessities and the prior delays, we have concluded, after careful consideration of the record, that the need to settle speedily the rights of the parties clearly outweighed whatever interest the husband had in being represented by a particular attorney. The continuance was properly denied. See United States v. Weathers, 431 F.2d 1258 (3d Cir. 1970); United States ex rel. Baskerville v. Deegan, 428 F.2d 714 (2d Cir. 1970); United States v. Restaino, 405 F.2d 628 (3d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 904, 89 S.Ct. 1012, 22 L.Ed.2d 216 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The husband\u2019s affidavit, dated March 4, 1974, which was before the court at the March 6 hearing, put into issue his ability to pay. We find, however, ample support in the record for the court\u2019s conclusion that the continued nonpayment constituted contempt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Poe v. Poe, 409 F.2d 40, 44 (3d Cir. 1969). The husband makes no claim that he has made payments ordered by the decree. Indeed, the affidavit itself clearly reveals his non-compliance with the December 5 order to pay $30.00 per week in child support.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The court having authority to enforce the decree through its contempt power, Bergen v. Bergen, 439 F.2d 1008 (3d Cir. 1971), and there being no denial of the right to counsel or other due process right, the judgment of contempt will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">The husband also alleges that the court abused its discretion in refusing to modify the alimony award ordered in the May 23, 1973, decree. The burden is on the party urging modification to \u201callege such a substantial and continuing change of circumstances since the entry of the original decree as to make continued enforcement of that decree unfair.\u201d Viles v. Viles, 316 F.2d 31, 34 (3d Cir. 1963). At the November 21, 1973, hearing, Judge Hoffman found that \u201cdespite the variances and discrepancies that counsel for Mr. Hodge has brought forth,\u201d N.T. at 123, modification of the alimony award was unwarranted. We find nothing in the record which indicates either that the husband carried his burden under <em>Viles </em>or that the district court erred in failing to modify the award.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See Poe v. Poe, 409 F.2d 40, 44 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In addition, the husband attacks certain modifications of the decree as abuses of discretion. Among these are the hours of visitation established by the March 14, 1974, order,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the order that sums owing under the decree be deducted from the husband\u2019s proceeds when the jointly-held property is sold.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The calculation of the amount owed as child support is also challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We have been unable to discover in the record any findings by the trial judge to justify the change in the husband\u2019s visitation rights, reflected in paragraph 4 of the March 14 order. <em>Cf. </em>Viles v. Viles, 316 F.2d 31 (3d Cir. 1963). At the December 10, 1973, hearing (p. 11), the trial judge concluded that the provisions of the May 1973 decree concerning visitation should \u201ccontinue.\u201d No evidence was produced at the March 6, 1974, hearing to support any change in that conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the trial judge stated on March 6, 1974 (p. 32), that \u201cvisitation rights shall not continue\u201d until the husband \u201chas liquidated the arrears,\u201d it appears that the March 14 modification of visitation rights was punitive. Under these circumstances, denial of visitation rights is not justified where, as here, the record indicates that the primary purpose is to punish a parent for failure to pay support money for his child. See, e. <em>g., </em>Com. ex rel. Lotz v. Lotz, 188 Pa. Super. 241, 244, 246, 146 A.2d 362, 363-364 (1958), aff\u2019d, 396 Pa. 287, 152 A.2d 663 (1959);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 88 A.L.R.2d 148, 163-164 and 204-205; Clark, Domestic Relations, 590, <em>cf. </em>507 \u2014 10 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">The power of the court to modify the May 23, 1973, order and to order the sale of the jointly-held property is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ceded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are unable to detect any abuse of this power in the orders of the court, which find ample support in the record. To the extent that there is any doubt about. the correctness of the amount owing for child support, we find that the husband waived his right to challenge that amount by failing to controvert the testimony at the March 6, 1974, hearing. As a court of equity, the district court has the power to order the deduction of sums owing by appellant under the court\u2019s decrees from the appellant\u2019s share of the proceeds of any sale of the real property now held by the parties as tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We will determine motions filed by ap-pellee under date of August 13, 1974, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">(1) The motion that additional docket entries be added to appellant\u2019s designated record and be contained in the record on appeal is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">(2) The motion to include in the record on appeal correspondence relating to matters occurring after the March 14, 1974, judgment is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">(3) The motion that appellant reimburse appellee for transcripts pursuant to Rule 10(b), F.R.App.P., is denied, without prejudice to its renewal in the district court in accordance with F.R.

The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-12\">.

Judge Louis Hoffman, of the Municipal Court of the Virgin Islands, was assigned to sit in the District Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and St. John, to hear matrimonial matters by the Chief Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit of the United States, pursuant to 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1614(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-14\">.

The December 10, 1973, hearing was scheduled for taking testimony as to the rental value of the apartments located in the jointly-held property, to establish the amounts paid on the mortgages by both parties, and to determine the husband\u2019s rights of visitation with the parties\u2019 child, Ann. However, the only result of the hearing was arranging for the husband to have custody of Ann for a weekend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\">. The case was first adjourned to January 14, 1974, but, due to Judge Hoffman\u2019s illness, it was postponed first to January 28, 1974, and then to February 25, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. The March 6 date was set for the convenience of the wife\u2019s attorney, since the husband\u2019s attorney failed to indicate a desired date for the adjourned hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b177-15\">. The wife testified that she had received only $120. in child support since the December 5 order, although she was supposed to receive $30. per week under that order. The husband\u2019s affidavit stated that he had paid $60.00 per month in child support since October \u201cin accord with the Decree and judgment of divorce.\u201d The husband does not claim, therefore, to have complied with the December 5, 1973, order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b177-16\">. This in-court order was modified by the court, sua <em>sponte, </em>in the written order filed March 14, 1974, to allow six hours of visitation on Saturdays.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AcT\">. Even where the desired counsel possesses special expertise, a court may, consistent with due process, refuse a continuance to accommodate counsel\u2019s trial schedules. \u201cThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not include the right to a lawyer whose other engagements prevent a speedy trial.\u201d United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 846 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\">. Although the husband claims, at page 11 of his brief, that the court made no finding of willfulness, at page 15 of the brief he alleges that the court found both husband and wife in \u201cequally willful\u201d violation of the decree. See November 21, 1973, hearing, N.T.. 123 (\u201ceach of these parties has failed to comply with Judge Young\u2019s decree . . . in a flagrant manner . . . \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">. The December 5 order was within both the power of the court and the proper scope of its discretion. See Viles v. Viles, 316 F.2d 31, 34 (3d Cir. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b179-14\">. The husband points out that the wife\u2019s net, rather than gross, earnings are approximately $5,600.00 per year. In the decree of May 23, 1973, the court found that her <em>gross </em>was about $5,000.00. The husband also claims that he has been unable to pursue his part-time business of making screens since his shop, located in the jointly-held property, is no longer accessible to him. Thus he contends the differential between his earnings and the wife\u2019s earnings is less than $3,000.00, while the decree was premised upon a differential of at least $5,000.00. Taking into account the whole of the testimony, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>we note that there are offsetting discrepancies and we agree with Judge Hoffman that these discrepancies do not indicate a change in the wife\u2019s needs sufficient to require modification of the decree. Viles v. Viles, 316 F.2d 31, 35 n. 3 (3d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The husband also urges that the alimony award be reduced to offset the imputed income which the wife is receiving by virtue of remaining in the larger, upstairs apartment, rather than moving into a smaller, downstairs apartment, as ordered by the May 23, 1973, decree. We note that such a reduction is within the power of the court. Poe v. Poe, 409 F.2d 40, 44 (3d Cir. 1969). However, after consideration of the record, we have concluded that the refusal of the court to reduce the award is within its sound discretion. <em>Id. </em>No abuse of discretion appears.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. See note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">. The husband challenges, <em>inter alia, </em>that part of this order which requires him to reimburse the wife for unpaid mortgage payments required of him by the May 1973 Memorandum Opinion and Decree. We reject this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\">. We recognize that visitation programs such as that followed in the December 11, 1973, decree appear to have merit, but the absence of findings to support the above-mentioned paragraph 4, combined with the indica-' tion that the terms of such paragraph 4 were punitive, required the vacation of that paragraph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b180-11\">. In the <em>Lotz </em>case, the court explained the rationale of this principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">\u201c . . . mere failure to support is not grounds for refusing visitation rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">\u201cA thorough review of the record in this case does not reveal sufficient evidence to warrant the termination of appellee\u2019s visitation rights. It is against public policy to destroy or limit the relation of parent or child. [Citing cases.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA3\">\u201cA parent has seldom been denied the right of visitation. The cases in which visitation rights of a parent have been limited or denied have been those in which severe mental or moral deficiencies of the parent have constituted a real and grave threat to the welfare of the child.
