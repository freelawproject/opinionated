His petition for a writ of habeas corpus herein alleges that he was charged and convicted by grand and petit juries which were unconstitutionally selected, and that he was denied a public trial. District Judge Frank Johnson denied Aaron\u2019s application, finding that the failure to assert these issues in the state trial proceedings was a deliberate bypass of state remedies which precluded raising such issues by way of collateral attack. We affirm the denial of the writ for basically the same reasons set forth in Judge Johnson\u2019s well-reasoned opinion appended hereto. However, we add some additional comments on each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>I. Waiver of right to challenge the composition of grand and petit juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In the deposition of Aaron\u2019s trial attorney, Solomon S. Seay, he stated that he knew that Alabama law at the time required a challenge to the composition of the jury roll, and that he recognized that failure to enter such a challenge constituted a waiver of that right. Moreover, he stated that the possibility of making such a challenge was discussed with his co-counsel, J. L. Chestnut, Jr., before a decision not to contest the jury composition was made. Seay Deposition at 14 \u2014 15. While this would seem to be an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d in the classic sense, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), appellant contends that no genuine waiver of the right to challenge the jury composition occurred. This assertion is based on a series of cases from this circuit which have found exceptional circumstances justifying failure to challenge jury composition where challenges of racial discrimination in jury selection might engender hostility to the defendants or create community hostility toward white attorneys such as would jeopardize their professional standing. See United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 5 Cir., 1959, 263 F.2d 71, 82, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 850, 80 S.Ct. 109, 4 L.Ed.2d 89; Whitus v. Balkcom, 5 Cir., 1964, 333 F.2d 496, 498-499, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 931, 85 S.Ct. 329, 13 L.Ed.2d 343; Winters v. Cook, 5 Cir., 1973, 489 F.2d 174 (en banc); Wells v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1973, 488 F.2d 522, 525. District Judge Johnson, however, specifically found that Aaron\u2019s attorneys were not faced with a \u201cgrisly choice\u201d that would trigger application of the <em>Whitus </em>exception to the deliberate bypass rule. In support of that conclusion, we add the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">1. The dictum in <em>Goldsby </em>that white attorneys in the Deep South often sacrificed their black clients\u2019 rights to be tried by a constitutionally selected jury out of fear of community opprobrium or social ostracism has been discredited by the en banc decision in <em>Winters. </em>See 489 F.2d at 178 \u2014 179. But the assumption, even if viable, would have no validity in this case as Aaron\u2019s retained attorneys were black, and not likely to be scorned in their community for doing all possible to insure a fair trial for a fellow black.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">2. Attorney Seay stated one of the reasons the jury selection procedure was not challenged was because the Circuit Judges in Montgomery County were members of the county\u2019s Jury Supervisors, and he was unwilling to call the integrity of the judges into question by asserting racial discrimination on the part of those entrusted with drawing up the jury rolls. But the state trial judge, Eugene W. Carter, Jr., specifically asked Seay, prior to Aaron\u2019s first trial, whether he intended to challenge the jury. Judge Carter stated he did so because he recognized that he would be obligated to recuse himself from the case should such a challenge be entered, because of his membership on the jury board. See 155 So.2d at 335. We note that a challenge to the composition of the jury in Montgomery County was timely entered in Reeves v. State, 264 Ala. 476, 88 So.2d 561 (1956), cert. granted, 352 U.S. 965, 77 S.Ct. 373, 1 L.Ed.2d 321, cert. dismissed, 355 U.S. 368, 78 S.Ct. 363, 2 L.Ed.2d 352 (1958), also a case involving rape of a white woman by a black, and Judge Eugene Carter \u2014 the trial judge in Aaron\u2019s case \u2014 did in fact recuse himself. Thus, we do not find these allegations of suspected judicial hostility well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">3. While Seay did state that one of the important factors which induced him not to enter a challenge to the jury was a fear of engendering community hostility that would only create the danger of his client\u2019s being tried by an antagonistic jury, he also stated, \u201cI thought I had a shot at the case,\u201d i. e., that the defendant might be acquitted. Seay Deposition at 16. Thus, tactical considerations were a part of the decision not to challenge the jury selection procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">4. While appellant would portray his attorney as being disinclined to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the jury composition out of fear either that his future career would be jeopardized or that his client would be prejudiced, two factors (in addition to those discussed by Judge Johnson) prompt us to conclude otherwise. First, in 1961, only a year after Aaron\u2019s second trial, attorney Seay did in fact challenge the composition of the jury in a case involving a black client. See 155 So.2d at 336. Second, as appellant\u2019s present attorney stated to the court below, Mr. Seay \u201chas for the past decade successfully litigated numerous controversial civil rights cases.\u201d Under these circumstances, we accept and affirm Judge Johnson\u2019s determination that Aaron\u2019s attorneys were not in fact presented with a \u201cgrisly\u201d or Hobson\u2019s choice which precluded them from knowingly and intelligently waiving the client\u2019s right to challenge the jury selection procedures in Montgomery County, Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">II. Waiver of right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Prior to the start of the second trial, the trial court, acting pursuant to Article VI, Section 169, Alabama Constitution of 1901,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ruled that certain persons be excluded from the trial. The prosecu-trix\u2019 relatives, the defendant\u2019s relatives, all those necessary to the conduct of the trial, other attorneys, defendant\u2019s clergyman and the press were allowed in the courtroom; other members of the public were barred. Despite the exclusions, Aaron\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cI would say there were quite a few people there. I would say that three-fourths of the courtroom was full.\u201d Seay Deposition at 23. Aaron\u2019s attorneys did not challenge this action, as an objection to a similar order entered prior to the start of the first trial was addressed and dismissed by the Alabama Supreme Court. Nonetheless, Judge Johnson held that failure to object to the court\u2019s action prior to the second trial constituted a waiver of Aaron\u2019s right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\"> Although it is clear that a person\u2019s right to a public trial can be waived, see Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 35, 85 S.Ct. 783, 790, 13 L.Ed.2d 630 (1965), we are reluctant to conclude that the failure to make an objection already overruled by the state\u2019s highest court and thus clearly futile constituted an actual waiver of Aaron\u2019s right to a public trial. Rather, we conclude on the merits of that contention that Aaron was not in fact denied a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Courts have differed over the propriety of excluding certain persons from criminal trials. Compare Tanksley v. United States, 9 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 58, 10 Alaska 443, with Harris v. Stephens, 8 Cir., 1966, 361 F.2d 888, 891, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 964, 87 S.Ct. 1040, 18 L.Ed.2d 113 (1967), and United States v. Geise, 9 Cir., 1958, 262 F.2d 151, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 842, 80 S.Ct. 94, 4 L.Ed.2d 80 (1959) (latter cases holding it proper to close courtrooms to certain spectators in rape trials). As we have previously noted, \u201cThe constitutional right to a public trial is not a limitless imperative.\u201d Lacaze v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 516, 521. The fact that some members of the public were barred from the courtroom does not necessarily mean that a denial of a public trial has occurred; the \u201cdecision must turn on the particular circumstances of the case, and not upon a question-begging because abstract and absolute right to a \u2018public trial.\u2019 \u201d Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 616-617, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 1043, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960). See also 6 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1835, at 338 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">In this ease, some members of the public were admitted; the courtroom was at least three-fourths full; the transcript of the trial became public record. Particularly important is the fact that the news media were admitted. The published reports of the trial were lengthy and complete. The defendant\u2019s relatives and clergyman were present to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>provide moral support and comfort to the accused. In sum, we find none of the secrecy of the proceedings which are condemned by the Sixth Amendment and In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948); see also, as an example of proceedings incompatible with the demand for public trial, Caudill v. Peyton, 4 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 563 (trial conducted in judge\u2019s chambers). We conclude that the denial of one\u2019s right to a public trial is not at issue where \u201c[tjhere was no <em>in camera </em>or secret trial. [The trial] was held in a public courtroom with attorneys, court reporters, court attendants and at least some outsiders present.\u201d United States ex rel. Bruno v. Herold, 2 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 125, 127, cert. denied, 397 U.S. 957, 90 S.Ct. 947, 25 L.Ed.2d 141 (1970). \u201cCertainly under modern conditions, when friends of the accused, the representatives of the press, and those necessary to the proper conduct of the trial are present, the defendant receives every safeguard insured by a trial open to the general public.\u201d Note, 45 Mich.L.Rev. 474, 479 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Opinion of District Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Drewey Aaron, a black man, was convicted <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1960 in a state court in Alabama upon an indictment charging rape of a white woman, and a death sentence was imposed. Aaron petitions this Court for a writ of habeas corpus,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging numerous errors of constitutional dimension which he claims entitle him to relief. This Court, in its order filed on November 26, 1973, granted petitioner a hearing on three issues: first, whether petitioner effectively waived his right to grand and petit juries selected without regard to race; second, whether the grand and petit juries which indicted and convicted petitioner were unconstitutionally selected; and third, whether petitioner was denied his right to a public trial. The case is submitted upon the pleadings, briefs, affidavits, depositions, and stipulations filed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">I. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">As an initial matter, it is abundantly clear that a state may not constitutional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ly require defendants to be tried to a jury from which citizens have been systematically excluded on account of their race. Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972); Arnold v. North Carolina, 376 U.S. 773, 84 S.Ct. 1032, 12 L.Ed.2d 77 (1964); Reece v. Georgia, 350 U.S. 85, 76 S.Ct. 167, 100 L.Ed. 77 (1955). It is also clear that whatever rights Aaron has as to this issue are not lost merely by the passage of time. Hamilton v. Watkins, 436 F.2d 1323 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Nevertheless, a defendant\u2019s right to be tried by a jury constituted without regard to race is a right which may in certain circumstances be waived. In this respect, there are two distinct varieties of waiver which must be considered. The first is a procedural or fictitious waiver, which is a function of criminal procedure and not of constitutional law. Procedural waiver is deemed to have occurred when issues are not presented to the trial court at a specified time or in a specified manner. ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Post-Conviction Remedies 88 (Commentary) (Approved Draft, 1968) (hereafter cited as \u201cPost-Conviction Remedies\u201d). This doctrine of procedural waiver is recognized in criminal cases in the State of Alabama and in the federal courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, a defendant in Alabama who does not present a timely and proper<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> challenge to the composition of the grand or petit jury is deemed under Alabama law to have waived that objection. Ex parte Seals, 271 Ala. 622, 126 So.2d 474 (1961). Under this rule of procedural waiver, Aaron was held by the Alabama Supreme Court to have waived his right to challenge the composition of the grand jury which indicted him and the petit jury which tried him. Ex parte Aaron, 275 Ala. 377, 155 So.2d 334, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 898, 84 S.Ct. 177, 11 L.Ed.2d 126 (1963). When state procedural waiver is held to have occurred, it may be an adequate state ground, to remain undisturbed by the United States Supreme Court upon certiorari in cases of direct review or review of state post-conviction remedies. Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 798, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">There is, however, a second variety of waiver, one which is a matter of federal constitutional law. This <em>genuine </em>waiver involves an active, knowing choice, an intelligent and understanding decision to forego certain rights. Post-Conviction Remedies at 88 \u2014 89. This form of waiver was defined in Johnson v. Zerbst as \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). While state procedural waiver may remain undisturbed on appeal, a federal court in a habeas corpus action has the power to pierce the procedural waiver and to require a show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ing of a <em>Zerbst </em>waiver. Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 425, 429-430, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). This Court is asked by petitioner to hold that the procedural waiver made by counsel in this case does not serve to waive his right to trial before a constitutionally-selected jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">It might have been thought until recently that the defendant himself had to make a personal <em>Zerbst </em>waiver of his right to a constitutional petit jury. Fay v. Noia was quite vague concerning the proper party, whether the attorney or the defendant, to make these procedural choices, noting only that \u201c[a] choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief.\u201d Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S.Ct. 822, 849, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). However, the Supreme Court in Henry v. Mississippi noted that counsel\u2019s choice of strategy might \u201camount to a waiver binding on petitioner [which] would preclude him from a decision on the merits of his federal claim . . . .\u201d Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 451, 85 S.Ct. 564, 569, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965). It is now clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">a constitutional objection to the composition of a grand or petit jury may be waived by an attorney without consultation with his client where there is \u201cconscientious consideration of that course of action which would be best for his client\u2019s cause\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Winters v. Cook, 489 F.2d 174, 180 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc). Therefore, a \u201cwaiver\u201d by counsel is not to be invalidated in circumstances like these merely because the attorney did not explain the decision to, or consult with, his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Here, Aaron\u2019s counsel effected the procedural waiver of Aaron\u2019s right to an indictment by and trial before properly constituted grand and petit juries. There are three groups of situations in which waiver by the attorney will not be binding upon the petitioner. The first group involves situations in which the lawyer has, through some personal fault or error, failed to give competent representation to the defendant. These are cases in which there is a showing of \u201cfraud, or gross negligence or incompetence on the part of the defendant\u2019s attorney.\u201d Winters v. Cook, 489 F.2d 174, 178 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc). In such a case, the petitioner must be allowed to effect or reject a personal waiver of the right involved. There is here no showing or claim of gross negligence or incompetence. Second, a personal waiver by defendant is necessary in cases in which \u201can inherently personal right of fundamental importance is involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178. It is now clear in this circuit, after <em>Winters, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-12\">the right to be indicted or tried by a constitutionally composed jury is not one of the rights traditionally considered so inherently personal that only the defendant may waive it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 180. Third, and most pertinent to this case, the waiver by an attorney may be held invalid and not binding upon his client if counsel was forced to make what is termed a \u201cgrisly choice.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201cgrisly choice\u201d theory first appeared as an exception to the concept of \u201cdeliberate by-pass\u201d in the law applied in habeas corpus cases. The deliberate by-pass rule first appeared in Fay v. Noia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-14\">If a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures, then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief if the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>courts refused to entertain his federal claims on the merits</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aly-dedup-0\">372 U.S. at 439, 83 S.Ct. at 849. <em>Accord, </em>Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 451\u2014452, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965) (failure to observe state \u201ccontemporaneous objection\u201d rule a deliberate by-pass). Thus it is clear that if a decision to waive certain rights is made for strategic reasons, a deliberate by-pass has been effected, and the federal district court on habeas corpus may properly hold that the procedural waiver is effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">However, while a strategic decision upon trial may be a deliberate by-pass and thus an effective waiver, courts have attempted to make a distinction between a strategic waiver and what is termed a \u201cgrisly choice,\u201d a phrase excerpted from Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 440, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201cdeliberate by-pass\u201d is a valid waiver under <em>Noia </em>principles; a \u201cgrisly choice\u201d is not. Thus, we must consider whether Aaron\u2019s trial counsel in this case was faced with a \u201cgrisly choice,\u201d or whether he made a \u201cdeliberate by-pass\u201d of Aaron\u2019s right to challenge the composition of the petit and grand juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for this circuit noted some two years after Aaron\u2019s second conviction that an attorney in a Southern setting faces at least a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> when he is deciding whether to challenge the composition of a trial jury. While in doing so he would be pursuing his client\u2019s undoubted constitutional right, there would be the strong possibility of serious prejudice <em>to the defendant:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">If the segregation policy in a county is so strong that Negroes are systematically excluded from the jury system, community hostility would be generated against any \u201ctroublemaker\u201d who would attempt to upset the all-white make-up of the jury system. Such hostility would <em>directly affect the Negro defendants.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Whitus v. Balkcom, 333 F.2d 496, 506\u2014507 (5th Cir. 1964) (emphasis added). That court noted that \u201c[t]he effect will, of course, be accentuated if the case is one involving . . . the rape of a white woman by a Negro . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>This, of course, is such a case. The court in <em>Whitus </em>held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-15\">the doctrine of fictitious waiver is unacceptable when the state compels an accused person to choose between an unfairly constituted jury and a prejudiced jury . . .We hold that the State could not constitutionally require the petitioners to make a guess and a gamble between two evils.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 510. The Supreme Court in Henry v. Mississippi approvingly cited <em>Whitus </em>as an exceptional circumstance involving a grisly choice. 379 U.S. at 451\u2014452, 85 S.Ct. 564. Numerous courts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and commentators <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> have agreed that a circumstance of this nature may in some circumstances constitute a grisly choice to be made by defendants or their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">Formerly, it appeared that a court might have the power to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-19\">take judicial notice that white lawyers in this circuit almost always will sacrifice their Negro clients\u2019 rights to be tried by a constitutionally selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>jury out of a fear of community opprobrium or social ostracism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Winters v. Cook, 489 F.2d 174, 178 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is now abundantly clear that a habeas petitioner <em>must offer evidence amounting to prima facie proof </em>that he or his attorney faced a grisly choice and did not therefore make a deliberate by-pass of his right to challenge the composition of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">II. <em>Findings of Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Soon after petitioner\u2019s arrest, his wife approached Solomon S. Seay, Jr., Esq., a black attorney in Montgomery. After initially suggesting to Mrs. Aaron that she retain more experienced trial counsel, Mr. Seay agreed to take the case. Mr. Seay associated J. L. Chesnut, Esq., a young black attorney from Selma.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Aaron\u2019s attorneys declined to challenge the jury selection system at either trial. They testified on deposition in this case that their primary reason for failing to challenge the jury selection system was fear of prejudicing the jury and the court against their client.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">While such a decision at Aaron\u2019s <em>first </em>trial might arguably have been a \u201cgrisly choice,\u201d a point which this Court need not decide, the first trial resulted in conviction. After reversal, it should have been apparent to the attorneys that since the waiver in the first trial had been of little benefit (the verdict being one of conviction), the value accruing to the client by their passive policy was gossamer at best. At least at that point, after the experience of one conviction, the attorneys\u2019 failure to attack the composition of the grand and petit juries became a deliberate by-pass and not a grisly choice. Therefore Aaron must remain bound by the choice made by counsel at the trial of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether the jury system as it operated at the time of Aaron\u2019s second conviction was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">III. <em>Public Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Petitioner contends that he was, during his second trial, denied his constitutional right to a public trial. At trial, attendance was restricted to relatives, counsel, a minister, court officials and newspapermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees to an accused the right to a \u201cpublic trial.\u201d This limitation operates upon the states by virtue of its incorporation into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948). The guidelines of this right to a public trial are unclear. \u201c[Wjithout exception all courts have held that an accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271 \u2014 272, 68 S.Ct. at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">At petitioner\u2019s second trial, the courtroom was, according to the testimony of Mr. Seay, about three-quarters full and contained several of Aaron\u2019s friends. The trial judge excluded all save a very few specifically-allowed spectators. Mr. Seay testified that he did not object at the second trial since he had objected and had been overruled at the first trial and the trial court had been affirmed on that point. <em>See </em>Aaron v. State, 271 Ala. 70, 78, 122 So.2d 360 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-17\">This exclusion was accomplished pursuant to the Alabama Constitution, which provides in part that \u201c[i]n all prosecutions for rape and assault with intent to ravish, the court <em>may, in its discretion, </em>exclude from the courtroom all persons, except such as may be necessary in the conduct of the trial.\u201d Ala.Const. \u00a7 169 (1901) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>It is not necessary in this case to decide whether the Alabama Constitutional provision is unconstitutional on its face or as applied. Petitioner\u2019s counsel were aware of the need to assert his constitutional right to a public trial; they did so at the first trial and pressed the point on appeal. Their failure to assert this right at the second trial can only be termed a deliberate by-pass. Therefore, Aaron is not entitled to habeas corpus relief on this point.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. Section 169 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">In all prosecutions for rape and assault with intent to ravish, the court may, in its discretion, exclude from the courtroom all persons, except such as may be necessary to the conduct of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">The provision was repealed in 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-5\">. Aaron was first convicted in the state circuit court in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1959. His conviction was reversed by the Alabama Supreme Court in 1960 upon an evidentiary error. Aaron v. State, 271 Ala. 70, 122 So.2d 360 (1960). Upon remand, Aaron was again convicted, and his second conviction was affirmed. Aaron v. State, 273 Ala. 337, 139 So.2d 309, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 846, 83 S.Ct. 81, 9 L.Ed.2d 82 (1962). Aaron\u2019s petition for leave to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis, dealing with the jury exclusion issue, was denied by the Alabama Supreme Court. Ex parte Aaron, 275 Ala. 377, 155 So.2d 334, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 898, 84 S.Ct. 177, 11 L.Ed.2d 126 (1963). A supplemental application for leave to petition for writ of error coram nobis was denied on February 4, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. Aaron filed his original petition in this Court on February 15, 1965. This Court on that date issued a stay of execution and stayed further proceedings to allow Aaron to present further matters to the state courts. On May 17, 1966, after leave obtained from the Supreme Court of Alabama, Aaron petitioned the state trial court for a writ of error coram nobis, which was dismissed by the trial court. That dismissal was reversed by the State Supreme Court to allow Aaron to obtain a hearing in the trial court on <em>Wither-spoon </em>issues. Aaron v. State, 283 Ala. 52, 214 So.2d 327 (1968). The state trial court denied relief on the <em>Witherspoon </em>issue on June 25, 1970. Aaron appealed to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. On August 24, 1972, this Court declared void, following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), the sentence of death imposed upon Aaron. On March 20, 1973, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals commuted Aaron\u2019s death sentence to one of life imprisonment. Aaron v. State, 49 Ala. App. 402, 272 So.2d 609 (Ct.Crim.App.1973). The <em>Witherspoon </em>issue was mooted by the death penalty holdings. On June 13, 1973, this Court ordered the State of Alabama to show cause why this Court should not issue the writ of habeas corpus prayed for by Aaron.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\">.

United States, 411 U.S. 233, 93 S.Ct. 1577, 36 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973), the Supreme Court held that a defendant who did not make a timely objection waives it, \u201cin the absence of the showing of \u2018cause\u2019 which that rule requires.\u201d 411 U.S. at 242, 93 S.Ct. at 1583. The challenge in <em>Davis </em>was to the composition of the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">This Court views Alabama law on this point as holding that, once a right is \u201cwaived\u201d procedurally, it is permanently waived according to state law. The Constitution requires that in certain instances, for instance where a \u201cgrisly choice\u201d [discussed infra] may be proved to have been required, any procedural waiver rule must implicitly contain a requirement that the waiver be set aside \u201cfor cause shown.\u201d In <em>Davis, </em>cause simply was not shown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-13\">. In Alabama criminal practice, the formation of the trial venire is properly attacked by a written motion to quash the venire, while the method of attacking the composition of the grand jury has been both plea in abatement or motion to quash the indictment.
