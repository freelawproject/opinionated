The defendants were the members of the school board, the board secretary, the superintendent of schools and the high school principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">After a full evidentiary hearing, District Judge John Feikens made the following finding of fact: \u201cThe reason that Manchester was not given tenure was the unsatisfactory level of his teaching performance.\u201d The District Court dismissed the action and Manchester appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-20\"> It is the well settled law of this Circuit that a public school teacher who is discharged or denied tenure because of the exercise of first amendment rights may maintain an action under \u00a7 1983. The constitutional rights of a teacher cannot be defeated by a pretext on the part of school authorities. Bates v. Dause, 502 F.2d 865 (6th Cir. 1974); Arnold v. Bondurant, 491 F.2d 718, 719 (6th Cir. 1974) ; Hetrick v. Martin, 480 F.2d 705, 708-709 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1075, 94 S.Ct. 592, 38 L.Ed.2d 482 (1973); George v. Board of Educ., 472 F.2d 132, 133 (6th Cir. 1972); Orr v. Trinter, 444 F.2d 128 (6th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 408 U.S. 943, 92 S.Ct. 2847, 33 L.Ed.2d 767 (1972). <em>See </em>McFerren v. County Bd. of Educ., 455 F.2d 199, 201 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 2461, 32 L.Ed.2d 817 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-21\">Orr v. Trinter, <em>supra, </em>states the rule of this Circuit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-22\">\u201cInitially we recognize that plaintiff does not have a constitutional right to public employment. Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy [367 U.S. 886, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230], <em>supra. </em>However, even though \u2018one may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>have a constitutional right to go to Bagdad, * * * the Government may not prohibit one from going there unless by means consonant with due process of law.\u2019 Homer v. Richmond, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 229, 292 F.2d 719, 722. Hence it is no longer open to debate that plaintiff would be entitled to relief if the board had refused to rehire him because he had exercised his rights as guaranteed by the free speech clause of the First Amendment, Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811, Board of Trustees of Arkansas A &amp; M College v. Davis, 396 F.2d 730 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 962, 89 S.Ct. 401, 21 L.Ed.2d 375; by the self incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment, Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, 350 U.S. 551, 76 S.Ct. 637, 100 L.Ed. 692; by the due process clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments, Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377; or by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Hatton v. County Board of Education, 422 F.2d 457 (6th Cir.); Rolfe v. County Board of Education, 391 F.2d 77 (6th Cir.). These are constitutionally impermissible reasons for refusal to rehire a teacher. Conversely courts have recognized as constitutionally permissible reasons for refusal to rehire the fact that the teacher is not as well qualified as another applicant, Brooks v. School District, 267 F.2d 733 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 894, 80 S.Ct. 196, 4 L.Ed.2d 151; . . . .\u201d 444 F.2d at 134. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Manchester contends that he was denied tenure because of his participation in the school visiting speaker program and his public comments criticizing the school\u2019s policy concerning visiting speakers. This presents an issue of fact, which was determined adversely to Manchester by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">After a full evidentiary hearing, Judge Feikens made findings of fact to the effect that members of the school board disliked Manchester\u2019s public comments on the school speaker policy but held that Manchester was not given tenure for the reason that the level of his teaching performance was unsatisfactory. Judge Feikens further held that Manchester was not deprived of his constitutional rights because of the school board members\u2019 attitude toward his public speech, \u201cwhen the reason he did not receive tenure was the unsatisfactory level of his teaching performance.\u201d Upon a review of the entire record we conclude that the findings of fact by the District Judge are not clearly erroneous, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), but to the contrary are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Manchester relies upon Mich. Comp.Laws Ann. \u00a7 38.83,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is part of the Teachers\u2019 Tenure Law of Michigan. He complains that some of the reasons assigned by school authorities for denying tenure occurred during his first year of employment as a probationary teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Review of actions of school authorities under the Teachers\u2019 Tenure Law of Michigan is the prerogative of the courts of that State and not of the federal judiciary. Jurisdiction cannot be conferred on federal courts by the procedural device of filing an unsubstantial action under \u00a7 1983 and relying on the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. Bates v. Dause, <em>supra, </em>502 F.2d at 867. In this \u00a7 1983 action determination of whether the constitutional rights of Manchester were violated is not controlled by \u00a7 38.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. <em>38.83 Same; notice to teacher, written statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Sec. 3. At least 60 days before the close of each school year the controlling board shall provide the probationary teacher with a definite written statement as to whether or not his work has been satisfactory. Failure to submit a written statement shall be considered as conclusive evidence that the teacher\u2019s work is satisfactory. Any probationary teacher or teacher not on continuing contract shall be employed for the ensuing year unless notified <em>in writing </em>at least 60 days before the close of the school year that his services will be discontinued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
