Buchert and several co-defendants were indicted on three counts in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Having waived his right to trial by jury, appellant was tried to the court and convicted on the second and third counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the indictment which charged (1) the unlawful distribution of methamphetamine on September 1, 1973 and (2) the possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute it on September 28, 1973, both violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In each of these transactions appellant allegedly supplied methamphetamine powder to co-defendant Frank J. Dorsey<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who in turn sold, or intended to sell, the powder to Francis J. Schmotzer, a federal undercover agent. Agent Schmotzer never dealt face-to-face with appellant, but only through Dorsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-20\">Among pretrial motions made on appellant\u2019s behalf was one to suppress evidence obtained by the Government\u2019s warrantless \u201cinterception\u201d of telephone communications between appellant and Agent Schmotzer on September 12 and September 28, 1973, both of which were alleged to have been recorded by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-21\">The grounds for the motion were asserted to be that</p>\n<p id=\"b718-22\">(1) the telephonic communications were seized without the Government having previously obtained a court order pursuant to the Omnibus Crime Control Act, Title 3, Wiretap Provisions (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq.);</p>\n<p id=\"b718-23\">(2) they were seized without the appellant\u2019s consent;</p>\n<p id=\"b718-24\">(3) they were seized in violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights; and</p>\n<p id=\"b718-25\">(4) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c), which authorizes consensual interceptions, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The District Judge denied the motion, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">Defendant Buchert\u2019s motion to suppress telephone tapes of conversations between himself and an undercover agent will also be denied. Whatever expectation of privacy defendant Bu-chert had by virtue of Katz v. U. S., 389 U.S. 347 [88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576] (1967), he gave up when he confided in the agent. This is clearly the import of Lopez v. U. S., 373 U.S. 427 [83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L.Ed.2d 462] (1963). U. S. v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 753 [91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453] (1971). The recording of conversations between undercover agents and suspected wrongdoers may be a distasteful example of law enforcement activity, but in this instance it was not an activity which can be found to have violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\u2022At trial, the prosecution connected appellant to the transactions by introducing evidence of the two telephone conversations he initiated with Agent Schmotzer, one linking him to the September 1 sale and the other connecting him to the attempted sale of September 28. On this appeal, Buchert submits that his conviction must be set aside because of the trial judge\u2019s failure to grant his motion to suppress evidence of the two incriminating telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Thus, the question presented by this appeal is whether one who engages in a telephone conversation may justifiably expect that the participant on the other end of the line will not record or disclose the substance of what is said. We hold in this case that such expectations of privacy are not \u201cjustifiable\u201d within the meaning of Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), and therefore are not entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">\n<em>Conversation # 1, linking appellant to the September 1 sale.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">Agent Schmotzer\u2019s initial contact with appellant was by way of the September 12, 1973 telephone conversation during which appellant identified himself as the source of supply for the methamphetamine sold on September 1. Acting without a warrant, Agent Schmotzer taped the conversation, but due to an equipment malfunction the recording was inaudible. Agent Schmotzer, however, made extensive notes of the conversation from which he was able to testify at trial. As to this first conversation, appellant\u2019s challenge is simply that the Fourth Amendment prevents Agent Schmotzer from publicly disclosing information that was given to him in confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Appellant\u2019s subjective expectation that Agent Schmotzer would not repeat the content of their discussion is not disposi-tive of whether the constitutional safeguards apply. <em>See </em>Katz v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 361, 88 S.Ct. 507 (concurring opinion of Harlan, J.). The Fourth Amendment\u2019s protective umbrella, as interpreted by <em>Katz, </em>shields only those expectations of privacy which are \u201cjustifiable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Measuring by this objective privacy standard, appellant had no right to assume that Agent Schmotzer would not relate the conversaton to oth-. ers. The possibility of repetition is a well-known risk that the prudent man weighs before disclosing confidential information. Moreover, under the facts of this case the risk of repetition was particularly strong. When the incriminating conversation took place appellant\u2019s only knowledge of Agent Schmotzer was that he had made a single purchase of methamphetamine from Mr. Dorsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Although United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971), was decided according to pre-<em>Katz </em>interpretations of the Fourth Amendment, the principles espoused by a plurality<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> therein are appropriate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), which was left undisturbed by <em>Katz, </em>held that however strongly a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations in this respect are not protected by the Fourth Amendment when it turns out that the colleague is a government agent regularly communicating with the authorities. [The Fourth Amendment] affords no protection to \u201ca wrongdoer\u2019s misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it.\u201d Hoffa v. United States, at 302, 87 S.Ct. at 413. No warrant to \u201csearch and seize\u201d is required in such circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We conclude that appellant\u2019s disclosures to Agent Schmotzer during the telephone conversation of September 12, 1973 which connected appellant to the September 1 sale were not protected by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Conversation # 2, linking appellant to the attempted sale of September 28.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">On September 28, 1973, the same date as the attempted sale, appellant again spoke with undercover Agent Schmotzer by telephone. Acting without a warrant, Agent Schmotzer successfully recorded the conversation during which appellant identified himself as the source of supply for the methamphetamine to be sold later that day. In addition to Agent Schmotzer\u2019s testimony, the recording itself was played at trial, both over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">In considering the admissibility of \u201cconversation # 1,\u201d we concluded that Agent Schmotzer could properly take notes of his conversations with appellant and subsequently testify as to the content of their discussions. Our sole remaining question is whether the Fourth Amendment protects appellant when, instead of merely repeating what was said, the undercover agent records the conversation and is permitted to replay it at trial. Appellant concedes that only the constitutional issue is involved since electronic interceptions by a party to the conversation are expressly exempted from the warrant requirements of the Omnibus Crime Control Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">Prior to its decision in <em>Katz, </em>the Supreme Court consistently upheld various forms of electronic eavesdropping where one party to the intercepted conversation gave prior consent. <em>See </em>Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L.Ed.2d 462 (1963); Rathbun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107, 78 S.Ct. 161, 2 L.Ed.2d 134 (1957); On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 L.Ed. 1270 (1952). While we agree that the trespassory concepts <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> prevailing at the time these cases were decided have since been discredited,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it does not nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>essarily follow that the holdings themselves are no longer sound law. The continuing validity of <em>Lopez, Rathbun </em>and <em>On Lee </em>remains a subject of active debate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The governmental activity challenged here is most closely related to the participant monitoring discussed in the <em>Lopez </em>case. Both here and in <em>Lopez </em>a participant in the incriminating conversation secretly recorded what was said and that recording was later introduced as evidence against one of the speakers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In analyzing this factual setting, the Supreme Court found no invasion of the speaker\u2019s Fourth Amendment guarantees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">Once it is plain that [the agent] could properly testify about his conversation with Lopez, the constitutional claim relating to the recording of that conversation emerges in proper perspective. \u2022 . . [T]his case involves no \u201ceavesdropping\u201d whatever in any proper sense of that term. The Government did not use an electronic device to listen in on conversations it could not otherwise have heard. Instead, the device was used only to obtain the most reliable evidence possible of a conversation in which the Government\u2019s own agent was a participant and which that agent was fully entitled to disclose. . ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-14\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-15\">Stripped to its essentials , petitioner\u2019s argument amounts to saying that he has a constitutional right to rely on possible flaws in the agent\u2019s memory .. <em>We think the risk that petitioner took in offering a bribe to [the agent] fairly included the risk that the offer would be accurately reproduced in court, whether by faultless memory or mechnical recording.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-16\">373 U.S. at 438-439, 83 S.Ct. at 1388 [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">The emphasized language closely resembles the Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy analysis required by <em>Katz. </em>In determining whether appellant\u2019s statements were made under circumstances which a reasonable person would assume to be free from \u201cuninvited ears,\u201d it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>logical to examine the potential risks of a breach of privacy. <em>See also </em>United States v. White, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. at 752-753, 91 S.Ct. 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">When appellant revealed his confidential information to agent Schmotzer, he undoubtedly assumed that the information would not be communicated further, least of all to the police. He would not have expressly consented to Agent Schmotzer\u2019s recording and replaying of the confidential disclosures any more than he would have permitted word-of-mouth repetition. Both forms of publication are, however, risks that the speaker who unveils confidential information must recognize. The mechanical ear of the recorder is no different than the ear of a listener with a precise memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The extent to which appellant\u2019s disclosures compromised his own secrets was intimately dependent upon his listener\u2019s trustworthiness. Viewed objectively, any continuing expectation that the information would remain confidential required consideration of the possibility of repetition, in whatever form. Our conclusion that appellant\u2019s expectations of privacy were not constitutionally protected is fortified by the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in United States v. White, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Our problem, in terms of the principles announced in <em>Katz, </em>is what expectations of privacy are constitutionally \u201cjustifiable\u201d \u2014 what expectations the Fourth Amendment will protect in the absence of a warrant. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">Inescapably, one contemplating illegal activities must realize and risk that his companions may be reporting to the police. If he sufficiently doubts their- trustworthiness, the association will very probably end or never materialize. But if he has doubts, or allays them, or risks what doubt he has, the risk is his. . . . Given the possibility or probability that one of his colleagues is cooperating with the police, it is only speculation to assert that the defendant\u2019s utterances would be substantially different or his sense of security any less if he also- thought it possible that the suspected colleague is wired for sound. At least there is no persuasive evidence that the difference in this respect between the electronically equipped and the unequipped agent is substantial enough to require discrete constitutional recognition. . . <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">In addition, at least seven other circuit courts have applied <em>Katz </em>and reached a decision similar to the one we reach here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">We are not unmindful of Justice Harlan\u2019s observation, in his <em>White </em>dissent, that expectations of privacy, and the risks a speaker assumes, are largely reflections of pre-existing Fourth Amendment law. 401 U.S. at 786, 91 S.Ct. 1122. Thus, Justice Harlan reasoned, instead of merely examining a particular individual\u2019s expectations, any Fourth Amendment analysis must ultimately focus on the impact a given police practice will have on the public\u2019s sense of security \u2014 the fundamental concern of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>In terms of the instant case, the underlying issue presented is whether we are willing to burden the average person with the threat of participant recording in order to provide the police with an admittedly valuable law enforcement tool.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>convinced that publications of confidential information by the <em>invited </em>participant, as in this case, do not present the same kind of threat to a free society as was presented by the <em>uninvited </em>listener in <em>Katz.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Warrantless electronic eavesdropping without the knowledge of either party to the conversation produces an atmosphere of police omniscience analogous to that produced by the general warrant of a by-gone era. <em>Cf. </em>Katz v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 358-359, 88 S.Ct. 507. <em>See generally </em>Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 482-484, 85 S.Ct. 506, 13 L.Ed.2d 431 (1965). It is this broad transgression, different from that presented by the instant case, against which the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect. A more limited threat to the values of a free society arises from the risk that an invited participant may be electronically recording one\u2019s conversation for later replaying. We concede that, in the latter case, the conversation may eventually reach the same number and kind of people as if the electronic intrusion had been accomplished by an uninvited third party. The significant difference, however, is that private discussions are more likely to be inhibited by the continuous threat of an uninvited listener.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We conclude that the unveiler of incriminating private information must assume some, but not all, possible risks of governmental intrusion. In the participant recording situation, the speaker need only contend with the trustworthiness of the person with whom he converses \u2014 a factor which the speaker can evaluate and judge for himself prior to disclosing confidential information. Thus, in order to preserve his privacy, appellant Buchert had only to cautiously evaluate Agent Schmotzer\u2019s reliability. Having failed to accurately assess Agent Schmotzer\u2019s true intentions, appellant can fairly be made to bear the consequences of his misjudgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">We hold that the district judge properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the testimony and recorded evidence obtained during Agent Schmotzer\u2019s telephone conversations. The judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-15\">.

Since the governmental activity challenged in the instant case took place long after December 18, 1967, the date <em>Katz </em>was decided, the <em>Katz </em>principles must be applied. <em>Compare, e. g., </em>United States v.

Four Justices among the Supreme Court\u2019s current membership have indicated their belief that <em>Lopez </em>and <em>On Lee </em>survive <em>Katz. See </em>United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 750-752, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453. Justices Brennan, Douglas and Marshall, on the other hand, argue that <em>Katz </em>implicitly overrules <em>On Lee </em>and perhaps also <em>Lopez. </em>See <em>Id. </em>at 755-756, 91 S.Ct. 1122 (Brennan, J., dissenting), at 758-760, 91 S.Ct. 1122 (Douglas, J., dissenting) and at 795-796, 91 S.Ct. 1122 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\">. Instead of recording a telephone conversation, the Federal agent in <em>Lopez </em>recorded, on a concealed wire recorder, a face-to-face conversation he had with the defendant. The recording was introduced at trial to corroborate the agent\u2019s in-court testimony relating to the conversation. 373 U.S. at 429-432, 83 S.Ct. 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">By way of comparison, <em>On Lee </em>and <em>Rath-bun </em>are factually dissimilar to the instant case in that they both involve interceptions by a third party who did not participate in the conversation. In <em>On Lee </em>a former acquaintance, turned Government informer, engaged the petitioner in an incriminating conversation and simultaneously transmitted the discussion to a Federal agent hiding a short distance away, 343 U.S. at 749-750, 72 S.Ct. 967. In <em>Rathbun </em>police officers listened on a regularly used extension telephone at the request of one party to the call, 355 U.S. at 108, 78 S.Ct. 161. We make no determination as to whether these factual distinctions would lead to a different result than the one we reach here. \u2022 Other circuits have examined <em>post-Katz </em>fact patterns which parallel the <em>On Lee </em>and <em>Rathbun </em>situations and have concluded that third-party interceptions accomplished with the consent of a participant do not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See </em>United States v.
