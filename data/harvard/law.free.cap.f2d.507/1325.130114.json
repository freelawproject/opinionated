Lavine, 415 U.S. 528 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-21\">The issue to which our earlier opinion of November 7, 1973 was addressed was the correctness of a judgment which had been entered in the Southern District of New York, Kevin T. Duffy, <em>District Judge, </em>on May 24, 1973, 361 F.Supp. 235, ordering defendants to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>store day care services to plaintiffs (including reimbursement for any day care services rendered during the pendency of this action) and enjoining defendants from denying day care services to any applicant because of failure to submit a certain form until that form was revised in accordance with the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">On appeal, one judge dissenting, we reversed and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. 487 F.2d 403, Our essential holding was that plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim did not present a substantial constitutional question and that accordingly there was no pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order of June 17, 1974, we entered an order on July 17, 1974 vacating our judgment of November 7, 1973. Thereafter we restored the case to the calendar, directed the parties to serve and file supplemental briefs and heard further oral argument on October 10, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">The asserted jurisdictional underpinning for the instant action is the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970), and its jurisdictional implementation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1970). Pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claims turns, upon the existence of such jurisdictional, underpinning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-10\">The test for determining whether a substantial constitutional claim has been presented for \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdictional purposes was restated by the Supreme Co.urt in Hagans v. Lavine, <em>supra. </em>The Court\u2019s refusal to reexamine the substantiality doctrine in <em>Hagans, </em>and particularly its emphasis upon the concept of \u201cconstitutional insubstantiality\u201d as reviewed in Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 518 (1973),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the district court in the instant case did have jurisdiction over the due process claim asserted by plaintiffs and pendent jurisdiction to consider the statutory claims urged by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-11\">We therefore remand the case to the district court for all purposes. We order that the mandate issue forthwith. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ayf-dedup-1\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s per curiam order of June 17, 1974 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-12\">\u201cThe petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for further consideration in light of Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528.\u2019r</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">. The Court in <em>Hagans, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 537-38, quoted as follows from <em>Goosby, stopra, </em>409 U.S. at 518, where it had reviewed the question of \u201cconstitutional insubstantiality\u201d in the context of convening a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 (1970) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-8\">\u201c \u2018Constitutional insubstantiality\u2019 for this purpose has been equated with such concepts as \u2018essentially fictitious,\u2019 Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S., at 33; \u2018wholly insubstantial,\u2019 ibid.; \u2018obviously frivolous,\u2019 Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 216 U.S. 285, 288 (1910) ; and \u2018obviously without merit,\u2019 Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32 (1933). The limiting words \u2018wholly\u2019 and \u2018obviously\u2019 have cogent legal significance. In the context of the effect of prior decisions upon the substantiality of constitutional claims, those words import that claims are constitutionally insubstantial only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous; previous decisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. A claim is insubstantial only if \u2018 \u201cits unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d \u2019 Ex parte Poresky, <em>supra, </em>at 32, quoting from Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, <em>supra, </em>at 288; see also Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103, 105-106 (1933); McGilvra v. Ross, 215 U.S. 70, 80 (1909).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1414-13\">.
