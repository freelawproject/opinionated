The ship and its owner appeal from so much of the judgment as awarded the time charterer indemnity for all of its attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in resisting cargo\u2019s claims. The action, tried before the late Judge McLean, was disposed of in a thorough opinion by Judge Ward, 372 F.Supp. 859 (S.D.N.Y.1974), whose statement of the facts we incorporate by reference. Since we are substantially in agreement with Judge Ward\u2019s opinion, we shall limit ourselves to a few observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">It is not disputed that the cause of the virtual destruction of plaintiff\u2019s shipment of 188 pieces of valuable machinery and parts for a steel mill was \u201ca massive entry of seawater into the [ship\u2019s] # 3 hold, which slowly permeated the fertilizer [stowed in that hold], formed a slurry, and finally burst through the [temporary] non-watertight bulkhead into the # 2 hold, inundating and destroying the Ili-gan cargo.\u201d Id. at 863. The entry of seawater was due to a defect which had developed in \u201ca pipe called a sanitary or soil line which drains from the crew\u2019s toilets, exits the ship through an opening in the hull, and permits waste to be discharged outside the ship\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 862. Resting on lugs over the opening of the pipe was a cover plate, called a clapper valve, which was below the level of the sea when the vessel was fully loaded; the plate was designed to swing open to allow the discharge of waste but then to close and, resisting the pressure of the ocean, prevent the entry of seawater. A damage survey after the vessel\u2019s arrival in the Far East showed that the lugs were \u201ccompletely corroded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>with rust, so that the valve was frozen in an open position, and the sanitary line pipe was corroded through, with a hole approximately 2\" by Vk\",\u201d 372 F.Supp. at 863, through which water entered the # 3 hold. The district judge found that the ship and its owner had not sustained their burden of proving the exercise of due diligence to make the ship seaworthy under \u00a7 4(1) of COGSA, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(1), and that New York Navigation Company, the time charterer, had breached a contractual warranty to furnish a seaworthy ship \u2014 rulings from which these parties have not appealed. However, he limited the liability of the defendants to $500 per package under \u00a7 4(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s principal contention in the trial court and on appeal, for the award of full damages against the ship and its owner, is based on what the judge called \u201ca novel theory\u201d, 372 F.Supp. at 865. It is premised on a factual claim that the owner was on notice of the defect before the voyage began. Building on this, plaintiff contends that the owner\u2019s conduct constituted such gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct as to constitute an \u201cunreasonable deviation\u201d from the contract of carriage, and that such a deviation should \u201coust\u201d the contract and deprive the carrier of the protection afforded by \u00a7 4(5). Since Judge Ward found that \u201cplaintiff has not proved that Weyerhaeuser knew or must have known of the unseaworthy condition of the ship\u201d prior to the trans-Pacific voyage, 372 F.Supp. at 865, he did not decide what result a contrary conclusion would have demanded. Although we do not consider the judge\u2019s conclusions to be in error, even under this circuit\u2019s standard for review, Mamiye Bros. v. Barber SS Lines, Inc., 360 F.2d 774, 776-778 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 835, 87 S.Ct. 80, 17 L.Ed.2d 70 (1966); Esso Standard Oil Co. v. S.S. Gasbras Sul, 387 F.2d 573 (2 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 914, 88 S.Ct. 1808, 20 L.Ed.2d 653 (1968); Cleary v. United States Lines Co., 411 F.2d 1009, 1010 (2 Cir. 1969), the question is likely to arise again. Since it has been thoroughly argued, we think it desirable, as an alternative ground of decision, to reject the legal theory advanced by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument, rearranged and supplemented to give it greater forcefulness, is essentially as follows: The cornerstone of the argument is The Will-domino, 272 U.S. 718, 725, 47 S.Ct. 261, 261-262, 71 L.Ed. 491 (1927), a pre-COG-SA case in which a ship left port with a grossly inadequate supply of coal, known to be so by the carrier, which necessitated a departure from her course. During the deviation the ship struck a reef or a submerged object which caused water to enter and damage the cargo. The Supreme Court held, speaking through Mr. Justice McReynolds, that when a loss occurred during an unreasonable deviation from the agreed course of the voyage, the ship \u201cbecame liable as an insurer for any damage suffered by the cargo\u201d and could not avail itself of the Harter Act, 27 Stat. 445 (1893), exception \u201cfor damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management\u201d of the vessel. A prior English case, Joseph Thorley, Ltd. v. Ortus S.S. Co., Ltd., [1907] 1 K.B. 660, 668 (C.A.), had similarly held that an unreasonable deviation from the intended path of the voyage deprived the ship of the benefit of exceptions in the bill of lading. Subsequently, after adoption of the English Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, which like COGSA was derived from the Hague Rules and the Brussels Convention, the House of Lords held in Stag Line, Ltd. v. Foscolo Mango &amp; Co., Ltd., [1932] A.C. 328 (1931), that the <em>Thorley </em>principle continued to prevail despite the fact that Art. IV-5 of the English statute, the equivalent of \u00a7 4(5) of COGSA, on its face contained no exception for losses due to unreasonable deviation. Lord Atkin there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">I pause here to say that I find no substance in the contention faintly made by the defendants that an unauthorized deviation would not displace the statutory exceptions contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. I am satisfied that the general principles of English law are still applicable to the carriage of goods by sea except as modified by the Act: and I can find nothing in the Act which makes its statutory exceptions apply to a voyage which is not the voyage the subject of \u201cthe contract of carriage of goods by sea\u201d to which the Act applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 340. Reaching the same conclusion, Lord Russell of Killowen said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">It was well settled before the Act that an unjustifiable deviation deprived a ship of the protection of exceptions. They only applied to the contract voyage. If it had been the intention of the legislature to make so drastic a change in the law relating to contracts of carriage of goods by sea, the change should and would have been enacted in clear terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s next building stone is St. Johns N.F. Shipping Corp. v. S.A. Com-panhia Geral Commercial, 263 U.S. 119, 44 S.Ct. 30, 68 L.Ed. 201 (1923), which, like The Willdomino, preceded COGSA. Unlike the cases of geographical deviation discussed up to this point, here the vessel had breached its agreement to stow a cargo of barrels containing rosin under deck and they had to be jettisoned during a storm. The Court, again speaking through Mr. Justice McReynolds, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">By stowing the goods on deck the vessel broke her contract, exposed them to greater risk than had been agreed and thereby directly caused the loss. She accordingly became liable as for a deviation, cannot escape by reason of the relieving clauses inserted in the bill of lading for her benefit, and must account for the value at destination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 124 \u2014 125, 44 S.Ct. at 31 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The next element vital to the construction of plaintiff\u2019s argument is Jones v. The Flying Clipper, 116 F.Supp. 386 (S.D.N.Y.1953), where Judge Weinfeld, drawing these lines of authority together, ruled that when the ship had breached its carriage agreement by transporting cargo on deck, which the <em>St. Johns </em>case forced the carrier to concede to be \u201ca \u2018deviation\u2019 in law\u201d, 116 F.Supp. at 387, the ship could not avail itself of \u00a7 4(5) of the COGSA. The final block supporting plaintiff\u2019s argument, which it has not cited to us, was this court\u2019s approval of <em>The Flying Clipper </em>in Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. v. S.S. Hong Kong Producer, 422 F.2d 7, 18 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 964, 90 S.Ct. 998, 25 L.Ed.2d 255 (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Relying on this structure, plaintiff urges that we should expand the concept of \u201cquasi deviation\u201d, see 2 Carver, Carriage by Sea, \u00a7\u00a7 750, 750A, 750B (12th ed. 1971), which entitles the shipper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>treat the carriage contract as abrogated, thereby eliminating the damage limitation contained in \u00a7 4(5) of COGSA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to include gross negligence or wanton and wilful misconduct in tendering an unsea-worthy ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We think the principle of \u201cquasi-deviation\u201d is not one to be extended. As previously noted, even the holding that a deviation in the geographical sense voids limitations on the carrier\u2019s liability seems inconsistent with the language of COG-SA. It has been justified in part by what is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 the especially serious effect of such a deviation on the shipper. As Lord Atkin explained in Hain S.S. Co. v. Tate &amp; Lyle, 41 Com. Cas. 359, 55 L1. L.R. 159, 173 (1936), quoted in 1 Carver, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">No doubt the extreme gravity attached to a deviation in contracts of carriage is justified by the fact that the insured cargo-owner when the ship has deviated has become uninsured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYl\">See to the same effect Gilmore &amp; Black, Admiralty \u00a7 3.40 at 156 (1957), also questioning whether the premise with respect to marine insurance is true today, and The Citta di Messina, 169 F. 472, 474-475 (S.D.N.Y.1909) (\u201c \u2018deviation\u2019 is a term of art, belonging in the main to the law of marine insurance\u201d, Hough, /.). Up to this point the concept of \u201cquasi deviation\u201d in the United States has recognized only one instance, deck stowage of cargo which the carrier had agreed to carry below deck, for which the carrier becomes liable in full as an insurer of the shipper\u2019s cargo. Whatever may be thought of that principle, it is easy to administer and carriers know the risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In contrast, acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s argument would mean that in almost all cases of loss due to unseaworthiness, in addition to the inquiry, directed by \u00a7 4(1) of COGSA, whether the carrier had used due diligence to make the ship seaworthy, with the burden cast on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under that section,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> shippers or, realistically, their insurers would demand a further inquiry into the degree of the carrier\u2019s culpability, with enormous potential liability, as illustrated by this case, riding on the decision of the fact finder, protected in many circuits by the \u201cunless clearly erroneous\u201d rule, .see, e. <em>g., </em>Merritt v. Interstate Transit Lines, 171 F.2d 605, 608-609 (8 Cir. 1948); Imperial Oil Co. v. Drlik, 234 F.2d 4, 10 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 941, 77 S.Ct. 261, 1 L.Ed.2d 236 (1956); Pacific Tow Boat Co. v. States Marine Corp., 276 F.2d 745, 752 (9 Cir. 1960), and enjoying great weight even in this one. This is a quite different matter from introducing the concept of gross negligence on the limited issue of whether a geographical deviation was unjustifiable. See The Will-domino, <em>supra, </em>272 U.S. at 725-728, 47 S.Ct. 261; The Waalhaven, 36 F.2d 706, 709 (2 Cir. 1929), cert. denied, 281 U.S. 747, 50 S.Ct. 352, 74 L.Ed. 1159 (1931). The difficulties that have been experienced in defining and applying varying degrees of negligence or even the concept of \u201cwilful and wanton\u201d are indicated in Prosser, Torts \u00a7 34 (4th ed. 1971). In the case of international air transportation, when it was desired that a limitation on liability should be lost by wilful misconduct, clear language appropriate to that end was used. Warsaw Convention, Art. 25, 49 Stat. 2 at 3000, 3020. If cases relating to pre-COGSA facts are relevant, as they unquestionably are, <em>see </em>Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.25 at 127, Royal Insurance Co., Ltd. v. United States, 87 F.2d 714, 716 (2 Cir. 1937) is very much in point. Distinguishing cases such as <em>The Willdomino </em>where the known unseaworthiness made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>completion of the agreed voyage impossible without geographical deviation, we there held that the fact that the owner\u2019s officers \u201cdetermined to take a chance and needlessly risked new perils in the voyage\u201d did not justify applying the doctrine of deviation so as to disregard provisions of the bill of lading with respect to giving notice of damage. In sum, loss due to an allegedly exceptional degree of negligence in furnishing an unseaworthy ship falls into Lord Diploek\u2019s category of risks concerning which \u201cit is more practical and economical from the point of view of insurance to spread the risk to the cargo in excess of a fixed limit among a number of cargo insurers rather than to concentrate it in the carrier\u2019s [protection and indemnity] insurer.\u201d Diplock, Conventions and Morals \u2014 Limitation Clauses in International Maritime Conventions, 1 J.Mar.L. &amp; Comm. 525, 528-29 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We agree with and have nothing significant to add to Judge Ward\u2019s disposition of Iligan\u2019s other arguments against the ship and its owner, and also against the time charterer, New York Navigation Co., Inc., which had agreed to provide seaworthy ships for the transportation of Iligan\u2019s machinery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We likewise adopt the portion of Judge Ward\u2019s opinion, 372 F.Supp. at 872, allowing New York Navigation to recover from the ship and its owner all the attorneys\u2019 fees which it incurred in resisting Iligan\u2019s claims. Although some of these concerned the effect of New York\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness as against the lesser liability imposed by \u00a7 4(1) of COGSA and the necessity of having to field Iligan\u2019s attempts to show that New York had not effectively incorporated the COGSA limitation, these were foreseeable consequences of the breach of the warranty of seaworthiness in the time charter. New York may also recover attorneys\u2019 fees for resisting Ili-gan\u2019s claims in this court. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement concerning the appropriate amount of those charges, they shall be fixed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The judgment is affirmed and the cause remanded to the district court for the addition of a provision in the judgment conforming to the last two sentences of the preceding paragraph. The ship and its owner may recover their costs on appeal against Iligan. New York Navigation may recover three-quarters of its costs against Iligan and one-quarter against the ship and its owner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">. Although Mr. Justice McReynolds cited no authority for holding unauthorized deck storage to be a \u201cdeviation\u201d, this court had so held in The Sarnia, 278 F. 459 (2 Cir. 1921), cert. denied, 258 U.S. 625, 42 S.Ct. 382, 66 L.Ed. 797 (1922), mentioned in another portion of Mr. Justice McReynolds\u2019 opinion. This was over a dissent by Judge Mack to the effect that, however the carrier\u2019s actions were characterized, the contractual limitation of liability should not be displaced. See <em>also </em>Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Dampkiesaktieselskabet Balto, 282 F. 235 (2 Cir. 1922), where Judge Hough, a great admiralty judge, expressed the same view as Judge Mack\u2019s in a case of overcarriage but felt compelled by <em>The Sarnia </em>to concur in a displacement of the damage limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\">. Relying on the language and structure of the statute, at least one court of appeals had rejected the reasoning of <em>The Flying Clipper, </em>holding that despite an unreasonable geographic deviation by the carrier its liability was limited to $500 pursuant to \u00a7 4(5). <em>See </em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. Poseidon Schiffahrt, 313 F.2d 872, 874-875 (7 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 819, 84 S.Ct. 56, 11 L.Ed.2d 53 (1963) (overcarriage of goods by shipper coupled with delay of one and one-half years in delivery). <em>See also </em>Nassau Glass Co. v. Noel Roberts, Ltd., 249 F.Supp. 116 (S.D.Fla. 1965) (on deck storage of plate glass). <em>But see </em>Searoad Shipping Co. v. E. I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co., 361 F.2d 833, 835-836 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 973, 87 S.Ct. 511, 17 L.Ed.2d 436 (1966) (shipper liable in full as an insurer of the cargo where damage resulted from on-deck deviation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. Although \u00a7 4(5) reads as if it had independent force, COGSA \u201cregulates the terms of ocean carriage by the indirect but highly efficacious device of dealing with the terms of the ocean bill of lading\u201d, Gilmore &amp; Black, Admiralty \u00a7 3.25 at 124 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">. With the limitations in \u00a7 4(5) available and generally prevailing, doubtless many such cases are settled by payment of part or all of the amount there provided, without action having been brought or at least without a trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. Iligan advances one argument against New York Navigation\u2019s entitlement to the per package limitation which is not discussed in Judge Ward\u2019s opinion. This is that the contract between Iligan and New York Navigation states that it is to be governed by New York law and \u00a7 7-309(2) of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in New York allows a carrier to limit liability to a value stated in a bill of lading only when the carrier\u2019s rates are dependent on value. Assuming that the argument was advanced below and thus is properly before us, it is without merit in light of UCC \u00a7 7-103, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-22\">Relation of Article to Treaty, Statute, Tariff, Classification or Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b161-23\">To the extent that any treaty or statute of the United States, regulatory statute of this State, or tariff, classification or regulation filed or issued pursuant thereto is applicable, the provisions of this Article are subject thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
