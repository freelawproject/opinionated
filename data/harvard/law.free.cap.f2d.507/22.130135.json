Campbell of the Northern District of Illinois is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-20\">STEVENS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">This appeal questions the sufficiency of the evidence of defendant\u2019s illegal intent. He was found guilty of violating the Mann Act by .transporting Kathy Rogers from Covington, Kentucky, to Hurley, Wisconsin, \u201cfor the purpose of prostitution.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-22\">The case is somewhat unusual because, even under the government\u2019s interpretation of the evidence, defendant had a legitimate reason for taking Rogers to Wisconsin. Whether the legitimate reason was as important as the illegitimate is doubtful, but we certainly cannot say that Rogers\u2019 prostitution was defendant\u2019s sole reason for transportation, and the trial judge, who tried the case without a jury, did not find that it was <em>the </em>dominant reason. Before discussing the evidence we pause to explain our understanding of the government\u2019s burden of proof on the intent issue in a Mann Act ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-23\">The government must prove that an intention to have females engage in immoral conduct is a dominant purpose for the interstate trip.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As it is often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>stated, the dominant purpose test is somewhat ambiguous, both with respect to the precise purpose which is relevant and also with respect to how important the illegal purpose must be when additional motives are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"> In a criminal case we must be concerned with the intent of the defendant on trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purpose of the travelers as a group, or even the purpose of the female passenger, is relevant only insofar as it sheds light on the defendant\u2019s intent. Moreover, when examining defendant\u2019s purpose, the appropriate inquiry is not merely his reason for making the trip but, more precisely, his reason for taking a female companion with him. If the evidence indicates a single-minded reason for her presence, notwithstanding additional motivation for the trip itself, guilt would attach even if the government had the burden of proving that immoral conduct was <em>\u201cthe </em>dominant purpose\u201d rather than merely <em>\u201ca </em>dominant purpose\u201d of the transportation. The distinction between \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d becomes significant only if the defendant may have had more than one reason for transporting the female.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-17\">The use of the word \u201cdominant,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as one sentence in the <em>Mortensen </em>opinion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> indicate that the immoral purpose must be the defendant\u2019s most significant motivation. The statement in <em>Mortensen, </em>however, is clearly dictum because, as the Supreme Court analyzed the record in that case, the purpose of the Mortensens\u2019 trip was entirely innocent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It now appears settled that prostitution or other immoral conduct, need not be the sole reason for the transportation;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Act may be violated if prostitution is <em>a </em>dominant or <em>a </em>compelling and efficient purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Despite the contrary implication suggested by the word \u201cdominant,\u201d it need not be the most important of defendant\u2019s reasons when multiple purposes are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-18\">In the case before us we assume, as defendant argues, that he had substantial legitimate reasons for transporting Rogers from Kentucky to Wisconsin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Nevertheless, when considered in the light most favorable to the government,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the evidence establishes that defendant had been taking all of Rogers\u2019 earnings while they lived together in Covington;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that he became aware of the significant employment possibilities for prostitutes working at the \u201cShowbar\u201d and of the fact that \u201cthe money was good\u201d;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that he \u201ctalked\u201d Rogers into becoming a prostitute;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that at the time of the interstate transportation, he was cognizant of Rogers\u2019 intention to engage in prostitution;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that he gave Rogers certain directions with respect to her prostitution;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that Rogers engaged in prostitution on an average of two or three times per week in Hurley;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that defendant, on at least one occasion, forced Rogers to remain there;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that defendant took all of the earnings derived from Rogers\u2019 prostitution, as well as from her work as a dancer and \u201cB-drinker.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APO\">Defendant\u2019s intent may, of course, be inferred from the conduct of the parties within a reasonable time before and after the transportation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Unquestionably, an important reason for taking Rogers to Wisconsin was to make it possible for her to engage in prostitution and thereby contribute to defendant\u2019s financial support.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Even if we make the assumption that this was not the sole, or even the most important reason for her transportation, we have no doubt that it satisfies the dominant purpose test as we understand it. In short, there was sufficient evidence to prove that defendant transported Rogers \u201cfor the purpose of prostitution\u201d within the meaning of the Mann Act because <em>her </em>prostitution was one of <em>his </em>\u201cdominant\u201d purposes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Our holding today is not foreclosed by United States v.

On one occasion in Hurley defendant refused the money which Rogers earned from an evening\u2019s work. He destroyed the money and beat Rogers, saying that she had not received enough (Tr. 18-19).

In view of the record as a whole, including the fact that defendant has not questioned the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the law, we are satisfied that such a narrow interpretation of the judge\u2019s oral comment, which merely restated the dominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>purpose test as it has repeatedly been phrased in appellate court opinions, would be unwarranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b114-16\">.
