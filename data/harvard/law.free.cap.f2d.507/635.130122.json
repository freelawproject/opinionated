Two men had forced their way into the apartment of Mrs. Boreiszo (the victim). One of the men shot her in the neck and personal property was stolen from her apartment by her assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the conduct of the pre-trial identification was so unnecessarily suggestive as to be a denial of due process of law. At the trial, the victim <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> testified that she eliminated three (Nos. 4-6) of six men in a lineup \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201clooked at the other three\u201d (N.T. 101 at 26a). She then eliminated No. 2, leaving two men in the lineup (N.T. 102 at 27a). The victim\u2019s testimony continued at N.T. 102 \u2014 03:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-18\">\u201cAnd then there were two and I looked at them and I felt that I had heels on while I was looking at them and the night it happened I did not, so I took my shoes off, or one shoe so that I could be on the height that I was on on the ground and then I knew at this height that I was looking directly into Francis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-19\">\u201cQ Did you identify anyone at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-20\">\u201cA I identified No. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-21\">\u201cQ Who was No. 3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-22\">\u201cA Alfred Francis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-23\">\u201cQ Is that the defendant sitting here at the defense counsel table?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-24\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-25\">\u201cQ Was there anyone else in that lineup at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-26\"><em>\u201cA </em>No. I was still there and I did recognize his face from having seen him in some of the pictures that I had looked at and I made the remark that I remembered seeing him in the albums, in some pictures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-27\">\u201cQ Did you ever identify anyone else in that lineup?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-28\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-29\">\u201cQ And are you sure at that time that the person you identified as No. 3, or No. 3 was your assailant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-30\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201cQ Are you sure now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In a May 30, 1974, Memorandum Opinion of the district court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denying the motion to dismiss, the court made these findings, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">\u201cIt was in connection with her [the victim\u2019s] identification of the defendant from the remaining two suspects that discrepancies in the testimony first developed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-32\">\u201cDefense Attorney Gamal distinctly recalls that the victim first identified suspect number one, and only changed her mind after being told by Assistant U. S. Attorney Wilbur to take her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>time and be sure. None of the other witnesses present recall the victim\u2019s having ever identified suspect one as her assailant. Instead they remember her having remarked that she recognized him but, on reflection, realized that this was because she had seen his photograph in one of the albums previously displayed to her. I am convinced that all of the witnesses testified to the facts as best they recalled them. However, I find as a fact that the victim never identified suspect one as her assailant. Instead I suspect that she stated T recognize him \u2014 number one\u2019 and then stood away from the viewing window. This initial recognition was probably misinterpreted by defense attorney Gamal as a statement that \u2018Number one is the man.\u2019 I find the subsequent explanation of her recognition believable and consistent with all the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">\u201cThe identification of defendant Francis, number three, as her assailant followed shortly after the recognition of number one. I do not think the identification was the result merely of elimination of the other five suspects, leaving only one. Had defendant Francis not been her assailant the victim would have identified no one, as evidenced by her failure to select any of the photographs shown to her during the first sessions of photographic identification. The victim made only one identification at the lineup and testified in Court that she feels she was right about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cI conclude as a matter of law that on the totality of the surrounding circumstances the conduct of the lineup was not unduly prejudicial as fatally to taint a subsequent in-court identification. Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 4, [90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387] (1970).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">These findings are supported by the victim\u2019s testimony as noted above. Weighing all the circumstances, we find no substantial likelihood of misidentification. See Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970); see also Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">We agree with the district court that the comments of the United States Attorney to the victim during the lineup to \u201ctake her time\u201d were unwise. See Memorandum of May 30, 1974, <em>supra, </em>at 21a. In order to avoid \u201c[a] major factor contributing to the high incidence of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification [which] has been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification,\u201d see United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 228, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), law enforcement authorities must take great care to avoid suggestive identification procedures. See also <em>id. </em>at 236 n. 26, 87 S.Ct. at 1937 (a model statute \u201cwould enjoin the police from suggesting to any viewer that one or more persons in the lineup had been arrested as a suspect\u201d). In Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 385, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), the Court noted that there was no evidence of verbal guidance by the police. See also Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 6, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970). <em>Cf. </em>Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 443, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 1129, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969) (\u201c[i]n effect, the police repeatedly said to the witness, <em>\u2018This </em>is the man\u2019 \u201d). In Clemons v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 408 F.2d 1230, 1237-1238 (1970), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">\u201cAny well-run department will presumably prepare \u2014 and enforce \u2014 careful regulations in this regard for the guidance of its personnel, as it will also do with respect to police station lineups. Apart from photographic leads and the familiar post-arrest police station confrontation, there are possible variations in the circumstances of arrest and detention where the right to counsel, as well as the demands of due process, will have to be defined and measured from case to case by reference to the reasonableness of the police conduct under the particular circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Any instructions to a witness to be careful or take her time should be given prior to the start of the lineup identification, rather than in the course of such a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae-\">The district court judgment and commitment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-15\">. Many days before the lineup the victim had selected his photograph, as well as two others, and focused her attention on him as her assailant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">.
