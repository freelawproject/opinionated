The defendant Diehl, a McKeesport, Pennsylvania, policeman, arrived two or three minutes after the accident occurred. He transported Polite, his two children, and a girl who had been riding in the other car, to McKeesport Hospital. On Diehl\u2019s instructions, Polite\u2019s car was towed away by a private towing service.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Polite was placed under arrest at the hospital on charges of driving under the influence of liquor and disorderly conduct. Polite alleges that while he was held in custody at the police station the defendant policemen maliciously beat him and sprayed chemical mace in his eyes. Then, Polite claims, he was taken before a magistrate and forced to plead guilty to charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver\u2019s license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law. The following morning, after a hearing, Polite was bound over on the drunken driving charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Approximately 23 months after Polite\u2019s arrest he filed a civil rights action against Diehl and Lofstrom. A little less than 24 months after the arrest<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he filed another suit against Rendulic, Chancio, Hanna, Donet, Sokol and Lofs-trom, alleging the same violations of his civil rights raised in the first suit. All the defendants were McKeesport policemen. The two actions were consolidated in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">The complaints both alleged that the defendant policemen, \u201cacting in concert and under color of state law,\u201d violated the Civil Rights Acts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in depriving Polite of due process of law and equal protection of the laws in that (1) \u201cPlaintiff was detained and incarcerated without a warrant, probable cause, explanation of the charges, explanation of his rights or the opportunity to consult with counsel;\u201d (2) \u201cPlaintiff was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting [and] physical abuse by the defendants in that he was repeatedly beaten, kicked, punched and while imprisoned in a cell was subjected to the application of liquid chemical mace to the eyes, all of which caused serious and severe injuries to the plaintiff,\u201d and \u201cdenied medical attention for the injuries received in the beatings administered by the defendants;\u201d (3) \u201cBy the use of threats, intimidation and interrogation was forced by the defendants to plead guilty to the charges alleged;\u201d and (4) \u201cAt the time of the collision the defendants, without explanation, unlawfully seized the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">The defendants denied the allegations in Polite\u2019s complaints, and then filed a motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground that Pennsylvania\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for actions based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>on false arrest<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> barred plaintiff\u2019s suits. Polite, in reply, contended that the appropriate statute of limitations was Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year statute pertaining to suits for personal injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Following a hearing on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in favor of the defendants in both actions. The district court construed Gagliardi v. Lynn,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the leading case on the scope of Pennsylvania\u2019s statute of limitations for false arrest actions, as holding that that statute \u201capplies to the entire course of conduct in cases involving incarceration preceded by arrest, including any incidental assault and battery.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying the one-year false arrest statute of limitations to the entirety of Polite\u2019s complaints, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motions since more than a year had elapsed between the alleged violations of Polite\u2019s rights and the filing of the actions. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Polite contends that the district court should have applied Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year statute of limitations pertaining to personal injury actions instead of the one-year statute of limitations relating to actions for false arrest. Although Polite has not challenged the district court\u2019s application of a single statute of limitations to the numerous claims raised in his complaints, we must determine whether the district court should have applied a separate statute to each cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The district court correctly applied the one-year statute of limitations to Polite\u2019s allegations of an unlawful arrest, but it erred in holding that the one-year statute extended to the assault and battery, conversion and guilty plea aspects of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Since the Civil Rights Acts contain no statute of limitations, the limitation to be applied is that which would be applicable in the courts of the state in which the federal court is sitting had an action seeking similar relief been brought under state law. Henig v. Odorioso, 385 F.2d 491 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied 390 U.S. 1016, 88 S.Ct. 1269, 20 L.Ed.2d 166 (1968). Consequently, this Court has held that Pennsylvania\u2019s one-year statute of limitations pertaining to suits for false arrest is applicable to federal civil rights actions for a false arrest allegedly committed in Pennsylvania. Hileman v. Knable, 391 F.2d 596 (3d Cir. 1968); Henig v. Odorioso, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the bar of Pennsylvania\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to the unlawful arrest aspect of Polite\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\"><em>Gagliardi, supra, </em>however, affords no support for the view, adopted by the district court, that the limitations statute applicable to actions for false arrest \u201capplies <em>to the entire course of conduct </em>in cases involving incarceration preceded by arrest, <em>including any incidental assault and </em>battery.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (emphasis added) In <em>Gagliardi, </em>the only issue was whether the trial court erred in holding that the one-year false arrest statute barred an action for false imprisonment. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in affirming, stated that \u201cconfinement is inextricably intertwined with an unlawful arrest,\u201d and \u201cBy the same token, <em>if the false arrest involved only a touching and no confinement, </em>and we were forced to choose between limitation statutes relating to false arrest and battery, we would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>opt for the former.\u201d 446 Pa. at 150, 285 A.2d at 112. (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Putting aside the fact that the latter statement was dictum, the language quoted refers only to a \u201ctouching\u201d or battery committed in accomplishing an arrest. The assault alleged here occurred not when the plaintiff was arrested at the hospital, but considerably later while he was being held in the police station. Therefore, since the alleged assault and battery was not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the alleged false arrest, plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for assault and battery would not, under Pennsylvania law, be subsumed under the one-year statute applicable to suits for false arrest. Rather, if plaintiff had brought an analogous action in state court, that court would have applied Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year personal injury statute to the assault and battery. The district court here, therefore, must do the same. Thomas v. Howard, 455 F.2d 228 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The district court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s allegations of a coerced guilty plea and the illegal seizure of plaintiff\u2019s automobile on the basis of the one-year false arrest statute of limitations. What has been said with regard to the assault and battery allegations demonstrates that the district court erred in doing so, since that alleged conduct was separable from the false arrest. The Pennsylvania statute of limitations applicable to state suits analogous to the allegation of the unlawful seizure of plaintiff\u2019s automobile is the six-year statute for actions for the recovery of goods. The state cause of action most similar to plaintiff\u2019s allegation of a guilty plea coerced by physical abuse is one for wrongful personal injury not resulting in death, to which a two-year statute is applicable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court therefore erred in summarily disposing of these two causes of action on the basis of the one-year false arrest statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Both parties to this appeal contend that plaintiff\u2019s entire complaint should be governed by a single limitations statute. Such a ruling, however, would be contrary to the holdings in <em>Henig, supra, </em>and <em>Thomas, supra, </em>that the district court must apply the same statute of limitations that a state court would apply in a- state action seeking similar relief. Moreover, applying a single statute would have an anamalous result, since joining a claim for unlawful arrest with one for \u201cpolice brutality\u201d would either extend the statute which would be applicable to the unlawful arrest or contract the statute that would be applicable to the brutality claim if plaintiff had raised only one of the claims or had raised them in separate actions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">We note that the defendants filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the basis that the record contained no evidence to sustain plaintiff\u2019s allegations of a coerced guilty plea or of an unlawful seizure of his automobile. Although the record in its present state may not contain sufficient averments to withstand such a motion, since there is no indication in the record that this mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tion was considered by or pressed in the district court and since the parties may wish to present additional facts when the question is squarely addressed, we leave that issue to be resolved upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment did not specifically raise the question whether the alleged assault, as described in the depositions, constituted grounds for relief under section 1983, nor did the briefs on this appeal deal with the issue, except in a fleeting reference.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, it would appear premature to address it at this time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for the defendants on the causes of action alleging false arrest will be affirmed, but the judgment on the causes of action alleging assault and battery, a coerced guilty plea and unlawful seizure of the automobile will be reversed, and the ease will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">.

Plaintiff\u2019s complaints, which are identical in this respect, invoke 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1974) in their jurisdictional statement only. Plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are then formulated under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1974) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 (1974). The district court, apparently giving the complaints a broad reading, disposed of both of them under section 1983. Polite v. Diehl, Civ. Nos. 71-637; 71-760 (W.D.

Depositions had been taken of Diehl, Polite, the driver and passenger in the other car involved in the accident and the custodian of the records of the McKeesport Police Department. Polite had also filed an ophthalmologist\u2019s report. The defendants later filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the ground that the record contained no support for plaintiffs allegations \u201cexclusive of false imprisonment, false arrest and assault and battery.\u201d (Appendix at 21a) The district court, in light of its disposition of the preceding motion for summary judgment, did not act on the supplemental motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">.

Cremins, 308 F.2d 187, 190 (9th Cir. 1962), adverted to the possible difficulties resulting from applying a separate statute of limitations to each constitutional violation alleged in a Section 1983 suit. There, however, the court was dealing with a single act by the defendant which violated several of plaintiffs constitutional rights. In the present case, however, the district court was dealing with separate acts where the alleged constitutional deprivations were not \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d Moreover, the statutory framework in <em>Smith </em>was different from that here. The <em>Smith </em>court was faced with a choice between separate limitation statutes applicable to each analogous common law tort and a broad statute applicable to any \u201cliability created by statute.\u201d The court decided that the broad statute was applicable. No such broad statute of limitations is available under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\">.

Polite\u2019s Complaints alleged violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights and sequential applicability of \u00a7 1983, and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ants\u2019 Answers denied violation of \u201cany\u201d constitutional rights. The applicability of \u00a7 1983 was squarely presented here by the briefs of Polite and the defendants. The defendants\u2019 brief specifically urged that \u201cthe plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under the Civil Rights Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The majority has not served the judicial economy in limiting its disposition to the statutory limitations issue presented by the defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and eschewing the substantive issue as to applicability of \u00a7 1983 raised by the defendants\u2019 Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The circumstance that the district court did not decide the threshold question presented by the Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment is of no consequence. Nor is it of critical significance that the district court erred in premising its grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to Polite's assault and battery and conversion allegations on Pennsylvania\u2019s one-year false arrest statute of limitations. It is settled that an appeal brings up the ultimate question whether a judgment below is right or wrong, and an appellate court may affirm the judgment if found to be correct, although based on incorrect reasoning. United States v. Rose, 346 F.2d 985, 989 (3d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 979, 86 S.Ct. 551, 15 L.Ed.2d 469 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The facts giving rise to plaintiff\u2019s actions may be highlighted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">On the evening of August 17, 1969, at about 6:30 p. m., an automobile operated by Polite, in which his two young children were passengers, ploughed into the rear of an automobile which had stopped at an intersection in compliance with a \u201cStop\u201d warning sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The defendant Diehl, a McKeesport, Pennsylvania policeman, arrived at the scene of the accident two or three minutes after it occurred. He transported Polite, his two children, and a girl who had been riding in the struck car, to McKeesport Hospital. One of Polite\u2019s children was then suffering from a bleeding nose occasioned by the collision. Polite\u2019s car, which had sustained a smashed radiator, was towed away by a private towing service on Diehl\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Polite was placed under arrest at the hospital for alleged driving under the influence of liquor and disorderly conduct. He was taken to the police station about 7 p.m. He was given a hearing before a magistrate several hours later on charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver\u2019s license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law. The magistrate fined Polite $205.00 and imposed costs of $15.00. Polite paid the fines and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Polite was given a hearing on the drunken driving charge the next morning before the same magistrate. He was bound over under bond of $1,000.00 for action by the grand jury and released from custody. The grand jury later failed to indict Polite.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">On July 8, 1971, Polite filed a civil rights action against the defendants at Appeal No. 72-1770. He filed his action on August 11, 1971 against the defendant policemen at Appeal No. 72 \u2014 2013. The first action came almost 23 months after Polite\u2019s arrest on August 17, 1969; the second action almost two years later. The actions were consolidated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">The complaints alleged in relevant part that the defendant policemen, \u201cacting in concert and under color of state law,\u201d violated the Civil Rights Acts in depriving Polite of the due process of law and equal protection of the laws guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment in that (1) \u201cPlaintiff was detained and incarcerated without a warrant, probable cause, explanation of the charges, explanation of his rights or the opportunity to consult with counsel,\u201d and \u201cBy use of threats, intimidation and interrogation was forced by the defendants to plead guilty to the charges alleged\u201d ; (2) \u201cPlaintiff was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting [and] physical abuse by the defendants in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>he was repeatedly beaten, kicked, punched and while imprisoned in a cell was subjected to the application of liquid chemical mace to the eyes, all of which caused serious and severe injuries to the plaintiff,\u201d and \u201cdenied medical attention for the injuries received in the beatings administered by the defendants\u201d ; and (3) \u201cAt the time of the collision the defendants without explanation unlawfully seized the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The defendants filed timely Answers in which they denied the allegations in Polite\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Polite took depositions in August 1971 of Diehl; Kenneth Carroll, Records Custodian of the McKeesport Police Department; and Esther and Rosemary Oros, driver and passenger, respectively, of the struck car.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Polite\u2019s deposition was taken by the defendants in August 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">All of the depositions taken were filed on September 29, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Polite\u2019s \u201cPre-Trial Narrative Statement\u201d was filed on January 6, 1972. The \u201cMedical Report\u201d of Dr. Philip C. Grana, an opthalmologist, was attached to, and made part of it. The defendants\u2019 \u201cPre-Trial Narrative Statement\u201d was filed on March 15, 1972. A pre-trial conference was had on March 24, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">On April 5, 1972, defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, under Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P., on the ground that Pennsylvania\u2019s false arrest one-year statute of limitations barred plaintiff\u2019s actions. Polite, in reply, contended that the appropriate statute of limitations was Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year statute of limitations pertaining to suits for personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">On May 1, 1972 the defendants filed a \u201cSupplemental Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d on the prevailing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">The district court entered judgments in favor of the defendants in both actions in a \u201cMemorandum and Order\u201d filed July 7, 1972, following a hearing that day on their \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">In doing so it held that the Pennsylvania one-year statute of limitations extended to all aspects of Polite\u2019s actions. The instant appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">What has been said brings me to the threshold question:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">Are Fourteenth Amendment rights violated when a policeman\u2019s fists give a \u201cblack eye\u201d to one under arrest; otherwise stated, is infliction of a \u201cblack eye\u201d a federal ease?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">That Polite suffered no more than a commonplace black eye, which \u201chealed,\u201d with \u201cno complications,\u201d in some five days, after treatments consisting of application of \u201ceye drops,\u201d is established by the \u201cMedical Report\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his attending physician, Dr. Philip C.

Taken together they make out a case of \u201csimple battery\u201d which is defined as \u201cAny unlawful beating, or other wrongful physical violence or constraint, inflicted on a human being without his consent . . . <em>not accompanied by circumstances of </em>aggravation, <em>or not resulting in grievous bodily </em>injury(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">I am of the opinion that <em>standing alone, </em>an ordinary assault and battery committed by a policeman upon one under arrest does not violate Fourteenth Amendment guarantees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and thus does not bring into play the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, which affords the remedy of an action at law, or suit in equity, for \u201cdeprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and [the] laws,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1343(3) which creates federal jurisdiction as to civil actions \u201cTo redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, ... of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Here Polite\u2019s complaints alleged only that \u201che was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting . . . [and] physical abuse by the defendants which caused serious and severe injuries to the plaintiff.\u201d The complaints did <em>not </em>allege that the \u201cphysical abuse\u201d was administered by the defendants (1) in the course of performance of their official duties; <em>or </em>(2) as summary punishment in lieu of regular procedures of trial and sentence; <em>or </em>(3) that the alleged physical abuse amounted to \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d proscribed by the Eighth Amendment; <em>or </em>(4) that it was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d The complaints state only <em>con-clusionary allegations of constitutional violations </em>under color of state law, viz., deprivation of \u201cthe due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Polite\u2019s theory of his case is epitomized in \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Pre-Trial Narrative Statement\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cDuring the course of his detention, the plaintiff was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting by the individual defendants. He was also subjected to physical abuse by the defendants in that he was beaten, kicked, and punched by some or all of them. While imprisoned in a cell, the plaintiff was subjected to the application of liquid chemical mace to his eyes, all of which caused him serious and severe injuries. All of the aforesaid was committed without provocation or reasonable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The sum of that theory is that any assault by a policeman on one under arrest \u2014 irrespective of attending circumstances, the nature and degree of the assault, and its consequences \u2014 constitutes a violation of the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The circumstances attending the assault and its nature, degree and consequences, are respectively spelled out in Polite\u2019s deposition as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Officer Rendulic, after saying \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this cat? . . . I\u2019m hot and irritated already. Don\u2019t give me no hard time,\u201d suddenly and without provocation, beat Polite with his fists, dragged him into a cell and then sprayed mace in his eyes, with resulting partial swelling of Polite\u2019s face and irritation of his eyes, of five days\u2019 duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Polite\u2019s deposition in sum makes out a state tort of simple assault and battery unattended by any circumstance constituting \u201cdeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and [the] laws.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">Present \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1343(3) are derived from the Act of April 20, 1871, ch. 22, \u00a7 1, 17 Stat. 13, entitled \u201cAn Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes.\u201d The 1871 Act is commonly referred to as the Ku Klux Klan Act because it was spawned by Ku Klux Klan unconscionable outrages inflicted upon black citizens and Union sympathizers in the post-Civil War era, unrestrained by state law enforcement agencies and courts which were unwilling or unable to cope with Klan outlawry.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">The historic background of the 1871 Act was outlined in the leading case of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), as follows, at pages 174 \u2014 175, 81 S.Ct. 473, at page 477, 5 L.Ed.2d 492:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">\u201cThis Act of April 20, 1871, sometimes called \u2018the third \u201cforce bill,\u201d \u2019 was passed by a Congress that had the Klan \u2018particularly in mind.\u2019 The debates are replete with references to the lawless conditions existing in the South in 1871. There was available to the Congress during these debates a report, nearly 600 pages in length, dealing with the activities of the Klan and the inability of the state governments to cope with it. This report was drawn on by many of the speakers. It was not the unavailability of state remedies but the failure of cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tain States to enforce the laws with an equal hand that furnished the powerful momentum behind this \u2018force bill.\u2019 \u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The significance of the historic background of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act, was recently stressed in District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418 (1973), in this statement at page 425, 93 S.Ct. 602, at page 607, 34 L.Ed.2d 613:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cAny analysis of the purposes and scope of \u00a7 1983 must take cognizance of the events and passions of the time at which it was enacted. After the Civil War ended in 1865, race relations in the South became increasingly turbulent. The Ku Klux Klan was organized by southern whites in 1866, and a wave of murders and assaults was launched against both blacks and Union sympathizers.\u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Prior to enactment of the 1871 Act, state courts had sole jurisdiction with respect to actions seeking vindication of fundamental rights secured by the federal Constitution and laws, since there then existed no general federal-question jurisdiction in the lower federal courts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in light of the fact that \u201cCongress relied on the state courts to vindicate essential rights arising under the Constitution and federal laws.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">In the interval between July 28, 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment became effective, and the enactment of the 1871 Act, state courts in the main failed to give effect to the Amendment whose main purpose was to establish the citizenship of emancipated negroes and thereby sequentially extend to them enjoyment of the guarantees of the Amendment. In numerous instances, state courts also failed to afford the protection of state constitutions and state laws to aggrieved citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">As indicated by its title, the 1871 Act was enacted to open the doors of the federal judicial system to citizens deprived of fundamental rights under color of state law by creating (1) a right to bring an action at law or in equity for vindication of fundamental guarantees, and (2) federal jurisdiction to entertain such an, action. As earlier stated, present sections 1983 and 1343(3), derived from \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act, respectively afford the federal remedy and jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">The \u201cseveral purposes\u201d of the 1871 Act were highlighted in Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra </em>, 365 U.S. at 173-174, 81 S.Ct. at 477, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-14\">\u201cThe legislation . . . had several purposes. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-16\"><em>\u201cFirst, </em>it might . . . override certain kinds of state laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-18\"><em>\u201cSecond, </em>it provided a remedy where state law was inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-19\"><em>\u201c[Tjhird </em>... to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">In elaboration of the foregoing, the Court further said at page 180, 81 S.Ct. at 480:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-21\">\u201cIt is abundantly clear that one reason the legislation was passed was to afford a federal right in federal courts because, <em>by reason of prejudice, passion, neglect, intolerance or otherwise, state laws might not be enforced and the claims of citizens to the enjoyment of rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment might be denied by the state agencies.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">The holding in Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>was recently epitomized in Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693 (1973), in this capsule statement at page 699, 93 S.Ct. 1785, at page 1790, 36 L.Ed.2d 596:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-23\"><em>\u201cThere the Court held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, </em>which was derived from \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, <em>was intended to provide private parties a cause of action </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>for abuses of official authority which resulted in the deprivation of constitutional rights, privileges, and immunities.\u201d </em>(footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The gamut of \u00a7 1983 was articulated in Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225 (1972), as follows, at pages 238\u2014239, 92 S.Ct. 2151, at page 2160, 32 L.Ed.2d 705:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ad8-dedup-0\">\u201cSection 1983 was originally \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. 17 Stat. 13. It was \u2018modeled\u2019 on \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, and was enacted for the express purpose of \u2018enforcpng] the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 17 Stat. 13. The predecessor of \u00a7 1983 was thus an important part of the basic alteration in our federal system wrought in the Reconstruction era through federal legislation and constitutional amendment. As a result of the new structure of law that emerged in the post-Civil War era \u2014 and especially of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was its centerpiece \u2014 the role of the Federal Government as a guarantor of <em>basic federal rights </em>against state power was clearly established. . <em>Section 1983 opened the federal courts to private citizens, offering a uniquely federal remedy against incursions under the claimed authority of state law upon rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the Nation.\u201d </em>(footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Supreme Court has specifically held that \u00a7 1983, like the Fourteenth Amendment which is its centerpiece, \u201cis of only limited scope\u201d reaching only \u201cdeprivations of rights\u201d under color of state law and not \u201cpurely private conduct.\u201d In doing so, it said in District of Columbia v. Carter, <em>supra, </em>409 U.S. at pages 424-425, 93 S.Ct. at page 606:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\u201cLike the Amendment upon which it based, \u00a7 1983 <em>is of only limited scope. </em>The statute deals only with those deprivations of rights that are accomplished under the color of the law of \u2018any State or Territory.\u2019 It does not reach purely private conduct and, with the exception of the Territories, actions of the Federal Government and its officers are at least facially exempt from its proscriptions.\u201d (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">This Court has taken cognizance of the limited scope of \u00a7 1983, in holding that improper medical treatment of a state prisoner is not a deprivation of fundamental rights secured by the federal Constitution and laws,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the same is true with respect to a denial to a state prisoner of necessary medical treatment for an ear infection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have further ruled that a state prisoner\u2019s complaint which alleged that he was compelled to work on a press which was dangerous and unfit, failed to state a \u00a7 1983 cause of action. In doing so we held that a tort committed by a state official acting under color of state law is <em>not </em>\u201cin and of itself, sufficient to show an invasion of a person\u2019s right under the [\u00a7 1983] Act.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The rationale of our stated view was later explicated in Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272 (3d Cir. 1972), where our brother Aldisert, speaking for the Court, said at page 278:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u201cIt becomes important to delineate that conduct which is actionable in state courts as a tort, and that which is actionable in federal courts under \u00a7 1983. The two rights of action do not always stand <em>in pari materia. </em>Some common law and statutory torts, although actionable in a state forum, do not rise to constitutional dimensions. The converse is equally true. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Conduct may be actionable as a deprivation of constitutional rights where no force and violence has been utilized, and there exists no orthodox counterpart of state common law or statutory relief available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We emphasized that \u201crecovery under \u00a7 1983 is strictly limited to deprivations under the federal constitution and <em>federal </em>law,\u201d in Smith v. Spina, 477 F.2d 1140, 1144 (3d Cir. 1973). We there held that \u00a7 1983 did not subsume state tort causes of action based on theories of negligence, <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>and intentional assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In United States v. Delerme, 457 F.2d 156 (3d Cir. 1972), where we held that a policeman violated due process of law guarantees in \u201cadministering a physical beating as <em>punishment </em>for a traffic violation,\u201d (emphasis supplied) we said at page 161:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201c[W]e do not . . . intimate that every assault by a police officer or official of a state or territory <em>ipso facto </em>transfers a state offense to an offense of constitutional dimensions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 [the criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1983].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">We recently held that an issue of due process deprivation within the ambit of \u00a7 1983 was presented in a prisoner\u2019s complaint which alleged that defendant prisoner guards had \u201cstopped him from defending himself\u201d when he was attacked by a fellow convict with a knife with, resulting <em>loss of an eye. </em>Curtis v. Everette, 489 F.2d 516, 517 (3d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 995, 416 U.S. 995, 94 S.Ct. 2409, 40 L.Ed.2d 774 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">It is imperative to note at this point that the Supreme Court has not passed on the issue whether an assault and battery, simple or aggravated, <em>per se, </em>affords a \u00a7 1983 remedy, when it is committed under color of state law on one in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The courts of appeals and district courts have ruled on the issue with divergent results without an equivalent amount of analysis of Supreme Court cases, later discussed, which they have cited in support of their dispositions, viz., Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945); and United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">An analysis of the cited Supreme Court cases, and the oft-cited Crews v. United States, 160 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1947), will be prefaced by discussion of circuit court <em>assault </em>cases which have denied or sanctioned application of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">In Cole v. Smith, 344 F.2d 721 (8th Cir. 1965), the Court affirmed the dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 complaint which alleged that the plaintiff, a prisoner, had suffered \u201cscars, a partial loss of hearing, and a disfigured ear\u201d as a result of an assault by employees of the Minnesota Security Hospital. 344 F.2d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">In doing so, the Court said at pages 723-724:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-16\">\u201cThe Civil Rights Act provides in pertinent part protection to an individual who is deprived of constitutionally protected rights under color of state law. It is now well settled that a right so violated must be a \u2018federal right,\u2019 i. e. a right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, for the violation of which a complaint may, in proper cases, be made under color of state law, rather than one arising from individual wrongs of private citizens one to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-17\">\u201cTherefore, <em>the real matter for consideration </em>by us in this appeal <em>is whether the alleged assaults </em>which appellant asserts . . . <em>were of such nature as to deprive him of a constitutional right under color of state law, </em>as opposed to assaults of a private nature by individuals, not constitutionally so protected. If the assaults . did in fact occur, they could possibly be violative of some state law, but \u2018the problem\u2019 confronting us \u2018is not whether state law has been violated,\u2019 but rather whether a constitutional right has been violated.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In Davis v.

Stripped of all the non-essential verbage, the complaint shows that appellant was caused to come into contact with tear gas used by the jail officers in quelling the disturbance in the prison. Even if this constituted an assault, it was insufficient to sustain an action for relief under the civil rights statute, Cole v.

Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973), it was held that a complaint which alleged that the plaintiff was arrested without probable cause and beaten with brass knuckles by one Carlson, a policeman, sufficiently alleged a cause of action against the policeman under \u00a7 1983. In so holding, the Court said at page 363:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\u201cAn arrest without probable cause, <em>or an arrest made with excessive force, </em>constitutes an <em>unreasonable seizure </em>in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">A divided Second Circuit Court recently held in Johnson v.

California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), must stand for the proposition that, <em>quite apart from any \u2018specific\u2019 of the Bill of Rights, application of undue force by law enforcement officers deprives a suspect of liberty without due process of law. </em>If Rochin suffered such a violation of his constitutional rights by the police as to be entitled to invalidation of a conviction obtained as a consequence, he also was the victim of a violation sufficient to sustain an action under the Civil Rights Act. . . . \u201d (footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Judge Moore, in a dissenting opinion, disagreed with the majority\u2019s \u201cpolice brutality\u201d categorization of Fuller\u2019s conduct. He pointed to the majority\u2019s statement that the complaint \u201calleged a single, spontaneous incident,\u201d and said with respect to it that the allegations as to \u201ca few blows to plaintiff\u201d did not constitute deprivation of due process. 481 F.2d at 1034-1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">The Fourth Circuit, in Jenkins v. Av-erett, 424 F.2d 1228 (1970), held that a white policeman who <em>shot </em>and wounded an 18-year old negro, in flight from the scene of a street brawl, was liable in a \u00a7 1983 action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">In reversing the district court\u2019s holding that albeit the plaintiff was subjected to reckless use of excessive force, his right of recovery was limited to his pendent state claim, the Court said at page 1232:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-16\">\u201cInjuries arbitrarily inflicted by the police are constitutionally cognizable and remediable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">It must be noted that the Court held the Fourth Amendment to be applicable, citing its guarantee of \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d In doing so, it stated <em>\u201cIt is likewise clear that this shield covers the individual\u2019s physical integrity.\u201d </em>424 F.2d at 1232. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Fifth Circuit held in Tolbert v. Bragan, 451 F.2d 1020 (1971), that a \u00a7 1983 cause of action was presented in a prisoner\u2019s complaint which alleged \u201cfive jailers beat him severely about the head and body with blackjacks, leaving him badly injured,\u201d and that the assault was \u201cracially motivated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In reversing the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, the Court, without adverting to the \u201cracially motivated\u201d allegations, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\"><em>\u201cSevere physical abuse of prisoners by their keepers without cause or provocation is actionable under the Civil Rights Act.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The Court cited only circuit court cases in support of the stated holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The Seventh Circuit, citing Screws v. United States, <em>supra, </em>held in Collum v. Butler, 421 F.2d 1257, 1259 (1970), that where an arrested motorist was severely beaten by policemen, that use of force by the police which is \u201cunreasonable and unnecessary\u201d violates the \u201cconstitutional right of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The same Circuit, however, cited and relied upon Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>in Hardwick v. Hurley, 289 F.2d 529 (1961), where it held that a \u00a7 1983 claim was presented by a complaint which alleged that the plaintiff, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, had been beaten, stomped and kicked following his arrest in punishment for his refusal to take a drunken driving test.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The Ninth Circuit, in Wiltsie v. California Department of Corrections, 406 F.2d 515 (1968), held that a civil rights action was presented in a prisoner\u2019s complaint which alleged six prison guards had beaten him with fists and billyclubs on his head, shoulder, ribs, spinal column and buttocks, and that he may suffer permanent disability as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">It merits observation that after reference to circuit court cases, the Court cited, at page 517, \u201cAs additional precedent for our ruling,\u201d United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966), where the Supreme Court sustained indictments under the criminal provisions of the Civil Rights Act which charged that the defendants, private citizens, acting in cahoots with state officials, had <em>killed </em>three civil rights activists as \u201cpunishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">The Ninth Circuit cited and applied Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>in Dodd v. Spokane County, Washington, 393 F.2d 330 (1968), where the complaint, without further specification, alleged that the plaintiff prisoner was beaten, by the six defendants, under color of state law, as \u201cpunishment\u201d for refusal to testify against an accused in a criminal trial, and in Brown v. Brown, 368 F.2d 992, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 868, 87 S.Ct. 133, 17 L.Ed.2d 95 (1966), where the prisoner\u2019s complaint alleged that he had been \u201cbeat[en], kicked, knocked, stomped, thrashed, and cursed\u201d by three unnamed \u201cagents of the San Quentin Prison,\u201d acting under instructions of the defendant Governor of California and Warden of San Quentin Prison, in an effort to \u201ccoerce\u201d the plaintiff into \u201cmaking a statement about another case of their interest\u201d and to exact his confession of involvement in other crimes. 368 F.2d at 993\u2014994 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">The Tenth Circuit held in Bethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504 (1969), Circuit Judge Seth dissenting, that an issue of cruel and unusual punishment, violative of the Eighth Amendment was presented by a prisoner\u2019s complaint which alleged that he had been kicked, and beaten about the face, head, and body, and had been \u201cknocked around a number of times\u201d by another prisoner without interference by prison officials. <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">In doing so, it said in relevant part at page 509:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-16\">\u201c[Tjaking the prisoners\u2019 version, we must conclude . . . that the alleged mistreatment amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In defining the test to be applied in determining whether the force used against a prisoner amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, the Court said at page 509:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201c[T]he ultimate issue is whether the assault as found by the factfinder is sufficiently severe <em>in the circumstances to shock the conscience of </em>a <em>reasonable man.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).

Labiak, 368 F.2d 338 (1966), where police officers \u201cused their night sticks to dislodge . from his property\u201d one who had been arrested for breach of the peace, the Tenth Circuit, citing Screws v. United States, <em>supra, </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cA person unlawfully beaten by an arresting officer is denied the right of due process of law, . . .

(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9X\">What has been said brings me to a discussion, in chronological order, of the Supreme Court cases, which as earlier stated, have been cited without equivalent analysis in the foregoing circuit court dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941), it was held that \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 20 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 51, 52, present \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242, 18 U.S.C.A., (criminal counterparts, respectively, of \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3), and 1983, 42 U.S.C.A.), permitted a criminal prosecution for violations of \u201crights\u201d \u201csecured\u201d to qualified voters by Article I; \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, in a Louisiana primary election for nomination of candidates for the United States Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">In so holding, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\">\u201cThe right of the voters at the primary to have their votes counted is, as we have stated, a right or privilege secured by the Constitution, and to this \u00a7 20 also gives protection. The alleged acts of appellees were committed in the course of their performance of duties under the Louisiana statute requiring them to count the ballots, to record the result of the count, and to certify the result of the election. <em>Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken \u2018under color of\u2019 state law.\u201d </em>313 U.S. at 325-326, 61 S.Ct. at 1043 (footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">In Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 93, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945), two law enforcement officers were found guilty on a \u00a7 20 indictment of the Criminal Code which charged them with \u201cwillfully\u201d depriving one Hall, a 30-year old negro, of his Fourteenth Amendment right \u201cnot to be deprived of life without due process of law\u201d <em>when they beat him to death, </em>in effecting his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">The Supreme Court reversed the defendants\u2019 conviction on the ground that the trial court had failed to properly instruct the jury that in order to convict, they were required to find that the defendants \u201chad the purpose to deprive the prisoner of a constitutional right, e.g., the right to be tried by a court rather than by ordeal.\u201d 325 U.S. at 107, 65 S.Ct. at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">In doing so it rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that \u00a7 20<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>insofar as it makes criminal acts in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it provides no ascertainable standard of guilt in light of the broad and fluid definitions of due process and their inherent uncharted potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Of critical significance is the fact that in holding \u00a7 20 constitutional the Court construed it to extend <em>only </em>to acts committed with the intent to deprive a person of a <em>right made specific (1) by the express terms of the Constitution; or </em>(2) <em>federal laws; or </em>(3) <em>by pre-existing decisions interpreting the Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In doing so the Court stated in rele- \u2022 vant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201c[T]he specific intent required by the Act is an intent to deprive a person of <em>a right which has been made specific either by the express terms of the Constitution or laws of the United States or by decisions interpreting them. . . . </em>He who defies a <em>decision interpreting the Constitution </em>knows precisely what he is doing. Of course, willful conduct cannot make definite that which is undefined. But willful violators of <em>constitutional requirements, which have been defined, </em>certainly are in no position to say that they have no adequate advance notice that they would be visited with punishment. When they act willfully in the sense in which we use the word, they act in open defiance or in reckless disregard of <em>a constitutional requirement which has been made specific and definite. </em>When they are convicted for so acting, they are not punished for violating <em>an unknowable something.\u201d </em>325 U.S. at 104-105, 65 S.Ct. at 1037. (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">It must be noted that in limiting application of the due process clause in \u00a7 20 cases to <em>\u201cdefined\u201d concepts of due process extant at the time of the alleged violation of the section,- </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq\"><em>\u201cWe take the course which makes it possible to preserve the entire Act and save all parts of it from constitutional challenge. If Congress desires to give the Act wider scope, it may find ways of doing so. Moreover, </em>here as in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469 [60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311], we <em>are dealing with a situation where the interpretation of the Act which we adopt does not preclude any state from punishing any act made criminal by its own laws.

(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), six negro children and their parents filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint against the City of Chicago and 13 of its police officers in which they alleged invasion of their home and search without a warrant, and the arrest and detention of the male parent without a warrant and without arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">The district court dismissed the complaint on its holding that (1) it failed to allege a \u00a7 1983 cause of action against the policemen, and (2) the City of Chicago was not liable under \u00a7 1983. The court of appeals affirmed and certiorari' was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal as to the City of Chicago on the ground that \u201cCongress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit\u201d of \u00a7 1983. 365 U.S. at 187, 81 S.Ct. at 484. It reversed the dismissal as to the 13 policemen on its holding that <em>the allegation of facts constituting a deprivation, under color of state authority, of the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures, contained in the Fourth Amendment and made applicable to the states by reason of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 1988.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">After noting that \u201cThe word \u2018wilfully\u2019 does not appear in \u00a7 1979 [\u00a7 1983]\u201d and thus there is no requirement of proof of intent to deprive a person of a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>right in a \u00a7 1979 action, the Court made this oft-quoted statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201cSection 1979 should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.\u201d 365 U.S. at 187, 81 S.Ct. at 484.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In light of its frequent citation in civil rights cases, I must also refer to Crews v. United States, 160 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1947), a <em>pre-Monroe </em>ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">There, the defendant Crews, a town marshal and constable took one McFadden into custody, placed him in a car driven by Crews\u2019 nephew, .beat him with a bull whip, and then drove him some thirty miles to a bridge, where, \u201cnotwithstanding McFadden\u2019s protestations that he could not swim, <em>forced him to jump from the high bridge into the deep, swift current of the river, from which he never came out until he was taken from the water and the willows by the undertaker.\u201d </em>160 F.2d at 748. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Crews was found guilty by a jury on an indictment charging him with violation of \u00a7 20 of the Criminal Code. He contended in his appeal that the evidence failed to show he was acting under color of law. The Fifth Circuit rejected that contention and affirmed his conviction, citing Screws v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In brief resume, <em>Classic </em>dealt only with violation of rights secured by Article I, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution relating, <em>inter alia, </em>to the right of the people to choose Representatives to the Congress of the United States; <em>Screws </em>held that the killing of a negro by three law enforcement officers violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and <em>Monroe </em>held that a search of a home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment proscription against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d thereby violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\"><em>Classic </em>and <em>Monroe </em>have in the main been cited in support of holdings that a custodial assault violates Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, albeit no circumstance of assault or use of force was adverted to in the Court\u2019s opinion in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The genesis of their citation is the statement in <em>Classic </em>that \u201cMisuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law . is action taken \u2018under color of\u2019 state law,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the statement in <em>Monroe </em>that \u201cSection 1979 [\u00a7 1983] should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">The courts resorting to these statements have failed to take into account the context in which they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\"><em>Classic\u2019s </em>\u201cmisuse of power\u201d statement was made in the context of the Court\u2019s definition of the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d provision in the criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1983, in rejecting the defendants\u2019 contention that they were not acting under color of state law in their fraudulent conduct of a primary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\"><em>Monroe\u2019s </em>statement that Section 1983 \u201cshould be read against the background of tort liability,\u201d etc. was made in the context of the Court\u2019s holding that while the criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1983 requires <em>proof of an intent to deprive </em>a victim of police action of a constitutional right, \u00a7 1983 does not require proof of such an intent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">It may be added that the assault cases which have cited <em>Screws </em>have overlooked the fact that it only decided that the beating to death of an arrested man by law enforcement officers was a \u201ctrial by ordeal\u201d in lieu of a trial by jury, in violation of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">What has been said brings me to the overriding critical issue whether custodial assaults under color of state law violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d; \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d; or \u201cdue process\u201d guarantees, so as to bring into play \u00a7 1983, derived from the Civil Rights Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>April 20, 1871, which, as its title declares, was enacted to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Since the Fourteenth Amendment is the centerpiece of \u00a7 1983, ascertainment of the meaning and sweep of the Amendment\u2019s guarantees are critical to application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, after stating that \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The \u201cprivileges or immunities\u201d clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is <em>not </em>a basis for the exercise of federal power in the protection of individual rights against state action since it protects only rights of national citizenship. It was so expressly held more than a century ago in the historic <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), where it was stressed that the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,\u201d and thus <em>\u201cspeaks only of privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and does not speak of those of citizens of the several States.\u201d </em>83 U.S. at 74. (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Later Supreme Court cases have consistently followed <em>Slaughter-House, </em>in construing the Amendment\u2019s privilege and immunity clause to protect only interests growing out of the relationship between citizens of the United States and the national government.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">In doing so, the leading case of Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 29 S.Ct. 14, 53 L.Ed. 97 (1908), said with respect to <em>Slaughter-House:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201cThe distinction between national and state citizenship and their respective privileges there drawn has come to be firmly established.\u201d 211 U.S. at 96, 29 S.Ct. at 18.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1 (1944), where \u00a7 1983 was invoked, the Court citing, <em>inter alia, Slaughter-House, </em>said at pages 6-7, 64 S.Ct. 397, at page 400, 88 L.Ed. 497:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\"><em>\u201cThe protection extended to citizens of the United States by the privileges and immunities clause includes those rights and privileges which, under the laws and Constitution of the United States, are incident to citizenship of the United States, but does not include rights pertaining to state citizenship and derived solely from the relationship of the citizen and his state established by state law.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d clause does not require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Supreme Court, has time and again, limited its application to cases of \u201cintentional and purposeful\u201d \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The reach of the clause was tersely epitomized by Mr. Justice Douglas, speaking for the Court in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955), in this statement at page 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, at page 465, 99 L.Ed. 563:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201cThe prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause <em>goes no further than the invidious discrimination.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In Snowden v. Hughes, <em>supra, </em>the Court said with respect to application of the clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">\u201cThe unlawful administration by state officers of a state statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection <em>unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination.\u201d </em>321 U.S. at 8, 64 S.Ct. at 401.

United States, <em>supra, </em>and that a \u201cbrutal\u201d custodial assault <em>to force a confession </em>violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Williams v.

(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">Courts indulging in judicial amendment of the Constitution and judicial legislation with respect to \u00a7 1983 might well have kept in mind the biblical injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">\u201cRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s . . ..\u201d Matthew, XXII, 21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">It merits notation that four Amendments extending civil rights have been added since adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and that Congress, since enactment of the Civil Rights Act of April 20, 1871, has enacted a series of acts extending protection of civil rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">A proposed Twenty-seventh Amendment guaranteeing equal rights to wom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>en is now under submission to the legislatures of the several states.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Constitution has been trivialized by interposition of \u201cjudicial amendment,\u201d and the fabric of \u00a7 1983 has been stretched and attenuated by sequential \u201cjudicial legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Federal courts have been swamped by a resulting mountainous flood of civil rights cases, as evidenced by the 1974 Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The Annual Report reveals that a staggering total of 8,443 civil rights eases were filed in the federal district courts in 1974 \u2014 an increase of approximately 2,750 percent over the 296 civil rights actions filed in 1961 when Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>was decided (February 20, 1961). (Table 16, at IX-21).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In startling contrast, the overall increase in <em>all </em>district court filings \u2014 civil and criminal \u2014 from 1961 to 1974 amounted to only 62.5 percent, viz., 86,-753 in 1961 to 141,197 in 1974. (Table 14, at IX \u2014 18, and Table 44, at IX-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">While the bulk of the civil rights filings are by prisoners alleging assaults by their custodians, they include in ever-increasing numbers these earthshaking categories: school regulations as to length of hair and mode of dress of pupils; city fire department regulations as to firemen\u2019s length of hair, beards and moustaches; denial of a 16-year old girl\u2019s right to membership on her high school\u2019s all-male swimming team; denial of a 13-year old girl\u2019s right to enter an all-male high school; alleged deprivation of a policewoman\u2019s right to achieve detective rank; and a prison guard\u2019s seizure of seven packs of cigarettes from a jail inmate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">The flood-tide of custodial assault, hair and dress cases has been given impetus by judicial spawning of <em>new </em>and <em>fresh </em>concepts of due process in \u00a7 1983 cases in disregard of the historic fact that \u00a7 1983 and its Fourteenth Amendment centerpiece were designed primarily to cope with state racially-motivated deprivations of rights \u201csecured by the Constitution and laws,\u201d and in further disregard of the fact that the Supreme Court has squarely held that application of \u00a7 20, the criminal counterpart of \u00a7 1983, is limited to deprivation of a right <em>\u201cwhich has been made specific and definite\" </em>\u201ceither by the express terms of the Constitution or laws of the United States <em>or by decisions interpreting them.\u201d </em>Screws v. United States, <em>supra, </em>325 U.S. at 104-105, 65 S.Ct. at 1037. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">An inexplicable anomaly is presented when lower federal courts apply their own freshly fashioned concepts of due process in \u00a7 1983 cases, in contrast to their application in \u00a7 20 cases of due process concepts as previously defined by the Supreme Court, as required by Screws.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">There remains this to be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">I have accorded exhaustive discussion to the basic issues of constitutional and legislative construction presented in actions pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and its derivatives, and to pertinent Supreme Court cases, in light of their transcending critical significance, particularly with respect to \u00a7 1983 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>I am of the opinion that the summary judgments below in favor of the defendants must be affirmed for the reason that, viewed in the light most favorable to Polite, his complaints, deposition, PreTrial Narrative Statement and its annexed Medical Report, present a claim of custodial assault which, <em>standing alone, </em>did not violate Fourteenth Amendment guarantees so as to be within the reach of \u00a7 1983. Simply stated, infliction of a black eye on one in custody by a policeman\u2019s fists, <em>standing alone, </em>is not a \u201cfederal case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">It is settled that while pleadings are to be liberally construed in favor of the party against whom the summary judgment motion is made, their conclusionary allegations, <em>standing alone, </em>do not create an issue of fact, and that courts in determining whether there is a bona fide dispute as to a material fact must consider, along with the complaint, depositions, affidavits, answers to interrogatories and requests for admissions, of record.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u201cThe [summary] judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, <em>depositions, </em>answers to interrogatories, and <em>admissions on file, </em>together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that <em>the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aju\">As the Advisory Committee on the 1963 Amendment to Rule 56(c), 28 U.S. C.A., stated in its Notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cThe <em>very mission </em>of the summary judgment procedure <em>is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof </em>in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">We cited and applied the foregoing epitomization of the \u201cmission\u201d of the summary judgment rule in Robin Construction Company v. United States, 345 F.2d 610, 615 (3d Cir. 1965), where we held that summary judgment was appropriate when interrogatories, affidavits and accompanying documents of record did not raise any issue of genuine fact and presented only a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Depositions of plaintiffs were strongly relied on in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants in Crest Auto Supplies, Inc. v. Ero Manufacturing Company, 360 F.2d 896, 900 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">There remains this to be said.</p>\n<p id=\"AdF\">Standing alone, and independent of the foregoing considerations, the majority\u2019s short-shrift disposition of these appeals errs in the following respects:</p>\n<p id=\"awu-dedup-0\">First, the record below clearly establishes that the joining of Walter Lofs-trom as a defendant in Polite\u2019s actions is utterly without legal basis. Polite\u2019s Complaints after alleging that Lofstrom \u201cwas at all times relevant hereto the Chief of Police of the City of McKees-port Police Department,\u201d further alleged that the defendant McKeesport policemen were \u201cat all times acting as the servants, employees, co-conspirators, and agents of the defendant, Walter Lofs-trom.\u201d Polite\u2019s Deposition is bare of any reference to Lofstrom\u2019s knowledge of, or participation in, the events which premise his actions. Polite\u2019s brief on this appeal clearly indicates that Lofs-trom has been joined as a defendant under the doctrine of \u201crespondeat superi- or.\u201d It is settled that conclusionary allegations in a complaint \u00e1lleging Civil Rights Act violations will not survive a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is further settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that an action is not maintainable against a police chief under the respon-deat superior theory where he was not present, did not participate in, or have knowledge of, any civil rights violation. Jennings v. Davis, 476 F.2d 1271, 1274 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Second, as to the reversal of the summary judgment in favor of Diehl at Appeal No. 72-1770: <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\">Polite in his Deposition completely absolved Diehl of any participation in the alleged assault incident. He testified therein that Diehl was \u201cstanding by that rail\u201d; that \u201che didn\u2019t\u201d hit him; \u201che didn\u2019t\u201d hold him during the alleged assault, and that \u201che did not\u201d spray any mace upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Third, the majority\u2019s reversal of the summary judgments insofar as they concern the alleged \u201cunlawful seizure\u201d of Polite\u2019s car, can only be categorized as a judicial \u201csport.\u201d Polite\u2019s Deposition shows that his automobile was badly damaged when it was ordered towed away by officer Diehl and that he had to pay a $500 repair bill for a \u201cnew bumper, radiator and I think a fender.\u201d All that needs to be said with respect to this aspect of the majority\u2019s disposition is that there is no \u201cwrongful deprivation of property . . . under color of state law\u201d when a policeman orders an automobile with a smashed radiator towed away while he takes its operator and passengers to a hospital, and the car is returned to its owner the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Finally, assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that infliction of a \u201cblack eye\u201d on one in custody by a policeman\u2019s fists presents a \u00a7 1983 case, Polite\u2019s Deposition only charged officer Rendulic with an assault. Failure of Polite in his Deposition to name any of the other policemen defendants as participating in the assault requires entry of summary judgment in their favor under our holding in Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272 (1964), as spelled out at Note 23. It is to be further noted on this score that Polite\u2019s Complaints contained only general allegations that he was \u201csubjected to physical abuse by the defendants\u201d without designating any of them by name. As stated in Note 23, we have time and again ruled that con-clusory allegations of this nature require dismissal of a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">As to the \u201ccoerced guilty plea,\u201d the deposition of Kenneth J. Carroll, custodian of records of the McKeesport Police Department, taken by Polite and filed of record, disclosed that Polite entered a \u201cPlea of N. G. [not guilty]\u201d at the Sunday night hearing at which he was fined for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver\u2019s license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-20\"> \u201cBlack eye ... a darkening of the skin about the eye resulting from a bruise.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 226 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">.

In so doing the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\u201c[T]he distinction between citizenship of the United States and citizenship of a State is clearly recognized and established. Not only may a man be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of a State, but an important element is necessary to convert the former into the latter. He must reside within the State to make him a citizen of it, but it is only necessary that he should be bom or naturalized in the United States to be a citizen of the Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">\u201cIt is quite clear, then, that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">\u201cThe language is, \u2018No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of <em>the United States.\u2019 </em>It is a little remarkable, if this clause was intended as a protection to the citizen of a State against the legislative power of his own State, that the word citizen of the State should be left out when it is so carefully used, and used in contradistinction to citizens of the United States, in the very sentence which precedes it. It is too clear for argument that the change in phraseology was adopted understandingly and with a purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADL\">\u201cOf the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the United States, and of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the State, and what they respectively are, we will presently consider; but we wish to state here that <em>it is only the former which are placed by this clause under the protection of the Federal Constitution, and that the latter, whatever th\u00e9y may be, are not intended to have any additional protection by this paragraph of the amendment.\u201d </em>83 U.S. at 73-74.
