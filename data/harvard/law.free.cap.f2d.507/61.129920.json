We vacate that part of the judgment which awarded the fees and remand for further consideration in light of our recent opinion in Lindy Bros. Bldrs., Inc. of Phila. v. American R. &amp; S. San. Corp., 487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir. 1973); see also Merola v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 493 F.2d 292 (3d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-21\">The complaint, brought by a student at the public school where defendant Christian was then acting principal pleaded two separate causes of action. One was brought against the Government of the Virgin Islands pursuant to the Virgin Islands Tort Claims Act, Title 33 V.I.C. Ch. 118.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second cause of action was brought against Christian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both causes of action were tried at the same time, but the claim against the Government was tried to the court, while the civil rights action was submitted to a jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $150.00 compensatory damages, declining to award any punitive damages. In addition to the damages assessed by the jury and nominal costs, the judgment of the court awarded the plaintiff an attorney\u2019s fee of $1500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c(a) Costs which may be allowed in a civil action include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">(6) Attorney\u2019s fees as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201c(b) The measure and mode of compensation of attorneys shall be left to the agreement, expressed- or implied, of the parties; but there shall be allowed to the prevailing party in the judgment such sums as the court in its discretion may fix by way of indemnity for his attorneys fees in maintaining the action or defenses thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Although the matter of the award and its amount are within the district court\u2019s discretion, \u201c[t]he amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to the prevailing party is intended to be an indemnification of the prevailing party for a fair and reasonable portion of his attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the prosecution or defense of the action, and not for the whole amount charged by the attorney . . ..\u201d Lucerne Investment Co. v. Estate Belvedere, Inc., 411 F.2d 1205, 1207 (3d Cir. 1969). Standards to guide the district courts in awarding such reasonable fees were stated by Chief Judge Seitz in <em>Lindy, supra </em>487 F.2d at 167:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201cBefore the value of the attorney\u2019s services can be determined, the district court must ascertain just what were those services. To this end the first inquiry of the court should be into the hours spent by the attorneys \u2014 how many hours were spent in what manner by which attorneys. It is not necessary to know the exact number of minutes spent nor the precise activity to which each hour was devoted nor the specific attainments of each attorney. But without some fairly definite information as to the hours devoted to various general activities . . ., the court cannot know the nature of the services for which compensation is sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">\u201cAfter determining, as above, the services performed by the attorneys, the district court must attempt to value those services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">\u201cThe value of an attorney\u2019s time generally is reflected in his normal billing rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">No itemization of the hours spent by plaintiff\u2019s attorney for his work appears in the record. The same evidence formed the gravamen of each cause of action stated in the complaint. The trial,- which began about four o\u2019clock on the afternoon of June 24, was concluded about 10:30 o\u2019clock on the night of June 25, 1974, when the verdict was returned. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the issues involved were complicated. Some 14 witnesses testified. Counsel agree that $50.00 per hour or $500.00 per day, is the going rate for conduct of a trial in the Virgin Islands. However, depositions were taken and other pre-trial activity must have been involved. As <em>Lindy </em>notes at 167, \u201c. . . the court may find that the reasonable rate of compensation differs for different activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-20\"><em>Lindy </em>finds two factors other than time pertinent to determining the amount of a reasonable award of attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-21\">\u201cWhile the amount thus found to constitute reasonable compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>should be the lodestar of the court\u2019s fee determination, there are at least two other factors that must be taken into account in computing the value of attorneys\u2019 services. The first of these is the contingent nature of success; In assessing the extent to which the attorneys\u2019 compensation should be increased to reflect the unlikelihood of success, the district court should consider any information that may help to establish the probability of success. . . . <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cThe second additional factor the district court must consider is the extent, if any, to which the quality of an attorney\u2019s ' work mandates increasing or decreasing the amount to which the court has found the attorney reasonably entitled. In evaluating the quality of an attorney\u2019s work in a case, the district court should consider the complexity and novelty of the issues presented, the quality of the work that the judge has been able to observe, and the amount of the recovery obtained. ... In making allowance for the quality of work, the court must keep in mind that the attorney will receive an otherwise reasonable compensation for his time under the figure arrived at from the hourly rate. Any increase or decrease in fees to adjust for the quality of work is designed to take account of an unusual degree of skill, be it unusually poor or unusually good. If the district judge determines that particular work was of a typical quality, he should, in increasing or decreasing the fee, be cognizant of the amount of time devoted to that given activity. Further, in increasing or decreasing an attorney\u2019s compensation, the district judge should set forth as specifically as possible the facts that support his conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 487 F.2d at 168 \u2014 169 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">The information necessary to apply the above standards can be supplied by affidavits, e. <em>g., </em>Tranberg v. Tran-berg, 456 F.2d 173, 175 (3d Cir. 1972), stipulations, or a hearing. See <em>Lindy, supra, </em>487 F.2d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Appellant objects particularly to what he terms \u201cthe disproportionate amount\u201d of the attorney\u2019s fees awarded on the two counts of the complaint in relation to the damage awards on these two counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He contends that such disproportion \u201cshows that the court failed to, consider any criteria in fixing the attorney\u2019s fees\u201d (p. 4 of appellant\u2019s brief). Because of the lack of any basis in the record for application of the standards set forth in <em>Lindy, supra, </em>we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>determine this contention on the barren record now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">Since the record fails to supply the information necessary to apply the <em>Lindy </em>standard, it is clear that the award of the $1,500.00 counsel fee in this case was inconsistent with the sound exercise of discretion. See <em>Lindy, supra, </em>487 F.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees in the June 27, 1974, judgment will be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\">. Count I, brought under Title 33 V.I.C. \u00a7 3408, alleged that Christian, while acting within the scope of his official capacity, inflicted unreasonable punishment on plaintiff by improperly administering a severe, unreasonable and unauthorized beating to Hector Estien. The court entered judgment of $8500.00 and an attorney\u2019s fee of $1,000.00. See judgment of July 3, 1974 (D.V.I., Civil 216/73).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-13\">. The \u00a7 1983 action alleged deprivation of plaintiff\u2019s rights and privileges as a United States citizen through an unreasonably severe beating administered as a disciplinary measure by Christian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">. This record does not disclose whether or not defendant Christian had arranged to compensate his attorney on a contingent basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. In Lucerne Investment Co. v. Estate Belved-ere, Inc., 411 F.2d 1205, 1207 (3d Cir. 1969), Judge Maris listed the following as \u201cappropriate criteria for the court\u2019s consideration in awarding attorney\u2019s fees as costs to a prevailing party in a civil action under\u201d 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill requisite properly to conduct the cause, the customary charges of the bar for similar services, the amount involved in the controversy, the benefits resulting to the client from the services, and the contingency or certainty of the compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Also, this court has recognized that \u201cthe amount of the attorney\u2019s fee agreed upon between attorney and client, or actually paid, is only one factor to be considered in making an award under section 541. Indeed, the relatively small allowances customarily made for attorneys\u2019 fees in the Virgin Islands indicate that the normal award under section 541 is often only a minor fraction of what an attorney may reasonably have charged a client for the services involved in the litigation.\u201d See Smith v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 361 F.2d 469, 471 (3d Cir. 1966). Another recent case considering in detail criteria governing attorney\u2019s fees is Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-719 (5th Cir. 1974.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-15\">. Appellant also called our attention to the October 22, 1974, judgment in Cargo Services, Inc. v. Merwin, et al. (Civil 175/1968, D.V.I.), where a $3500. attorney\u2019s fee was awarded in a case imposing damages of more than $43,-000. We do not find the factual situation in that case sufficiently similar to this personal injury action to make it helpful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
