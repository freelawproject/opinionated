The complaint is to that part of the sentence imposing a special parole term of three years following release from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It is conceded that a special parole term following incarceration is mandatory under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 960(b)(1), upon conviction of a substantive violation of \u00a7 952(a)(1). The argument is that the conspiracy statute, \u00a7 963, does not include the special parole term provision of \u00a7 960(b)(1). We disagree. \u00a7 963 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The punishment provision of \u00a7 963 must be considered in light of \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 960, since it is these statutes which define the offense which was the object of the conspiracy, and provide for punishment therefor. They provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u00a7 952(a) It shall be unlawful to import into the customs territory of the United States from any place outside thereof (but within the United States), or to import into the United States from any place outside thereof, any controlled substance in schedule I or II of subchapter I of this chapter * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\u00a7 960(a)(1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">Any person who\u2014 contrary to section 952, 953, or 957 of this title, knowingly or intentionally imports or exports a controlled substance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">\u00a7 960(b)(1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">In the case of a violation under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a narcotic drug in schedule I or II, the person committing such violation shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or fined not more than $25,000, or both. If a sentence under this paragraph provides for imprisonment, the sentence shall include a special parole term of not less than three years in addition to such term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-18\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">We have no trouble whatever in understanding the language of \u00a7 963 to permit punishment not exceeding that provided for an offense in violation of \u00a7 952(a). Appellant was charged with conspiring to commit such an offense and pleaded guilty thereto. The \u2018substantive offense in question carried a special parole term of three years. Appellant received a special parole term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
