In such event, the respondent shall be notified promptly, in writing, that such efforts have been unsuccessful and will not be resumed except upon the respondent\u2019s written request within the time specified in such notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeA\">Before us the Commission does not dispute that the regulation was not followed, but urges that in the circumstances of this case, 1) compliance with the regulation was not required, and, alternately, 2) noncompliance was not prejudicial to the Employer. Such circumstances, as found by the trial court, we here summarize. On March 15, 1972 Margo Owens filed a charge with the Commission alleging that because of her race the Employer paid her less than a white employee doing the same work. The Commission\u2019s investigation of these charges in August, 1972 ultimately resulted in the Commission\u2019s determination on November 30, 1972 that reasonable cause existed to believe that the Employer had engaged in an unlawful employment practice. A copy of this determination, including a \u201cNotice of Conciliation Process\u201d and an invitation to join with the Commission \u201cin a collective effort toward a just resolution of this matter,\u201d was mailed to the Employer December 6, 1972.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In January, 1973 the Employer\u2019s attorney, F. Douglas O\u2019Leary, spoke by telephone with James Helm, a Commission official, concerning conciliation of the Owens charge. Mr. O\u2019Leary indicated little willingness to conciliate the charge. At Mr. Helm\u2019s request, Mr. O\u2019Leary wrote Mr. Helm a letter dated January 12, 1973 wherein Mr. O\u2019Leary declined to engage in conciliation with the Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>contact occurred between the parties until this action was instituted May 9, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">We are thus squarely confronted with the issue of whether the Commission\u2019s failure to give the notice required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23 (1974), that the Commission considers the conciliation efforts unsuccessful and intends to terminate them, should bar the prosecution of the Commission\u2019s civil action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) (Supp. II, 1972). We are not without guidance in this area; two district courts in addition to the court below have considered the issue and resolved it against the Commission. EEOC v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., 375 F.Supp. 237, 246-248 (N.D.Ala.1974); EEOC v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R., 368 F.Supp. 633, 638-639 (N.D.Ala.1974); EEOC v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 366 F.Supp. 273 (D.Md. 1973). We may reject out of hand the Commission\u2019s contention that the regulation is not applicable to the situation before us. The argument that the limited purpose of the regulation is to \u201cmake certain that a respondent\u2019s failure to engage in conciliation is not the result of inadvertence or neglect\u201d ignores the fact that the regulation applies in terms to a respondent\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] <em>or refus[al]\u201d </em>to conciliate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That the Employer intentionally and knowingly declined to conciliate does not take the case out of the ambit of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">More serious, however, is the Commission\u2019s claim that the January 12 letter conclusively demonstrates its inability to secure a conciliation agreement within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(1) (Supp. II, 1972),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the failure to give the \u00a7 1601.23 notice is at most a technical error which did not prejudice the Employer. Resolution of this issue requires a brief examination of the purpose of the regulation and the function of conciliation, generally, in the enforcement scheme of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">As originally enacted Title VII did not empower the Commission to sue employers to enforce the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[c]oop-eration and voluntary compliance were selected as the preferred means for achieving\u201d equality of employment opportunities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Voluntary compliance proved elusive, however, as more than half of the Commission\u2019s conciliation efforts were deemed unsuccessful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, Congress enacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 which amended Title VII to permit Commission suits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statutory mandate that the Commission attempt conciliation was not abandoned, however,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the Act expressly conditions the Commission\u2019s powers of suit on its inability to \u201csecure from the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the House sponsor of the bill stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>The conferees contemplate that the Commission will continue to make every effort to conciliate as is required by existing law. Only if conciliation proves to be impossible do we expect the Commission to bring action in Federal district court to seek enforcement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Indeed, it is essential, as one observer notes, that negotiation remain the primary mode of enforcement, lest the Commission\u2019s energies be dissipated in interminable litigation in the Federal courts, which, whatever the outcome, would be detrimental to efficient and effective implementation of Title VII.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Although the lower federal courts have differed over whether the fact of failure of conciliation must be affirmatively pleaded by the Commission,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is beyond dispute that a Commission lawsuit brought before any attempt at conciliation is premature. EEOC v. Westva-co Corp., 372 F.Supp. 985, 991-993 (D.Md.1974); EEOC v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., 373 F.Supp. 1321, 1333-1334 (D.Del.1974). \u201cThe Commission\u2019s power of suit and administrative process [are not] unrelated activities, [but] sequential steps in a unified scheme for securing compliance with Title VII.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Against this background we must review the Commission\u2019s breach of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23 (1974) providing for notice to the respondent of the imminent termination of the conciliation process. We agree with the court below that the regulation affords even the most uncooperative and recalcitrant respondent<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cthe right to be told that it has one last chance to attempt conciliation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In view of the central role of conciliation in the scheme of Title VII we cannot say the regulation is merely \u201ctechnical.\u201d This is an area where animosities run high and negotiations may be difficult to initiate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The regulation reflects formal recognition by the Commission of the need to keep the doors of communication open even where, as here, it has received a flat refusal to engage in conciliation discussions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-12\">We are, of course, aware of the general principle that \u201c[i]t is always within the discretion of a court or an administrative agency to relax or modify its procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of business before it when in a given case the ends of justice require it. The action of either in such a case is not reviewable except upon a showing of substantial prejudice to the complaining party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, 397 U.S. 532, 539, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 1292, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 quoting this court in NLRB v. Monsanto Chemical Co., 205 F.2d 763, 764 (8th Cir. 1953).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, the Commission offers no acceptable justification for its breach of the regulation in this case, and we cannot conclude that the Employer was not prejudiced by it. The Employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>letter refusing to conciliate is, as we have noted, the event which should have triggered the application of the regulation, not the excuse for ignoring it. Compliance with the regulation, a last gesture by the Commission of a conciliatory attitude, may well give pause to the most (theretofore) recalcitrant employer, now indubitably faced with expensive and time-consuming litigation, and thus lead to a resolution of these disputes in the congressionally preferred forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">. The Hon. John F. NANGLE, United States District Judge, Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">. A previous ruling of the court is found in EEOC v. Hickey-Mitchell Co., 372 F.Supp. 1117 (E.D.Mo.1973). There the court refused to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it had not been filed within 180 days of the filing of the charge, holding that the Act did not so require. <em>Accord, </em>EEOC v. Cleveland Mills Co., 502 F.2d 153 (4th Cir. 1974). It did, however, dismiss Count II of the complaint (which alleged sex discrimination) as not within the proper scope of an investigation of the original charge (which alleged racial discrimination). The court also granted a protective order in favor of the Employer, delaying discovery until the court resolved \u201cthe jurisdictional issue of whether the plaintiff was unable to secure an acceptable conciliation agreement.\u201d 372 F.Supp. at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-20\">In view of our resolution of the issues herein, we need not reach and we express no opinion on the 180 day issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1033-21\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (Supp. II, 1972) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-23\">(a) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-24\">The Commission is empowered, as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful employment practice as set forth in section 2000e-2 or 2000e-3 of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-25\">(b) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Whenever a charge is filed by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved * * * alleging that an employer * * has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Commission shall serve a notice of the charge * * * on such employer * * * (hereinafter referred to as the \u201crespondent\u201d) within ten days, and shall make an investigation thereof. * * If the Commission determines after such investigation that there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the Commission shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AZj\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"ArA\">^ * * *</p>\n<p id=\"aih-dedup-0\">(1) If within thirty days after a charge is filed with the Commission * * * the Commission has been unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the Commission, the Commission may bring a civil action against any respondent * * * named in the charge. * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">.

If the Commission or any other person wants to take further action, we would assume that such action will take place in a forum where there would be a fair and impartial hearing by persons who do not have a preconceived result in mind while considering the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23 (1974) (emphasis added).
