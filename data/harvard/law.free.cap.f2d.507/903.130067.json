The District Court dismissed this allegation without prejudice because it held this issue had never been presented to the Texas courts. 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2254. McBride contends he has presented this issue to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals because he submitted a supplemental pro se brief directed expressly to the issue. This brief was supplemental to one filed by counsel on direct appeal from his sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree this \u201cpresentation\u201d is enough to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 2254, but affirm the District Court. Alonzo v. Estelle, 5 Cir., 1974, 500 F.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-18\">The only difference between McBride\u2019s case and Alonzo\u2019s is that McBride\u2019s pro se brief in the Texas appellate court presented the plea bargain issue much more forcefully than did Alonzo\u2019s state appellate brief. In that case, the issue we sent back to the state court was only presented in a passing reference \u2014 not otherwise set off \u2014 in the text of a brief presenting several issues. We hold this distinction does not warrant a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">Principles of comity require us to put more emphasis on two factors which are the same in McBride\u2019s ease as in Alonzo\u2019s, (i) the state court did not address itself to the issue in its opinion, and (ii) the state court had no factual record upon which to base any consideration of the issue. \u201cArticle 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides an \u2018available State corrective process to protect the rights of the prisoner.\u2019 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(b). That forum should be given the opportunity to assess the factual foundation of appellant\u2019s claims. [Citation omitted].\u201d 500 F.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"A5a\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-15\">. McBride\u2019s counsel urged the state trial Judge\u2019s comments during the trial exceeded the bounds of propriety. McBride now asserts those comments violated his constitutional right to a fair trial. We do not think constitutional error was committed. At the very most, appellant has shown the Judge may have infringed upon Art. 38.05, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Tex.Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
