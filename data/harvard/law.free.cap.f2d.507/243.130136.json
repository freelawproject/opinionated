We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to transport stolen goods, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and interstate transportation of stolen goods, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. At his trial he was represented by retained counsel. An appeal was perfected, oral argument was heard and while the matter was under submission in this court the appellant dismissed his retained counsel and filed a pro se motion to withdraw his appeal. The panel of this court which had the matter under consideration granted the motion to withdraw and dismissed the appeal. Thereafter, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a rehearing on the order granting permission to withdraw the appeal, which was denied. Subsequently, appellant filed a motion to vacate withdrawal of appeal and to reinstate the appeal. That motion was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\"> Appellant then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court contending that the dismissal of his appeal was not voluntary. After reviewing the record, the district court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing. While we agree that bona fide factual issues in \u00a7 2255 cases must be resolved on the basis of an evidentiary hearing, Montgomery v. United States, 469 F.2d 148 (5th Cir. 1972), we hold that in view of all of the circumstances of this case the petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motion and that the order of dismissal by the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
