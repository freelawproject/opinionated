S.O. \u00a7 293(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1203-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">The appellant Brock entered a plea of guilty to two counts of an indictment alleging possession of heroin and marijuana, with intent to distribute, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">On the basis of a presentence report the District Court ordered Brock committed for evaluation and study under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b). On November 10, 1972 the court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2), sentenced Brock to imprisonment for \u201cnot more than five (5) years pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 [a] (2), in which event defendant may become eligible for parole at such time as the Board of Parole may determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-15\">The Controlled Substances- Act, under which Brock was charged and entered his plea of guilty, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-16\">Any sentence imposing a term of imprisonment under this paragraph shall, in the absence of such a prior [narcotics] conviction, impose a special parole term of at least 3 years in addition to such term of imprisonment and shall, if there was such a prior conviction, impose a special parole term of at least 6 years in addition to such term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1203-17\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-18\">In the case of Brock this statute required the District Court to impose a special parole term of at least three years in addition to the term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-19\">On April 4, 1973, some five months after he was sentenced, Brock moved to vacate and correct the sentence upon the ground that it was \u201cillegal.\u201d He contended the sentence should be corrected to include the special parole term and that the corrected sentence should not exceed the original sentence of not more than five years. The District Court denied the motion, holding that Brock had been sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2) and not under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). On this appeal Brock renews the contention he made before the District Court. The government says that since the original sentence was illegal the court may correct it by now adding the additional special parole term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-20\">Brock contends \u201cthat his corrected sentence must be for a total of two years imprisonment and three years special parole so as not to exceed the original \u2018no more than\u2019 5 years sentence. Thus, it is appellant\u2019s position that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>corrected sentence of, for example, five years <em>plus </em>three years special parole would be an impermissibly more severe sentence and thereby unlawful.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">The argument advanced-by the appellants has been considered and rejected by three circuit courts of appeals. Garcia v. United States, 492 F.2d 395 (10th Cir. 1974); Caille v. United States, 487 F.2d 614 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Thomas, 356 F.Supp. 173 (E.D.N.Y. 1972) , aff\u2019d, 474 F.2d 1336 (2d Cir. 1973) . These decisions are based on Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1946), and we think they are sound. In our own circuit the rejection of Brock\u2019s argument is supported by Hayes v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 249 F.2d 516 (1957), and King v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 10, 98 F.2d 291 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">We remand the case to the District Court with directions to correct the sentence by imposing a special parole term of at least three years. The district judge may reconsider the original sentence of five years of imprisonment in light of the three years of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
