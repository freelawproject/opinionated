Familiarity with the board\u2019s opinion is assumed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-13\">We find no error in the board\u2019s findings of fact or in its conclusion that concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the parties is likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive. We add in support of the board decision only that the commercial impression <em>intended </em>by the user of a mark is entitled to very little consideration in resolving the issue of likelihood of confusion, etc., where, as the board here found, the <em>actual </em>impression created by the mark is different from the impression allegedly intended by the user; and that the high cost of the goods does not necessarily decrease the likelihood of confusion where the confusion found to be likely is not as to the products but as to their source. Contour Chair-Lounge Co. v. Englander Co., 324 F.2d 186, 51 CCPA 833 (1963). Here the goods of the parties are such as might reasonably be expected to emanate from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-15\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
