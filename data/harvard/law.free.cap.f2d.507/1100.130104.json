The Supreme Court, on June 25, 1973, vacated that judgment and remanded the cause to this court for reconsideration in the light of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), and related cases. 413 U.S. 913, 93 S.Ct. 3030, 37 L.Ed.2d 1022 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>Subsequent proceedings have kept the case in litigation. Most recently it has been returned by the court en banc to the original panel for disposition. We now reaffirm the convictions and adopt our previously reported opinion in 431 F.2d 655, on the authority of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) and Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">We described the materials in our opinion, 431 F.2d at 658, and held that they were constitutionally obscene under the tests then prevailing. We find they are equally obscene under the tests of Miller v. California, <em>supra, </em>and Hamling v. United States, <em>supra. </em>We have considered the issues tendered by appellants in their rebriefing of the issues in the light of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Hamling. </em>We find that the arguments have been foreclosed to them by <em>Hamling </em>or are frivolous, e. <em>g., </em>that a conviction and incarceration would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">The judgment is reaffirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
