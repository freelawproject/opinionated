We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-20\">Moses does not contest the fact that he wilfully and knowingly failed to ap- . pear for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead he urges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that the induction order under which he was indicted was invalid, thereby nullifying the obligation on his part to comply. Moses points out that his mother had informed the Executive Secretary of his local draft board over the telephone that he was attending the University of Houston. Moses then urges that the Executive Secretary\u2019s failure to convey that information to the entire board for consideration of a postponement of induction pursuant to Title 50 App., U.S.C., Section 456(i)(l) and (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> invalidated the subsequent \u201crescheduled\u201d induction order, the date of which was selected by the Executive Secretary upon the recommendation of the State Director of the Selective Service System.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Moses relies heavily on our decision in' United States v. Jackson, 5 Cir. 1972, 454 F.2d 821, in which case we held an induction order invalid because a draft board clerk failed to submit to the entire board a physician\u2019s letter stating that Jackson was suffering from functional hypoglycemia. After admonishing that, \u201cit is for the local board and not the clerk to determine the merits of classification questions,\u201d 454 F.2d at 824, we specifically held that Jackson <em>\u201cpresented an arguable case </em>(for reclassification on medical grounds) and that the board, which has great discretionary authority, must first fulfill its responsibility by considering whether the information meets the standards set out in the Regulations.\u201d (emphasis supplied) 454 F.2d at 825. Moses\u2019 position, therefore, hinges upon whether the information in the hands of the Executive Secretary presented at least an arguable case for a student deferment. We find that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">In order to qualify for a student postponement of an induction order, the student must not only fit within the statutorily defined class of deferable students but must also have the appropriate facts pertaining thereto presented to the local board. Title 50 App., U.S.C., \u00a7 456(i)(l) &amp; (2), Note 2, supra. The burden of proving an entitlement to student deferment was clearly on Moses. See United States v. Brooks, 6 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 502, 506; 32 CFR \u00a7 1622.25(d). At the time Moses\u2019 induction order was rescheduled, the only information the board had pertaining to his alleged sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>tus as a student was his signed statement that he had graduated from high school in June of 1970 and his mother's uncorroborated oral statement over the telephone on October 31, 1972 that he was attending the University of Houston. While this information may have served to put the board on notice of the <em>possibility </em>that Moses was a deferable student, it did not even arguably infer that he was <em>\u201csatisfactorily </em>pursuing a <em>full-time </em>course of instruction\u201d as is required by Section 456(i) and 32 CFR \u00a7 1622.25(d). It is clear that Moses was not statutorily entitled to a student deferment based on the information possessed by the local board at the time his rescheduled induction order was issued. Any error therefore committed by the board\u2019s Executive Secretary in not submitting what little information she had to the entire board was harmless. See United States v. Jackson, supra; Batiste v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Nor may Moses cure this dearth, of information by a later presentation of additional facts before a court of law. By failing to inform his local board of the facts necessary for it to ascertain whether he was eligible for student deferment, Moses failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. This failure bars Moses\u2019 later assertion of entitlement because it jeopardizes the legitimate government interest \u201cin full administrative fact gathering and utilization of agency expertise.\u201d McGee v. United States, 1971, 402 U.S. 479, 486, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 1569, 29 L.Ed.2d 47. See McKart v. United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 185, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 23 L.Ed.2d 194; DuVernay v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 979, aff\u2019d by equally divided Supreme Court, 1969, 394 U.S. 309, 89 S.Ct. 1186, 22 L.Ed.2d 306. As this Court stated in United States v. McDuffie, 5 Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 1163, 1165:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201c \u2018We would frustrate administration of the Selective Service System by permitting a registrant first to stand aloof from the process designed to bring such possibly determinative facts to light * * * and then to challenge the firmness of the factual foundation for his draft board\u2019s discretionary actions.\u2019 United States v. Houston, 433 F.2d 939 (2d Cir. 1970).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6-\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\">.
