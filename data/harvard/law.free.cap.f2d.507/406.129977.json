Appellant was notified of this by letter dated April 8, 1971, and paid this amount on April 13, 1971. Subsequently, the appellant\u2019s 1969 return was selected for audit, and a further deficiency of $182.-84 was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Appellant, pro se, claims that the letter of April 8, 1971, written by a revenue officer, informing her that if she paid the original deficiency of $116.-32 she would have \u201cpaid in full for the Income Tax Return . . . for the period ended 12-31-69,\u201d constituted a closing agreement within \u00a7 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121, thus foreclosing the assessment of additional taxes. This contention is adequately answered in T.C. No. 145 (July 2, 1973) (Hall, J.), holding that the letter was not a \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d agreement binding both taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service, in the formal sense requisite in the Revenue Code and indeed could not have been one since Revenue Officer Kleinman, who sent the letter in question had no authority to execute the formal closing agreement which \u00a7 7121 envisages. <em>See </em>Delegation Order No. 97 (Rev. 9) (1971-1 Cum.Bull. 656). <em>See also </em>Harrington v. Commissioner, 48 T.C. 939, 953 (1967), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 404 F.2d 237 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">As Tax Judge Hall pointed out, the United States is not bound by the unauthorized acts of its agents, nor is it estopped to assert lack of authority as a defense. Bornstein v. United States, 345 F.2d 558, 562, 170 Ct.Cl. 576 (1965). Appellant, moreover, failed to establish detrimental reliance, which would be essential to a theory of estoppel. <em>Id. </em>at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Appellant, who commenced this suit by filing a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of a deficiency, also seeks to review the decisions of that court denying her requests, first, for a jury trial before the Tax Court and, second, for removal of the case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Dorl v. Commissioner, 57 T.C. 720 (1972) (Dawson, J.). It is elementary, although unfortunately not well known to the layman, that the filing of a timely petition with the United States Tax Court gives that court exclusive jurisdiction, \u00a7 6512, Int.Rev.Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6512(a), thereafter barring a refund suit in the district court. United States v. Wolf, 238 F.2d 447, 449 (9th Cir. 1956); Elbert v. Johnson, 164 F.2d 421, 424 (2d Cir. 1947). It is equally elementary that there is no right to a jury trial in the Tax Court. Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 599 n. 9, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931); Wick-wire v. Reinecke, 275 U.S. 101, 105, 48 S.Ct. 43, 72 L.Ed. 184 (1927). It is unfortunate, perhaps that an elderly unguided lay person has been deprived of the peace of mind that goes with the knowledge of having finally settled one\u2019s tax obligations to his government. If Revenue Officer Kleinman\u2019s original letter had been more artfully worded the taxpayer\u2019s distress and the ensuing litigation could have been avoided. Perhaps the Service will from it, however, see fit to devise a form letter that would meet the situation in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
