ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1275-20\">The named appellants, four employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), brought this class action against appellees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that they and 141 other HUD employees had unlawfully been suspended from employment because of absence without leave from their work posts on May 13, 1971. The action seeks declaratory relief and damages arising out of the allegedly wrongful suspensions. The District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that they had not proven sufficient likelihood of success on the merits due to their failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-22\">The District Court made findings of fact describing the events that gave birth to this litigation. At approximately noon on May 13, 1971, a large group of HUD employees assembled outside the office of Lester P. Condon, HUD\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Administration, to present grievances regarding equal employment opportunity in HUD and specifically to seek a response to a May 4 memorandum submitted to HUD by appellant Ronald Wallace, co-chairman of the HUD Employees Task Force Against Racism.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Condon returned to his office at 12:30 p. m. and spoke with appellants, the apparent group leaders; he twice requested that they return to their jobs and ask all other employees to follow suit. Appellants refused, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>claiming any control over the assembled group. At about 1:00 p. m. Condon himself, without avail, asked the employees to return to work. The group finally dispersed at about 3:30 p. m. All employees identified by their supervisors as participants in the incident were charged with absence without leave and denied compensation for the period of the absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">On May 21, 1971, HUD sent to the accused employees three types of letters giving notice of proposed actions of suspension. The first type, a proposed suspension for five days, was sent to the four appellants. It stated that their absences from work posts on May 13, and their refusal to comply with the orders to return and to request the return of demonstrators, amounted to insubordination. In addition, a letter noting absences without leave on May 13 and proposing a one-day suspension was sent to 146 other employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both types of letters also informed the affected employees of their right to respond in writing to the charges within five days and directed them to the HUD Personnel Office for further information. A third kind of letter, not here relevant, was sent to eight probationary employees notifying them of their absences without leave on May 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">Replies were received within the five-day period from 52 of the 150 employees who had the right to reply. HUD found that five responses gave satisfactory justification for being off the job and that the other 47 responses gave unsatisfactory reasons. The latter group of employees was suspended for one day. Of the remaining 98 nonprobationary employees to whom letters were sent, 94 were ordered suspended for one day and the four appellants for five days. The individual notices to the 145 employees who were ordered suspended described available appeals to the Civil Service Commission and the HUD grievance procedures,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but none of these employees pursued these remedies before seeking relief from the District Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">In ruling on appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, the District Court found that the suspensions, if unrestrained pending trial on the merits, would inflict irreparable injury on the affected employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>the motion, however, because appellants had not proven sufficient probability of success on the merits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The basis for this finding was appellants\u2019 failure to exhaust available administrative remedies, and in this court appellants have sought vigorously to justify that omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">The scope of our review is restricted to a determination as to whether the District Court\u2019s action was founded on an erroneous legal premise or constituted an abuse of its discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Four inquiries have traditionally governed decisions on motions for preliminary injunctions: (1) whether the movant has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) whether denial of relief prior to a decision on the merits would cause the movant to suffer irreparable injury, (3) whether harm to the respondent from granting relief outweighs the possible injury to the movant, and (4) whether, and if so how, the public interest will be affected by granting or denying relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The factors unearthed by the first two inquiries compel us to affirm the denial of pretrial relief;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we regard the factors developed by the latter two as neutral in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\"> It is well settled that resort to the judicial process must ordinarily be postponed until administrative remedies capable of rectifying claimed error have been pursued to finality.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where a failure to exhaust administrative remedies would likely preclude an award of relief at the end of the litigation, the party seeking relief has not made a sufficient showing of probability of ultimate success to obtain a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A number of diverse policies have motivated application of the exhaustion doctrine, and some we find relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>The Supreme Court has noted that administrative tribunals should generally be given the opportunity to correct their own errors and thereby obviate the need for judicial review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This policy is particularly viable where an established scheme of decision making might be undermined by permitting circumvention of administrative procedures.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This court has noted that close adherence to the exhaustion rule in such circumstances will prevent waste of judicial resources and discourage forum shopping.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Appellants contend that they are not bound by the general rule, because the administrative remedies available to them are inadequate and any endeavor to utilize them would be futile. It is beyond question that \u201cthe exhaustion requirement contemplates an efficacious administrative remedy,\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but appellees claim, and \u25a0 we agree, that two possible courses in the administrative process could provide appellants with the relief they now seek in court. Appellants could have obtained review of their suspensions by the Civil Service Commission under government-wide regulations <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or by HUD under its grievance procedures.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Among the grounds for relief urged in the District Court were lack of a hearing before suspension, failure by HUD to follow its own guidelines, and insufficiency of the time given appellants to respond to the notices of suspension.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It appears that each of these claims would lie within the scope of an appeal either to the Commission<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or within HUD.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is also clear that appellants\u2019 contention that the suspensions were by-products of racial discrimination could likewise be presented to the Commission.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">Appellants also assert that the exhaustion requirement is inapplicable, because they are seeking to remedy violations of constitutional rights over which the Commission and HUD have no jurisdiction. On the contrary, \u201c[t]he very fact that constitutional issues are put forward constitutes a strong reason for not allowing . . . suit either to anticipate or take the place of [agency action].\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To be sure, neither the Commission nor HUD could finally set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>tie the claim that appellants were victimized by racial discrimination or were protected by the First Amendment in their efforts to redress their grievances. But there are grounds on which appellants could succeed in nullifying the suspensions through the administrative process and eliminating any need for the courts to pass on the constitutional issues.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If the administrative appeals open to appellants and others similarly situated are unsuccessful, the constitutional issues will remain alive and judicial intervention in this employment dispute will become appropriate at that time.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">The failure to exhaust administrative remedies prevents appellants from demonstrating sufficient likelihood of success on the merits. As a result, the District Court properly denied their motion for a preliminary injunction. Appellants are free, of course, to now avail themselves of those remedies.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Initiation and pursuit of the administrative process does not appear particularly burdensome, and in the usual case need not long delay judicial resolution, if necessary. We repeat that \u201c [i]f [appellants] are unable to obtain justice through administrative remedies, they may then seek review and correction by the federal judiciary.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">The judgment of the District Court appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1275-15\">.

The memorandum asked HUD to clarify and itemize its response to fourteen demands that had originally been submitted by the Task Force shortly after a demonstration on October 13, 1970., The employees who participated in the October 13 incident were disciplined, resulting in a loss in pay; the demands were aimed at the elimination of alleged racial discrimination in HUD. These grievances were subsequently aired before an impartial appeals examiner who, on October 5, 1971, found a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination at HUD as of October 13, 1970, and recommended that the disciplinary actions following the incident of that date be rescinded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">.

Twenty-nine employees, including two of the appellants herein, appealed their suspen- \u25a0 sions to the Civil Service Commission two days after the District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. On Xovember 19, 1971, their appeals were denied on the ground that the procedures used by HUD complied with civil service regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1276-16\">. The District Court was of the view that appellants had shown the suspensions would cause irremediable harm to the affected employees despite the availability of retroactive reinstatement and back pay, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.-402 (1974), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596 (1970), and the possibility of expunging the suspensions from their personnel files, see 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.401 (1974). True there is no provision in the Civil Service regulations for a stay pending appeal to the Commission, see Sampson v. Murray, <em>supra </em>note 3, 415 U.S. at 93, 94 S.Ct. 937. (Douglas, J., dissenting), and HUD was not disposed to hold off the suspensions voluntarily. The Supreme Court, however, subsequently held that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>temporary loss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 90, 94 S.Ct. at 952; moreover, the Court noted that damage to reputation is insufficient to establish the irreparable injury required to order preliminary relief in favor of federal civil servants, <em>id. </em>at 91, 94 S.Ct. 937.

AVith respect to the third factor, the parties disagree as to the effect of a preliminary injunction on the daily operations of HUD. The District Court made no finding on this score, and we do not believe that restraint of the suspensions pending final determination of the merits would inflict appreciable injury on I-IUD. Appellants contend that a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest, because they were suspended for exercising First Amendment rights; appellees respond that the suspensions resulted from absence without leave and not from any exercise of constitutionally protected freedoms. The District Court has not yet passed on the validity of the asserted constitutional claims, nor do we, and appellants have not convinced us that the public interest factor is strong enough in any event to overcome the likelihood of loss on the merits for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1277-16\">.
