This order denied appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing of an earlier order denying his motion for reduction or modification of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. Appellant was sentenced on September 21, 1973. On November 13, 1973 he filed, through his attorney, a timely motion to reduce or modify sentence, which the district court denied on November 15, 1973. Appellant did not appeal this order. Instead, on March 14, 1974 he filed a pro se letter motion asking the district court to reduce or modify sentence. This motion was denied the day it was filed. A later motion for \u201crehearing\u201d of the November 15 and March 14 orders was likewise filed and denied on July 26, 1974. It is from this July 26 order that appellant now seeks to appeal. The district court, however, lost all jurisdiction to modify appellant\u2019s sentence 120 days after the original sentencing. Fed.R. Crim.P. 35; 8A Moore, Federal Practice K 35.02[2]. Thus, since the district court had no jurisdiction to grant the requested relief, we have no jurisdiction of this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United States v. Bryan, 5 Cir. 1974, 498 F.2d 366; United States v. Granville, 5 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 1073; United States v. Gorman, 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\">. Appellee argues that because appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on August 9, 1974 without allegations of excusable neglect, we lack jurisdiction of this appeal under Fed.R. App.P. 4(b). We note, however, that appellant\u2019s notice was dated July 31, 1974, well within the time for appealing the July 26 order. Because we find the Rule 35 issue dispositive, we need not pass on whether appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was timely under Fallen v. United States, 378 U.S. 139, 84 S.Ct. 1689, 12 L.Ed.2d 760. <em>Compare </em>United States v. Mehrtens, 5 Cir. 1974, 494 F.2d 1172, 1176, <em>with </em>United States v. Grimes, 5 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 706, 707.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
