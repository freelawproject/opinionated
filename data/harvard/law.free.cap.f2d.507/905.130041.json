(NRDC), a nonprofit corporation, the Arizona Nurses\u2019 Association, also a nonprofit corporation, and Dr. Richard Abbuhl, individually, challenge the approval by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of various portions of the implementation plan submitted by the State of Arizona under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857 et seq. (the Act). This court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the challenge is founded upon Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">The federal-state cooperative scheme of the Act has been well described elsewhere.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For present purposes, it is necessary only to reiterate briefly that the Act charges the EPA with responsibility for setting national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and imposes upon the EPA the duty of ensuring that the implementation plans of the various states provide for both the attainment of these standards within the statutorily prescribed time periods and the maintenance of these levels thereafter. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c \u2014 4, 1857c-5. Petitioners contend that the EPA has breached this duty by approving those elements of the Arizona implementation plan<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which (1) allow the State to grant variances in a manner unauthorized by the Act; (2) inadequately provide for the full disclosure of emissions data by individual sources of air pollution; and (3) provide for the issuance of permits for new and modified sources of pollution in a manner insufficient to guarantee the attainment and maintenance of national air standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-14\">Before appraising the merits of these substantive issues raised by petitioners, we shall first consider the standing of each petitioner to assert these arguments before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-16\">The Tenth Circuit, in a similar action brought by the NRDC to test the adequacy of the Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah implementation plans, dismissed the petition for lack of standing. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 481 F.2d 116 (10th Cir. 1973). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>The court refused to read into Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b)(1), a standing requirement more liberal than that applied by the Supreme Court in other cases in which standing to sue was predicated upon a specific statutory authorization. 481 F.2d at 120 \u2014 121. We agree with this construction of section 307(b)(1). Given the inexorable interrelationship between standing and the constitutional prerequisites of federal jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 98, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), we are unable to accept the NRDC\u2019s contention that the statute could confer standing without a prior showing of \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d <em>See </em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151-152, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). Nor does the legislative history of the section demonstrate, as the NRDC avers, that this is what Congress intended when it established this mode of review for EPA decision-making.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">The Supreme Court, in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), and <em>Data Processing, supra, </em>has required litigants who assert standing based upon an enabling statute (as here) to demonstrate that they have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d <em>and </em>that this injury is \u201carguably within the zone of interests\u201d to be protected by the applicable statute. <em>Sierra Club, supra </em>405 U.S. at 732-733, 92 S.Ct. at 1365; <em>Data Processing, supra </em>397 U.S. at 152\u2014153, 90 S.Ct. 827. The \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requirement necessitates a showing that the party seeking review be himself among the injured. <em>Sierra Club, supra </em>405 U.S. at 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361. Neither petitioners nor respondent has seen fit to enlighten the court with respect to the identity of the \u201cpetitioners,\u201d their relationship to the State of Arizona, if any, or just how they or any of them are among those who might be injured by any deficiency in the Arizona State implementation plan. The Petition for Review cryptically states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-9\">\u201cNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., Project on Clean Air; Dr. Richard Abbuhl; the Arizon [sic] State Nurse\u2019s Association petition this court for review of the rules and regulations promulgated by respondent (37 Fed. Reg. 10842 [May 31, 1972], 40 CFR Part 52, Subchapter C) insofar as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>approve the state air pollution implementation plan for the state of Arizona.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">We therefore requested additional briefs addressed to the critical jurisdictional question that we raised sua sponte. Respondent argued that no sufficient showing had been made and requested that the petition be dismissed. Petitioners, without seeking to amend their petition or supplement the record, <em>see </em>Fed.R. App.P. 16(b), simply described themselves in an unverified memorandum as follows: (1) The National Resources Defense Council, with offices in Palo Alto, California; New York City, New York; and Washington, D.C., is a New York nonprofit corporation that comprises approximately 16,000 members, 107 of whom are residents of Arizona. There has been no allegation or showing on the record in this court that the Arizona members have either requested to be represented or consented to be represented by the NRDC in this action. (2) The Arizona Nurses\u2019 Association is a nonprofit Arizona corporation with approximately 2,300 nurses as members throughout the State of Arizona. The memorandum states that \u201c[t]he Association testified\u201d at some of the public hearings on the Arizona State implementation plan. (3) Dr. Abbuhl is a resident and medical practitioner of Phoenix, Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">While the Arizona resident members of the nonprofit organizations breathe the air of the State and their health and well-being may be affected by pollutants in the air, the constituent corporations neither breathe the air nor is their corporate health affected by it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the basis of the record before us we are unconvinced that the NRDC has sufficiently asserted or made a showing within Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), to qualify as possessing standing. In a supplemental statement, it is alleged that some of the nurses of the Arizona Nurses\u2019 Association participated in the Arizona hearings, but on the basis of the petition it is doubtful if this corporation is in any better position than the NRDC. There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Abbuhl, as a resident of Arizona, will suffer injury if compelled to breathe air less pure than that mandated by the Clean Air Act. <em>See </em>United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 687, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973); <em>id. </em>at 703, 93 S.Ct. 2405 (Douglas, J., dissenting in part). On this basis, we are satisfied that there is sufficient individual interest presented in this petition for review to allow us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>go forward. The petition is dismissed, however, as to petitioners NRDC and the Arizona Nurses\u2019 Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">With this preliminary jurisdictional inquiry aside, we may now address seri-atim the specific objections of petitioner Abbuhl to the Arizona implementation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">\n<em>Variances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Under the Arizona statute, any individual source of pollution may apply for a \u201cconditional permit\u201d allowing the source to vary from the requirements of the State\u2019s implementation plan. Such variances may be granted if \u201cadditional time is needed for compliance and . the conditional permit, if granted, will not unduly endanger human health or safety either directly or indirectly.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 36 \u2014 1712 (West Supp. 1973). Petitioner advances three reasons why this provision should have been disapproved by the EPA as inconsistent with the dictates of the Act. First, this procedure allegedly circumvents the only express mechanism in the Act through which individual exemptions from the requirements of a state\u2019s implementation plan may be granted. Secondly, petitioner contends that this element of Arizona\u2019s plan improperly interjects economic considerations into the State\u2019s program through which national air quality standards are to be attained and maintained. Finally, petitioner asserts that this provision may interfere with Arizona\u2019s ability to regulate in conformity with these standards new and modified sources of pollution. For the reasons hereinafter set forth we reject these contentions of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">According to petitioner, an individual source of pollution may secure a vari-anee from any requirement of a state\u2019s implementation plan only by application to the EPA, by the governor of the state in question, for a \u201cpostponement\u201d under Section 110(f) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(f). The EPA, responding to this argument in earlier challenges to the Agency\u2019s approval of state plans containing similar allowances for variances, construed section 110(f) as relevant only to those exemptions from a state plan that would preclude the attainment or maintenance of national ambient air standards. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 478 F.2d 875, 886 (1st Cir. 1973). The EPA viewed the Act as enabling a state to grant \u201cvariances,\u201d subject to approval by the EPA, for reasons other than those denominated in section 110(f) as long as such variances were minor, <em>i. e., </em>did not inhibit national air quality standards. <em>Id. </em>The EPA has since acceded to an intermediate interpretation, articulated by the First Circuit in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., supra, </em>that would require mandatory resort to section 110(f), for such minor variances, only in the so-called \u201cpostat-tainment\u201d period, i. e., the period after May 31, 1975, the point at which national primary ambient air standards are to be achieved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is this construction that the EPA asserts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">The First Circuit, in reasoning that has since been adopted by the Second and Eighth Circuits, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 494 F.2d 519, 523 (2d Cir. 1974); Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 483 F.2d 690, 693-694 (8th Cir. 1973), categorized as the \u201cpreattainment\u201d period that time within which the states must achieve national primary ambient air standards, viz., \u201cas expeditiously as practicable\u201d but in no case later than 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>years beyond the date on which the state implementation plan is approved by EPA. 478 F.2d at 885. Reading the \u201cas expeditiously as practicable\u201d language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(a)(2)(A)(i) as indicative of a congressional intent to allow the states a measure of flexibility during this period, the court accepted the EPA\u2019s allowance of a state\u2019s variance procedure, similar to that at issue here, during this preliminary period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 478 F.2d at 887. The court declined, however, to recognize the availability of such flexibility after May 31, 1975. Rather, the court viewed section 110(f) of the Act as the exclusive means intended by Congress to vary any requirement of a state plan after the attainment date; any other procedure might \u201cinvite protracted delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 886. Yet the court acknowledged that some brief and minor variances might be acceptable after this time, without reference to section 110(f), for \u201cmechanical breakdowns and acts of God.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">We do not agree with this interpretation of the Act. While the First Circuit recognized, 478 F.2d at 887, that <em>any </em>variance, whenever sought, which would affect the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air standard (/. e., a \u201cmajor\u201d exemption) necessarily can be effected only through the express procedures of section 110(f), and only for the reasons stated in that section, there is no statutory basis for treating minor variances differently in the \u201cpreattainment\u201d and \u201cpostattainment\u201d periods. Indeed, given the First Circuit\u2019s restrictive reading of the Act as applicable in the postattainment period, it appears inconsistent for that court to acknowledge the need for minor variances, effected in the postattainment period without recourse to section 110(f), for mechanical breakdowns and acts of God. The statute lends itself only to one of two alternatives: either minor variances are possible at any time without recourse to section 110(f), or section 110(f) must be followed for any and all exemptions from a state\u2019s implementation plan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">We read the legislative history of section 110(f) as demonstrative of a congressional intent to have that section apply only in those cases in which a particular variance would prevent the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air standard. The origin of section 110(f) was section 111(f) of the Senate version of the Act. A portion of the relevant commentary from the Senate report concerning this provision is particularly instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-10\">\u201cFinally, the Committee would recognize that compliance with the national ambient air quality standards deadline may not be possible. If a Governor judges that any region or regions or portions thereof within his State will not meet the national ambient air quality standard within the time provided, the bill would authorize him \u2014 one year before the deadline \u2014 to file a petition against the United States in the District Court of the United States for the district where such region or portion thereof is located for relief from the effect of such expiration.\u201d S.Rep.No.91-1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 14-15 (1970). <em>See also id. </em>at 55 \u2014 56; 116 Cong.Rec. 33,117</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">(1970) (remarks of Senator Cooper). After Conference, this provision became part of the Act, with only a slight, procedural alteration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>was intended to encompass only \u201cmajor\u201d modifications of a state\u2019s plan \u2014 modifications that would inhibit a national standard within a particular air control region \u2014 is reaffirmed by the Conference report and the Senate debates accompanying the passage of the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">We must now consider whether or not the Act contemplates the issuance by states of \u201cminor\u201d variances, subject always to EPA approval. We agree with the First Circuit that such flexibility, during what that court termed the preattainment period, is indicated by the employment of the term \u201cpracticable\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(a)(2)(A)(i).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We extend this rationale, however, to the time after national standards are to be achieved. Without such an interpretation, it is difficult to perceive any just basis for the Act\u2019s exhortation to the states to promulgate implementation plans even stricter than that required to attain national ambient air standards. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857d-l. As long as a possible variance from a state plan will not preclude the attainment or maintenance of such standards, we discern no legislative intent to commit a state, in toto, to its initial plan, without any flexibility whatsoever.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To be sure, we recognize that the Act intends a policy of \u201cnondegradation,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>those geographic areas enjoying air quality superior to that mandated by the Act are not to be made to suffer a reduction in such quality to national standards. Sierra Club v. Ruckelshaus, 344 F.Supp. 253, 255-257 (D.D.C.1972), aff\u2019d per curiam, No. 72-1528 (D.C.Cir. Nov. 1, 1972), aff\u2019d by an equally divided Court sub nom. Fri v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Sierra Club, 412 U.S. 541, 93 S.Ct. 2770, 37 L.Ed.2d 140 (1973) (per curiam). Yet even here a measure of flexibility was written into the Act: the states are to provide for the maintenance of such superior air quality \u201cto the maximum extent <em>practicable.\u201d </em>S.Rep.No.91 \u2014 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1970) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Petitioner argues strenuously that the Act\u2019s conception of \u201cpracticability\u201d does not include considerations of economic cost and technological feasibility. Indeed, the portions of the legislative history relied upon by petitioner, as well as several other references in the reports and debates, clearly evince a legislative intent to realize national ambient air standards despite economic cost and in spite of the possibility that some business enterprises, unable to comply with a state\u2019s plan so as to enable that state to attain national standards within the prescribed time period, might have to terminate operations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We do not believe, however, that the Act forestalls consideration of economic and technological feasibility when a variance that will not interfere with national ambient air standards is contemplated. <em>See also </em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 483 F.2d 690, 694 (8th Cir. 1973); Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 478 F.2d 875, 888-889 (1st Cir. 1973). Accordingly, we hold that the EPA properly approved the Arizona \u201cconditional permit\u201d system that allows variances, as long as the public health or safety will not be unduly endangered, if \u201cadditional time is needed for compliance\u201d with a particular requirement of the State\u2019s implementation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">While finding that the Act permits the adoption of a state \u201cvariance\u201d system similar to that contained in the Arizona implementation plan, we nevertheless stress that the ultimate arbiter of the propriety of any particular variance is and must be the EPA. <em>See </em>Getty Oil Co. (Eastern Operations) v. Ruckelshaus, 467 F.2d 349, 358 (3d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1125, 93 S.Ct. 937, 35 L.Ed.2d 256 (1973). Thus, should the State of Arizona grant a \u201cminor\u201d variance that does, in fact, alter the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air standard, the EPA is bound to disapprove this modification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>State implementation plan unless the explicit procedures of section 110(f) are followed and the modification is justified under that section. Indeed, until any variance is sanctioned by the EPA, any source operating in contravention of a state implementation plan that has been approved by that Agency is subject to forced compliance at the instance of the EPA. <em>See Getty Oil Co., supra; </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-8. Since no variance is operative without EPA approval, we do not agree with the First Circuit that the allowance of such variance procedures, in the postattainment period, will \u201cinvite protracted delay.\u201d Pending final approval of the variance by the EPA, the individual source is committed to the emissions standards enumerated in the original or previously revised<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> state plan. Moreover, we fail to see how exclusive reliance upon the procedural and substantive hurdles of section 110(f) would facilitate a prompt determination on any particular sought-after variance. <em>See </em>Comment, Variance Procedures Under the Clean Air Act: The Need for Flexibility, 15 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 324, 334-36 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">We are not unaware that the Fifth Circuit has recently accepted petitioner\u2019s construction of the Act. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 489 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. granted, sub nom NRDC Inc. v. Train, - U.S.-, 95 S.Ct. 39, 42 L.Ed.2d 46 (No. 73-1742); <em>see also </em>Buckeye Power, Inc. v. EPA, 481 F.2d 162, 167 (6th Cir. 1973) (dictum). With that court, we acknowledge that resort to the legislative history of a statute is unwarranted when the terms of the statute are clear and unambiguous. United States v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 643, 648, 81 S.Ct. 1278, 6 L.Ed.2d 575 (1961); Easson v. Commissioner, 294 F.2d 653, 656-657 (9th Cir. 1961); Gilbert v. Commissioner, 241 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir. 1957). To be sure, the express language of section 110(f), standing alone, is not ambiguous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet, the failure of the Act to define \u201crevision,\u201d as used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(3), and to indicate what notions are embodied in the \u201cas expeditiously as practicable\u201d language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(A)(i), create a lack of clarity in meaning when those sections are juxtaposed with section 110(f) as construed by petitioner and the Fifth Circuit. The words of the statute, in toto, give rise to a \u201clegitimate doubt\u201d as to the meaning intended, and, therefore, justify resort to the legislative history. Maun v. United States, 347 F.2d 970, 976 (9th Cir. 1965). As stated, we do not see in this history a congressional intent to establish section 110(f) as the exclusive mechanism by which <em>all </em>changes of particular application may be accomplished. <em>Compare </em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 489 F.2d 390, 401 (5th Cir. 1974). Further, since we believe that the EPA\u2019s \u201crevision\u201d authority of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(3) is not the statutory basis for the allowance of variance procedures such as those at issue here,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the semantic differences surrounding the various generally accepted definitions of \u201cpostponement,\u201d \u201crevision,\u201d and \u201cvariance\u201d are irrelevant. This fact, in addition to our different interpretation of the legislative history of the Act, marks the point of departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>between our reasoning and that of the Fifth Circuit. <em>See Natural Resources Defense Council, supra, </em>489 F.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">In so construing the Act, we have adopted an interpretation asserted neither by petitioner nor respondent here.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is our duty, however, to apply the statute in accordance with what we perceive to be the congressional intent underlying the Act. Woods v. Benson Hotel Corp., 177 F.2d 543, 546 (8th Cir. 1949); Miller v. Burger, 161 F.2d 992, 994 (9th Cir. 1947); <em>see </em>FTC v. Texaco, Inc., 393 U.S. 223, 226, 89 S.Ct. 429, 21 L.Ed.2d 394 (1968); Rachal v. Allen, 376 F.2d 999, 1002-1004 (5th Cir. 1967). Under usual circumstances, we would accord \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the interpretation of the EPA, the administrative agency responsible for enforcing the statute. <em>E. g., </em>Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). But we feel less bound by this principle when the EPA interpretation is, as here, merely an accession to a previous judicial decision. Indeed, the construction we adopt is more in tune with the original EPA interpretation<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that has since been abandoned after the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 478 F.2d 875 (1st Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The EPA has informed this court that it intends to revoke its approval of the Arizona plan insofar as that plan allows state variance during the First Circuit\u2019s \u201cpostattainment\u201d period. The appropriate administrative processes that, if Arizona failed to modify its plan accordingly, would eventually culminate in the EPA\u2019s promulgation of a substitute, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c\u2014 5(c), have already begun. Our decision here does not foreclose the adoption by the State of Arizona of an implementation plan that forbids the issuance of variances through means other than that prescribed in section 110(f), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(f), after that date on which national ambient air standards are to be achieved. The Act expressly authorizes the states to devise implementation plans stricter than required to maintain national air quality standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857d-l. Our interpretation of the Act, however, precludes the EPA\u2019s rejection of a state plan which contains a provision for variances similar to that at issue here and which is enforced in a manner wholly consistent with the policies underlying the federal statute. Additionally, the EPA may not exercise its authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(c) to promulgate a substitute plan for the State of Arizona that, contrary to the intent expressed in the State statute or implementation plan, proscribes the issuance of \u201cminor\u201d variances<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> under a procedure other than that specified in section 110(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Petitioner\u2019s final objection to the inclusion within the Arizona plan of a \u201cconditional permit\u201d or variance provision is the assertion that the procedure would undermine the State\u2019s obligation to prevent any interference with national ambient air standards by new and modified sources of pollution. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(D), (4). Under petitioner\u2019s theory, any conditions, designed to protect national air quality standards, that have been incorporated within a state permit required before a new source is constructed or an existing source is modified may be circumvented by subsequent application for a \u201cconditional permit.\u201d Since we conclude, however, that any such permits would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>effectual until sanctioned by the EPA, and that the EPA could not approve such a variance \u2014 if such a modification would prevent the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air standard \u2014 unless the procedural and substantive requirements of section 110(f) were met, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">\n<em>Confidentiality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The EPA approved the following provision for confidentiality within the Arizona air pollution control statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKTz\">\u201cAny records or other information furnished to or obtained by the director concerning one or more air pollution sources, which records and information relate to production or sales figures or to the processes or production unique to the owner or operator, or which would tend to adversely affect the competitive position of such owner or operator, shall be only for the confidential use of the director in the administration of this chapter, unless such owner or operator shall expressly agree to their publication or availability to the public. No provision of this section shall be construed to prohibit the appropriate governmental agency from publishing quantitative and qualitative statistics pertaining to the emission of pollutants.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 36-1708, subd. D (West Supp.1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">We believe that the last sentence of this quoted section of the statute clearly and adequately ensures public access to emissions data within the State of Arizona, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(F)(iii), (iv). <em>Compare </em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v.

Petitioners\u2019 assertion that the EPA acted inconsistently in approving this element of the Arizona plan, while simultaneously rejecting \u201cvirtually identical\u201d provisions in the Kansas and Kentucky implementation plans, is without merit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\"> As with the approval by the EPA of Arizona\u2019s statutory scheme regarding new and modified sources of pollution (to be examined <em>infra), </em>the appropriate standard of review in appraising the EPA\u2019s sanction of Arizona\u2019s confidentiality provision is that contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(A) \u2014 (D) and applied in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415-417, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). Delaware Citizens for Clean Air, Inc. v. EPA, 480 F.2d 972, 975-976 (3d Cir. 1973); Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 477 F.2d 495, 504\u2014507 (4th Cir. 1973). Since we cannot say that the EPA\u2019s determination here was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d it must be sustained under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>\n<em>Regulation of New and Modified Sources</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Petitioner\u2019s final objections to the Arizona implementation plan relate to the procedures intended to regulate in conformity with the Act the construction and modification of new and existing sources of pollution. The Act requires that each state include within its plan a \u201creview\u201d procedure designed to ensure that any proposed construction or modification of sources will not inhibit the attainment or maintenance of national ambient air standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(D), (4). The relevant portion of the Arizona statute declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axn-dedup-0\">\u201cA new industry hereinafter established shall not begin normal operation until it has secured a permit attesting that its operation will not cause pollution in excess of the standards <em>set by the state board of health.\u201d </em>Ariz.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 36 \u2014 1700, subd. B (West Supp. 1973) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axt\">In litigation testing the adequacy of the Iowa implementation plan, the EPA admitted that its approval of a provision<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> similar to that quoted above was improper. Natural Resources Defense Counsel, Inc. v. EPA, 483 F.2d 690, 694 (8th Cir. 1973). This confession of error was based upon a recognition of the Iowa plan\u2019s failure explicitly to forestall any interference with <em>national </em>air quality standards. Since the Arizona provision seeks to guarantee the operation of new sources consistent only with \u201cstandards set by the state board of health,\u201d it seems subject to the same infirmity as that which caused the invalidation of the applicable <em>provision </em>in <em>the Iowa </em>plan. Accordingly, the EPA\u2019s approval of this element of the Arizona plan must be set aside in order to effectuate the \u201creasonable\u201d agency decisionmaking required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Indeed, the EPA has informed the court that administrative action is currently in progress to revise the Arizona regulations appropriately. We direct the EPA to discharge fully its responsibilities under the Act so as to ensure the development of an Arizona plan that gives proper regard to national air quality standards when considering permits for new and modified sources of pollution. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(a)(2)(D), (4); <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1857c-5(a)(3), (c)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that Arizona\u2019s new- and modified-source regulations do not mandate continuing compliance with the State\u2019s \u201ccontrol strategy,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> as required by 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.18(d), is without merit. The Arizona statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-10\">\u201cThe director shall deny an installation permit or an operating permit if the applicant does not show that every such machine, equipment, incinerator, device or other article . . . , the use of which may cause or contribute to air pollution, . . . is so designed, controlled, or equipped with such air pollution control equipment, that it may be expected to operate without emitting or without causing to be emitted air contaminants in violation of the provisions of this article <em>and the rules and regulations </em>adopted by the [board of health].\u201d Ariz.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Stat. \u00a7 36-1707.02, subd.

In arguing that the statute bestows a \u201cstanding\u201d which does not require the assertion of \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d petitioners rely upon the following passage from the applicable Senate report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">\u201cOne of the uncertainties in the existing Clean Air Act is the availability or opportunity for judicial review of administratively developed and promulgated standards and regulations ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-7\">\u201cAdministratively developed standards, rules and regulations under the Act and under this bill would clearly affect the interests of persons. The courts are increasingly adapting this test to what administrative actions are reviewable. In several recent cases [Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Hardin, [138 U.S.App.D.C. 391, 428 F.2d 1093] (C.A. No. 23,813, May 28, 1970); Barlow v. Collins (397 U.S. 159, 167, [90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192] (1970); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardiner [sic] (387 U.S. 136, 140-141 [87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681] (1967))] the Courts have held that even in matters committed by statute to administrative discretion, preclusion of judicial review \u2018is not lightly to be inferred . it requires a showing of clear evidence of legislative intent.\u2019 (E. D. F. v. Hardin, supra, p. 7.) The Courts have granted this review to those being regulated and to those who seek \u2018to protect the public interest in the proper administration of a regulatory system enacted for their benefit.\u2019 (E.

Since precluding review does not appear to be warranted or desirable, the bill would specifically provide for such review within controlled time periods.\u201d S.Rep.No.91-1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 40-41 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a8b-dedup-0\">We read the quoted passage as germane only to the legislative determination that judicial review of the EPA\u2019s approval of the various state implementation plans should be expressly made available. Thus, the statement relates only to the <em>fact </em>of judicial review, and does not purport to specify <em>who </em>may petition for such review. A reading of the cases cited in the report confirms this interpretation. See, e. g., Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v.

This is to be contrasted to the legal corporation, either profit or nonprofit, which is an artificial entity separate and apart from its membership that exists solely by virtue of a charter issued by the state of incorporation. The quoted reference of the Court in <em>Sierra Club, supra, </em>is followed by the citation of NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963), wherein the NAACP is described as a nonprofit membership corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 83 S.Ct. 328. The Court stated that \u201cthough a corporation,\u201d the NAACP was itself directly engaged in the activities that the state statute would proscribe; it also expressed the opinion that the corporation had standing to assert the corresponding rights of its members. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 83 S.Ct. 328. This \u201crepresentative standing\u201d was immediately assignable to the nature of the constitutional right asserted in <em>Button, </em>freedom of association, and the Court\u2019s recognition that, \u201cin every practical sense,\u201d the NAACP and its members are \u201cidentical.\u201d <em>See </em>NAACP v.

Whatever may the standing of legal corporations, profit or non-profit, to represent \u2018members\u2019 who suffer an injury in fact, the allegations here, however, as were the allegations in Sierra Club, are entirely inadequate to sustain claims by these corporations either for themselves or, in representative capacities, for their individual members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">.

As discussed above, we hold that section 110(f) need not be con-suited at all for \u201cminor\u201d variances that will not inhibit national air quality standards. <em>See </em>note 20 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">. <em>See </em>36 Fed.Reg. 22,405 (1971); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.32(f) (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">.

Subsequent to the EPA approval of the Arizona plan, the EPA acknowledged that the plan itself may not sufficiently implement the policy of disclosure of emissions data that is required by the Arizona statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">\u201cThe pertinent section of the Arizona Plan (Sec. 2.6) speaks of the necessity of an amendment to the statute, rather than providing that such emissions reports shall be made available, and, therefore, the Administrator, upon reconsideration, has no alternative but to direct revision of the Arizona Plan in this respect. This will be done as promptly as possible.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">We have been advised by the EPA that appropriate administrative proceedings to achieve the necessary clarification of the Arizona plan have been initiated and are continuing during the pendency of this action. Since we read the Arizona statute to provide the degree of disclosure mandated by the Act, we do not find that the EPA acted erroneous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>ly in originally approving the Arizona plan. We presume, however, that the Arizona plan will be modified in a timely manner to reflect expressly the unconditional availability of emissions data which is allowed unde fhe Arizona statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"agb-dedup-0\">. \u201cThe department shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">\u201c7.
