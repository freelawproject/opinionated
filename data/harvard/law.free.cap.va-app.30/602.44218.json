McDaniel filed a motion to suppress statements he made to the police. The trial judge denied the motion and, after a bench trial, convicted McDaniel of statutory burglary, grand larceny, and receiving stolen property. On appeal, McDaniel contends the police interrogated him in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel and the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress his statement. A panel of this Court, with one judge dissenting, reversed the trial judge\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence. <em>See McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 432, 506 S.E.2d 21 (1998). We stayed the mandate of that decision and granted rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">The facts pertinent to the motion to suppress are essentially undisputed. Detective Rodney Caison of the Hampton City Police Department testified that he arrested David A. McDaniel for burglary and larceny pursuant to arrest warrants. From a preprinted card, the detective read to McDaniel a statement of <em>Miranda </em>rights but did not question McDaniel at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>that time. After searching McDaniel\u2019s residence, the detective transported McDaniel to an investigative services office. There, the detective began to interrogate McDaniel concerning his involvement in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Before responding to the interrogation, McDaniel stated, \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me.\u201d The detective testified that he interpreted McDaniel\u2019s statement to be a question and told McDaniel that he could not tell him whether he needed an attorney. Continuing the interrogation, the detective told McDaniel that he should be truthful because two witnesses saw him commit the offenses and because McDaniel\u2019s accomplice had confessed to the crimes and implicated McDaniel in the crimes. The detective testified that McDaniel responded, \u201c[y]ou already know everything,\u201d and then confessed to committing the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">McDaniel also testified at the suppression hearing. He confirmed that he made the request for an attorney as recited by the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The trial judge found that McDaniel\u2019s request for an attorney was not a question. However, reasoning that \u201c[t]he word rather in the middle of his statement indicates some degree of choice,\u201d the trial judge ruled that the request for counsel was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">To ensure the right against compelled self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. More than thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court addressed \u201cthe admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his [or her] privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself [or herself].\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 439, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The Court \u201cheld ... that ... [an accused] subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>custodial interrogation has the right to consult with an attorney and to have counsel present during questioning, and that the police must explain this right [to the accused] ... before questioning begins.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 457, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">After the police have advised an accused of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, the accused may make a knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights and respond to the police interrogation. <em>See Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 483-84, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). However, if the accused \u201cexpresses] his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, [the accused] is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him ... [or] the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that the test for determining whether the accused invoked the right to counsel is an objective one. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 457-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350. The Court must determine whether the accused \u201carticulate[d] his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Although the detective testified that he \u201cinterpreted\u201d McDaniel\u2019s response to be a question, and not a request for an attorney, the trial judge rejected that explanation after hearing the detective recite the words and provide his recollection of inflections that McDaniel used. The trial judge stated, \u201cit\u2019s not a question \u2014 there\u2019s no way it could be a question.\u201d We agree with the trial judge\u2019s finding. Nothing about the construction of McDaniel\u2019s words indicates that McDaniel spoke anything other than a declarative statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The trial judge also found, however, that \u201c[t]he word \u2018rather\u2019 in the middle of his statement indicates some degree of choice.\u201d Based on that finding, the trial judge ruled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>statement was ambiguous. We disagree. The statement, as ordinarily understood, is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Although the record does not contain the precise language contained on the card from which the detective read to McDaniel the <em>Miranda </em>rights, those rights typically are worded to inform an accused as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">MIRANDA WARNING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">1. You have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">3. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you are being questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you, without cost, before any questioning, if you desire one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-11\"><em>Harrison v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 576, 578, 423 S.E.2d 160, 161 (1992). <em>See also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 310, 312, 373 S.E.2d 340, 341-42 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">McDaniel\u2019s response after the detective informed him of the <em>Miranda </em>rights was, \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me.\u201d That statement contains no ambiguity. The word \u201cthink\u201d is generally defined \u201cto have in one\u2019s mind as an intention or desire,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>2376 (1986), and the word \u201crather,\u201d in the context of McDaniel\u2019s statement, means \u201cmore readily\u201d or \u201cprefer to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1885. The statement was an appropriate response to the warnings, which gave McDaniel the choice of speaking with the detective without an attorney or having an attorney present while the detective questioned him. By indicating his preference, McDaniel made his choice clear, informing the detective that he desired to have an attorney speak for him. <em>See State v. Jackson, </em>348 N.C. 52, 497 S.E.2d 409, 412 (1998) (ruling that the response \u201c T think I need a lawyer present,\u2019 ... was not an ambiguous statement\u201d). In requesting an attorney, McDaniel was not required to \u201c \u2018speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>McDaniel\u2019s statement is qualitatively different than statements held to be ambiguous by the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia. McDaniel did not phrase his response in the form of a question. <em>See Mueller v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 396-97, 422 S.E.2d 380, 387 (1992) (\u201cDo you think I need an attorney here?\u201d); <em>Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 252-54, 397 S.E.2d 385, 395-96 (1990) (\u201cYou did say I could have an attorney if I wanted one?\u201d). Furthermore, McDaniel expressed more than a mere \u201creservation\u201d about continuing the interrogation without counsel. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 462, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (\u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer.\u201d); <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 267, 462 S.E.2d 112, 115-16 (1995) (\u201cI\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We hold that McDaniel unambiguously responded with sufficient clarity that a reasonable police officer would have understood that McDaniel wanted an attorney. Thus, the interrogation should have ceased. <em>See Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880. Because we conclude that the detective gained McDaniel\u2019s confession by continuing the interrogation after McDaniel had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, we reverse the trial judge\u2019s denial of the suppression motion. Accordingly, we reverse the convictions and remand this matter to the circuit court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">. In <em>Davis, </em>the suspect stated during the interrogation, \"Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.\u201d 512 U.S. at 455, 114 S.Ct. 2350. He then continued to talk to the investigator. The Court concluded that the confession did not have to be suppressed because Davis only indicated that he <em>\"might </em>want a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (emphasis in original). The Court also noted, however, that later, while still being interrogated, Davis said, \"I <em>think </em>I want a lawyer before I say anything else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (emphasis added). The Court observed that the interrogation then ceased immediately. <em>Id. </em>While the issue whether Davis' second statement was ambiguous was not before the Court, the fact that the interrogators ceased questioning Davis indicates that the investigators understood Davis\u2019 statement to be a clear request for counsel. We believe that the Court\u2019s recitation of the circumstances leading to the cessation of the questioning is significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>LEMONS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKE\">with whom BUMGARDNER, J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The trial court found that McDaniel\u2019s statement \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me\u201d was not an unequivocal request for counsel. In reversing the conviction the majority substitutes its own findings for that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Detective Caison obtained probable cause for a warrant charging McDaniel with burglary and grand larceny. Having been previously convicted of four misdemeanors and one felony, McDaniel had prior experience with the criminal justice system. Caison went to McDaniel\u2019s home and placed him under arrest. At that point, Caison read McDaniel a statement of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which McDaniel understood. McDaniel wished to continue speaking to Caison but made no statements that \u201ccaused [Caison] any concern.\u201d Caison then requested McDaniel\u2019s permission to search the house, which McDaniel granted. McDaniel\u2019s wife escorted Caison to the garage, where Caison observed a \u201cgas-powered Sears pressure washer.\u201d McDaniel was then transported to Investigative Services for further interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">McDaniel was not re-read his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the police station; however, he continued \u201cdiscussing the case\u201d with Caison. Over one hour had elapsed since the reading of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAt the beginning of the interview\u201d while \u201cdiscussing the case,\u201d McDaniel stated to the detective, \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me.\u201d The detective responded to McDaniel by saying, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you if you need an attorney or not\u201d and told McDaniel that he needed to be \u201ctruthful to the Court, because the facts are we have two witnesses that were working surveillance and saw you at Sears in the compound\u201d and that the other suspect had \u201calready confessed and implicated\u201d McDaniel. Thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>McDaniel made incriminating statements concerning the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">At the suppression hearing, referring variously to the defendant\u2019s \u201cemotion,\u201d \u201cdemeanor,\u201d \u201cbody language,\u201d and the circumstances of the encounter, the detective stated that, \u201cIf you were there and around the atmosphere and everything, he was looking at me for a response.\u201d Although the trial court rejected the detective\u2019s characterization of McDaniel\u2019s statement as a question, the trial court compared the statement to others considered by the Supreme Court of Virginia and the United States Supreme Court and found that, \u201c[tjhere is an equivalent amount of equivocation, ambiguity, in the statement as spoken by this defendant, as there has been in those other cases where other language was cited.\u201d Whether McDaniel\u2019s statement was a question is not the issue in this case. The trial judge focused upon the issue in this case: whether McDaniel\u2019s statement, under the circumstances and in context, was equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">McDaniel does not contend that his incriminating statements were involuntary. Rather, he argues that the rule articulated in <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), required cessation of interrogation after an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Under <em>Edwards, </em>law enforcement officers must immediately cease questioning a suspect who has clearly asserted his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation. <em>See id. </em>Following <em>Edwards, </em>many courts addressed what it means to \u201cclearly assert\u201d the right to have counsel present. The United States Supreme Court revisited this issue in <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 455, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994), where the defendant had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, waived his right to remain silent, and after one and one-half hours of interrogation stated, \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer.\u201d In finding that Davis\u2019 statement was equivocal, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">The applicability of the rigid prophylactic rule of <em>Edwards </em>requires courts to determine whether the accused actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>invoked his right to counsel. To avoid difficulties of proof and to provide guidance to officers conducting interrogations, this is an objective inquiry. Invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney. But if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The prohibition of further questioning after clear assertion of the right to counsel during custodial interrogation is not required by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on coerced confessions, rather, it is a prophylactic rule created by the courts. In declining to expand the rule, the Court in <em>Davis </em>further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">But when the officers conducting the questioning reasonably do not know whether or not the suspect wants a lawyer, a rule requiring the immediate cessation of questioning would transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity, because it would needlessly prevent the police from questioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if the suspect did not wish to have a lawyer present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 460, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Declining to adopt a rule requiring questions clarifying a suspect\u2019s ambiguous statements, the <em>Davis </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">But we are unwilling to create a third layer of prophylaxis to prevent police questioning when the suspect might want a lawyer. Unless the suspect actually requests an attorney, questioning may continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.Ct. 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">From the direction given by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis, </em>two things are abundantly clear: 1) the test to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>determine if the statement of the defendant \u201cclearly asserts\u201d his right to counsel is an objective test viewed through the eyes of a reasonable police officer in light of the totality of the circumstances; and, 2) the officer has no duty to ask questions to resolve ambiguity before questioning may continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The burden is initially upon the Commonwealth to prove a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. As we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASL\">The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. It must show that the accused knowingly and intelligently waived the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. Additionally, the Commonwealth must prove the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession by a preponderance of the evidence. Whether a confession is voluntary requires an independent examination of the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the statement is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker, or whether the maker\u2019s will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired. In making this independent determination, however, an appellate court is bound by the trial court\u2019s subsidiary factual findings unless those findings are plainly wrong. Conflicts in evidence present factual questions that are to be resolved by the trial court, and whether an accused requested counsel is also a factual determination that will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Mills v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 459, 468, 418 S.E.2d 718, 722-23 (1992) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Although an express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is strong evidence of waiver, it is not necessary. \u201c[W]aiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">McDaniel was read a statement of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at his home. The detective testified that McDaniel understood them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>and continued to engage in conversation as he gave the detective permission to search his home. Upon discovery of a \u201cgas-powered Sears pressure washer,\u201d McDaniel was transported to Investigative Services for further interrogation. Only after McDaniel reached the police station, and while the investigating officer and McDaniel were \u201cdiscussing the case\u201d did McDaniel make the equivocal statement \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Even McDaniel focuses his argument upon whether he made an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel after previously waiving his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>In his brief, McDaniel states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">Here, Mr. McDaniel was advised of his rights, seemed to understand them, then transported to an investigating area, where he asked for an attorney prior to <em>any more questioning.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>clearly stated that after a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">[the suspect] must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney. If the statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, <em>Edwards </em>does not require that the officers stop questioning the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\"><em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350. The trial court found that McDaniel\u2019s statement did not meet this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Counsel for McDaniel conceded at oral argument that the statement \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me\u201d could have several meanings depending upon context and other circumstances such as voice inflection and body language. The majority is unwilling to embrace the honest concession of counsel and simply declares the words themselves to be unambiguous. The majority focuses upon the trial court\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he word \u2018rather\u2019 in the middle of the sentence indicates some degree of choice.\u201d The majority ignores the trial judge\u2019s consideration of the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>of the declaration and circumstances surrounding it and concludes \u201c[t]he statement, as ordinarily understood, is unambiguous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The majority\u2019s sole focus upon the word \u201crather\u201d both fails to apply the objective analysis required under <em>Davis </em>and ignores its context within the sentence. McDaniel did not state \u201cI would rather have an attorney here to speak for me.\u201d McDaniel stated <em>\u201cI think </em>I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial court\u2019s finding was based upon the statement as a whole, not merely upon its interpretation of the word \u201crather.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">A correct analysis of the statement requires that we consider the statement in its entirety. The word \u201cthink\u201d is defined as \u201cto believe, to consider, to conclude, to esteem; to recollect or call to mind.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Legal Dictionary </em>1479 (6th ed. 1990). The existence of numerous and diverse definitions, including, \u201cto consider\u201d underscores the ambiguity of the term \u201cthink.\u201d When the sentence is considered in its entirety, \u201cI think\u201d imports inherent ambiguity to the term \u201crather\u201d and to the sentence as a whole. Again, McDaniel\u2019s counsel agreed, but the majority has chosen to ignore his concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">As the United States Supreme Court has made abundantly clear, the trial court must ask if a reasonable police officer would have considered the utterance in context and under circumstances sufficient to constitute a clear assertion of the right to counsel. In this case the trial court considered the testimony of witnesses concerning the circumstances surrounding the statement made by McDaniel. Although rejecting the conclusion drawn by the officer that the defendant was asking a question, it is clear that the trial court agreed with the officer that the statement made by McDaniel was equivocal and ambiguous such that it invited a response from the detective. The detective referred to \u201cemotion,\u201d \u201cdemeanor,\u201d and \u201cbody language,\u201d and the trial court was entitled to rely upon this testimony in its interpretation of McDaniel\u2019s statement. Just as the law has historically trusted spontaneous utterances to be trustworthy, the trial court was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>consider the spontaneous reaction of the detective as evidence of the equivocal nature of McDaniel\u2019s statement. Unless the trial court\u2019s finding is clearly wrong or without evidence to support it, basic appellate principles require that we uphold its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Our Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia have engaged in the same analysis in an effort to apply legal principles of higher courts while demonstrating deference to the factual findings of the trial court. In <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 462 S.E.2d 112 (1995), the Supreme Court of Virginia applied the objective test set out in <em>Dams. </em>The Court held that the suspect\u2019s statement \u201cI\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer\u201d was not a clear and unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel and that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress his statements that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Recently, in <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 646, 500 S.E.2d 835 (1998), we considered whether a suspect\u2019s statement that \u201che didn\u2019t know anything about this incident and he wasn\u2019t going to say anything else unless he had an attorney\u201d was a clear and unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel. Green argued that his statement constituted a clear and unequivocal request for counsel and that any statement made by him that followed should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We rejected Green\u2019s argument, relying on various cases which the majority opinion in this case attempts to distinguish from the case now before us. We reiterated the objective test in <em>Davis, </em>stating, \u201c[t]he Virginia Supreme Court has declared that a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to remain silent or to counsel is necessary before authorities are required to discontinue an interrogation.\u201d <em>Green, </em>27 Va.App. at 653, 500 S.E.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">It is important to note that both the Arizona and Ohio Supreme Courts have considered nearly the identical issue before us. <em>See State v. Eastlack, </em>180 Ariz. 243, 883 P.2d 999 (1994); <em>State v. Henness, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 53, 679 N.E.2d 686 (1997). In <em>Eastlack, </em>during custodial interrogation the defendant stated, \u201cI think I better talk to a lawyer first.\u201d Finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that the statement was not an unequivocal request for counsel, the court stated, \u201c[t]he statement itself was ambiguous, using the equivocal language T think\u2019 rather than, the language of a clear request.\u201d <em>Eastlack, </em>883 P.2d at 1007. In <em>Henness, </em>the court observed, \u201cwe find that appellant\u2019s statement T think I need a lawyer ...\u2019 is just as ambiguous as the statement made by the defendant in <em>Davis.\u201d Henness, </em>679 N.E.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Courts in other states have reached similar results. In <em>State v. Parker, </em>886 S.W.2d 908 (Mo.1994), the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the defendant\u2019s statement that \u201cneither Parker\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver form, <em>nor his statement that, he \u2018ought\u2019 to talk to a lawyer </em>\u201d constituted an unambiguous invocation of his right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 918 (emphasis added). In <em>State v. Travis, </em>26 Ariz.App. 24, 545 P.2d 986 (1976), the Court of Appeals of Arizona held that it did not consider the defendant\u2019s statements that \u201che might want an attorney\u201d to be \u201csufficient to have required cessation of further questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 991. Similarly, in <em>People v. Kendricks, </em>121 Ill.App.3d 442, 77 Ill.Dec. 41, 459 N.E.2d 1137 (1984), the Appellate Court of Illinois held that the defendant\u2019s statement to the police that \u201cYou know, I kind of think I know [sic] a lawyer, don\u2019t I?\u201d or \u201cI think I might need a lawyer\u201d were not clear assertions of the right to counsel. The <em>Kendricks </em>court relied heavily upon the reasoning in <em>People v. Krueger, </em>82 Ill.2d 305, 45 Ill.Dec. 186, 412 N.E.2d 537 (1980). In <em>Krueger, </em>the Illinois appellate court held that the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cMaybe I ought to have an attorney,\u201d \u201cMaybe I need a lawyer,\u201d or \u201cMaybe I ought to talk to an attorney\u201d was not a clear, unambiguous invocation of the right to counsel, and the officers were not required to cease questioning. <em>Id. </em>at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Additionally, in the context of jury selection we have found juror responses such as, \u201cI think,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and \u201cI would try\u201d to be statements of equivocation. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 199, 510 S.E.2d 751 (1999). The majority\u2019s assertion that the phrase \u201cI think\u201d is unambiguous as a matter of law in the context of a request for counsel is impossible to reconcile.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Given the passage of time from the initial reading of <em>Miranda </em>rights, the search of his home in his presence and by consent, and the continued dialogue with the detective about the case, the trial judge did not err in concluding that McDaniel waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and analyzing the case under <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Davis. </em>Further, I believe, as the Supreme Courts of Arizona and Ohio have concluded, the language utilized by McDaniel is ambiguous on its face. Additionally, the factual circumstances and context of the statement also provide ample evidence of its ambiguity. Applying the legal principles articulated by courts above and proper deference to factual findings and reasonable inferences drawn by the trial court, I would hold that McDaniel\u2019s statement was not a clear assertion of his right to counsel. I would uphold the convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">. McDaniel was arrested and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights at 4:45 p.m. He gave a written statement at 6:23 p.m. after a thirty-minute interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
