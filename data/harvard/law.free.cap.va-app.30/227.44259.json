Bahen, Jr., for driving thirty-five miles per hour in a zone with a posted speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour. The summons cited Code \u00a7 46.2-874 and Henrico Code \u00a7 22-2. On appeal from a conviction for speeding, Bahen contends the trial judge erred in ruling that the street on which he was driving was in a \u201cresidence district.\u201d We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The facts concerning the event that gave rise to the issuance of the summons are undisputed. Bahen was driving south on Charles Street where the speed limit was posted as twenty-five miles per hour. When he was between Park Avenue and West Franklin Street, a radar device operated by a Henrico County police officer registered the speed of Bahen\u2019s vehicle at thirty-five miles per hour. At trial, Bahen conceded he was driving in excess of the posted speed limit. Instead, relying on <em>Brooks v. Painter, </em>225 Va. 400, 302 S.E.2d 66 (1983), and <em>Thoms v. Dowdy, </em>201 Va. 581, 112 S.E.2d 868 (1960), Bahen argued that the portion of Charles Street on which he was driving in excess of the twenty-five miles per hour posted speed limit was not a \u201cresidence district,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-100, and, therefore, that the speed limit was improperly posted as twenty-five miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>After the police officer testified concerning the events that caused him to issue the summons, Bahen sought to prove through cross-examination of the officer and testimony of various County traffic engineers that the character of the land contiguous to Charles Street did not meet the definition of \u201cresidence district.\u201d At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge ruled that the contiguous land \u201cmeets the definition of the residence area, and is so properly speed limited at [twenty-five] miles per hour.\u201d The trial judge also found that Bahen had conceded the accuracy of the radar and ruled that Bahen was driving at thirty-five miles per hour in violation of the posted limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Generally, \u201c[t]he maximum speed limit on ... highways shall be fifty-five miles per hour if the vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-870. That general rule is subject to many statutory exceptions. <em>See e.g. </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-870 through 46.2-883. For example, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the other [statutory] provisions [governing speed], the Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner or other authority having jurisdiction over highways may decrease the speed limits set forth in [Code] \u00a7 46.2-870 and may increase or decrease the speed limits set forth in [Code] \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-873 through 46.2-875 on any highway under its jurisdiction.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-878. Any speed limit that is increased or decreased pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-878 \u201cshall be effective only when prescribed after a traffic engineering investigation,\u201d which is filed as prescribed in the statute, \u201cand when indicated on the highway by signs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute further provides that \u201c[w]henever the speed limit on any highway has been increased or decreased ... and such speed limit is properly posted, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the change in speed was properly established.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In addition, the legislature has empowered \u201c[t]he governing bodies of counties, cities, and towns [to] adopt ordinances not in conflict with the [Motor Vehicle Code] to regulate the operation of vehicles on the highways in such counties, cities, and towns ... and may erect appropriate signs ... on the highway showing the general regulations applicable to the operation of vehicles on such highways.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1300(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Nelson v. County of Henrico, </em>10 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>558, 393 S.E.2d 644 (1990) (decided under Code \u00a7 46.1-180, the precursor to Code \u00a7 46.2-1300). This statute specifically authorizes the governing body or, when properly delegated, the chief administrative officer to \u201c[i]ncrease or decrease the speed limit within its boundaries, provided such increase or decrease in speed shall be based upon an engineering and traffic investigation ... and provided such speed area ... is clearly indicated by ... signs.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1300(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">At trial and on this appeal, Bahen argued that the evidence proved he was driving on a highway that was not in a \u201cresidence district\u201d as specified in Code \u00a7 46.2-874 and defined in Code \u00a7 46.2-100. The record establishes that a substantial portion of the proof at trial concerned that issue and the application of the <em>Brooks </em>and <em>Thoms </em>decisions to the facts of this case. Indeed, at one point during the taking of the evidence the trial judge indicated that \u201c[we are] down to the very narrow issue of whether it\u2019s a residence district or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>We conclude, however, that we need not determine whether the County\u2019s interpretation of \u201cresidence district,\u201d which was accepted by the trial judge, comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Brooks </em>concerning the proper way to view \u201cland improved for dwelling purposes\u201d as that term is used in the Code \u00a7 46.2-100 definition of \u201cresidence district.\u201d <em>See Brooks, </em>225 Va. at 404, 302 S.E.2d at 68-69.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth prosecuted Bahen for violating the posted speed limit. Bahen raised as his defense the theory that the Commonwealth could not prevail absent proof that he was in a \u201cresidence district.\u201d Although much of the evidence concerned the character of Charles Street and the definition of \u201cresidence district,\u201d the following colloquy occurred during the presentation of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">MR. BAHEN: I\u2019m trying to establish that I was driving at a safe speed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">THE COURT: Well, but again, you were not charged with driving unsafe. You\u2019re just charged with driving above the speed limit. So I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant, unless you can tell me some reason that it would be, I\u2019d be glad to hear it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">I mean, you\u2019re not charged with reckless driving, and you\u2019re not charged \u2014 you\u2019re just charged with a prohibited crime of driving above the posted speed limit, and that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">MR. BAHEN: Your Honor, I would offer that I\u2019m not charged with driving above the posted speed limit, I\u2019m charged with speeding in a residential district, Section 874 of the Code of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">THE COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">MR. BAE\u00cdEN: Forty-six\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>THE COURT: Speed 35 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone is what the summons says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">MR. BAHEN: The law section of the summons says 874, and 874 has \u2014 there\u2019s nothing, nothing in 874 about the posted speed limit, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">THE COURT: The code section is merely advisory. The crime you\u2019re charged with is what is stated in the charge and that\u2019s speeding 35 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone. They could put no code section or the wrong code section and that is not controlling. What is controlling is the stated word that gives you notice of what your charge is. So that\u2019s what I take it you\u2019re being charged with. All right? So is there any reason that it\u2019s relevant as to whether you were driving safely or unsafely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">MR. BAHEN: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">THE COURT: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">MR. BAHEN: But I would like to further discuss the\u2014 according to Your Honor that Commonwealth had every opportunity to amend the warrant if they thought they had a code section that I had violated....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The undisputed evidence at trial proved that the speed limit for the portion of the highway on which Bahen was driving was posted by a sign to be twenty-five miles per hour. Bahen concedes that he was exceeding the posted speed limit. The Motor Vehicle laws explicitly state that \u201c[a]ll drivers of vehicles shall obey lawfully erected signs.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-830. Furthermore, \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful to operate any motor vehicle in excess of speed limits established and posted as provided [by the Commissioner or other authority having jurisdiction over highways].\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-878. In applying these proscriptions in cases where \u201cthe speed limit on any highway has been increased or decreased ... and such speed limit is properly posted, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the change in speed was properly established in accordance with the provisions of this section.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-878.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The testimony of the traffic engineer for the County established that the records of the traffic engineering division <em>\u201cgo </em>back to 1976 and ... do not show that there has been a change of speed limit since 1976.\u201d He further testified that if the posted speed limit was not the original speed limit, he had no records to show a change. No evidence in the record proved whether the speed limit sign was initially posted by the County or the Commissioner. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence in the record failed to rebut the presumption that the speed limit was properly established. Thus, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s ruling that Bahen was driving in excess of the posted speed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">.
