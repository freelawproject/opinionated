Four years later, on April 10, 1998, Mitchell was convicted. On appeal, Mitchell contends the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress an incriminating statement allegedly obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Mitchell also contends he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">\n<em>A. Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">In 1989, Burley Cobb\u2019s farm tractor was stolen from his residence in Prince Edward County, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>In 1998, Charlotte County Deputy Sheriff Howard Hobgood arrested Timothy Mitchell\u2019s girlfriend after finding stolen property in her home during a search for Mitchell, a suspect in a Charlotte County burglary. Sometime later, Mitchell turned himself in to authorities in Charlotte County, and Deputy Hobgood interviewed him in jail regarding the Charlotte County burglary. Before doing so, Hobgood read Mitchell his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Mitchell indicated he understood his rights, agreed to answer questions, but refused to sign a waiver form. Mitchell stopped speaking every time Hobgood started to take notes, but he never requested a lawyer and never stated that he would not talk to Hobgood.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The following morning, Investigator Donald Lacks interviewed Mitchell. Lacks again read Mitchell his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Mitchell responded, \u201cI ain\u2019t got shit to say to /all,\u201d but then he proceeded to talk about being in jail before and about the charges against his girlfriend. Mitchell never requested a lawyer and conversed generally with the investigator, but again refused to sign a waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">A few minutes later, Charlotte County Sheriff Thomas Jones arrived at the jail. Lacks told Jones he had attempted to get a statement from Mitchell but Mitchell had said he did not wish to speak to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Jones then confirmed with Mitchell that Lacks had read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to him and that Mitchell understood his rights. Jones told Mitchell that he wanted to give him an opportunity to tell his side of the story. Mitchell responded, \u201cthere is nothing I can tell /all that you don\u2019t already know ... you-all got me; you know what I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Mitchell talked about a prior conviction and prior incarceration and talked in general about his history of stealing from various people. Later, he complained to the sheriff about the charges brought against his girlfriend and asked the sheriff to drop them. Jones replied that he could not drop the charges but that if she were found innocent through their investigation, the charges would be dropped. Jones told Mitchell that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>his girlfriend\u2019s guilt or innocence would have to be resolved by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Later, Mitchell asked Jones \u201cif he could do anything to help himself.\u201d Jones told him if he had information about property stolen in Charlotte County, \u201cit would be taken into consideration.\u201d Mitchell subsequently admitted stealing Burley Cobb\u2019s tractor. He never stated that he wanted a lawyer and never stated that he did not want to talk to Jones. Mitchell did most of the talking while Jones listened. Jones testified that although Mitchell was angry, he was very calm and willing to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Before trial, Mitchell moved to suppress his confession that he stole the tractor, contending the officers had obtained the confession in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The trial court denied the motion, and Mitchell appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>B. Speedy Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Following Mitchell\u2019s indictment on April 19, 1994, he was admitted to bail and released on bond. The trial court entered an order on April 19, 1994, continuing the case until June 22, 1994, on Mitchell\u2019s motion and stating that Mitchell \u201cwaives his Speedy Trial rights and joins in this Motion for Continuance freely and voluntarily.\u201d This order did not set a trial date, and the court had not previously set a trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">On June 22, 1994, the trial court continued the case \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d On November 7, 1994, the court entered its next order continuing the case and for the first time set a trial date of March 21, 1995. The November 7 order, which Mitchell and his attorney both endorsed, \u201cwaives his Speedy Trial rights and [states that he] joins in this Motion for Continuance freely and voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">On March 21, 1995, when the judge inquired if the parties were ready to proceed, Mitchell\u2019s attorney requested a continuance due to a miscommunication between the defendant and the attorney. Noting that the case had been continued several times in the past and had been pending for almost two years, Mitchell\u2019s attorney stated, \u201c[w]e certainly would waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>our right to a speedy trial.\u201d The trial court entered the March 21 order \u201c[u]pon motion of the defendant\u201d stating that the case was \u201ccontinued generally\u201d until April 18, 1995 and that Mitchell \u201cwaives his/her Speedy Trial rights and joins in this Motion for Continuance freely and voluntarily.\u201d Mitchell endorsed the order, \u201cI ASK FOR THIS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Thereafter, the trial court, by agreement of counsel, set the case for trial on August 8, 1995. However, on August 8, Mitchell failed to appear for trial, and the court issued a capias for his arrest. During the time Mitchell was a fugitive, the case was continued. Over a year later, on November 27, 1996, police arrested Mitchell on the capias.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On January 23,1997, the court set trial for May 9,1997. On May 9, 1997, despite assurances that he would obtain private counsel and be ready for trial, Mitchell appeared before the court without counsel. On May 9, the court appointed counsel and Mitchell endorsed an order as \u201cI ASK FOR THIS,\u201d continuing the case on his motion until June 18, 1997. The order states that Mitchell \u201cfully understands that a motion by the defendant or attorney for the defendant ... constitutes a waiver of his speedy trial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">After the June 18, 1997 trial date, another series of court appearances, continuances, hearings, and waivers occurred. Ultimately, Mitchell was tried on April 10,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>On the morning of trial, Mitchell filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that his trial had not commenced within nine months of his indictment as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-248. The motion alleged that between indictment on April 19, 1994, and Brickhill\u2019s appointment as counsel on May 9, 1997, 396 days of delay attributable to the Commonwealth had elapsed. Mitchell makes no claim in this appeal that the delay after May 9, 1997, until his trial on April 10, 1998, violated his statutory speedy trial right. The court denied the motion, and Mitchell appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ayt\">\n<em>A. Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Mitchell contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements allegedly obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Mitchell contends that when he told Officer Lacks, \u201cI ain\u2019t got shit to say to /all,\u201d he invoked his right to silence and all further questioning should have ceased. On appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 527, 532, 507 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">An express written waiver is not required for an accused to waive <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 35, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 (1990) (finding that defendant\u2019s decision to speak after being apprised of <em>Miranda </em>warnings was sufficient to constitute waiver). Officer Hob-good read Mitchell the <em>Miranda </em>warnings on June 13, 1993. Mitchell indicated that he understood his rights and agreed to answer questions. The next morning, Officer Lacks again read Mitchell the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Mitchell\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver form does not constitute an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Where police read <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a defendant and the defendant knowingly and intelligently waives his or her constitutional rights, we presume that the waiver remains in effect \u201cuntil the suspect manifests, in some way which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>would be apparent to a reasonable person, his [or her] desire to revoke it.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 548-49, 323 S.E.2d 577, 586 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Only when an accused expresses a clear and unambiguous assertion of his (or her) right to remain silent must investigators cease further questioning. <em>See e.g., United States v. Banks, </em>78 F.3d 1190, 1197 (7th Cir.1996) (finding that, \u201cI don\u2019t got nothing to say\u201d did not constitute an invocation of the right to remain silent); <em>Burket v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 609-10, 450 S.E.2d 124, 131-32 (1994) (finding that, \u201cI don\u2019t think I should say anything\u201d did not constitute an invocation of right to remain silent); <em>Akers v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 40, 45-46, 216 S.E.2d 28, 31-32 (1975) (finding that, \u201cDo I have to talk about it now?\u201d did not constitute an invocation of the right to remain silent); <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 646, 652-54, 500 S.E.2d 835, 838-39 (1998) (finding that, \u201c[I don\u2019t] have anything more to say\u201d did not constitute an invocation of the right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">After Lacks <em>re-Mirandized </em>Mitchell, Mitchell stated, \u201cI ain\u2019t got shit to say to y\u2019all.\u201d Then Mitchell proceeded to volunteer information to Lacks. Under these circumstances, we find that Mitchell\u2019s phrase, \u201cI ain\u2019t got shit to say to y\u2019all,\u201d did not constitute a clear and unambiguous invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Mitchell\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory statement. Additionally, we reject Mitchell\u2019s assertion that investigators applied undue pressure regarding charges brought against Mitchell\u2019s girlfriend. Mitchell, not the investigators, initiated discussion of the charges against his girlfriend. Although Mitchell\u2019s concern for his girlfriend may have prompted his confession, nothing in the record suggests that investigators used those charges as leverage to obtain involuntarily his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\n<em>B. Speedy Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">When a defendant charged with a felony offense is not continuously held in custody, he or she is forever discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>from prosecution if trial is not commenced for that offense within nine months from the date he or she is indicted. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-243; <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 347, 349-50, 464 S.E.2d 516, 517 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In Mitchell\u2019s motion to dismiss, and on brief, he conf\u00ednes his argument to the period between indictment on April 19, 1994, and May 9, 1997, the date counsel was appointed for him. Mitchell argued at trial, and argues on appeal, that during that three-year period, the Commonwealth unjustifiably exceeded the nine-month statutory limitation for commencing trial. Because Mitchell limits his claim to that time period, our review is confined to that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Between April 19, 1994 and May 9, 1997, the trial court entered four orders, the last three of which Mitchell personally endorsed as having been asked for on his motion and which contained explicit waivers of his statutory speedy trial rights. Additionally, on one occasion, Mitchell\u2019s attorney, in Mitchell\u2019s presence, orally represented to the court that he waived any speedy trial claim. In this appeal, we decide the impact that those waivers have on Mitchell\u2019s statutory speedy trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">A defendant may agree to a general waiver of his or her statutory speedy trial rights, in which instance the accused foregoes his or her rights granted by Code \u00a7 19.2-243. Additionally, an accused may make a limited waiver of that right, in which instance the accused foregoes the statutory protection for a specified period of time. <em>See Shavin v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 256, 266, 437 S.E.2d 411, 418 (1993). Where a defendant moves for, or concurs in the continuance of a trial date, such action tolls the running of the speedy trial bar and that time is specifically excepted under the statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-243(4). However, a continuance moved for or concurred in by the defendant, while not included in the time frame within which the Commonwealth must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>commence trial, does not waive or bar a defendant\u2019s right to assert a speedy trial claim. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-243. While a defendant may request or concur in a continuance and simultaneously waive his statutory speedy trial rights, the two are separate and distinct. A continuance has the effect of excluding the time for the delay from the period attributable to the Commonwealth. A waiver, however, foregoes the accused\u2019s right to assert the speedy trial statute as a bar to prosecution notwithstanding the effect of the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 267, 437 S.E.2d at 419. A general waiver bars the defendant from raising a statutory speedy trial claim regarding any delay accrued before the waiver is revoked, if at all. A limited waiver, by its terms, will limit or specify the period to which it applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Although the three orders<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entered prior to the May 9,1997 order arguably are general waivers that would remain in force until revoked, for purposes of this opinion we need only consider the scope of the waiver of the May 9, 1997 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We hold that the waiver language of the May 9, 1997 order operated as a general waiver that barred Mitchell from making any statutory speedy trial claim with regard to delays preceding the entry of that order and thereafter until revocation of the waiver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That order, signed by defendant and defendant\u2019s counsel, states that the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance also constitutes a waiver of his statutory speedy trial rights. Without that language, defendant\u2019s motion would have merely been for a continuance and would have only tolled the clock prospectively. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-243. With the language, however, the defendant waived his right to make a statutory speedy trial claim for the delays preceding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>waiver and until such time as the waiver ceased to be effective. Accordingly, because Mitchell waived his right on May 9, 1997 to claim a statutory speedy trial defense, the trial court did not err in denying Mitchell\u2019s motion to dismiss in which he alleged the Commonwealth exceeded the statutory speedy trial period between April 19,1994 and May 9,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress nor in its denial of the motion to dismiss for an alleged violation of speedy trial rights, we affirm Mitchell\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">VIRGINIA: IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA</p>\n<p id=\"ANU\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"AtF\">CASES NO(S): CR94-80, CR94-81,</p>\n<p id=\"Aes\">CR94-278, CR94-279, CR94-280</p>\n<p id=\"ANA\">TIMOTHY A.
