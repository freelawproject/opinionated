The Commissioner denied Sentara a Certificate of Public Need (COPN) to initiate a liver transplant service at its hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. Sentara contends the Commissioner committed reversible error when he denied Sentara\u2019s application, despite the fact that the application satisfied all the existing criteria for issuing a COPN. Sentara also argues that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was based upon evidence not contained in the record and upon a material mistake of fact. We agree and reverse the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">On July 31, 1996, Sentara filed an application for a COPN seeking authorization to perform liver transplants. Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>a public hearing, the Eastern Virginia Health Systems Agency Board voted to recommend approval of the COPN. On February 28, 1997, however, the Department of Health\u2019s Division of Certificate of Public Need (DCOPN) recommended that the application be denied. The matter was then referred to an adjudication officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Following an informal hearing, the adjudication officer issued a report recommending that the COPN be approved. The adjudication officer concluded that Sentara\u2019s plan satisfied all the applicable statutory factors, including all applicable factors listed in the State Medical Facilities Plan (SMFP).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With regard to the SMFP\u2019s minimum requirement that a facility perform twelve transplants per year, he found that Sentara would perform six transplants in the first year of its program, twelve in the second year, and fifteen in the third year. The adjudication officer further found that \u201cit may be anticipated\u201d that Sentara eventually would be able to substantially exceed the regulatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The evidence before the adjudication officer proved that in 1996, facilities able to perform liver transplants nationwide averaged thirty-six such procedures for the year. Medical College of Virginia Hospital (MCVH) performed sixty-six liver transplants in 1996, the University of Virginia Hospital (UVAH) performed thirty-seven, and Fairfax Hospital performed fifty-three. From 1992 through 1995, MCVH performed, respectively, thirty-one, thirty-seven, thirty-three, and thirty-nine liver transplants.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In 1994, eighteen residents of Sentara\u2019s primary service area received liver transplants. This figure rose to twenty-one in 1995, and twenty-eight in 1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The adjudication officer noted that forty to fifty percent of liver transplant patients at MCVH, and ten to twenty percent of liver trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>plant patients at UVAH originated from Sentara\u2019s potential service area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, he found that \u201cthe development of a liver transplant service at [Sentara] should only marginally alter the volume of liver transplants at MCVH, which is located in Health Planning Region (HPR) IV,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> where a fully accredited fellowship training program for liver transplant surgeons exists.\u201d The adjudication officer explained that \u201cthe number of liver transplant patients from eastern Virginia appears to be increasing and, coupled with the projected slow start-up of the [Sentara] liver transplant service, no significant impact on liver transplant volume at the MCVH transplant center should occur in the first three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The Commissioner rejected the adjudication officer\u2019s recommendation and denied the COPN. Citing the average numbers of transplants performed in Virginia and nationwide in 1996, the Commissioner found that the SMFP minimum transplant requirement was too low and out of date. The Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">I find that the provisions of the State Medical Facilities Plan as they relate to liver transplantation services are inaccurate, outdated, inadequate or otherwise inapplicable. Because they fail to reflect current standards, they should not be applied here, and I will direct that procedures be initiated to make appropriate amendments to such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVa\">The Commissioner further found that \u201c[indications in the healthcare system are that the numbers of available organs may be reaching a plateau.\u201d This fact would limit the number of procedures that could be performed each year, regardless of whether the demand for liver transplants continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>grow. The Commissioner expressed concern that adding a liver transplant program at Sentara could adversely affect other Virginia facilities, especially MCVH and UVAH. He cited the adjudication officer\u2019s finding that forty to fifty percent of MCVH\u2019s liver transplant volume, and ten to twenty percent of UVAH\u2019s volume came from Sentara\u2019s potential service area. The Commissioner also expressed concern that spreading patients over four programs would significantly reduce the average number of liver transplants performed at each facility and that this overall per-facility decrease in volume could adversely affect the quality of care each facility provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Commissioner continued that, even if Sentara\u2019s transplant numbers remained around fifteen per year, the SMFP</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApT\">contemplates that \u201csuccessful transplantation programs are expected to perform substantially larger numbers of transplants annually. Performance of minimum transplantation volumes does not necessarily indicate a need for additional transplantation capacity or programs.\u201d Thus, even the unamended State Medical Facilities Plan governing liver transplantation services is not binding as to minimum acceptable volumes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The Commissioner suggested that, by performing twelve to fifteen transplants per year, Sentara might not be able to develop and maintain \u201cessential technical expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Finally, the Commissioner found that granting the COPN to Sentara could, by lowering the number of transplants performed at MCVH, adversely impact MCVH\u2019s liver transplant fellowship program. In what he now concedes was a mistake of fact, the Commissioner noted that the American College of Surgeons requires training facilities to perform forty-five transplants per year. The standard had been recently amended, however, by requiring transplant fellows to perform forty-five liver transplants during the course of their two-year fellowships.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Sentara appealed the Commissioner\u2019s ruling to the trial court, which affirmed the Commissioner. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>found that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in rejecting the COPN, even though Sentara met all the minimum SMFP requirements. The court held that the Commissioner\u2019s reliance on extra-record evidence and \u201cinstitutional knowledge\u201d regarding organ donation rates did not result in substantial prejudice to Sentara. Similarly, the trial court also ruled that the Commissioner\u2019s mistake of fact regarding fellowship requirements constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201cUnder Code \u00a7 32.1-24, the provisions of the Virginia Administrative Process Act ... govern the procedures for rendering case decisions and issuing orders and regulations by the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 241, 369 S.E.2d 1, 6 (1988). \u201c[T]he party complaining of an agency action has the burden of demonstrating an error of law subject to review.\u201d <em>Hilliards v. Jackson, </em>28 Va.App. 475, 479, 506 S.E.2d 547, 549 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">Errors of law fall into two categories: first, whether the agency decisionmaker acted within the scope of his authority, and second, whether the decision itself was supported by the evidence. Where the agency has the statutory authorization to make the kind of decision it did and it did so within the statutory limits of its discretion and with the intent of the statute in mind, it has not committed an error of law in the first category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\"><em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 242, 369 S.E.2d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The level of deference accorded to an agency decision depends upon the nature of the legal question involved. \u201c[W]here the question involves an interpretation which is within the specialized competence of the agency and the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly, the agency\u2019s decision is entitled to special weight in the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 369 S.E.2d at 8. Such deference is not in order, however, where the issue is one in which the courts have a special competence. <em>See id. </em>at 243-44, 369 S.E.2d at 7-8. \u201cThus, where the legal issues require a determination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the reviewing court whether an agency has, for example, accorded constitutional rights, failed to comply with statutory authority, or failed to observe required procedures, less deference is required.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3 provides that no hospital can commence any project without first obtaining a COPN from the Commissioner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Any decision to issue or approve the issuance of a certificate shall be consistent with the most recent applicable provisions of the State Medical Facilities Plan; however, if the Commissioner finds, upon presentation of appropriate evidence, that the provisions of such plan are inaccurate, outdated, inadequate or otherwise inapplicable, the Commissioner, consistent with such finding, <em>may issue or approve the issuance of a certificate </em>and shall initiate procedures to make appropriate amendments to such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Sentara contends that while Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(A) allows the Commissioner to <em>grant </em>a COPN if there is a need therefor and the Commissioner finds that the SMFP is outdated, the Commissioner cannot <em>deny </em>a COPN based on a finding that the existing SMFP is outdated. The Commissioner asserts that the statutory language \u201cmay issue or approve the issuance\u201d of a COPN means that he may grant or <em>deny </em>a certificate on the ground that the SMFP is inaccurate or outdated. We agree with Sentara.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u201c[A]dministrative agencies, in the exercise of their powers, may validly act only within the authority conferred upon them by statutes vesting power in them.\u201d <em>Sydnor Pump &amp; Well Co. v. Taylor, </em>201 Va. 311, 316, 110 S.E.2d 525, 529 (1959). And appellate courts \u201c \u2018must construe the law as it is written. An erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to overrule the clear mandates of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richmond v. County of Henrico, 185 </em>Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>176, 189, 37 S.E.2d 873, 879 (1946) (citation omitted), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>185 Va. 859, 41 S.E.2d 35 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must look first to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993). \u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). \u201c[W]e must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Because this is an issue of statutory construction, we owe less deference to the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation. We interpret Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(A) as providing that the Commissioner may, but is not required to, issue a COPN where a public need has been demonstrated for a project, but where the petition does not satisfy an outdated or inaccurate SMFP. We reject the Commissioner\u2019s assertion, however, that the General Assembly intended to grant the Commissioner the authority to <em>deny </em>a COPN on the ground that the SMFP is outdated or inaccurate. The plain language of the statute provides that the Commissioner \u201cmay <em>issue </em>or <em>approve </em>\u201d a petition that does not comply with an outdated or inaccurate SMFP. (Emphasis added.) It does not provide that he may deny or disapprove a petition on this basis. Accordingly, to the extent the Commissioner denied this application on the ground that the SMFP standards were outdated, inaccurate, inadequate or otherwise inapplicable, he exceeded his statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Sentara further contends the circuit court erred in holding that the Commissioner\u2019s reliance on extra-record evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>liver donation rates did not result in substantial prejudice to Sentara and that the court erred when it found that the Commissioner\u2019s mistake of fact regarding fellowship requirements was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The adjudication officer did not make a finding regarding organ donation rates, although the record contains evidence concerning those rates. In a September 17, 1996 letter to the executive director of the Eastern Virginia Health Systems Agency, MCVH\u2019s Dr. Marc Posner wrote that in the three years through 1995, the number of liver transplants performed in Virginia had reached a plateau, \u201cindicating the driving force is now only the numbers of available donor organs.\u201d At the May 20, 1997 hearing conducted by the adjudication officer,' Dr. John Colonna testified that \u201c[w]e have all seen, <em>at least in D.C., </em>a great slowing on our organ donation since the recent 60 minute thing on non heartbeat donors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There was also evidence that MCVH has to \u201cimport\u201d livers from out of state and that liver transplants generally have always been limited by the supply of donated organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Also contained in the record is a chart titled \u201cMCV Liver Transplant Program \u2014 Liver Donations in Virginia.\u201d The chart reflects that liver donations in Virginia increased every year from 1991 through 1994, but declined in 1995. Despite this decline, however, the number of liver transplants performed in Virginia in 1995 was fourteen percent higher than the number performed in 1994. And the 156 liver transplants performed in Virginia in 1996 was twenty-one percent higher than the 1994 figure. Statistics in the record reflect that the number of liver transplants in Virginia grew from twenty-two in 1988 to 156 in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We addressed the issue of extra-record evidence in <em>Johnston-Willis: </em>\u201cMembers of an administrative body cannot decide issues on personal knowledge, but must rely upon the evidence produced before them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 369 S.E.2d at 16. Accordingly, as a preliminary matter, we must determine whether evidence in the record proved that organ donation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>rates had reached a plateau, or whether the Commissioner relied on extra-record evidence in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u201cThe standard of review of an agency\u2019s factual findings on appeal to a circuit court is limited to determining whether <em>substantial evidence </em>in the agency record supports its decision.\u201d <em>Avante at Lynchburg, Inc. v. Teefey, </em>28 Va.App. 156, 160, 502 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1998) (emphasis added). Under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, an agency\u2019s factual findings should be rejected \u201c \u2018only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tidewater Psychiatric Inst. v. Buttery, </em>8 Va.App. 380, 386, 382 S.E.2d 288, 291 (1989) (quoting <em>Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983)). \u201cThe phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <em>might </em>accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. at 269, 308 S.E.2d at 125 (citation omitted). Additionally, \u201cthe court must review the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the [Commissioner\u2019s] action and \u2018take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the [Commissioner], and the pin-poses of the basic law under which the [Commissioner] has acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bio-Medical Applications of Arlington, Inc. v. Kenley, </em>4 Va.App. 414, 427, 358 S.E.2d 722, 729 (1987) (quoting Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Having reviewed the record, including those specific portions cited by the Commissioner, we find as a matter of law that the evidence contained in the record is insufficient to support the Commissioner\u2019s finding that organ donation rates have reached a plateau.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At best, the evidence in the record on trends in organ donation rates is inconclusive. We cannot conclude, for example, that a one year decline in organ donation rates reflects a trend. This faulty logic is demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>by the evidence on liver transplant rates. The number of liver transplants performed in Virginia declined in 1992 and 1994, but increased in 1993 and in 1995 and 1996. We conclude, therefore, that the Commissioner relied on extra-record evidence in making his factual finding on organ donation rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The Commissioner asserts that information on organ donation rates constituted part of his \u201cinstitutional knowledge,\u201d upon which he could rely in making such a determination. While we do not reach the issue of whether the Commissioner can ever rely on institutional knowledge in making a decision on a COPN application, we hold that statistical evidence such as trends in organ donation rates does not constitute institutional knowledge. Similarly, the Commissioner has failed to establish that this empirical evidence could be classified as a \u201cpublic statistic.\u201d <em>Cf. Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 259, 369 S.E.2d at 16 (finding that data regarding birth and fertility rates received from the Virginia Center for Health Statistics constituted \u201cpublic statistics\u201d upon which the Commissioner could rely even though the statistics were not part of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Having concluded that the Commissioner improperly relied upon extra-record evidence, we must determine whether this reliance constituted reversible error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">[T]he rules of evidence are relaxed in an administrative proceeding and the findings will not be reversed solely because the Commissioner considered evidence not in the record. \u201c[T]he mere fact that the [agency] has looked beyond the record does not invalidate its action unless substantial prejudice is shown to result.\u201d \u201cNo reversible error will be found ... unless there is a clear showing of prejudice arising from the admission of such evidence, or unless it is plain that the agency\u2019s conclusions were determined by the improper evidence, and that a contrary result would have been reached in its absence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\"><em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 258, 369 S.E.2d at 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>If the record contains sufficient evidence to sustain the Commissioner\u2019s ruling, then Sentara\u2019s claim that it was prejudiced by the Commissioner\u2019s consideration of extra-record evidence regarding organ donation rates must fail. In reviewing the record, we owe \u201cdeference to [the agency\u2019s] findings of fact, [and] where substantial evidence in the record exists to support the agency\u2019s conclusions, we may not substitute our own judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Smith v. Dept. of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy, </em>28 Va.App. 677, 687, 508 S.E.2d 342, 347 (1998). Nevertheless, \u201cthe reviewing courts should not abdicate their judicial function and merely rubber-stamp an agency determination.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 7-8. We will overturn the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Tidewater Psychiatric Inst., 8 </em>Va.App. at 386, 382 S.E.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The evidence proved, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that Sentara\u2019s petition satisfied all the pertinent statutory factors and the minimum requirements in the SMFP. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(B). The Commissioner expressed two concerns: 1) the negative effect Sentara\u2019s program might have on the liver transplant programs at MCVH and UVAH, and 2) whether Sentara would be performing a sufficient number of transplants each year to maintain the requisite level of surgical expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s concern that Sentara\u2019s program would adversely affect. MCVH was speculative at best. By its third year, Sentara would be performing only fifteen transplants per year. Even if we assumed that all these patients would have been treated by MCVH, the number of transplants performed at MCVH would be fifty-one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This number is still significantly higher than the national average and is substantially more than MCVH performed in the years before 1996. Moreover, there is no evidence that this reduction would adversely affect MCVH\u2019s fellowship program.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The Commissioner found that an additional facility performing liver transplants would place the Commonwealth\u2019s programs below the national average of thirty-six transplants per center per year. This conclusion is erroneous. If liver transplants in Virginia remained static at the 1996 level of 156 per year, adding a fourth facility would drop Virginia\u2019s per-facility average to thirty-nine, three <em>above </em>the national average. Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Sentara\u2019s program would have an adverse affect on the quality of other transplant programs in Virginia is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">There is likewise no evidence that Sentara would not be performing enough transplants each year to maintain a satisfactory level of technical expertise. Sentara projected that by the third year of its program, it would be performing fifteen transplants per year, which is twenty-five percent above the SMFP minimum. Other than the SMFP\u2019s minimum requirements, there is no evidence in the record on the minimum number of transplants a facility must perform each year to maintain its expertise in the field. The Commissioner\u2019s finding that Sentara would not be performing a sufficient number of transplants to maintain technical expertise is also not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">When Sentara\u2019s petition is viewed in conjunction with the current SMFP and the other evidence in the record, it is apparent that the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying the COPN was arbitrary and capricious. Since the evidence contained in the record was insufficient to support the Commissioner\u2019s denial of the petition, we must find that Sentara was substantially prejudiced by the Commissioner\u2019s consideration of extra-record evidence regarding organ donation rates. Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s reliance on this evidence constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Likewise, we cannot say the Commissioner\u2019s mistake of fact regarding fellowship requirements was harmless error. In the absence of substantial credible evidence supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny the COPN, we must assume that Sentara was also prejudiced by this mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>For the reasons stated above, we hold that the Commissioner exceeded his statutory authority when he denied Sentara\u2019s petition for a COPN on the ground that the SMFP was out of date. Based on our review of the record, we hold that the Commissioner\u2019s denial of the petition was arbitrary and capricious. And, in the absence of substantial evidence otherwise supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision, his reliance on extra-record evidence and his mistake of fact regarding fellowship program certification requirements constituted reversible error. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for remand to the Commissioner, who is instructed to issue the COPN to Sentara and to conduct any further proceedings consistent with this decision. Sentara\u2019s request for costs and fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">.
