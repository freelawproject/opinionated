Specifically, we determine whether an employee\u2019s statutory dependents are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>entitled to claim the employee\u2019s scheduled permanent partial loss benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B) for loss of an arm and a leg, when the deceased employee was still under an award for temporary total incapacity and had claimed neither permanent total nor permanent partial incapacity before his death. We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission did not err by awarding the scheduled benefits to the employee\u2019s statutory beneficiaries. Therefore, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Kendell Flood suffered a compensable injury in a work-related automobile accident rendering him a quadriplegic. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission granted him temporary total incapacity benefits. Although eligible for permanent total incapacity benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C) for the loss of both arms and both legs, Flood never claimed those benefits and was under the temporary total incapacity award at the time of his death. When Flood died from unrelated causes, his statutory dependents filed a claim under Code \u00a7 65.2-511 for permanent partial loss benefits based on Flood\u2019s 100% loss of use of his four extremities. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B). The commission determined that prior to his death, Flood was eligible under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B) for permanent partial loss benefits and therefore, the remaining 148.71 weeks of benefits to which Flood would have been entitled survived his death under Code \u00a7 65.2-511. Accordingly, the commission awarded the statutory dependents 148.71 weeks of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Thomas Refuse Service (employer) asserts that due to the severity of his injury, Flood was never entitled to permanent partial loss benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B), which was the basis for the commission\u2019s award. Employer contends that because Flood met the criteria for permanent and total incapacity under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C), he did not qualify for scheduled benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B). Employer contends Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C) would require compensation to be awarded to Flood pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-500; thus, under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-500(D), his benefits would have been limited to his lifetime and his dependents have no claim to assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The commission\u2019s conclusions of law are not binding on this Court. <em>See Robinson v. Salvation Army, </em>20 Va.App. 570, 572, 459 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1995). However, the commission\u2019s construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is entitled to great weight on appeal. <em>See Wiggins v. Fairfax Park Ltd., </em>22 Va.App. 432, 441, 470 S.E.2d 591, 596 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 65.2-511 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1r\">When an employee received or <em>is entitled </em>to compensation under this title for an injury covered by \u00a7 65.2-503 and dies from a cause other than the injury for which he was entitled to compensation, payment of the unpaid balance of compensation shall be made to his statutory dependents under this chapter, in lieu of the compensation the employee would have been entitled to had he lived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-511 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-511 includes claims under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 for \u201cscheduled\u201d benefits to which a claimant \u201cis entitled\u201d prior to death even though benefits had not been actually awarded under Code \u00a7 65.2-503. <em>See, e.g., Jarvis v. Gale, </em>20 O.I.C. 310, 312 (1938) (holding that dependents could claim employee\u2019s scheduled benefits for partial disability even though employee had made no efforts to claim them before he died). Accordingly, if Code \u00a7 65.2-503 entitled Flood to \u201cscheduled\u201d benefits prior to his death, his dependents are entitled to those benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The employer claims that Flood would have been entitled to permanent total disability benefits which would have ceased at death, not \u201cscheduled\u201d benefits for loss of use of specific members. Code \u00a7 65.2-503 addresses, among other matters, compensation for \u201cscheduled\u201d benefits for permanent partial and permanent total loss or loss of use of members. Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B) lists the scheduled benefits due for loss or loss of use of each member. However, Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C) also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>sets forth the criteria under which a claimant qualifies for permanent total incapacity. Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C), in subsections one through three, states that \u201cCompensation shall be awarded pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-500 for permanent and total incapacity when there is\u201d loss of any two qualifying members in the same accident, total paralysis, or injury to the brain that renders the employee unemployable. Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C)(1) to (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The commission held, and we agree, that Code \u00a7 65.2-511 permits Flood\u2019s dependents to collect the scheduled benefits to which Flood was entitled before his death. Although Flood, as a quadriplegic, could have qualified for permanent and total incapacity benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C), he also could have qualified for and would have been \u201centitled\u201d to scheduled benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B). Because Flood would have been \u201centitled\u201d to an award of scheduled benefits at the time of his death, his statutory dependents were entitled under Code \u00a7 65.2-511 to the balance of benefits to which Flood would have been entitled under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
