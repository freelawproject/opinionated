For the following reasons, we vacate the five-year sentence reflecting the enhanced punishment and remand with instructions to enter an order imposing a three-year sentence on appellant\u2019s firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">On April 21, 1997, appellant was indicted for the robbery of Andrea A. Thomas and the use of a firearm in the commission of robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A jury trial was set for August 6, 1997. Appellant filed a pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to prevent the Commonwealth from using an earlier firearm conviction as the predicate for imposing an enhanced penalty. In the earlier case, the jury returned a guilty verdict and although sentencing was set prior to the August 6 trial date in the instant case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Judge Stevens continued the sentencing hearing in that case at the request of appellant\u2019s trial counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Appellant argued that because no final sentencing order had been entered on the earlier firearm conviction, the jury should have been instructed only as to the first offender sentence of three years. At that time, the trial court indicated it would resolve the dispute after the presentation of evidence. The Commonwealth then moved for a continuance, arguing that appellant should not be allowed to \u201cmanipulate the court system\u201d by requesting <em>ex parte </em>a continuance of the first firearm sentencing hearing in order to avoid the enhanced punishment in the instant case. Noting that trial counsel\u2019s actions \u201cput the Commonwealth in a bind,\u201d the trial judge initially granted the motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In an extended colloquy between the trial judge and appellant\u2019s counsel, counsel objected both to the continuance and the proposed jury instruction on the enhanced five-year punishment for the firearm charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant ultimately \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ceded the point\u201d and \u201cagreed\u201d to the five-year jury instruction rather than have the matter continued. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court reviewed the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed Instruction G, which contained the mandatory five-year sentence on the firearm charge. When the trial judge asked counsel if he had any objection to the proposed instruction, counsel stated, \u201cThat\u2019s acceptable.\u201d The jury subsequently convicted appellant of the firearm offense and recommended the \u201cfive years mandatory fixed\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-18\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Judge Alden continued the case to November 21, 1997, for the imposition of sentence. Prior to that time, Judge Stevens set aside the jury verdict on the firearm conviction in the first, unrelated case. Accordingly, appellant filed a motion to set aside the verdict in the instant case, alleging that the jury instruction was improper because it contained the enhanced punishment of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">On October 31, 1997, after the trial in the instant case but before the scheduled sentencing hearing, appellant was convicted of two additional firearm offenses resulting from another unrelated crime. In that case, the trial judge sentenced him to three years on the first offense and five years on the second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">At the sentencing hearing in the present case, Judge Alden denied appellant\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict and imposed the mandatory five-year sentence. The trial judge found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">All right, well, I\u2019ve considered the pre-sentence report in this case, the sentencing guidelines, the jury recommendation, counsel\u2019s arguments. Mr. Batts, I\u2019ve considered your letter and the other facts and circumstances regarding the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">And I conclude that the instruction, when given, was correct. Now, after the correct instruction was given, circumstances changed, which might have allowed me at a sentencing proceeding to exercise my discretion or may have required me to \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 to impose a lesser sentence than that the jury had imposed at the time it was instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">However, as it\u2019s turned out in this case, I guess, it has gone full circle because even though the facts changed after the jury was properly instructed, by the time you get to the sentencing day, the facts have gone all the way around again and have come back to the beginning. So, I conclude, based on all of that, that the jury was properly instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and that today the sentence of the jury is the proper sentence to impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Accordingly, the trial judge imposed the five-year sentence on the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">II. JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">[I] Appellant contends that at the time the jury was instructed to impose the mandatory five-year sentence for a second firearm offense, there was no predicate conviction because a final order had not been entered on the earlier firearm offense. Because the jury was instructed to impose a sentence greater than that authorized by statute, the instruction was erroneous even though it was approved by appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u201c[An appellate] court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises. It is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the essentials of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[W]hen a principle of law is vital to a defendant in a criminal case, a trial court has an affirmative duty properly to instruct a jury about the matter.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 250, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">At the time of trial in the instant case, appellant had not been sentenced on the earlier firearm offense pending before Judge Stevens. Trial counsel admitted in the colloquy with Judge Alden that \u201c[he] called Judge Stevens\u201d to get a continuance in that case. Alleging that appellant sought that continuance for tactical reasons, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney in the present case moved for a continuance, pending the outcome of the first case. While Judge Alden was \u201cconsidering granting the motion for a continuance,\u201d trial counsel said he would \u201cconcede the point\u201d and agreed to the instruction. Subsequently, when the trial judge asked counsel if he had any objection to the firearm instruction, Instruction G, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>said, \u201cThat\u2019s acceptable.\u201d It is in this fast and loose climate that appellant contends the jury was improperly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">A party may not invite error and subsequently raise that error as grounds for appeal. \u201c[A] defendant, having agreed upon the action taken by the trial court, should not be allowed to assume an inconsistent position. No litigant, even a defendant in a criminal case, will be permitted to approbate and reprobate \u2014 to invite error ... and then to take advantage of the situation created by his own wrong.\u201d <em>Manns v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 677, 679-80, 414 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1992) (citations omitted). Trial counsel agreed to the proposed jury instruction and, thus, became a party to the error he now complains of on appeal. However, his agreement cannot confer the power to impose a sentence greater than that established by the legislature. The penalty exceeded that authorized by statute and, therefore, we hold that the jury was improperly instructed. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 makes it unlawful for any person to use or display a firearm while committing one of the enumerated felonies. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit murder, rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate or animate object sexual penetration as defined in \u00a7 18.2-67.2, robbery, carjacking, burglary, malicious wounding as defined in \u00a7 18.2-51, malicious bodily injury to a law-enforcement officer as defined in \u00a7 18.2-51.1, aggravated malicious wounding as defined in \u00a7 18.2-51.2, malicious wounding by mob as defined in \u00a7 18.2-41 or abduction. Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction, and for a term of five years for a <em>second or subsequent conviction </em>under the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUl\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (emphasis added). The statute is recidivist in nature because it is \u201caimed at <em>punishment </em>of specific behavior, not reform.\u201d <em>Stubblefield v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 343, 347, 392 S.E.2d 197, 198 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Based on the evidence before the trial court, Instruction G provided an incorrect statement of law because it instructed the jury on the enhanced punishment provision for a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d in the absence of proof of a first conviction. A final sentencing order was a necessary predicate to this action, and Judge Stevens had not entered one on the earlier firearm offense. The jury\u2019s verdict in that case was not a final conviction without the entry of the sentencing order and, therefore, could not be used to establish the predicate first offense. <em>See Ramdass v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 518, 520, 450 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1085, 115 S.Ct. 1800, 131 L.Ed.2d 727 (1995). In <em>Ramdass, </em>our Supreme Court considered whether the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for armed robbery made him ineligible for parole. The Court concluded: <em>\u201cJudgment had not been entered on that verdict; </em>therefore, it cannot be considered as a conviction under [the applicable Code provision].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 497, 500 n. 3, 471 S.E.2d 780, 781 n. 3 (1996) (citing Ramdass) (\u201cA guilty verdict is not a conviction until a final order of judgment has been entered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">There being no evidence to support the enhanced punishment provided in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the jury did not have the statutory authority to impose a five-year sentence for a first time offender, <em>even with the acquiescence of appellant\u2019s </em>attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the sentence imposed is in excess of that prescribed by law, that part of the sentence which is excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>is invalid.\u201d <em>Deagle v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 304, 305, 199 S.E.2d 509, 510 (1973) (citing <em>Crutchfield v. Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 291, 46 S.E.2d 340 (1948)). \u201cA sentence in excess of one prescribed by law is not void [a]b initio because of the excess, but is good insofar as the power of the court extends, and is invalid only as to the excess.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 199 S.E.2d at 510-11 (citing <em>Royster v. Smith, </em>195 Va. 228, 77 S.E.2d 855 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201cIf an illegal sentence has been pronounced, the court has [the] power to substitute a legal sentence, ... the imposition of the void sentence does not terminate the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 327, 340, 28 S.E.2d 687, 692 (1944) (citations omitted). \u201cA void sentence does not invalidate a prior adjudication of guilt properly had; but, on the contrary, such adjudication furnishes a basis for the imposition of a valid sentence when the invalidity of the sentence imposed is called to the attention of the court.\u201d <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 466, 470, 100 S.E.2d 681, 684 (1957). In the instant case, at the time the jury returned a guilty verdict and recommended the five-year punishment, it did not have the statutory authority to sentence appellant to any term greater than three years. Accordingly, any sentence in excess of the statutory mandate of three years is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">III. HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The Commonwealth argues that any error in Instruction G was harmless because appellant received two subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>quent <em>final </em>firearm convictions on October 31, 1997, before the trial judge imposed the instant five-year sentence. Relying on <em>Miller, </em>22 Va.App. 497, 471 S.E.2d 780, the Commonwealth contends that those subsequent convictions can be used as the predicate for an enhanced punishment in the instant case. The Commonwealth concludes that any error in the jury instruction was harmless because the trial judge ultimately possessed the authority under <em>Miller </em>to impose the five-year sentence based upon the \u201csubsequent\u201d convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Our determination of whether the error is harmless is guided by familiar principles. Non-constitutional error \u201cis harmless \u2018[w]hen it <em>plainly appears </em>from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678) (emphasis added in <em>Lavinder). </em>To determine whether an error is harmless, we \u201cmust review the record and the evidence and evaluate the effect the error may have had on how the finder of fact resolved the contested issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007, 407 S.E.2d at 912. \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Applying the standard articulated in <em>Lavinder, </em>we cannot conclude that the erroneous jury instruction and the trial court\u2019s imposition of the five-year sentence was harmless. Although we concluded in <em>Miller </em>that the trial court properly imposed the enhanced punishment in that case, Miller, unlike appellant, was tried in a bench trial. In <em>Miller, </em>we held that the trial judge properly imposed the five-year sentence where an unrelated firearm conviction was entered after the judge\u2019s finding of guilt but four days before he imposed the sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeO\">Because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is concerned with punishing repeat firearm offenders, the statute punishes for a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d <em>without regard, to the dates of the convictions or the sequence in which the offenses were </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>committed. </em>\u201cAny conviction that follows a first conviction is a subsequent conviction within the purview of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Miller, </em>22 Va.App. at 501-02, 471 S.E.2d at 782 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, we concluded \u201cthat the relevant inquiry under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is whether, <em>at the time of sentencing, </em>a conviction entered is a \u2018second or subsequent\u2019 conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 471 S.E.2d at 782 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The decision in <em>Miller, </em>which involved a bench trial, is not inconsistent with our decision in the present case. A jury may use only those convictions that are final at the time it returns its verdict and determines the appropriate sentence. There was no predicate offense in this case when the jury recommended the enhanced punishment because judgment had not been entered on the earlier firearm conviction pending before Judge Stevens and the October 1997 convictions had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">We recognize that Virginia law has historically maintained a clear distinction between the roles played by judge and jury in criminal sentencing. <em>See Duncan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 342, 345, 343 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1986). \u201cUnder the statutory scheme, the jury determines the guilt or innocence of the accused. If the jury finds that he is guilty, it then \u2018ascertains\u2019 or \u2018fixes\u2019 the maximum punishment in accordance with contemporary community values and <em>within the limits established by law.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cAfter conviction, ... the court may suspend imposition of sentence or suspend the sentence in whole or part....\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201c[T]he punishment as fixed by the jury is not final or absolute, since its finding on the proper punishment is subject to suspension by the trial judge, in whole or in part, on the basis of any mitigating facts that the convicted defendant can marshal. <em>The verdict of the jury is the fixing of maximum punishment which may be served. </em>Under such practice, the convicted criminal defendant is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u2018two decisions\u2019 on the sentence, one by the jury and the other by the trial judge in the exercise of his statutory right to suspend; his \u2018ultimate sentence ... does not [therefore] rest with the jury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alone but is always subject to the control of the trial judge. This procedure makes the jury\u2019s finding little more than an advisory opinion or first-step decision. Any criticism of jury sentencing because it lacks the objectivity and principled decision of a judge is thus overcome by the existence of the power in the trial judge to bring his so-called superior judgment to bear upon the issue of proper punishment in reaching his decision whether to suspend the sentence or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Duncan, </em>2 Va.App. at 345, 343 S.E.2d at 394 (quoting <em>Vines v. Muncy, </em>553 F.2d 342, 349 (4th Cir.1977)) (emphasis added). Clearly, the trial judge may reduce a sentence but may not exceed the \u201cmaximum punishment\u201d fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In the instant case, notwithstanding trial counsel\u2019s acquiescence and agreement to the erroneous jury instruction, we cannot conclude that the error was harmless. Appellant was subjected to a maximum mandatory sentence that was not authorized at the time the jury determined his \u201cmaximum punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While a trial judge may have the authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 to reduce a jury\u2019s recommended sentence,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he or she does not have the authority to impose a sentence greater than the one recommended by the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court is required to properly instruct the jury as to a correct statement of the applicable punishment range as of the time of trial. Because the jury was instructed to impose a sentence greater than that authorized, that portion in excess of the statutory maximum of three years is vacated and the case is remanded to the trial court to enter an order consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>with this opinion and in accordance with the first offender provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-13\">.

Our decision to vacate appellant\u2019s five-year sentence is based solely upon the lack of authority of a jury to sentence a defendant to a period greater than that statutorily mandated. Appellant\u2019s argument that he was \"forced\u201d either to accept the improperly enhanced punishment or suffer a continuance is without merit. It is well settled that the decision whether to grant a continuance is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Lebedun v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 697, 712, 501 S.E.2d 427, 434 (1998); <em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 785, 788, 485 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1997). Indeed, we have previously held that a trial court may properly grant a continuance where the moving party has been the victim of surprise. <em>See Lyles v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 187, 191, 462 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1995) (affirming decision to grant a continuance where the moving party was surprised by defendant\u2019s trial tactics); <em>see also Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 460-61, 374 S.E.2d 303, 311 (1988) (\"Ambush, trickery, stealth, gamesmanship, one-upmanship, surprise have no legitimate role to play in a properly conducted trial.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028, 109 S.Ct. 1765, 104 L.Ed.2d 200 (1989). Although the trial judge in the instant case could have granted the continuance for good cause, including that the Commonwealth was \"put in a bind\u201d by counsel\u2019s \"surprise\u201d trial tactics, she did not do so because counsel agreed to proceed with trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">. The trial judge cannot reduce a statutorily mandated sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2, which provides that the trial court has the option of imposing an additional six months to three years of suspended sentence, is inapplicable to the instant case. <em>See Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 67-68, 480 S.E.2d 139, 143-44 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b61-15\">. Appellant also contends that proof of a prior conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 constitutes an element of that offense, which the Commonwealth must prove in order to impose the enhanced punishment. He argues that Instruction G was improper because it did not instruct the jury that it was required to find that appellant had previously been convicted of a firearm offense before recommending the enhanced five-year punishment. We do not address the merits of appellant\u2019s argument because he did not raise this issue before the trial court and is precluded from raising it on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
