On appeal, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that the trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay evidence was reversible error. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">On the afternoon of February 19,1997 Elliott loaned his car to his girlfriend, Misty Dawn Dellinger, the victim. She was to have returned the car to Elliott by 6:30 that evening after running errands; however, she did not return until almost 7:30 p.m. after spending the afternoon with her lesbian lover, Sarah Jackson. Elliott was aware of the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Dellinger and Jackson and had expressed animosity towards Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Scott Minnock visited Elliott\u2019s residence at approximately 5:45 p.m. on the day of the murder. When Dellinger had not returned on time, Elliott repeatedly told Minnock that Del-linger was late. Minnock observed Elliott putting a shoulder holster on and off during this time. He also saw Elliott manipulating a pistol inside the holster and repeatedly drawing the weapon. When Dellinger arrived at the residence late, Minnock heard her tell Elliott that she had been with Jackson that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Dellinger initially sat in the living room with Minnock but went into one of the back bedrooms alone with Elliott. She and Elliott returned to the living room. Dellinger sat in a chair and Elliott stood over her. Minnock remained seated watching television. Minnock stated that he \u201cheard the gun go off,\u201d looked up and saw Elliott holding a gun \u201cpointed over towards [Dellinger\u2019s] direction\u201d a few feet from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Dellinger had fallen \u201conto the back of the couch.\u201d The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner testified that she died as a result of a .44 caliber bullet which had entered her body through the chin in a \u201csharply downward\u201d direction, proceeded into the chest, penetrated the thoracic aorta, and then penetrated and lodged in the liver. The path of the bullet was \u201cdownward at a sharp angle, and backward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Elliott maintained that the shooting was an accident and offered the following explanation to Giles County Sheriffs Investigator E.M. Blevins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">I loaded the damn pistol like an idiot and I got in there and I tried the holster. I kept trying to put the holster on. I don\u2019t know how to wear it. I kept getting it on wrong, the snap was underneath and everything and trying to unsnap it and, you know, I was playing with it and pulling it out. Well, I finally, I don\u2019t know if I ever got it on right or not, but I tried it three or four different ways and I jerked the pistol out and when I did, when I jerked it forward, I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>know if the shoulder, the, the holster jerked it, I don\u2019t know what happened, but the damn gun went off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Elliott claims he \u201cdidn\u2019t pull the trigger back\u201d and stated that the last word uttered by the victim before she was shot was \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Richard Roberts, a firearms expert for the Division of Forensic Science, stated that he examined the murder weapon. It is a single-action revolver and in order to fire such a weapon, \u201cyou have to cock [the hammer] back and then pull the trigger.\u201d Roberts explained that a safety feature of the weapon included a transfer bar that is engaged only when the trigger is pulled. If the trigger is not pulled, the transfer bar will not engage and the gun will not fire, even if the hammer is pulled back and released. Roberts said the gun was \u201cin mechanical operating conditions with the safety features functioning properly.\u201d The trigger pull required \u201capproximately four and one-half pounds\u201d of pressure which was within \u201cnormal factory recommendations\u201d and considered \u201csafe.\u201d Because \u201cthere was a question about the accidental shooting,\u201d Roberts performed tests \u201ctrying to see if [he] could get it to accidentally fire and ... be sure the transfer bar was working properly.\u201d Roberts conceded that it was possible that the weapon could be cocked by catching it on the holster or clothing, but further testified that he examined the holster in question and found that the pistol went \u201cin and out of the holster with no problem.\u201d Roberts testified, without objection, that he \u201ccould not get it to go off accidentally.\u201d He said that even if a person cocked the hammer back, the weapon would not fire \u201cunless the trigger is pulled or pushed to the back real well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Michael Waldron testified that a few months before the fatal shooting, Dellinger visited his house but declined to stay overnight and told Waldron that Elliott had threatened to kill her if she tried to leave him. Additionally, Sarah Jackson testified that she was with Dellinger on the day she was fatally shot and that she told Dellinger not to be late because Elliott would be \u201cmad at her\u201d and that Dellinger said \u201cshe wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>get a job and to get a car and she wanted to leave [Elliott] and she wanted me and her to move away together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Where the sufficiency of the evidence is an issue on appeal, an appellate court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 42, 393 S.E.2d 599, 608 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">To establish the crime of second-degree murder, \u201cthe defendant must be shown to have wilfully [sic] or purposefully, rather than negligently, embarked upon a course of wrongful conduct likely to cause death or great bodily harm.\u201d <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 280-81, 322 S.E.2d 216, 220 (1984). Whether a shooting is intentional or accidental is \u201ca matter peculiarly within the province of a jury to determine.\u201d <em>Compton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 716, 731, 250 S.E.2d 749, 758 (1979). Every unlawful homicide is presumed to be murder in the second degree. <em>See Painter v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 360, 364, 171 S.E.2d 166, 169 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Malice is the element that distinguishes murder from manslaughter. <em>See Essex, </em>228 Va. at 280, 322 S.E.2d at 219-20. The trier of fact may infer malice from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon unless the evidence raises a reasonable doubt whether malice existed. <em>See Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 575, 578, 439 S.E.2d 867, 870 (1994). Killing with malice but without premeditation and deliberation is murder in the second degree. <em>See Perricllia v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 85, 91, 326 S.E.2d 679, 683 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The fact finder believed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, including its theory of the case, and rejected Elliott\u2019s evidence that the shooting was accidental. \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>598, 601 (1986). The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was competent, was not inherently incredible, and was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Elliott was guilty of second degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">III. HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Elliott maintains that the trial judge erred by admitting hearsay statements of Michael Waldron and Sarah Jackson into evidence. Hearsay is \u201cprimarily testimony which consists [of] a narration by one person of matters told him by another.\u201d <em>Williams v. Morris, </em>200 Va. 413, 417, 105 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1958). However, \u201c[i]f the declaration is offered solely to show that it was uttered, without regard to the truth or falsity of its content, the declaration is not excluded by the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Speller v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 437, 446, 345 S.E.2d 542, 548 (1986) (citations omitted). Of course, hearsay evidence is admissible nonetheless if it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the rule of exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">One of the exceptions to the rule of exclusion of hearsay evidence is the \u201cstate-of-mind\u201d exception. In order to be admissible, the evidence must be relevant, must refer to a presently existing state of mind, and must have no obvious indication of fabrication or contrivance. Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-16 (4th ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">With regard to relevance of the declarations of a homicide victim we have said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">[t]he state of mind of a homicide victim is relevant and material only in cases where the defense contends that the death was the result of suicide, accident, or self-defense. In those instances, the state of mind must have been communicated to the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">For the state of mind of the victim to be relevant to prove the state of mind of the accused, some nexus must exist which inferentially implicates the accused, such as by show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ing previous threats made by the defendant towards the victim, narrations of past incidents of violence on the part of the defendant or general verbalizations of fear of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 173, 188-89, 416 S.E.2d 14, 23 (1992) (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Elliott did not contend that Dellinger\u2019s death involved self-defense or suicide; rather, he claimed her death was an accident. The Commonwealth contended that it was murder. Elliott testified that his relationship with Dellinger was \u201cfabulous.\u201d Elliott\u2019s state of mind was a critical issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The testimony of Michael Waldron that Dellinger told him that Elliott had threatened to kill her if she tried to leave him is admissible under the state of mind exception to the rule of exclusion. In this instance the state of mind of the victim is relevant to prove the state of mind of the accused and the nature of their relationship. It is devoid of any obvious indication of fabrication or contrivance and the nexus to the defendant is obvious \u2014 it relates a conversation between the defendant and victim which demonstrated the nature of their relationship and provided a motive for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The testimony of Sarah Jackson that she told Dellinger that \u201cshe should go home because she had to be home at six thirty ... and she didn\u2019t need to be late, [Elliott] would get mad at her,\u201d followed by Dellinger\u2019s response \u201cthat she wanted to get a job and to get a car and she wanted to leave [Elliott] and she wanted me and her to move away together,\u201d is also admissible under the state of mind exception to the rule of exclusion. Jackson\u2019s recitation of what she said to Elliott is not offered for the truth of the matter stated; rather, it is offered to prove that her statement was made as a catalyst for Dellinger\u2019s response. The relevance of Dellinger\u2019s response depends upon nexus to the defendant. Dellinger\u2019s response establishes her state of mind, namely, her intention to leave Elliott. The testimony of Michael Waldron proves Elliott\u2019s state of mind in response to Dellinger\u2019s intention to leave him. The testimony of Sarah Jackson is corroborative in nature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The nexus to the defendant is his prior threat to Dellinger relating to the subject of any intent she may have to leave him. Also, the evidence rebuts Elliott\u2019s characterization of the relationship as \u201cfabulous\u201d and provides a motive for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Finding no error, we affirm Elliott\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
