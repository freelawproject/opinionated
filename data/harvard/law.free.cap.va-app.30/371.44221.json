Byrd (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals his conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and his sentence to five years in the penitentiary. He contends the trial court erred in admitting unredacted orders of conviction during the sentencing phase of the jury trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Police officers stopped appellant for driving with defective equipment and searched his car incident to the stop. Based on the results of the search, appellant was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">After the jury found appellant guilty as charged and during the sentencing phase of the trial, the Commonwealth moved to introduce two orders of conviction. The orders contained references to charges that had been <em>nolle prossed. </em>Appellant\u2019s motion to redact reference to the <em>nolle prossed </em>charges was denied. The denial of this motion is the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Relying on our decisions in <em>Folson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 521, 478 S.E.2d 316 (1996), and <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 465 S.E.2d 592 (1996), the Commonwealth contends that the term \u201crecord of conviction\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 includes both convictions and <em>nolle prossed </em>charges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 establishes the procedure for bifurcating felony trials by jury. \u201c \u2018The purpose of the bifurcated trial is to allow the trier of fact to consider the prior ... record of the accused for sentencing purposes while avoiding the risk of prejudice to the accused when determining guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 523, 465 S.E.2d at 594 (quoting <em>Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 175, 179, 390 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>S.E.2d 775, 776-77, <em>aff'd upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>12 Va.App. 337, 404 S.E.2d 371 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The evidence the Commonwealth may present during the sentencing phase is specified by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">At such proceeding, the Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal <em>convictions </em>by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction____ The Commonwealth shall provide to the defendant fourteen days prior to trial notice of its intention to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal <em>convictions. </em>Such notice shall include (i) the date of each prior <em>conviction, </em>(ii) the name and jurisdiction of the court where each prior <em>conviction </em>was had, and (in) each offense of which he was <em>convicted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The language of the statute is clear and its intent plain. Therefore, we need not reach beyond the common meaning of its terms to invest it with meaning. As adopted by the legislature, the statute limits the introduction of evidence by the Commonwealth to charges for which a defendant has been convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no basis upon which to enlarge the legislature\u2019s manifest intent in adopting this statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Furthermore, under well-settled rules governing the admission of evidence, we find that evidence of charges which have been <em>nolle prossed </em>is not relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of sentence. \u201c \u2018Evidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Utz v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 411, 419, 505 S.E.2d 380, 384 (1998) (quoting <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The purpose of the \u201cseparate [sentencing] proceeding\u201d required by Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is \u201climited to the ascertainment of punishment.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. We have further noted that the purposes underlying the punishment of criminal conduct include deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and retribution. <em>See Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 594. We can discern no relationship between the purposes of sentencing and the jury\u2019s role in determining appropriate punishment in non-capital cases that would make evidence of <em>nolle prossed </em>charges relevant to the jury\u2019s task. <em>Cf. Bassett v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 844, 858, 284 S.E.2d 844, 853 (1981) (approving the admission, during the sentencing phase of capital murder prosecutions, of evidence concerning the sentences imposed for prior <em>convictions </em>because \u201c[t]he sentence reflects the gravity of the offense and the offender\u2019s propensity for violence.\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938, 102 S.Ct. 1996, 72 L.Ed.2d 458 (1982); <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>524, 465 S.E.2d at 594 (\u201cManifestly, the prior criminal <em>convictions </em>of a felon, including previous efforts to punish and rehabilitate, bear upon a tendency to commit offenses, the probabilities of rehabilitation, and similar factors indispensable to the determination of an appropriate sentence.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Even were the evidence deemed relevant, it must be excluded if its probative value is \u201coutweighed by other, negative factors.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 11-8 (4th ed.1993). Factors that weigh against the admission of relevant evidence include: (1) the confusing nature of the evidence and the likelihood that it will mislead the jury, <em>see Farley v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 495, 498, 458 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1995), and (2) the danger of distracting the jury from the major issues in the case. <em>See Maynard v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 437, 442, 399 S.E.2d 635, 638 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc). Here, evidence of the <em>nolle prossed </em>charges could be misunderstood by the jury and misapplied. No explanation of the meaning of the term was given to the jury, nor could one have been given without introducing collateral issues into the case, as numerous reasons may underlie a prosecutor\u2019s decision to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of a charge. In addition, because the court allowed consideration of the charges, the evidence could also be erroneously treated by the jury as proof that the accused was involved in the perpetration of other crimes. We therefore conclude the probative value of the challenged evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial impact and, on this ground, the court abused its discretion in admitting it. <em>See Coe v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 83, 87, 340 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1986); <em>Farley, </em>20 Va.App. at 498, 458 S.E.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Our decisions in <em>Folson </em>and <em>Gilliam </em>do not support the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the challenged evidence was properly admitted. In <em>Folson, </em>we held that an indictment, showing the nature of the crime charged, and documents entitled \u201cDOCKET ENTRIES\u201d and \u201ccommitment record,\u201d showing the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>prior offenses, were admissible as a \u201crecord of conviction\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. <em>See </em>23 Va.App. at 523-25, 478 S.E.2d at 317-18. In <em>Gilliam, </em>we held that the term \u201crecord of conviction\u201d includes \u201cboth conviction and punishment....\u201d 21 Va.App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 595. In each case, the issue before us was limited to the evidence that is required to establish the fact of conviction, both its incidence and its nature, including the gravity of the offense. <em>See Folson, </em>23 Va.App. at 525, 478 S.E.2d at 318 (approving of the admission of documents as \u201crecords of conviction\u201d because they demonstrated \u201cthat the court convicted appellant for the crimes charged\u201d); <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 523-24, 465 S.E.2d at 594-95 (approving of the admission of evidence concerning the sentences that attended previous convictions). Neither holding addressed the propriety of admitting evidence of <em>nolle prossed </em>charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Under accepted principles, however, we find that the improper admission of the evidence at issue was harmless because it plainly appears from the record that the error did not affect appellant\u2019s sentence. In the absence of a curative instruction from the trial court, a nonconstitutional error is presumed to be harmful \u201cunless \u2018it plainly appears from the record and the evidence\u2019 that the verdict was not affected by the error.\u201d <em>See Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1008-09, 407 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Like the seven prior convictions that were properly made known to the jury, the three erroneously admitted <em>nolle prossed </em>charges involved property offenses or offenses related to property crimes. Assuming the jury treated the <em>nolle prossed </em>charges as convictions, the inadmissible evidence was merely cumulative of overwhelming evidence that appellant had been convicted of numerous property offenses. Furthermore, although the jury was free to impose a maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>sentence of ten years imprisonment as punishment for the instant offense, notwithstanding the evidence that appellant had committed seven previous offenses, the jury only imposed a mid-range sentence of five years. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10(e), 18.2-248.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In short, given the nature of the erroneously admitted charges, weighed in the context of admissible evidence of seven previous convictions on charges of a similar nature, and, in light of the sentence imposed, we conclude that the exclusion of the evidence of appellant\u2019s <em>nolle prossed </em>charges would not have affected his sentence and that the improper admission of this evidence was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 also permits the Commonwealth to introduce relevant, admissible evidence to <em>rebut </em>any evidence introduced by the defendant on the issue of sentencing. The admissibility of rebuttal evidence is generally restricted in scope to refuting matters brought out by its proponent\u2019s adversary. <em>See Henning v. Thomas, </em>235 Va. 181, 189-90, 366 S.E.2d 109, 114 (1988). <em>See also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 1-4(e) (4th ed. 1993) (\"It is not proper to introduce matter which is merely cumulative, or not responsive to points raised in defendant\u2019s case....\u201d). The propriety of admitting rebuttal evidence relating to <em>nolle prossed </em>charges is not before us, and we decline to address the issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\">. We note that, in <em>Commonwealth v. Shifflett, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that the factors a jury may consider in mitigation of a capital offense under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B) may also be considered by the trial court \u201cin determining what evidence is relevant to punishment under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1....\u201d 257 Va. 34, 44, 510 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1999). However, while the Commonwealth may introduce evidence of unadju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>dicated criminal activity in capital cases, <em>see Beaver v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 530, 352 S.E.2d 342, 347 (1987), the holding in <em>Shifflett </em>does not stand for the proposition that charges that have been <em>nolle prossed </em>are admissible in non-capital cases prosecuted under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Unlike the directive provided by the express language of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 in non-capital cases, the Commonwealth's evidence is not confined in capital cases to the \"record of convictions.\u201d <em>See Peterson v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 298, 302 S.E.2d 520, 526 (holding that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4 \"does not restrict [penalty phase] evidence to the record of convictions\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865, 104 S.Ct. 202, 78 L.Ed.2d 176 (1983). Furthermore, since the question before the Court in <em>Shifflett </em>dealt only with the scope of admissible evidence related to punishment that a <em>defendant </em>is permitted to introduce, it did not address or construe the limitations imposed by Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 on the introduction of evidence related to punishment in non-capital cases by the Commonwealth in its case-in-chief. <em>See Shifflett, </em>257 Va. at 42, 510 S.E.2d at 235.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
