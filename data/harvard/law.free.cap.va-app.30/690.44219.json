Appellants contend they have standing under either Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 of the State Water Control Law (\u201cSWCL\u201d) or Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u2018VAPA\u201d). The Board and the City respond on multiple grounds, collectively arguing that: (1) neither the SWCL nor the VAPA establishes a waiver of sovereign immunity enjoyed by the Board\u2019s decision to grant a VWPP; (2) appellants lack standing under the SWCL because they have not suffered \u201cactual or imminent injury\u201d and any such injury is not traceable to the Board\u2019s decision; (3) the organizational appellants representing the interests of their members do not have standing under the SWCL because representational standing has not been specifically authorized by statute; and (4) appellants lack standing under the VAPA because they are not \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision to issue the VWPP.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We hold that the SWCL waives the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit but that appellants lack standing to challenge the Board\u2019s action in granting the City a VWPP. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">In July 1993, the City applied to the Board for a VWPP for its proposed King William Reservoir water supply project. The King William Reservoir project is a regional undertaking sponsored by a coalition of local governments, including Newport News, Williamsburg and York County, for the purpose of identifying and developing a regional water supply to meet projected needs through the year 2040. Once completed, the reservoir will comprise a 1,526 acre impoundment created by a new dam across Cohoke Creek, a small tributary of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Pamunkey River located between the Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers in King William County. The project will also entail the construction of a water intake and pumping station to withdraw water from the nearby Mattaponi River and convey it to the reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Because the dam will be constructed by \u201cthe discharge of dredged or fill material\u201d into Cohoke Creek, \u00a7 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) requires the City, as the lead agency of the coalition governments, to obtain a construction permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d). <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a), (d). Under \u00a7 401(a) of the CWA, the Corps may not issue a permit for an activity resulting in a discharge into wetlands unless the state where the discharge takes place certifies that the discharge will comply with \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the CWA or until the state waives such certification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The Corps may not issue a permit \u201cif certification has been denied by the [s]tate____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, under \u00a7 401(d) of the CWA, \u201cany effluent limitations and other limitations, and monitoring requirements\u201d that are included in the state\u2019s certification \u201cshall become a condition on any Federal license or permit....\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) of the SWCL authorizes the Board to issue certificates for the alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of state waters. The SWCL further designates the VWPP as \u201cthe certification required under Section 401\u201d of the CWA. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5(A). \u201cThe Board shall issue a [VWPP] for an activity requiring \u00a7 401 certification if it has determined that the proposed activity is consistent with the provisions of the [CWA] and will protect instream beneficial uses.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5(B). \u201cConditions contained in a [VWPP] may include, but are not limited to, the volume of water which may be withdrawn as a part of the permitted activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>On December 16, 1997, the Board issued a VWPP to the City. The VWPP contained a number of \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d establishing various limitations and monitoring requirements for the project. For example, the VWPP requires the City to develop a monitoring plan designed to analyze the impact of the project on the Mattaponi River\u2019s salinity. The permit also sets forth conditions requiring the reservoir to release a minimum amount of water below the dam on Cohoke Creek and authorizing the withdrawal of up to seventy-five million gallons of water per day from the Mattaponi River.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Subsequently, the City, the Mattaponi Tribe and appellants, a group of petitioners consisting of the Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers Association, the Sierra Club, Paulette Berberieh and Warren Mountcastle, appealed the Board\u2019s decision. Both the Board and the City demurred to appellants\u2019 petition for appeal on grounds substantially similar to those raised before this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the parties\u2019 request, the circuit court heard oral argument on both demurrers at the same time, sustaining the demurrers on August 7, 1998 in a document entitled \u201cCase Under Advisement.\u201d Without elaborating upon the grounds for its decision, the court wrote that appellants \u201clack standing to maintain [their] suit.\u201d The court disagreed, however, with the Board\u2019s position that appellants\u2019 suit was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court entered a final order dismissing appellants\u2019 appeal on September 11,1998. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Board contends that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars appellants\u2019 appeal to the circuit court because neither the SWCL nor the VAPA explicitly waives such immunity. We disagree, finding an express waiver of immunity in the provisions of the SWCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5 establishes that a VWPP \u201cshall constitute the certification required under \u00a7 401 of the [CWA].\u201d Although Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5 makes no mention of judicial review, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 expressly waives the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the Board\u2019s grant or denial of a VWPP on the ground that a VWPP is a permit for the alteration of state waters within the scope of that statute\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) gives the Board authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\"><em>[t]o issue certificates for </em>the discharge of sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes into or adjacent to or <em>the alteration otherwise of the physical, chemical or biological properties of state waters under prescribed conditions </em>and to revoke or amend such certificates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">We hold that the VWPP for the King William Reservoir project is a certificate for the alteration of state waters constituting Cohoke Creek and the Mattaponi River. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5). The VWPP certifies that the discharge of fill material into Cohoke Creek complies with the CWA. The VWPP also contains a number of conditions relating to the operation of the proposed reservoir that will directly affect the water levels of Cohoke Creek and the Mattaponi River and which, under federal law, must be incorporated into any permit subsequently issued by the Corps under \u00a7 404 of the CWA. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(d). Furthermore, the Board\u2019s regulations confirm that a VWPP is a permit for the alteration of state waters. <em>See </em>9 VAC \u00a7 25-210-50(A) (stating that <em>\u201c[n]o person shall </em>dredge, fill or discharge <em>any </em>pollutant into, or adjacent to surface waters, or <em>otherwise alter the physical, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>chemical or biological properties of surface waters, except as authorized pursuant to a [VWPP] </em>...\u201d (emphasis added)). Because the VWPP for the King William Reservoir is a permit for the alteration of state waters, we hold that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29, by reference to the Board\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5), expressly waives the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity as to the grant of that permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 authorizes judicial review of \u201cfinal decision[s]\u201d made by the Board under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find the language of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 to be clear and the scope of judicial review established therein to be unambiguously defined. Broadly inclusive language in a statute is not ambiguous if the legislature\u2019s objective requires such language. <em>See Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 302, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988). As such, judicial construction is not required, and we will not resort to legislative history or extrinsic facts to endow the statute with its meaning. <em>See id. </em>Instead, we take the statute\u2019s words as they are written and give them their plain meaning. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Board contends that Code \u00a7 62.1-14.29 should not be construed to allow judicial review of VWPP decisions because it fails to separately and explicitly identify the precise type of permit at issue in this case. In support of this argument the Board notes that, while Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 states that judicial review is available for final decisions made pursuant to the general authorization in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5), the statute then identifies specific types of permitting decisions under other code sections which are to be afforded such review. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 (authorizing judicial review of final decisions under Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.16, 62.1-44.17 and 62.1-44.19). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Board reasons that, because the code section providing for the issuance of a VWPP, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5, is not specifically-mentioned, judicial review is limited to decisions made pursuant to the specific permitting actions cited in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">First, we find no authority in support of the principle advanced by the Board that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 must separately and explicitly identify the precise type of permit at issue in order for its legislative waiver of sovereign immunity to be effective as to that permitting action, particularly where the statutory language providing for judicial review is otherwise clear. Indeed, we declined to require such specificity in <em>Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. VPTA, </em>13 Va.App. 458, 413 S.E.2d 59 (1991), where we found an \u201cexplicit and limited waiver of sovereign immunity\u201d in general statutory language providing that \u201c \u2018[a]ny person affected by ... any [regulation]\u2019 \u201d or any \u201c \u2018party aggrieved by ... a case decision\u2019 \u201d has the right to judicial review against the agency promulgating the regulation or case decision at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 465-66, 413 S.E.2d at 64 (quoting Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16(A)). Furthermore, the Board\u2019s construction effectively negates the express language of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 providing for judicial review of final decisions made under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5). <em>See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em>10 Va.App. 41, 44, 390 S.E.2d 3, 5 (1990) (stating that statutes \u201cmust be read so as to give effect to the plain meaning of all of [their] terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Second, the premise underlying the Board\u2019s position does not withstand scrutiny. The Board argues that if the legislature had intended to establish judicial review for final decisions encompassed within the \u201cgeneral\u201d language of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5), there would be no need to include the specific and redundant references to Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.16, 62.1-44.17 and 62.1-44.19. They contend that by giving the general language of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) effect, the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the specific references is made \u201can unnecessary and duplicative act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>However, a close examination of Code \u00a7 62.44.29 makes manifest that the specific references address final decisions by the Board that are separate and distinct from those made under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5). Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) authorizes the Board to issue certificates for the discharge of industrial wastes, other wastes and sewage or for the alteration of state waters by other means. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.17 authorizes the Board: (1) to require the installation of facilities or the adoption of appropriate measures necessary to prevent the discharge of \u201cother wastes\u201d into state waters and (2) to issue certificates for the \u201chandling, storing, distribution or production\u201d of other wastes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.16 and 62.1-44.19 authorize the Board to issue certificates for the discharge of wastes into state waters, they also authorize the Board to make decisions that do not involve the issuance of certificates for the discharge of wastes or for the alteration of state waters. Specifically, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.16 gives the Board the authority, <em>inter alia, </em>to approve facilities for the treatment as well as the control of industrial wastes and other wastes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.19 authorizes the Board, <em>inter alia, </em>to certify the construction, expansion or operation of a sewerage system or sewage treatment works and to determine minimum treatment requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>9 VAC 25-32-10; 9 VAC 25-32-30(C); 9 VAC 25-32-60(A)(2) (authorizing the Board, pursuant to the statutory authority of Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.16, 62.1-44.17 and 62.1-44.19, to issue Virginia Pollution Abatement permits for \u201cpollutant management activities,\u201d which include the operation of systems for the prevention, reduction, storage, treatment, separation, disposal, recycling or reclamation of wastes).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Indeed, as their captions suggest, the waste statutes generally include provisions for the treatment of wastes and for the regulation of the facilities where wastes are stored or produced. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.16, 62.1-44.17 (entitled \u201cRegulation of Industrial Establishments\u201d); Code \u00a7 62.1-44.19 (entitled \u201cRegulation of Sewage Discharges\u201d). <em>See also Hawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 261, 269, 497 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1998) (stating that a title \u201cmay be read in an attempt to ascertain an act\u2019s purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Thus, the legislature\u2019s authorization of judicial review for decisions made under Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.16, 62.1-44.17 and 62.1-44.19, in addition to the class of decisions encompassed within 62.1-44.15(5), is not redundant. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29. Rather, the language is necessary to address comprehensively the different decision-making authority granted to the Board under the SWCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>In summary, we hold that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 explicitly provides for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision to issue a permit for the alteration of state waters. Because the VWPP for the King William Reservoir project is such a permit, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar appellants\u2019 suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Having established that the SWCL provides for a waiver of the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity from judicial review of its decision to grant or deny a VWPP, we must now determine whether appellants have standing to challenge the decision at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The SWCL provides that any person who has participated, either in person or by the submission of written comments, in the public comment process related to a final decision of the Board under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(5) is entitled to judicial review of that decision \u201cif such person meets the standard for obtaining judicial review of a case or controversy pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACq\">A person shall be deemed to meet such standard if (i) such person has suffered an actual or imminent injury which is an invasion of a legally protected interest and which is concrete and particularized; (ii) such injury is fairly traee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>able to the decision of the Board and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court; and (iii) such injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Appellants contend they have standing to challenge the Board\u2019s grant of a VWPP to the City because they meet the three-part test for Article III standing enunciated in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find that, under the statutes and regulations applicable to the proposed reservoir project, the Army Corps of Engineers must grant a \u00a7 404 permit for the discharge of fill material into Cohoke Creek before construction of the King William Reservoir project may proceed. Accordingly, we hold that appellants do not have standing under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 to challenge the Board\u2019s issuance of a VWPP because the injuries alleged in their petition for appeal will result from the independent action of the Corps, a third party not before the circuit court. In light of this holding, the remaining arguments of the Board and the City are rendered moot, and we will not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The CWA establishes a comprehensive program to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters of the United States. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a); <em>Route 26 Land Development Assoc. v. United States Government, </em>753 F.Supp. 532, 536 (D.Del.1990), <em>aff'd, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>961 F.2d 1568 (1992). Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 404 of the CWA, the Corps is authorized to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States after obtaining a certification from the state where the discharge originates that any such discharge will comply with the CWA. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341(a)(1), 1344(a). Although the certifying state may prevent the Corps from issuing a \u00a7 404 permit by denying the certification required by the CWA or may issue a certification with limitations that become conditions on any \u00a7 404 permit issued by the Corps, only the Corps, by issuance of a \u00a7 404 permit, has the power to authorize an actual discharge into the waters of the United States. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341(a)(1), 1341(d). Indeed, in the absence of a state\u2019s timely action \u201con a request for certification,\u201d the Corps is authorized to proceed with a permitting action without the state\u2019s certification. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Rules regarding the Corps\u2019 authority to issue \u00a7 404 permits are codified at 33 C.F.R. Parts 230, 320 and 323. Part 230 establishes guidelines to implement the policies of the CWA \u201cthrough the control of discharges of dredged or fill material.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.1(a), (b). The guidelines are \u201capplicable to the specification of disposal sites for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States,\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.2(a), and establish \u201cconditions which must be satisfied in order to make a finding that a proposed discharge of dredged or fill material complies with\u201d the CWA. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.4. Part 320 contains the Corps\u2019 general policies for evaluating all applications for permits. <em>See </em>33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4. <em>See also Route 26 Land Development, </em>753 F.Supp. at 536. Part 323 contains additional policies, practices and procedures specifically applicable to the Corps\u2019 \u201creview of applications for ... permits to authorize the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States pursuant to section 404 of the [CWA].\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">According to these rules and policies, the Corps \u201cis neither a proponent nor opponent of any permit proposal\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>bases its permitting decisions on a \u201cpublic interest review.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.1(a)(1), (4). The Corps may issue or deny a permit based on its assessment of whether \u201cthe proposed activity and its intended use\u201d is in the public interest. <em>See </em>33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4(a)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative impacts, <em>of the proposed activity and its intended use on the public interest. </em>Evaluation of the probable impact which the proposed activity may have on the public interest requires a careful weighing of all those factors which become relevant in each particular case. The benefits which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. The decision whether .to authorize a proposal, and if so, the conditions under which it will be allowed to occur are therefore determined by the outcome of this general balancing process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4(a)(1) (emphasis added). As to \u00a7 404 permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material, Part 323 specifically provides that the Corps will review such applications and, if it \u201cdetermines that the proposed discharge would comply with the [Guidelines], ... grant the permit unless issuance would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.6(a). Factors that the Corps must balance in making its public interest determination include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cconservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and -wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, ... recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, ... considerations of property ownership, and, in general, the needs and welfare of people.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">As the foregoing regulations make clear, the Corps ultimately authorizes the discharge of fill material into Cohoke Creek after consideration of numerous factors, including some which are co-incident with those considered by the Board in issuing a VWPP. <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15:5 (stating that the Board \u201cshall issue\u201d a VWPP \u201cif it has determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>proposed activity is consistent with the provisions of the [CWA] and will protect instream beneficial uses,\u201d which include navigation, maintenance of waste assimilation capacity, the protection of fish and wildlife resources and habitat, recreation, cultural and aesthetic values), <em>with </em>33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.6(a) (stating that the Corps shall issue a \u00a7 404 permit if it determines that the proposed discharge complies with the Guidelines and comports with the public interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Moreover, we cannot say that the Board\u2019s issuance of a VWPP has a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Corps\u2019 ultimate decision to issue a \u00a7 404 permit for the King William Reservoir project. <em>See Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 169, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997). In <em>Spear, </em>the United States Supreme Court found that an injury was fairly traceable to a biological opinion of the Fish and Wildlife Service, notwithstanding the fact that the Service\u2019s opinion was not \u201cthe very last step in the chain of causation,\u201d based on the opinion\u2019s coercive effect on the ultimate decision-making agency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>The Court based its decision, however, on several factors not present here. In <em>Spear, </em>the statutory scheme: (1) placed a heavy burden on an agency that disagreed with the Service\u2019s opinion to articulate its reasons, (2) raised wildlife issues for review that were beyond the Bureau\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>sphere of expertise and which were peculiarly within the Service\u2019s expertise and (3) imposed the risk of civil and criminal penalties upon agencies and their employees who chose to disregard an opinion\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In this case, although 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4 states that the Corps \u201cwill generally ... issue[ ]\u201d a permit upon receipt of \u201ca favorable state determination,\u201d the remaining regulatory provisions make clear that the Corps independently reviews whether a \u00a7 404 permit would comport with the public interest and that numerous factors must be considered by the Corps before a permit can issue. Furthermore, we note the absence of any provisions imposing penalties on the Corps should it elect to deny a \u00a7 404 permit after receiving the required state certification and the relative expertise enjoyed by the Corps in reviewing the relevant issues to be addressed before a permit may be issued. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a), (d) (authorizing the Secretary of the Army, \u201cacting through the Chief of Engineers,\u201d to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material); 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.1 (establishing \u201cpolicies, practices, and procedures to be followed by the Corps of Engineers in connection with the review of ... permits [for] the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States ... \u201d). Further, as expressly established in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4, the general statement that the Corps will issue a permit upon receipt of a favorable state determination applies only \u201cin the absence of overriding national factors of the public interest that [are] revealed during the evaluation of the permit application\u201d and only if the \u201cconcerns, policies, goals, and requirements as expressed in 33 C.F.R. Parts 320-24, and the applicable statutes have been considered and followed.\u201d These factors underscore the independent nature of the Corps\u2019 review of permit applications and the absence of a coercive or determinative effect of a state certification upon the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In summary, the construction and operation of the King William Reservoir project is contingent upon the Corps\u2019 issuance of a \u00a7 404 permit for the discharge of fill material into Cohoke Creek. Under the applicable statutory scheme, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Corps has exclusive authority to issue such a permit upon finding that the project and its intended use comply with the guidelines implementing the policies of the CWA and comport with the public interest. The Board\u2019s issuance of a VWPP does not compel the Corps to issue a \u00a7 404 permit. Thus, we hold that appellants\u2019 alleged injuries are the result of the independent action of the Corps upon its authorization of the discharge of fill material into Cohoke Creek pursuant to \u00a7 404 of the CWA. As such, appellants have failed to satisfy the second prong of the test for standing established in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">.

However, we find our decision in <em>May </em>to be inapposite. In <em>May, </em>we held that \"where an agency\u2019s basic law provides expressly for VAPA coverage of certain proceedings under specified conditions and makes no provision for judicial review of other proceedings, the unmentioned proceedings are subject to the VAPA unless otherwise expressly excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 513 S.E.2d at 882. Unlike <em>May, </em>in this case the basic law provides expressly for judicial review of the agency action at issue. As such, we need not look to the provisions of the VAPA for a waiver of sovereign immunity. Nor do we rely on the provisions of the VAPA to analyze whether appellants have standing. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:3 (stating that the VAPA \"does not supersede or repeal additional procedural requirements in\u201d an agency\u2019s basic law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\">.

Members of the Alliance to Save the Mattaponi, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (\"CBF\"), the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers Association, and the Sierra Club contend the construction of the reservoir and subsequent withdrawal of water from the Mattaponi River will harm them by damaging the ecosystems and the aesthetic qualities of the Mattaponi River and Cohoke Creek, which they use for boating, fishing, swimming, water supply, and educational purposes. Paulette Berberich alleges the reservoir will flood fifteen to twenty acres of land that she owns, resulting in her loss of use and enjoyment of that land.
