On appeal, Bowman argues that the court erred by allowing a witness to identify him as the man depicted in video surveillance tapes. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In the summer of 1997, three convenience stores in Campbell County were burglarized. On June 7, 1997, Lester\u2019s Market was burglarized, and a safe containing approximately $2,600 was stolen from the store. On July 26, 1997, Miles Market was burglarized, and approximately $6,400 in cash, twenty-five cartons of cigarettes, and several cases of beer were taken from the store. On July 26, 1997, Moore\u2019s Country Store was burglarized, and a safe containing $3,000 in cash and checks was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The evidence revealed that a breaking occurred in the back of Miles Market, approximately nine feet off the ground. The perpetrator of the burglaries at Lester\u2019s Market and Moore\u2019s Country Store was captured on tape by video surveillance equipment. At trial, Carl Smith testified that Henry Bowman was the person seen on both video surveillance tapes. Smith stated that he was the grandfather of Bowman\u2019s children. Smith stated that although he was not present during the commission of any of the charged burglaries, he could positively identify Bowman as the person on the tapes. On cross-examination, Smith testified that he did not like Bowman because Bowman was unemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Smith also identified Bowman as the person in Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibits 6 and 7, still photographs taken from the videotapes. Bowman\u2019s counsel objected to Smith\u2019s testimony, arguing that his statements constituted \u201cnon-verbal hearsay,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>improper lay testimony, and opinion testimony offered to prove an ultimate issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Bowman moved to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief and at the close of all evidence. The court denied both motions. The court stated that although the videotapes themselves were insufficient to allow an identification of Bowman, when looking at one of the still photos from the videotape the court itself could identify Bowman as \u201cthe burglar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">On appeal, Bowman argues that the court erred in overruling his objection to the admission of Smith\u2019s testimony regarding his identity as the perpetrator of the burglaries that were depicted on the two videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">II. IDENTIFICATION OF BOWMAN</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Bowman argues that the court erred in allowing Smith to testify about the identity of the perpetrator shown on the videotapes and the still photographs made from the tapes. Bowman contends the Commonwealth \u201cfailed to establish Mr. Smith\u2019s familiarity with [Bowman] in order to qualify Smith to express an opinion regarding [Bowman\u2019s] identity.\u201d Bowman argues that Smith\u2019s lack of familiarity with Bowman\u2019s appearance, coupled with his bad feelings toward Bowman, undermine the credibility of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\n<em>A. Ability of Witness to Identify Appellant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Bowman did not raise at trial the issue of Smith\u2019s ability to identify him on the videotape. \u201cIn order to be considered on appeal, an objection must be timely made and the grounds stated with specificity. To be timely, an objection must be made when the occasion arises \u2014 at the time the evidence is offered or the statement made.\u201d <em>Marlowe v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 619, 621, 347 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1986); <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18. Because Bowman did not raise this objection at trial, we will not consider it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\n<em>B. Lay Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Bowman also argues that Smith was prohibited from making an identification of the person on the videotape because he was a lay witness testifying about matters that require the testimony of an expert. We disagree. \u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 552, 555, 466 S.E.2d 116, 117 (1996). \u201cEvidence which tends to cast any light upon the subject of the inquiry is relevant.\u201d <em>Cash v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 506, 510, 364 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1988). \u201cRelevant evidence which has the tendency to add force and effect to a party\u2019s defense is admissible, unless excluded by a specific rule or policy consideration.\u201d <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 118, 122, 415 S.E.2d 851, 853-54 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 943 (1874), the Supreme Court of Virginia considered whether a witness who had been given a description of two men alleged to have recently committed a robbery could testify at their trial. At trial, the .witness testified that the men matched the description he had been given. On appeal, the Court held that \u201cupon questions of identity a witness is competent to give his opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u201cA lay witness may offer an opinion as to the identity of a person.\u201d 2 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 17.10, at 21 (4th ed.1993). Here, Smith was Bowman\u2019s father-in-law and the grandfather of Bowman\u2019s children. Smith testified that he had known Bowman for two years and that he recognized Bowman not only in the videotapes but also in the Commonwealth\u2019s still photographs of the perpetrator made from the videotape. \u201cThe scarcity of case law on the point [of whether a witness may identify a person] is probably due to a general failure to regard identification as an opinion problem, it being considered a matter of \u2018fact.\u2019 \u201d Friend, <em>supra, </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\n<em>C. \u201cUltimate Issue of Fact\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Bowman also argues that the court erred in allowing Smith\u2019s testimony because \u201c[o]pinion testimony on ultimate issues of fact is not admissible in criminal proceedings.\u201d Bowman contends that Smith\u2019s testimony \u201cgoes directly to the ultimate issue: the identity of the culprit.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Smith\u2019s identification of Bowman did not implicate an \u201cultimate issue of fact.\u201d \u201cUltimate issues of fact\u201d for purposes of the conviction of a crime are the statutory elements of that offense. <em>See Llamera v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 414 S.E.2d 597 (1992) (in prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the Commonwealth is required to prove the element of possession and the intent to distribute which are both ultimate issues of fact); <em>Bond v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 539, 311 S.E.2d 769, 772 (1984) (where \u201cthe crucial issue was whether death was brought about by criminal agency ... [t]he ultimate question was whether the decedent jumped intentionally, fell accidentally, or was thrown to her death\u201d). The court did not err in allowing Smith to identify Bowman as the person shown on the videotape and the still photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">III. DENIAL OF WRIT \u201cON THE MERITS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In an earlier unpublished decision, we considered the exact issue now before us: whether a witness may identify a person from a videotape and whether that identification may be considered by the fact finder. <em>See Rogers v. Commonwealth, </em>97 Vap. UNP 2269961, Record No. 2269-96-1, 1997 WL 613299 (October 7, 1997). In <em>Rogers, </em>appellant appealed his conviction of murder, rape, robbery, credit card theft, and credit card fraud. At trial, the court allowed a witness who knew both the victim and the appellant to identify the appellant in a videotape taken at a bank machine where the victim\u2019s stolen credit card was used. On appeal, Rogers argued that a lay witness should not have been permitted to identify the person on the videotape. <em>See id. </em>In addition, Rogers argued that by allowing the witness to identify him, the witness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>usurping the role of the fact finder in making a determination of an \u201cultimate fact in issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In an unpublished opinion, we disagreed with Rogers\u2019 contentions and affirmed his convictions. <em>See id. </em>We held that \u201ca witness may identify a person from a description, or, as in the instant case, a videotape, and that identification may be considered by the finder of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, because the witness\u2019 identification of Rogers as the man in the videotape did not prove an element of any of the charges against him, \u201c[the witness\u2019] testimony did not implicate an ultimate issue of fact and the trial court did not err by allowing his testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">After his convictions were affirmed, Rogers did not petition this Court for a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Rogers did, however, file a petition for appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia. On February 18, 1998, the Supreme Court denied Rogers\u2019 petition for appeal. <em>See </em>Record No. 972336 (Va. February 18, 1998). The refusal of a petition for appeal constitutes a final decision on the merits. <em>See Saunders v. Reynolds, </em>214 Va. 697, 700-01, 204 S.E.2d 421, 424 (1974) (\u201c[w]e state unequivocally that a decision to grant or refuse a petition for writ of error is based upon one equally-applied criterion \u2014 the merits of the case\u201d); <em>see also Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 283, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992) (\u201cthe Supreme Court of Virginia refused the petition\u2014a disposition indicating that the [C]ourt found the petition without merit\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 311 n. 4, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (\u201c[e]ach petition for writ of error under Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-317 (1975) is reviewed. on the merits ... and the effect of a denial is to affirm the judgment of conviction on the merits\u201d); <em>Dodson v. Director, </em>233 Va. 303, 307 n. 5, 355 S.E.2d 573, 576 n. 5 (1987) (\u201c[i]n Virginia, aside from appeals from a capital murder conviction, criminal appeals to both the Court of Appeals and to this Court are discretionary, and \u2018a decision to grant or refuse a petition [for appeal] is based upon one equally-applied criterion \u2014 the merits of the case\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Additionally, the Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that a denial of a writ is on the merits and the issue that is decided is binding in other cases. As we stated in <em>Harward v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 468, 476, 364 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1988);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[t]he Supreme Court held \u201cunequivocally that a decision to grant or refuse a petition for writ of error is based upon equally-applied criteria \u2014 the merits of the case.\u201d When there is \u201csubstantial possibility that error has been committed in the conviction of the defendant,\u201d then a writ is granted. \u201c[A] convicted felon whose claims lack substance is refused a writ.\u201d The Court has held the doctrine to apply even when \u201cthe precise issue involved\u201d resulted in denial of a petition for a writ of error in a separate case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">(Citations omitted). <em>See also Overhead Door Co. v. Lewis, </em>29 Va.App. 52, 509 S.E.2d 535 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Attorney General argues that the denial of a petition for writ of error by the Supreme Court of Virginia results in binding precedent upon the Court of Appeals for the precise issue raised in the appeal and resolved \u201con the merits.\u201d Given the holdings cited above, the Attorney General\u2019s position is not without merit; however, the difficulty comes in application of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In <em>Rogers, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia stated only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">Upon review of the record in this case and consideration of the argument submitted in support of the granting of an appeal, the Court refuses the petition for appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Accepting that the petition was refused \u201con the merits,\u201d in order to discern any precedential effect of the denial, the \u201cprecise issue\u201d that formed the basis for the denial must be determined. The Supreme Court of Virginia is silent on this issue. The Court could have found error but found it to be harmless, which would, nonetheless, be a decision \u201con the merits.\u201d We cannot speculate concerning the \u201cprecise issue\u201d that served as the basis for the denial of the writ of error in <em>Rogers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We hold that, to the extent it can be determined by the plain language of an order of the Supreme Court of Virginia denying a petition for -writ of error that a \u201cprecise issue\u201d has been decided \u201con the merits,\u201d the holding is binding on the Court of Appeals in future cases raising the same issue. Here, we are unable to determine the \u201cprecise issue\u201d addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Rogers; </em>consequently, we reject the Attorney General\u2019s contention that the denial of a writ of error by the Supreme Court creates binding precedent in the case before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We hold that the court did not err in allowing a witness to identify Bowman as the man depicted in video surveillance tapes, and we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
