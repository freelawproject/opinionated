On appeal, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the trial court\u2019s admission of hearsay evidence was reversible error. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">On August 14, 1997, Carl Wesley Ernest Warner, appellant, an employee of Aliloo Oriental Rugs, requested that he be paid his weekly wage a day early. The evidence at trial revealed that Warner received a check for $231 and attempted to cash it on August 15, 1997. The bank informed him that the account contained insufficient funds. Warner told his employer, and his employer gave him a second check for $200. Warner retained the check for $231. Warner cashed the $200 check that day. On August 17, 1997, he cashed the check for $231 at the Aldie Country Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">In the absence of the owner, Parviz \u201cPaul\u201d Hadjialilo, Christopher Syrjala was operating Aliloo Oriental Rugs. Syrjala testified that Warner told him \u201cthe bank wouldn\u2019t cash the check because of insufficient funds.\u201d Syrjala stated that he went to the bank and was informed that the account contained only $218. Syrjala stated that he \u201ctold ... [Warner] there was $218 in the account, that I would write a check for $200, which was most of ... [Warner\u2019s] salary, and that Paul [Hadjialilo] would fix it up when he got back, you know, the underpayment.\u201d Syrjala testified that he wrote the check for $200 and Warner immediately went to Southern Financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Bank and cashed it. Syrjala stated that he did not ask Warner to return the $231 check because \u201cit seemed totally unnecessary.... I mean, it was obvious that it was a bad check at that point.\u201d Syrjala stated that he had initially mentioned that Warner might try cashing the $231 check at a country store, but testified, \u201cthen I thought better of it and came up with the idea of writing the second check that was within the amount of that in the account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On Saturday, August 16, 1997, Warner was supposed to work, but Warner\u2019s girlfriend called to tell Syrjala that Warner was unable to come into work because a family member was ill. After cashing both checks, Warner never went back to work for Aliloo Oriental Rugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Syrjala testified that he received a call from Eagle Check Cashing in Manassas, Virginia. In response to the call, Syrjala stated that he \u201ctold them that a bank had refused to cash the check.... \u201d Syrjala identified the check at trial as \u201c[t]he one for $231 because of insufficient funds____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Hadjialilo testified that he received a call from a check cashing company in Manassas and he told them \u201cthe check is not good, not to cash the check.\u201d Hadjialilo stated that he called Southern Financial Bank and issued a stop payment on the $231 check.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Warner testified that he believed that the $231 check was, in part, pre-payment for the following weekend and week\u2019s wages. Warner stated that he did not work because his father had a heart attack. Warner stated that the bank had not informed him that the account contained insufficient funds and that when he cashed the $231 check, he did not know that there were insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Where the sufficiency of the evidence is an issue on appeal, an appellate court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 42, 393 S.E.2d 599, 608 (1990). \u201cIntent is the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>formed in a person\u2019s mind that may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case, and may be shown by a person\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 626, 632, 426 S.E.2d 137, 140 (1993) (citations omitted). The \u201c[i]ntent to defraud means that the defendant intends to deceive another person, and to induce such other person, in reliance upon such deception, to assume, create, transfer, alter or terminate a right, obligation or power with reference to property.\u201d <em>Sylvestre v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 253, 258-59, 391 S.E.2d 336, 339 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">On appeal, Warner acknowledges that he cashed the $231 check but argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove he had the intent to defraud or knowledge that the account contained insufficient funds when the check was uttered. Warner also contends that he had a bona fide claim of right to the $231 check, which negated the criminal intent required for his conviction, and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the Aldie Country Store is a depository as required by the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A. <em>Claim of Right</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">At trial, Warner stated that Syrjala gave him the $231 check, in part, as prospective payment for the following week. Warner testified that he intended to work the next week, prior to his father\u2019s heart attack, and that the money would then be \u201cowed\u201d to him. On appeal, Warner asserts that he believed he was entitled to the money, in part, as a prospective wage at the time he uttered the check, and in part because he was still owed thirty-one dollars from the previous week. Consequently, he maintains he lacked the requisite intent to defraud the Aldie Country Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Warner cites <em>Butts v. Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 133 S.E. 764 (1926), for the proposition that a person cannot commit a larceny of his or her own property or of property that a person in good faith believes is his or her own. In <em>Butts, </em>the defendant was fired from his job without being paid his final wages. Butts returned to his former place of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>with a pistol and demanded payment from his supervisor at gunpoint. The Court reversed Butts\u2019 robbery conviction, holding that Butts\u2019 claim of right to the wages negated the requisite criminal intent for the conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 813-15, 133 S.E. at 768-69. <em>Butts </em>is distinguishable from the case before us because Warner had been paid $200 for the hours he worked. He was owed only thirty-one dollars. He did not earn an additional $200, either at the time the check was uttered or the following week. The evidence established that Warner was routinely paid retroactively, not prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Additionally, a claim of right defense only applies against a party that holds that person\u2019s funds. A party may not assert a \u201cclaim of right\u201d against an innocent third party. Here, the victim of the uttering was the Aldie Country Store, not Warner\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">B. <em>\u201cDepository\u201d Language in the Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">On appeal, Warner argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he defrauded a \u201cbank or other depository\u201d as charged in the indictment. Code \u00a7 18.2-181 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">Any person who, with intent to defraud, shall make or draw or utter or deliver any check, draft, or order for the payment of money, upon any bank, banking institution, trust company, or other depository, knowing, at the time of such making, drawing, uttering or delivering, that the maker or drawer has not sufficient funds in ... shall be guilty of larceny____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Warner argues that the Aldie Country Store is not a depository as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-181. Warner, however, misconstrues the use of the term \u201cdepository\u201d in the statute. A \u201cdepository bank\u201d refers to \u201cthe first bank to which an item is transferred for collection even though it is also the payor bank.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.4-105(a). A \u201cpayor bank\u201d is defined as \u201ca bank by which an item is payable as drawn or accepted.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.4-105(b). Therefore, a depository as defined by the legislature is the institution upon whose funds the check is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>drawn. Here, the depository referred to in the indictment is Southern Financial Bank, not the Aldie Country Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">To construe the statute as Warner suggests would criminalize the passing of bad checks only when they are passed directly at the depository bank. We hold that the \u201cdepository\u201d language in Code \u00a7 18.2-181 refers to the institution upon which the funds are drawn, not to the entity where the check is uttered.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">III. HEARSAY EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On appeal, Warner argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence in violation of the hearsay rule. We agree, but we find that the admission of the statements was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Hearsay is \u201ctestimony which consists [of] a narration by one person of matters told him by another.\u201d <em>Williams v. Morris, </em>200 Va. 413, 417, 105 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1958). \u201cThe strongest justification for the exclusion of hearsay evidence is that the trier of fact has no opportunity to view the witness on cross-examination and to observe the demeanor of the out-of-court declarant to determine reliability.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 197, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987), citing C. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 224 (2d ed.1983). However, \u201c[i]f the declaration is offered solely to show that it was uttered, without regard to the truth or falsity of its content, the declaration is not excluded by the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith, </em>5 Va.App. at 197, 361 S.E.2d at 441 (citations omitted) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Warner objected to the admission of the following testimony from Syrjala:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">Q: Do you recall when you actually opened the office whether or not you received a phone call from Eagle Check Cashing Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">THE COURT: State the grounds of your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>DEFENSE COUNSEL: Hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">THE COURT: Whether or not a call was received is not hearsay. She did not ask what the content of the conversation was. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: May I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">COMMONWEALTH: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">Q: Do you recall what day it was in the sequence of events that you got this call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">A: Saturday morning just after I opened the store, about 15 minutes afterwards, I got a call from Eagle Check Cashing in Manassas asking me to verify\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">Q: \u2014just answer the question that I asked you. Now, as a result of Eagle Check Cashing, what if any response did you make back to those people during your telephone conversation with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">A: Well, can I say what they asked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">THE COURT: No. That\u2019s hearsay. The objection made by [defense counsel] is sustained. Actually, the Commonwealth backed off. You may not because it\u2019s hearsay, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">A: I told them that a bank had refused to cash the check yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">Q: What check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">A: The one for $231 because of insufficient funds I gave them as the reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">Warner also objected to the following testimony from Hadjialilo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-18\">Q: Now, regarding the exhibit that I showed you, the check in the amount of $231, did you have a conversation with him about the check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-19\">A: I saw Mr. Warner after I had a call from a check cashing company in Manassas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-20\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, I would object as to hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>THE COURT: If he had the call, it is a fact. There\u2019s been no question and no statement regarding any hearsay. Overruled at this stage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Q: After receiving that phone call from the check-cashing place in Manassas, what did you do with regard to ... Warner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">A: They told me there\u2019s a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t tell what they told you. The question is what did you do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">WITNESS: What I told \u2014 can I tell them what I told them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApM\">THE COURT: Answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Q: What did you tell the bank institution that called you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEv\">A: I told them that the check is not good, not to cash that check. He already got paid for the work that he worked and I tried to get in touch with Mr. Warner. And, actually, I saw him again in the street, and I was kind of disappointed I told him. I showed him my disappointment [sic] and got a call the next day from John Beiler at the country store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Warner argues that in both instances the court erred in allowing Syrjala and Hadjialilo to testify that the phone calls were received from check cashing companies. We agree. Testimony that phone calls were received is not hearsay. Testimony that a phone call came from a person unknown to the recipient and who is identified only by the caller is hearsay if offered to establish the identity of the caller. The only way Syrjala and Hadjialilo could know who was calling was from an out-of-court declaration from the caller. The relevancy of Syrjala\u2019s and Hadjialilo\u2019s responses to the call is dependent' upon who made the call. Clearly, this information lacks any significance unless the source of the call is known. Similarly, it is clear that the identification of the caller in each instance was based solely upon out-of-court declarations and was offered for the truth of the matters stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u201cError -will be presumed prejudicial unless it plainly appears that it could not have affected the result.\u201d <em>Joyner v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 471, 477, 65 S.E.2d 555, 558 (1951). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Therefore, \u201c[a] criminal conviction shall not be reversed for an error committed at trial when it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 173, 189, 416 S.E.2d 14, 23 (1992) (citations omitted); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-678.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">A nonconstitutional error is harmless if \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial that the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 692, 695, 446 S.E.2d 619, 620 (1994) (quoting <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Excluding the hearsay evidence that Syrjala and Hadjialilo both received phone calls from a check cashing company in Manassas, the Commonwealth presented overwhelming evidence to prove that Warner cashed the $231 check with the intent to defraud and with knowledge that the funds in the account were insufficient. Syrjala testified that Warner told him that the bank refused to cash the $231 check because the funds in the account were insufficient. Syrjala wrote a second check to Warner in the amount of $200, which the funds in the account were sufficient to cover, and told him that Hadjialilo would pay him an additional thirty-one dollars when he returned to the country. Warner cashed the check for $200. Two days later, he presented the $231 check to the Aldie Country Store. Syrjala testified that he did not ask Warner to return the $231 check because Warner knew that the check was \u201cbad.\u201d Warner never returned to work at Aliloo Oriental Rug Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The evidence is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Warner knew the account contained insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>funds to cover the $231 check when he presented it to the Aldie Country Store. He is not entitled to a claim of right defense because he was not entitled to the sum of $231 and the right may not be asserted against an innocent victim who does not hold the funds claimed. Finally, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements concerning two phone calls; however, upon review of the record we conclude that the error did not affect the verdict. Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
