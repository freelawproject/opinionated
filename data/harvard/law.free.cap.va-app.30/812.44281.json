Alexander (claimant) for an injury by accident which occurred on March 18,1996. On appeal, employer contends the commission erred (1) in interpreting Commission Rule 3.2 as directory rather than mandatory and, therefore, in not dismissing claimant\u2019s appeal when she failed to file a written statement; and (2) in holding that credible evidence established that claimant experienced a compensable injury by accident which prevented her from returning to work for employer. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">On March 18, 1996, while working on an assembly line in employer\u2019s chocolate manufacturing plant, claimant smelled the strong odor of bleach and experienced a \u201creal bad asthma attack\u201d for which she sought immediate medical treatment. Claimant reported to the employer\u2019s nurse, Amanda Snead, that she was experiencing shortness of breath and tightness in her chest due to the strong bleach smell. Snead ultimately sent claimant to the emergency room, where she was diagnosed as having an acute asthma attack. She received multiple medications and was told to remain home from work the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Claimant said she had smelled bleach in the plant on other occasions during her six-year employment there but that it had not been as strong as it was on March 18, 1996. Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>witnesses confirmed smelling bleach that day. Nurse Snead smelled bleach in the plant that day. Claimant\u2019s co-worker, Brenda Chambers, also smelled the strong odor of bleach and had a headache as a result of the smell. Claimant complained to her supervisor, Nora Small, who determined that the smell was emanating from a nearby trash compactor being cleaned with bleach.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Prior to March 18,1996, claimant had mild asthma for which she used an inhaler about once a year. She had not sought medical treatment for her asthma for about ten years. Following the March 18 incident, claimant saw her personal physician; on March 22, 1996, employer sent claimant to Dr. Earle Moore, the company doctor. Moore returned claimant to work, but she experienced a total of about twelve additional asthma attacks of increasing severity which were triggered by bleach, smoke or other inhalants. Dr. Moore referred her to a pulmonologist, Dr. Terrence Truitt. Dr. Truitt diagnosed her as having \u201c[e]pisodic bronchospastic symptoms consistent with occupational induced asthma in a patient with mild underlying asthma.\u201d He also noted claimant\u2019s report that cleaning solutions and dust from plant construction continued to bother her at work but that \u201cfor the most part she is fine when she is out of the work environment.\u201d He recommended that she try to wear a mask at work \u201cto help cut down on the exposure intensity\u201d and that she use her inhaler before entering the workplace each day. Claimant said the mask caused her to have more asthma attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">When exposed to bleach on the night of April 30 to May 1, 1996, claimant again went to the emergency room where she was diagnosed with reactive airway disease and told to see a specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On May 16, 1996, claimant had another asthma attack at work, and Dr. Moore excused her from work on May 17. On May 20, she was moved from \u201cthe choker pad\u201d to the back room, where she worked for two days, but she continued to have problems. On May 22, 1996, claimant had another bad asthma attack and was placed on medical leave. On May 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>1996, Dr. Moore opined that claimant\u2019s asthma was triggered by some inhalant in the plant and that, effective May 26, 1996, she could not work in an environment containing fumes, smoke or other irritants.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Dr. Truitt, who examined claimant again on February 3, 1997, opined that her pre-existing asthma was benign until her March 1996 exposure at work. He also opined that, although her subsequent symptoms were \u201cfairly well-controlled with aggressive bronchodilator and inhaled steroid therapy,\u201d she was disabled from returning to her pre-injury work environment and had been so disabled since her symptoms developed in the spring of 1996. Claimant testified that exposure to \u201cany smoke, anything, will trigger [her asthma] now\u201d and that, as a result, she \u201ccan\u2019t do nothing but stay at home.\u201d At the time of the hearing claimant was earning $80 per week by baby-sitting in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Employer offered the written opinion of Dr. John Catlett, an allergist, who reviewed claimant\u2019s records but did not examine her. Catlett opined that claimant suffered from allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis and that \u201cher main problem is allergic.\u201d He also opined that, while \u201c[o]dors at work may make her wheeze more[, they] are not the cause of her asthma.\u201d Finally, he noted that claimant had normal pulmonary function tests following her March 1996 attack and that her condition seemed to have worsened after she stopped working at employer\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The deputy commissioner held that claimant failed to prove her asthma was an occupational disease rather than an ordinary disease of life and that it could not be an injury by accident because the commission previously had held that asthma, by its very nature, results from cumulative trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Claimant timely filed a request for review by the full commission. The commission ordered claimant to file a written statement in support of her request, but she failed timely to do so. Employer moved to dismiss claimant\u2019s request for review based on her failure to file a written statement pursuant to Commission Rule 3.2. Alternatively, employer argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>that the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision should be affirmed and should provide the basis for the commission\u2019s decision. Subsequently, without mentioning employer\u2019s motion, the commission considered the appeal on the merits. It affirmed the deputy\u2019s ruling that claimant failed to prove an occupational disease but held that claimant established an ixy'ury by accident which occurred \u201c \u2018immediately\u2019 upon [her] smelling bleach that was stronger than usual.\u201d As a result, it entered an award for the requested benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Employer appealed to this Court, contending that the commission erred in failing to rule on employer\u2019s motion to dismiss. Claimant contended that the commission\u2019s failure to address the motion to dismiss constituted a ruling that Rule 3.2 is \u201cdirectory, not mandatory.\u201d However, in a memorandum opinion, we noted that \u201cthe commission seems to have adopted an opposite interpretation in previous cases ... [holding that] issues not addressed in the written statements are waived and abandoned.\u201d <em>See Russell Stover Candies v. Alexander, </em>No. 0045-98-2, 1998 WL 463454, at *1 (Va.Ct.App. Aug.11, 1998). Based on the principle that the commission should \u201chave the first opportunity to construe its own rules,\u201d we remanded to the commission \u201cwith instructions to clarify its treatment of employer\u2019s motion to dismiss and its interpretation of Rule 3.2.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On remand, the commission denied employer\u2019s motion and observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">As the Court [of Appeals] noted, the Commission may construe its own rules. The Commission\u2019s rules regarding post-hearing procedures are contained in Rules 3.1\u20143.4. Rule 3.1 addresses the requirement that parties assign specific errors in request for Review. The rule states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">Failure of a party to assign any specific error in its request for review <em>may be deemed </em>by the Commission to be a waiver of the party\u2019s right to consideration of that error. <em>The Commission may however, on its own motion, address any error and correct any decision on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number><em>review if such action is considered to be necessary for just determination of the issues.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">[emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Rule 3.2 states that written statements submitted by the parties \u201cshall address the errors assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The Commission reads Rule 3.2 in conjunction with Rule 3.1, and we conclude that while we have the authority to deem waived any assignment of error not specifically identified in the Request for Review or specifically addressed in a written statement, we retain the right to, on our own motion, \u201caddress any error and correct any decision\u201d if necessary for a just determination of the issues. Thus, the waiving of assignments of error is not automatic but is within the Commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The Commission\u2019s construction of Rule 3 is such that parties are not required to file written statements on review. The provision in Rule 3.2 stating that these statements shall address all errors assigned is directory, not mandatory. If a party requesting review does not file a written statement, the appellee may nonetheless file a written brief in support of its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The Commission is not bound by formal rules of evidence and procedure, but conducts its proceedings in a summary manner in order to most efficiently administer the Act and do justice for all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">NECESSITY OF WRITTEN STATEMENT UNDER COMMISSION RULE 3.2</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Employer contends the commission erred in interpreting Rule 3.2 to allow claimant\u2019s appeal to the full commission to proceed despite her failure to file a written statement supporting her position. It contends that the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>applies Rule 3.2 to favor claimants and that employers \u201cfacet 3 the strictest application of the rule,\u201d which violates the due process clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The commission\u2019s rules provide, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">3.1 Request for Review</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">A request for review should assign as error specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. Failure of a party to assign any specific error in its request for review may be deemed by the Commission to be a waiver of the party\u2019s right to consideration of that error. <em>The Commission may, however, on its own motion, address any error and correct any decision on review if such action is considered to be necessary for just determination of the issues.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\"># sj\u00ab %</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-9\">3.2 Written Statements</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-10\">The Commission will advise the parties of the schedule for filing brief written statements supporting their respective positions. The statements shall address all errors assigned, with particular reference to those portions of the record which support a party\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Virginia Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Rules 3.1, 3.2 (emphasis added), <em>reprinted in Virginia Court Rules and Procedure: 1994, </em>at 984-85 (West 1993). The commission revised and renumbered its rules in 1994. The quoted portion of Rule 3.1 derives from former Rule 2(A); Rule 3.2 was added in 1994. <em>See </em>Rule 2(A) (effective October 1, 1991), <em>reprinted in Virginia Court Rules and Procedure: 1993, </em>at 948 (West 1992); Rules 3.1, 3.2 (effective January 1, 1994), <em>reprinted in Virginia Court Rules and Procedure: 1994, </em>at 984-85 (West 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">We previously have held, in keeping with the commission\u2019s interpretation here, that \u201cRule [3.1] does not create an absolute requirement that parties specify [in their requests for review] each determination of fact or law to which exception is taken.\u201d <em>Seneca Falls Greenhouse &amp; Nursery v. Layton, </em>9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Va.App. 482, 484, 389 S.E.2d 184, 185-86 (1990). We also have noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">the rule must be applied equally to all parties irrespective of whether they be claimant or employer/insurer. The Fourteenth Amendment declares that all persons, including corporations, irrespective of status, are entitled to equal protection of laws. Thus, if the ... Commission imposes sanctions for the failure to follow the specific provisions of Rule [3.1] dealing with specification of exceptions, the sanctions may not be applied arbitrarily to parties based upon their position in the case or whether they are represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 389 S.E.2d at 186 (citation omitted). However, we further held in <em>Seneca Falls </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcN\">[i]f the specificity requirement of Rule [3.1] has not been applied consistently to all persons in the past, irrespective of their position, be they claimant or employer/insurer, the rule, nevertheless, should not be applied to bar Mr. Layton\u2019s appeal since we agree with the ... Commission that the provisions of Rule [3.1] at issue in this case do not require specification in all cases. In other words, these appellants were not aggrieved by the ruling of the commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 485, 389 S.E.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">We conclude that the commission\u2019s construction of Rule 3.2 in conjunction with Rule 3.1\u2019s provisions permitting the commission to address and correct, <em>sua sponte, </em>any errors of the deputy commissioner is reasonable and does not violate due process or equal protection under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>3.2 contains no express requirement that the parties either \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d file written statements. Rather, it states that the commission will notify the parties of the schedule for filing such statements and that the statements \u201cshall\u201d address all errors assigned. It does not, however, address the ramifications of failing to file a written statement, and Rule 3.1 explicitly provides that the commission may correct any errors \u201cnecessary for just determination of the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Employer contends the commission applies this provision arbitrarily, to the advantage of claimants and disadvantage of employers. It cites two decisions of the commission as examples of the supposed disparate treatment: <em>Terry v. Coe, </em>No. 171-49-16, 1996 WL 107645 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n May 30, 1996), which involved an employer\u2019s request for review, and <em>Quinones v. Guest Services, Inc., </em>No. 176-82-89, 1997 WL 1080585 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Jan. 31, 1997), which involved a claimant\u2019s request for review. We do not believe these decisions are inconsistent. In both cases, the party requesting review failed timely to file a written statement, and in both cases the commission ruled that failure constituted a waiver and abandonment of the petition for review. Finally, in both cases, despite the party\u2019s waiver, the commission reviewed the record and found no basis for reversing the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Terry, </em>1996 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>107645, at *1 (\u201cOn review, we find that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions are justified and supported by the record, and we note no error that would warrant reversal.\u201d); <em>Quinones, </em>1997 WL 1080585, at *1 n. 2 (\u201cWe have, [despite waiver], independently reviewed the entire record in the matter, and find no reason to reverse the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">We note further that the commission appears to have interpreted Rule 3.2 consistently since its adoption in 1994. In <em>Stowers v. KVAT Food Stores, Inc., </em>No. 168-39-76, 1994 WL 1038235 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Nov. 9, 1994), for example, the commission held that although Rule 3.2 provides for the submission of written statements by the parties, \u201csuch statements are not required. The Rule is directory in nature, rather than mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1. As a result, the commission \u201cdecline[d] to penalize the carrier with dismissal\u201d for the late filing of its written statement, and it reviewed the case on the merits. <em>Id.; see also Dixon v. Toano Middle Sch., </em>No. 166-32-37, 1995 WL 1063947, at *1 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Comm\u2019n Apr. 18,1995) (holding, in case in which claimant filed no written statement, that failure to file written statement \u201cshould not serve as an independent basis to dismiss the review\u201d and reviewing the case on the merits).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Finally, even assuming the commission has applied Rule 3.2 inconsistently in the past, our holding in <em>Seneca Falls </em>makes clear that inconsistent application of the rule does not require dismissal of claimant\u2019s appeal to the commission. <em>See </em>9 Va.App. at 485, 389 S.E.2d at 186. As we held above, Rule 3.2 does not mandate that a party appealing a deputy\u2019s ruling must file a timely written statement or face dismissal. Rather, as we have observed, once a request for review has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>filed, the commission may \u201caddress any error and correct any decision ... necessary for just determination of the issues,\u201d even if no written statement has been filed. Rule 3.1. Here, because we hold that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding of an ongoing disability causally related to claimant\u2019s compensable injury by accident, <em>see infra </em>\u00a7 II.B., Rules 3.1 and 3.2, read in harmony, permitted the commission to address the deputy\u2019s error to achieve a \u201cjust determination of the issues.\u201d Therefore, here, as in <em>Seneca Falls, </em>the commission did not act arbitrarily, and this employer was not aggrieved by the commission\u2019s ruling. <em>See </em>9 Va.App. at 485, 389 S.E.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">CREDIBLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT FINDING OF INJURY BY ACCIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Employer contends the commission erred in holding that claimant is entitled to ongoing temporary disability benefits because the evidence \u201csolely established a contraindication to [claimant\u2019s] returning to the workplace due to sensitivity to unknown environmental conditions at the workplace rather than an actual, ongoing disability to work.\u201d At most, it contends, she suffered from a temporary aggravation of a preexisting, ordinary disease of life and is not entitled to additional benefits. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Guided by well established principles, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, claimant in this instance. <em>See Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). \u201cIf there is evidence, or reasonable inferences can be drawn from the evidence, to support the Commission\u2019s findings, they will not be disturbed on review, even though there is evidence in the record to support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986); see Code \u00a7 65.2-706. \u201cThe actual determination of causation is a factual finding,\u201d <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Musick, </em>7 Va.App. 684, 688, 376 S.E.2d 814, 817 (1989), and \u201c[t]he testimony of a claimant may ... be considered in determining causation, especially where the medical testimony is inconclusive,\u201d <em>Dollar Gen. Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 176-77, 468 S.E.2d 152, 154-55 (1996). Further, \u201c[a] question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, supports the commission\u2019s finding that her inhalation of bleach fumes on March 18, 1996 constituted an injury by accident, which employer appears to concede. <em>See Aistrop v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., </em>181 Va. 287, 294, 24 S.E.2d 546, 549 (1943) (where disability results from inhalation of gases \u201cat a particular time and on a particular occasion which can be fixed with reasonable certainty,\u201d event is an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d). Claimant, who had mild asthma which bothered her only once a year, experienced a \u201creal bad asthma attack\u201d immediately after her exposure to the strong odor of bleach on March 18, 1996, an odor which was strong enough to be noticed by coworkers and to give one of them a headache. Claimant\u2019s attack was severe enough to cause employer\u2019s nurse to send claimant for treatment at a hospital emergency room. Although claimant\u2019s condition improved, she was able to return to work only sporadically and noted a significantly increased susceptibility to asthma resulting from exposure to various inhalants, including bleach, dust and smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Further, credible evidence supports a finding that claimant\u2019s bleach exposure on March 18, 1996 aggravated her \u201cbenign\u201d pre-existing asthma and that this work-related exposure has caused an ongoing disability preventing claimant from returning to her pre-injury employment. <em>See Ohio Valley Constr. Co. v. Jackson, </em>230 Va. 56, 58, 334 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1985) (holding that disability from industrial injury which accelerates or aggravates a pre-existing condition is compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>sable). One of claimant\u2019s treating physicians, Dr. Moore, the \u201ccompany doctor,\u201d stated expressly that claimant \u201ccan not work in an environment where there are fumes, smoke or other particulate matter in the air,\u201d and he opined that she was disabled from May 26, 1996, forward. That Dr. Moore may elsewhere have termed his work restriction a \u201crecommendation\u201d is not dispositive. In addition, Dr. Truitt, a pulmonologist who treated claimant on referral from Dr. Moore, opined that \u201ccertainly there was a precipitating element in the work environment at Russell Stover Candies that exacerbated [claimant\u2019s] previously quiescent asthma,\u201d and he \u201cstrongly advised [claimant] to avoid any and all exposure to what has previously been documented to cause significant broncho-spasm.\u201d That the record may contain contrary evidence from employer\u2019s physician, Dr. Catlett, also is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">Employer contends that claimant\u2019s case is governed by the reasoning in <em>Castle v. Westvaco Container Division, </em>No. 139-64-20, 1990 WL 752231, at *6 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 23, 1990), in which the commission held that \u201ccompensation benefits cannot be continued based on a personal susceptibility to a possible subsequent respiratory reaction if the [employee] returns to the work environment.\u201d Although we are not bound by decisions of the commission, the facts in <em>Castle </em>nevertheless are distinguishable from those here. In <em>Castle, </em>which involved an occupational disease resulting from exposure to an industrial chemical, the commission found that the employee was asymptomatic and that his pulmonary function had \u201creturned to normal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In claimant\u2019s case, by contrast, the record contains evidence that claimant\u2019s asthma has not returned to the \u201cbenign\u201d status it occupied before her injury by accident on March 18, 1996. Claimant had an average of one attack a year prior to her injury by accident; within ten weeks following that injury, she had twelve asthma attacks of increasing severity at work and required ongoing \u201caggressive bronchodilator and inhaled steroid therapy\u201d to control her symptoms even outside the workplace. Claimant testified that, prior to March 18, she was able to endure exposure to cigarette smoke and other inhalants without sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>nificant difficulty but that exposure to \u201cany smoke, anything, will trigger [her asthma] now\u201d such that she \u201ccan\u2019t do nothing but stay at home.\u201d Finally, both \u201cthe company doctor\u201d and the pulmonologist to whom he referred the claimant opined that claimant is disabled from returning to her pre-injury work environment. These facts provide sufficient credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award of disability compensation and medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\">. Although employer bases its argument on \u201cdue process,\" it relies on our holding in <em>Seneca Falls, </em>9 Va.App. at 483-85, 389 S.E.2d at 185-86, which deals expressly only with equal protection. We presume that employer is alleging a violation of substantive due process, which requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that a statute or rule be \u201c 'neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. Virginia Birth-Related. Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>242 Va. 404, 412, 410 S.E.2d 656, 661 (1991) (quoting <em>Duke v. County of Pulaski, </em>219 Va. 428, 437-38, 247 S.E.2d 824, 829 (1978)). For the reasons discussed in the text and footnotes, <em>infra, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>hold that neither the challenged rules nor the commission\u2019s application of them in this case was arbitrary or discriminatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\">. Employer contends that <em>Terry </em>is distinguishable because it also involved a request for review filed by the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund, which timely filed a written statement supporting its request. However, the Fund challenged only the admissibility and sufficiency of evidence to prove the claimant was disabled during a particular period. Employer challenged multiple additional issues, including whether the commission had jurisdiction; whether claimant's injury resulted from willful misconduct; and whether the employer had been misidentified in claimant\u2019s pleadings. Before outlining the Fund\u2019s argument,- the commission noted, despite employer\u2019s failure to file a written statement, \"that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions are justified and supported by the record\u201d and that it observed \"no error that would warrant reversal.\u201d Finally, after making these findings, the commission specifically addressed employer\u2019s misidentification argument, hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ing that, if error occurred, it was harmless. Only after making clear that it had considered employer\u2019s request for review on the merits did it advance to the error assigned by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Employer also contends that in <em>Buck v. Virginia Design Packaging Corp., </em>No. 176-16-44, 1996 WL 1076346 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Dec. 3, 1996), the commission treated a claimant who failed to file a written statement more favorably because he was unrepresented. In <em>Buck, </em>the commission held that Buck had waived any error because he failed to assign specific error under Rule 3.1 and failed to file a written statement. <em>See id. </em>at *1. It did note that it \"conducted a thorough review of the record\u201d because claimant was unrepresented. <em>See id. </em>Although- this statement may appear to favor unrepresented claimants, the commission, in fact, followed this same procedure in <em>Stowers </em>v. <em>KVAT Food Stores, Inc., </em>No. 168-39-76, 1994 WL 1038235, at *1 (Va. Workers' Comp. Comm\u2019n Nov. 9, 1994) (denying claimant\u2019s motion to dismiss and considering employer\u2019s request for review on the merits), in which a represented employer failed to file a written statement, and in <em>Kuhn v. Battlefield Painters, Inc., </em>No. 185-14-63, 1998 WL 1004174, at *1 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm'n July 6, 1998) (where corporate officer, a non-lawyer, filed written statement which was considered the unauthorized prafctice of law and, therefore, could not be considered, commission conducted \"independent review of the record\u201d), in which an unrepresented employer failed to file a written statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-5\">. As set out above, the commission may exercise its discretion in determining whether to dismiss a request for review based on failure to file a written statement as long as it does not do so \"arbitrarily ... based upon [an improper factor such as the parties\u2019] position in the case or whether they are represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Seneca Falls, </em>9 Va.App. at 485, 389 S.E.2d at 186. The commission might well be justified, for example, in dismissing a request for review based on a party\u2019s failure to file a written statement on a particularly difficult issue despite repeated orders from the commission to do so. Despite an extended review of the commission's decisions in cases in which one or both parties failed to file a written statement, we are aware of no inconsistent or arbitrary action on the part of the commission, and employer has cited no decisions which we view as arbitrary or inconsistent. <em>See Higgins v. Stanley Martin Homes, </em>No. 171-73-71, 1998 WL 1003529, at *1 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 16, 1998) (involving <em>pro se </em>claimant and represented employer, both of whom failed to file written statements); <em>Gamer v. Schmidt Baking Co., </em>No. 171-39-83, 1998 WL 1003571, at *1 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 23, 1998) (same but both parties represented); <em>Jackson v. Alexandria Transit Co., </em>No. 178-87-12, 1997 WL 1081035, at *1 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 18, 1997) (same but both parties represented). Similarly, and despite employer\u2019s claim to the contrary, we detect no arbitrary inconsistency in the commission\u2019s handling of cases in which a party files a written statement but does not discuss therein all errors previously assigned in the request for review. <em>See, e.g., Hale v. Roadway Package Sys., </em>No. 185-67-89, 1998 WL 1004045, at *2 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Aug. 3, 1998) (represented claimant); <em>Staton v.
