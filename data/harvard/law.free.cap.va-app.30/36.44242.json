Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">At about 6:00 p.m. on January 8, 1997, the police found Smith\u2019s dead body near Davenport Bridge in a rural section of Spotsylvania County. Smith had sustained shotgun wounds to the face and the left arm. The wallet in Smith\u2019s pocket contained approximately forty-two dollars. The police found no firearms or shotgun casings at the scene. Smith\u2019s burned and abandoned truck was found the following day in Caroline County.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">On the day of his death, Smith began work at around noon at his job at a CB radio and electronics shop at a truck plaza in Doswell, Virginia. Appellant, who had been staying at the truck plaza motel while his vehicle was under repair, appeared at the radio shop at about 1:00 p.m. that day. Appellant, who was familiar with Smith, asked if Smith could give him a ride. Smith was then unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Appellant returned to the shop twice more that afternoon, looking for Smith. During appellant\u2019s last visit, Smith was on the telephone ordering a CB radio for a customer. Mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Bayne, Smith\u2019s employer, asked if Smith had enough money to cover the COD order. Bayne testified, without objection, that Smith \u201clooked in his wallet and counted his money and said, Tes, I got that and then some.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smith showed his wallet to Bayne, and Bayne could see that it contained money.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bayne testified that the radio Smith had ordered cost $256.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Smith left the radio shop with appellant at about 3:00 p.m. Smith said he would be back in a few minutes, but he never returned. At 3:40 p.m., one of Smith\u2019s cousins saw Smith driving in his truck with a passenger. Smith was heading away from the truck plaza and in the direction of the residence of Hazel Gayle, appellant\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Gayle testified that appellant called her at work at 3:58 p.m. that day. Appellant said he was at her home, had broken into the gun cabinet, and intended to take her husband\u2019s shotgun. Gayle spoke with appellant until 4:10 p.m., trying to persuade him not to take the gun. Gayle arrived home at 4:35 p.m. She found the glass in the gun cabinet broken and a shotgun missing. Thomas Galbraith was working at a residence near Davenport Bridge that afternoon. At some point after 4:10, Galbraith heard the sound of two gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Between 4:40 and 4:45, Samuel Smith (Samuel), who also was Smith\u2019s cousin, saw appellant driving Smith\u2019s truck on a narrow dirt road in Hanover County. Samuel slowed down to talk to appellant and questioned appellant about the truck. Appellant said the truck belonged to Gary Smith. Samuel saw a shotgun on the seat beside appellant. Samuel challenged appellant\u2019s statement about the truck, stating that appellant knew it was not Gary Smith\u2019s truck. Appellant abruptly ended the conversation and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>At 4:55 p.m., appellant drove Smith\u2019s truck to the home of Roger Miles. At appellant\u2019s request, Miles took a ride with appellant. Miles recognized Smith\u2019s truck and asked where Smith was. Appellant said Smith had been shot and was at Davenport Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">That evening, appellant called his sister\u2019s residence and spoke with her son, Forrest Gayle (Forrest). Appellant said he had killed a man. He asked Forrest to come to the truck plaza motel and retrieve the gun. Forrest went to the motel, where he found appellant drunk. Forrest returned the shotgun to his mother\u2019s home. At that time, the gun contained no ammunition. The weapon had been loaded before it disappeared from the gun cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Later that night, appellant appeared at Gayle\u2019s residence. He arrived in a truck which Gayle did not recognize. Appellant said he had killed a man named \u201cSmith.\u201d He did not mention having done so in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Appellant was at the home of Thomas Lemonedes watching television on the night of January 10, 1997 when a news program reported that appellant was wanted for murder. Appellant said that \u201csomebody else did it\u201d and that he would surrender himself to the police the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Appellant was arrested in Louisa County on January 11, 1997. Through DNA testing, the police found that blood stains on appellant\u2019s clothing were consistent in all respects with Smith\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Testifying in his own behalf, appellant claimed that he and Smith rode in Smith\u2019s truck to Davenport Bridge on the afternoon of January 8, 1997. Appellant stated that he and Smith were negotiating the sale of a shotgun from appellant to Smith. The gun was the same one appellant had taken from his sister\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">According to appellant, he and Smith argued over the purchase price, and both men got out of the truck. Smith grabbed the barrel of the shotgun appellant was holding. Appellant jerked the gun away and pushed Smith. As Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>backed up and reached into his jacket, he threatened to kill appellant. Appellant testified that he \u201cpanicked\u201d and shot Smith with the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Appellant said that Smith had showed him a gun the previous night. Appellant testified that he thought Smith was reaching for a firearm, and he feared for his life when he shot Smith. After the shooting, appellant drove away in Smith\u2019s truck. Appellant claimed Forrest assisted him that night in burning Smith\u2019s truck and transporting him back to the motel. On cross-examination, appellant admitted he was drunk that day and did not remember encountering anyone on the road after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">After appellant testified, the defense sought to introduce orders reflecting Smith\u2019s 1991 convictions for petit larceny and the reckless handling of a firearm. Appellant contended the petit larceny conviction was admissible \u201cto impeach statements made by William Smith that he had a certain amount of money in his wallet.\u201d Appellant argued the firearm conviction was admissible to demonstrate Smith\u2019s propensity for violence. The trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objections and refused to admit the convictions into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Appellant first contends that, in light of the evidence that he acted in self-defense when he shot Smith, Smith\u2019s prior conviction for the reckless handling of a firearm was admissible to demonstrate Smith\u2019s propensity for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u2018Where the defendant claims self-defense, evidence of prior acts of violence by the victim is relevant as bearing on the reasonable apprehension which the defendant may have experienced and on the likelihood of the victim\u2019s aggressive behavior as claimed by the defendant.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 140, 142, 390 S.E.2d 204, 206 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">When admissible, such evidence bears on the questions as to who was the aggressor or what were the reasonable appre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>hensions of the defendant for his life and safety. As to the latter question, \u201c[t]he true solution is to exercise a discretion, and to admit such facts when common sense tells us that they could legitimately affect a defendant\u2019s apprehensions.\u201d As to the former, who was the aggressor, the question is what the deceased probably did, and evidence of recent acts of violence towards a third person ought to be received if \u201cso connected in time, place and circumstance with the homicide, as to likely characterize the deceased\u2019s conduct towards the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><em>Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 256, 265, 56 S.E.2d 226, 230 (1949) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The evidence offered by appellant to show Smith\u2019s propensity for violence was a record from Hanover County General District Court indicating that, on January 4, 1991, Smith was convicted of recklessly handling a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1. At the time of Smith\u2019s conviction, Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1(A) provided that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to handle recklessly any firearm so as to endanger the life, limb or property of any person. Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 491-92, 370 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1988), we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">the recklessness involved in reckless handling of a firearm may or may not equate with the \u201crecklessness\u201d involved in criminal negligence. The meaning of \u201creckless\u201d varies significantly depending on who uses it and in what circumstances. In laymen\u2019s terms, \u201creckless\u201d means \u201clacking in caution.\u201d In legal terms, the definition depends on the context; what is \u201creckless\u201d behavior in tort law may not be so construed in criminal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>In [Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1] ..., the term \u201creckless\u201d is not defined. At this point, however, we are not prepared to hold that the \u201creckless\u201d handling of a firearm is limited to a handling \u201cso gross, wanton or culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The record contains no information about the basis for Smith\u2019s 1991 conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1. The unlawful activity leading to Smith\u2019s conviction could have arisen under a myriad of circumstances, which may have involved careless, but not violent or turbulent, behavior. Indeed, Smith need not have actually discharged a firearm at a person or at property in order for him to be convicted under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Under these circumstances, in the absence of a proffer of evidence of the basis for Smith\u2019s conviction, we fail to see how the bare conviction order is evidence of Smith\u2019s prior violent or turbulent behavior. <em>Cf. Short v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 746, 747, 196 S.E.2d 79, 80 (1973) (evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior homosexual advances to a third party did not \u201cdisclose such violent and turbulent acts as to make the evidence admissible\u201d). Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to admit Smith\u2019s prior conviction of Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1 as evidence of Smith\u2019s propensity for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The Commonwealth introduced Smith\u2019s statement to Bayne to prove that, when Smith left the radio shop with appellant, Smith\u2019s wallet contained an amount of money substantially greater than the amount found on his body a few hours later. During its case-in-chief, the defense sought to introduce Smith\u2019s 1991 petit larceny conviction to impeach Smith\u2019s credibility. The trial judge refused to permit appellant to introduce this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The Commonwealth contends appellant waived his objection to the trial judge\u2019s ruling because appellant did not object to the admission of Smith\u2019s statement when the Commonwealth introduced it. As it was offered for the truth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the matter it asserted, Smith\u2019s statement clearly was hearsay. <em>See Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 445, 450, 464 S.E.2d 563, 565 (1995) <em>(en banc). </em>We find no applicable exception to the hearsay rule through which Smith\u2019s statement would have qualified for admission. However, to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver argument on appeal would be to permit the Commonwealth to benefit from its own wrong in offering the inadmissible evidence at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c\u2018No litigant ... will be permitted to approbate and reprobate \u2014 to invite error ... and then to take advantage of the situation created by his own wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manns v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 677, 680, 414 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1992) (quoting <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 403, 417, 374 S.E.2d 46, 54 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Nor do we find merit in the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that, to comply with Rule 5A:18, appellant was required to offer his impeachment evidence at the time the Commonwealth introduced Smith\u2019s statement. It is within a trial judge\u2019s discretion to permit impeachment of a witness at a time other than when the witness testifies. <em>See Mastin v. Theirjung, </em>238 Va. 434, 440, 384 S.E.2d 86, 89 (1989) (no abuse of discretion to permit introduction of impeachment evidence on rebuttal although the evidence could have been introduced in cross-examination of the witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The litigants have identified no Virginia appellate decision concerning the impeachment of a hearsay declarant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>we have found none. Several legal treatises, however, state that a hearsay declarant may be impeached in the same manner as a witness who actually appears in court. <em>See, e.g., </em>3A John Henry Wigmore, <em>Evidence in Trials at Common Law </em>\u00a7 884 (Chadbourn rev. 1970) (stating that a hearsay statement admitted in evidence is subject to \u201cimpeachment in the appropriate ways\u201d); 1 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 4-9(a) (4th ed. 1993) (opining that \u201c[a] person whose hearsay statement is admitted into evidence is subject to impeachment, though the declarant did not appear in court\u201d). Federal Rule of Evidence 806 provides in part that \u201c[w]hen a hearsay statement ... has been admitted in evidence the credibility of the declarant may be attacked ... by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.\u201d A vast majority of states have adopted similar rules. <em>See </em>Arthur Best, <em>Supplement to Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 884 (1998) (listing forty-one states with a rule of evidence the same as or similar to Fed.R.Evid. 806).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u201cWhen the testimony of a witness concerning an extrajudicial statement declared by another is offered as evidence of the truth of the thing stated, the credibility of the declarant becomes crucial to the truth-determining process.\u201d <em>Claud v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 794, 796-97, 232 S.E.2d 790, 792 (1977). Therefore, we adopt the majority rule and hold that when a hearsay statement has been admitted into evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">As a general rule, a witness may be impeached by evidence that he or she previously was convicted of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 447, 456, 345 S.E.2d 303, 308 (1986). \u201cThe Supreme Court of Virginia has recognized petit larceny as an offense involving moral turpitude.... \u201d <em>Dowell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1145, 1147, 408 S.E.2d 263, 264 (1991), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>14 Va.App. 58, 414 S.E.2d 440 (1992). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Smith\u2019s 1991 petit larceny conviction was admissible to impeach Smith\u2019s statement concerning the contents of his wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u201cBefore we adjudge an error to be harmful or harmless, we must carefully examine all the evidence. An error committed in the trial of a criminal case does not automatically require reversal of an ensuing conviction.\u201d <em>Galbraith v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 734, 742, 446 S.E.2d 633, 638 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">A nonconstitutional error is harmless if \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial that the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d \u201cAn error does not affect the verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been'the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\"><em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 692, 695, 446 S.E.2d 619, 620 (1994) (quoting <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc)). </em>\u201cAn error may be harmless because other evidence of guilt is \u2018so overwhelming and the error so insignificant by comparison that the error could not have affected the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 9, 12, 427 S.E.2d 442, 444 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Smith was shot and killed in January of 1997. He was convicted of petit larceny in 1991, when he was twenty-one years old. The remoteness in time of Smith\u2019s petit larceny conviction would have affected the conviction\u2019s tendency to diminish Smith\u2019s credibility. Moreover, in contrast to Smith\u2019s prior larceny conviction, the Commonwealth introduced testimony, without objection, from numerous witnesses who described Smith as a dependable, honest, and hardworking young man at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Smith\u2019s statement concerning the contents of his wallet was relevant only to appellant\u2019s robbery charge, as the statement tended to prove that Smith possessed more than forty-two dollars when he left the shop with appellant. By offering Smith\u2019s petit larceny conviction, appellant sought to diffuse the probative effect of Smith\u2019s statement. However, other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>evidence introduced by the Commonwealth tended to prove that Smith possessed more than forty-two dollars when he left his place of employment a short time before his death. Since noon that same day, Smith had been paid $150 in cash for a radio he owned. Smith also performed at least five radio jobs for which he would have been paid fifteen dollars each.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Furthermore, the evidence was uncontroverted that, after shooting Smith, appellant stole Smith\u2019s truck. Especially in light of appellant\u2019s subsequent efforts to conceal his taking of the vehicle, the jury could have found that appellant\u2019s taking of the truck was a sufficient basis upon which to find appellant guilty of robbery. \u201cThe violence or intimidation by which robbery is accomplished must precede or be concomitant with the taking. If the robbery is accomplished by killing the victim, it is immaterial that the victim is dead when the theft occurs.\u201d <em>Shepperson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 586, 591, 454 S.E.2d 5, 8 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We conclude that any error in excluding Smith\u2019s conviction for petit larceny was harmless. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\">. Appellant also challenges the trial judge's refusal to admit Smith's conviction of statutory burglary which, appellant conceded at oral argument, was reduced at Smith\u2019s sentencing to the misdemeanor of trespassing. Appellant did not contend at trial, as he does on appeal, that this conviction was admissible to impeach a hearsay statement of Smith. We will not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court. <em>See Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991) (citing Rule 5A:18). Accordingly, Rule 5A:18 bars our consideration of this aspect of appellant\u2019s argument on appeal. Moreover, the record does not reflect any reason to invoke the good cause or ends of justice exceptions to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. Bayne testified about Smith\u2019s statement during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. Appellant voiced no objection to this testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. The record shows that on January 8, 1997, Smith sold a CB radio to William Burkhardt for $150 in cash. Smith also worked on the electronic equipment of at least five trucks that day. Smith would have been paid fifteen dollars in cash for each job.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-9\">. For his conviction, Smith received a suspended sentence of a $100 fine and sixty days in jail. A violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1 has since been upgraded to a Class 1 misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\">. Nor do we find a basis to apply the doctrine of curative admissibility, which, \"in its broadest form, allows a party to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence when necessary to counter the effect of improper evidence previously admitted by the other party without objection.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 1, 7, 473 S.E.2d 707, 709-10 (1996) <em>(en banc). </em>\"[W]hile a trial court generally has discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, a trial court has no discretion to apply the doctrine of curative admissibility if the party seeking to invoke it intentionally failed to object to the inadmissible evidence in order to gain admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9, 473 S.E.2d at 710 (citation omitted). We find no evidence in the record that the defense intentionally failed to object to the admission of Smith\u2019s statement in order to gain the admission of Smith\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
