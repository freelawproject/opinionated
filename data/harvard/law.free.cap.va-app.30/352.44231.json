He contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress statements he made to the police. We find that the police were not interrogating the defendant when he made the statements. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The victim died of multiple gunshot wounds inflicted while he sat in his car on April 27, 1997. Redford, who sat in the front passenger seat, was also shot. Four months after the shooting, the police arrested the defendant on an unrelated charge. He initially waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and talked to the police, but then he asked for an attorney, and the questioning ceased. During the interview, the defendant mentioned that he had heard about the James Dixon murder but denied any involvement in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Five days later, the police charged the defendant with the instant offenses and obtained arrest warrants. Two detectives brought the defendant to a police interview room to execute the new warrants. They did not advise the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights because they were only planning to serve the warrants and were not planning to interrogate him. The usual police practice was to serve murder warrants in an interview room to keep the accused out of the public eye and away from distractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Once in the room, one of the detectives told the defendant that he was under arrest for the murder of James Dixon, and he began reading the warrant to the defendant. As he read, the defendant became angry and upset, interrupted the detective, and said, \u201clook, if y\u2019all want to know the truth, I am going to tell you the truth.\u201d The detective started taking notes as the defendant continued to talk about the murder. In the statements he made, the defendant admitted that he was at the scene of the shooting, but he denied shooting either victim. Neither detective asked the defendant to make a statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>asked him any questions, or made any comment about the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">If the detectives interrogated the defendant, any statements to them would be suppressed because they did not advise him of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Interrogation includes when \u201ca person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The trial court specifically found that the detectives did not question the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence of the Commonwealth supports this finding. The defendant\u2019s testimony to the contrary does not dispel the finding. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony are matters solely for the fact finder. <em>See Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986). The police did not interrogate the defendant by subjecting him to express questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Though they asked no express questions, the statements must be suppressed if the detectives\u2019 conduct was the functional equivalent of questioning. The United States Supreme Court defined \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d as \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The test is \u201c \u201cwhether an objective observer would view an officer\u2019s words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>or actions as designed to elicit an incriminating response.\u2019 \u201d <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 196, 503 S.E.2d 233, 238 (1998) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 15, 371 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1988)). If a statement is \u201cnot foreseeable, then it is volunteered.\u201d <em>Blain, </em>7 Va.App. at 15, 371 S.E.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We conclude that there was no functional equivalent of questioning. The detective stated the charges and began reading the warrant. They were unprepared to record or memorialize any statements. They did not have a tape recorder, a video camera, or even a notepad. The detective, who made notes once the defendant began talking, had to write on paper he retrieved from the defendant\u2019s file folder. Their actions were not \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The room where the detectives executed the warrants did not, by itself, constitute a functional equivalent of interrogation. It was common for detectives to serve warrants in an interview room. Even if it amounted to \u201csubtle compulsion,\u201d as the defendant argues, an interview room was not reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses. Neither did it create a situation that the detectives should have known would produce incriminating responses. <em>See id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">No evidence suggests that the detectives anticipated the defendant would react by making statements. Their sole purpose was to execute the new warrants. Interrogation does not include \u201cwords or actions by the police which are normally attendant to arrest and custody.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 743, 746, 348 S.E.2d 9, 12 (1986). <em>Accord Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 603-04, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990); <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 360, 416 S.E.2d 669, 672-73 (1992) (when law enforcement\u2019s stated purpose of encounter with defendant is entirely legitimate, to obtain forensic samples, and they did not deviate from that purpose, there was no \u201cinterrogation\u201d (citing <em>Miranda </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The detectives did not interrogate the defendant either by asking express questions or by actions that were the functional equivalent to express questions. When the defendant volunteered statements to them, they were not required to ignore what they were hearing. <em>See Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 453, 423 S.E.2d 360, 365 (1992). The trial court did not err when it denied the motion to suppress the statements. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">[T]he Court doesn\u2019t have any problem with the case. The Court doesn't believe the police officers or the detectives asked any questions. It's not unusual to take them back in the interview room to serve them with warrants to keep them out of the public eye and for distraction. So, they took him back there, were reading warrants to him, and he started talking and the detectives listened to him a few minutes, took out his pad and wrote it down. To suppress this would be ridiculous. Here\u2019s a free statement given by an individual without any interrogation. And to say that that would not be admissible is contrary to common sense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b401-6\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AdB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Detective David E. Burt testified at trial that he was the chief homicide investigator of the murder of James Dixon, which occurred April 27, 1997. During the course of his investigation, he \u201cdeveloped Tavario Gates as a suspect,\u201d and he \u201carrest[ed] Gates on August 28, 1997.\u201d Detective Burt testified that after he read Miranda. warnings to Gates, the following events occurred during a lengthy custodial interrogation in the detective division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">Q Did he decide to waive those rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">A Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">Q What did you ask him and what did he tell you about this murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">A He denied any involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">Q Were you specific when you were talking about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">A Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">Q He said what exactly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">A He stated that he didn\u2019t know anything about, he had heard about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">Q But, he didn\u2019t know anything about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-19\">A Didn\u2019t know anything about it or who done it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">Q Did you see him five days later on September the 3rd, 1997?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-22\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Q Were you giving him some papers that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">A Yes, I was.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The evidence also proved that during the questioning on August 28, which lasted an hour, Gates attempted to terminate the questioning by requesting a lawyer. His initial request was ignored. Only after he made a second request for a lawyer was the interview terminated. At the suppression hearing, Detective Burt testified that although he had given Gates the <em>Miranda </em>warnings on August 28 and had questioned Gates, he was not present in the room when Gates requested a lawyer. However, before September 3, Detective Burt learned from another detective that Gates had requested a lawyer during the August 28 interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Several days after the August 28 interrogation, Detective Burt secured a warrant charging Gates with the murder of Dixon. Detective Burt testified that on September 3, he called the jail and arranged to have Gates transferred from the jail so that he could serve arrest warrants on Gates concerning the Dixon matter. Detective Burt testified that he did not serve the arrest warrant on Gates in the jail or in the detention center because he wanted to use \u201can area that was more comfortable for both of us, for [Gates] and [Burt].\u201d He decided to serve the warrants in the detective division. Detective Burt acknowledged, however, that taking a jailed prisoner to the detective division posed security problems. He testified that two detectives were present for the serving of the warrant because \u201cwe do have policies and procedures about bringing prisoners into our detective division. We have civilian personnel down there and we make all efforts to keep them safe.\u201d Despite those safety concerns, Detective Burt intended to take Gates to the room where the detectives first interrogated Gates on August 28, when Gates had twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>requested a lawyer before the interview was stopped. Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s finding, neither detective testified that this was done to shield Gates, who was then a prisoner, from the public eye or from embarrassment of being served in public with a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Detective Woody testified that the city jail personnel delivered Gates to \u201cthe detention center ... in the city lock up.\u201d He and Detective Burt then took Gates, who was handcuffed, \u201cinside the detective division to the interview room.\u201d They saw that the interview room was occupied and then took Gates \u201cto another room that was back in the back.\u201d When Detective Woody was asked whether this happened on many occasions, he responded, \u201cI have done it on many occasions, yes.\u201d However, Detective Woody also testified he had no knowledge that Gates had said on August 28 that he wanted a lawyer and did not want to talk to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Detective Burt testified that as he began \u201cfilling out\u201d and reading the arrest warrants, Gates became angry. Then the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">[Gates] made a statement to the fact that he was tired of me keep coming and asking him to come down from the jail. He said I told /all before I ain\u2019t have nothing else to say. And, he was \u2014 began to become angry. And, as I began to fill out the warrant itself he stated, you know, what are these for? And, I told him that they are additional arrest warrants. I explained that to him and I began to read them to him at that time. And, then he began to interrupt me and stated, look, if /all want to know the truth I am going to tell you the truth. So, as I continued to execute the warrant that\u2019s when he began to make a statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Detective Burt testified that he \u201cgrabbed a couple of sheets of paper ... in [a] folder and began to write\u201d as Gates talked about the Dixon incident. Detective Burt also testified that as Gates was talking another detective entered the room and said he had \u201cadditional charges, charges perhaps capital murder on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Citing <em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988), and <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), Gates correctly asserts that when he exercised his right to counsel during the August interrogation, he was protected from further interrogation or \u201ctalks\u201d initiated by the police unless his counsel was present. In <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthat an accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d 451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880. The Court in <em>Roberson </em>held that <em>Edwards </em>applies even when the police interrogate an accused who has invoked his or her right to counsel and the interrogation concerns an investigation separate from the initial interrogation. <em>See Roberson, </em>486 U.S. at 682-85, 108 S.Ct. 2093. The Court explained that <em>Edwards </em>is violated even if the police recite the <em>Miranda </em>warning before subsequent interrogations, <em>see Roberson, </em>486 U.S. at 686, 108 S.Ct. 2093, and even if the accused fails to meet with his or her attorney, <em>see Minnick v. Mississippi, </em>498 U.S. 146, 153, 111 S.Ct. 486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489 (1990). Simply put, the police \u201cmay not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The record clearly establishes that Gates did not initiate the meeting where he made his statement and his lawyer was not present. Instead, at the behest of Detective Burt, Gates was taken to the interrogation room in handcuffs and under guard. Therefore, <em>Edwards </em>bars the admission of Gates\u2019 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The Commonwealth argues, however, that Gates\u2019 statement is admissible because Gates was not induced by interrogation to make the statement. Indeed, Detective Burt testified repeatedly that he did not intend to ask Gates questions. However, not only does this argument fail to address <em>Edwards </em>and its progeny, it overlooks the fact that the intent of the investigating officer is irrelevant. \u201cA requirement of actual proof that \u2018questioning ... was intended or designed to produce an incriminating response\u2019 ... is contrary to the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>preme Court\u2019s admonition that the definition of interrogation \u2018focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 196, 503 S.E.2d 233, 237 (1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Furthermore, I disagree with the proposition that what transpired in the interrogation room was not interrogation or its functional equivalent. The standard we must apply regarding interrogation is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">[T]he <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\"><em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he concern of the Court in <em>Miranda </em>was that the \u2018interrogation environment\u2019 created by the interplay of interrogation and custody would \u2018subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner\u2019 and thereby under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>mine the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 457-58, 86 S.Ct. 1602). The Court then referenced several police interrogation techniques that <em>Miranda </em>was specifically designed to address and described these practices as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aru\">The police practices that evoked ... concern [in <em>Miranda </em>] included several that did not involve express questioning. For example, one of the practices discussed in <em>Miranda </em>was the use of line-ups in which a coached witness would pick the defendant as the perpetrator. This was designed to establish that the defendant was in fact guilty as a predicate for further interrogation. A variation on this theme discussed in <em>Miranda </em>was the so-called \u201creverse line-up\u201d in which a defendant would be identified by coached witnesses as the perpetrator of a fictitious crime, with the object of inducing him to confess to the actual crime of which he was suspected in order to escape the false prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\"><em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (citations omitted). Because of the Supreme Court\u2019s concern with such practices, it has consistently held that \u201ccustodial interrogation for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>includes both express questioning and words or actions that ... the officer knows or reasonably should know are likely to \u2018have ... the force of a question on the accused,\u2019 and therefore be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 601, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990) (citation omitted); <em>see Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The technique used by Detective Burt to extract Gates\u2019 statement is substantially similar to those described in <em>Innis. </em>The technique is founded on the understanding that an accused, when presented with accusations that he or she committed a crime, is likely to make a statement with the goal of either mitigating or rationalizing his or her guilt. In making a statement, however, the accused often provides information which, when viewed in context with information obtained by police from other sources, may prove the accused guilty. By moving Gates to the same area where Gates was previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>interrogated, informing Gates that he was being charged with murder, and mentioning in Gates\u2019 presence that other charges, including capital murder, could be brought against Gates, the detective\u2019s procedure had the same effect as the \u201creverse lineups\u201d discussed in <em>Miranda </em>and noted in <em>Innis. </em>The effect was to place Gates in an interrogation setting similar to the previous session where he was twice required to demand an attorney. The procedure invoked Gates\u2019 ire and led to the exploitation of his ire.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The record clearly establishes that the detectives had no administrative reason to take Gates from the jail to a room in the back part of the detective division to serve an arrest warrant on him. Detective Burt was not the person who fingerprinted or photographed arrestees. No evidence proved that those functions occurred in the detective division. When the sheriffs department delivered Gates from the jail to the city \u201clock up,\u201d Gates was in a place where serving the warrant was convenient. No evidence proved the \u201clock up\u201d was a place in the \u201cpublic eye.\u201d Furthermore, safety issues militated against moving Gates from the \u201clock up.\u201d Detective Burt had to take the precaution of having another detective with him because of the security concern that arises from taking a jailed person into the detective division of the police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Clearly, Detective Burt wanted to \u201ctalk\u201d to Gates in a setting that was \u201ccomfortable.\u201d He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">Q You took him down, you had the warrants charging him with the murder of James Dixon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Q And, you had to do some paperwork, fingerprinting, and other associated police business in order to serve the warrants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">A Well, the booking process, fingerprinting, photographing, is actually done by the sheriffs department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Q You still had some \u2014 you had to talk to him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-13\">Q \u2014a little bit about some \u2014 not about the case but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>A I had had all this information from a previous situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Q Okay. You took him back to an interview room to do some, some work; did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Q And, Mr. Gates became upset when you told him he had been charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">A That\u2019s correct, he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Detective Burt knew that Gates had been interrogated in the detective division for an hour on August 28 about the Dixon murder and other issues. He knew Gates had invoked his right to counsel. Indeed, the record indicates that when Gates was first questioned, Gates twice had to ask for a lawyer before the police honored his request and ceased the interrogation. Taking Gates from the jail to a back room in the detective division to be in a \u201ccomfortable\u201d place to \u201ctalk\u201d without the presence of his attorney cannot be justified by any administrative needs of the police. When Detective Burt had Detective Woody accompany him as he attempted to \u201ctalk\u201d to Gates about \u201call this information from a previous situation,\u201d he employed a \u201cpractice [that was] ... designed to elicit an incriminating response from the accused.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02 n. 7, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">In the absence of any administrative justification for the detective\u2019s actions, I would hold that Detective Burt should have reasonably expected that his \u201cactions ... [would] likely ... \u2018have ... the' force of [an interrogation] on [Gates],\u2019 and therefore be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. 2638 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court explicitly has held that \u201cthe purpose behind [the] decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards ... </em>[was to prevent] government officials from using the coercive nature of confinement to extract confessions that would not be given in an unrestrained environment.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Mauro, </em>481 U.S. 520, 529-30, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 95 L.Ed.2d 458 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Because the detective improperly initiated these \u201ctalks\u201d and Gates\u2019 statements were made in response to the \u201cfunctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>equivalent\u201d of police interrogation, the statements should have been suppressed. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. Detective Burt\u2019s testimony clearly establishes that after Gates was arrested on August 28, he questioned Gates concerning the murder of Dixon.
