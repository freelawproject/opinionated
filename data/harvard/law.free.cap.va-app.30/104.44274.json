Johnson\u2019s application for disability benefits. On this appeal from the circuit court\u2019s review, Johnson contends the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>erred in ruling that the record contains substantial evidence to support the Retirement System\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">For nineteen years, Barbara W. Johnson was employed as an elementary school teacher by the Lancaster County School Board. She resigned from her. position in July 1996 and applied to the Retirement System for regular disability retirement benefits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-156. Johnson\u2019s application indicated she suffered from hypertension and related medical problems that became aggravated when she was in the classroom. Attached to her application was a report from Dr. Norman R. Tingle, Jr., her physician, which indicated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">[Johnson] remains relatively anxious and hypertensive, but is doing pretty well on her medications____ She plans not to go back to work. I recommend that. I think it is too stressful. Her blood pressure is clearly made worse by the stress at work. In that regard, she is \u2019applying for early disability and I have completed a note today suggesting that she go ahead and early retire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Denying the application, the Retirement System informed Johnson that the medical board had reviewed the application and recommended denying it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-124.23. The medical board noted, \u201c[t]here is no evidence of end-organ impairment from her hypertension ... and generally in such cases, more focused treatment of the blood pressure gives control.\u201d Johnson appealed the decision and submitted additional evidence, including a chart of her blood pressure readings for eighteen months and a letter from Dr.,Tingle. In his letter, Dr. Tingle disclosed the medication Johnson was taking and stated, \u201cher blood pressure is stable now, but she is not working and I recommended that she not do that.\u201d The medical board requested that Johnson submit to an independent medical examination by Dr. Kenneth C. Griffith, a cardio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>vascular specialist, and sent Dr. Griffith a copy of the records it had received from Johnson and Dr. Tingle.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">After examining Johnson, Dr. Griffith reported to the medical board that Johnson has \u201cpoorly controlled\u201d blood pressure and \u201chas been treated with several different agents but apparently has been treated one at a time and never in combination.\u201d While noting that the \u201cdocumentation as to the medical regimen which [Johnson] has been under is somewhat limited,\u201d Dr. Griffith\u2019s report contained references to Johnson\u2019s current medication, \u201cJohnson\u2019s own account\u201d of her medicines, and Dr. Tingle\u2019s letter noting the types of medication he had prescribed. In concluding his lengthy report, Dr. Griffith stated the following disposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">I am not quite certain why this lady takes Codeine twice a day and I am not quite certain if she has any reason for suspecting that her symptomatology is related to her hypertension. She seems to have a lot of symptoms that are much more likely to be anxiety symptoms than hypertensive. She has uncontrolled hypertension but I do not think it has been at all demonstrated that she has ever been on a regimen of medications which might reasonably be suspected to control difficult hypertension. It may well be that she has a disabling anxiety condition, it may be that she potentially has disabling hypertension if it were demonstrated that the patient\u2019s current level of pressure was the best that could be attained by multi-drug therapy, but as of the present moment I do not see that in my professional opinion that disabling hypertension has been demonstrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On December 2, 1996, the Retirement System again denied Johnson\u2019s application. It informed Johnson that, after reviewing Dr. Griffith\u2019s report, the medical board recommended denying the application because Johnson had not proved a \u201cpermanently disabling illness.\u201d Johnson then submitted further, more current medical reports from Dr. Tingle, who noted Johnson\u2019s continuing elevated blood pressure, described the medication she was receiving, and reported that she had been examined by Dr. Anthony Giordano because of hearing problems she was experiencing. On December 18, 1996, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Retirement System denied Johnson\u2019s further application. Although Johnson\u2019s \u201csingle antihypertensive medication has been increased,\u201d the medical board found, \u201c[t]here is still no evidence with the use of approved methods of treating blood pressure, including multiple drugs, that her blood pressure cannot be quite satisfactorily controlled\u201d and \u201c[t]here is still no evidence of permanent disability from hypertension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Johnson requested a fact finding hearing, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 9-6:14.12, and informed the Retirement System that she had \u201ca new doctor.\u201d Johnson also supplied additional records from Dr. Tingle, Dr. Giordano, Dr. John Deschamps, an internist, and Dr. William G. Ryan, an optometrist. At the hearing, Johnson testified extensively concerning her difficulties at school and at home. The notes from Dr. Tingle reported that on January 21, 1997, he increased Johnson\u2019s medication for hypertension and that her blood pressure had decreased when she returned two weeks later. Dr. Deschamps reported that on his examination of March 24, 1997, Johnson said she had experienced blood pressure problems \u201cfor at least seven years,\u201d and he noted the various medicines she had taken. He diagnosed hypertension and \u201canxiety with some stress component,\u201d and he \u201cstreamline[d]\u201d Johnson\u2019s medications. When Johnson returned to Dr. Deschamps two weeks later, he noted that her blood pressure \u201cis much better controlled.\u201d However, Dr. Deschamps\u2019 medical report stated that Johnson\u2019s \u201cfeeling is that she can no longer effectively teach her classes\u201d and that he \u201cdo[es] not foresee her being able to continue her work as a teacher because of the responsibility that that requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In its review of the doctors\u2019 reports, the medical board noted that \u201cDr. Deschamps indicate[s] that [Johnson\u2019s] pressure was eventually satisfactorily controlled with the recording 130/80,\u201d that Dr. Ryan reports Johnson\u2019s \u201cvision is corrected at 20/20 in each eye with lenses,\u201d and that Dr. Giordano reports Johnson needs no further treatment for her hearing problem. The medical board concluded that Johnson\u2019s \u201chypertension is now satisfactorily controlled\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no evidence of a permanently disabling condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Based on his review of Johnson\u2019s testimony and the medical evidence, the hearing officer found that Johnson did not fully satisfy the statutory requirements of Code \u00a7 51.1-156. Noting the report from Dr. Deschamps, which established that under his medication regimen Johnson\u2019s blood pressure is now \u201cbetter controlled,\u201d the hearing officer found that Johnson had not established a permanent disabling condition. The hearing officer further stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">While Ms. Johnson may not be ready to resume the responsibility of a teacher at this time and has shown as much, she has not satisfied the requirement of the code that her condition is likely to be permanent. Hypertension is permanent, but it may be controlled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Upon review of the hearing officer\u2019s decision, the Retirement System informed Johnson that \u201c[t]he medical evidence has not proved that your incapacity is \u2018likely to be permanent\u2019 \u201d and denied her application for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">On appeal to the circuit court, Johnson contended that the \u201cfindings of fact ... are not based upon substantial evidence\u201d and that she had sufficiently demonstrated permanent physical incapacity from work. Finding that the \u201crecord contains conflicting medical testimony from reputable physicians,\u201d the trial judge ruled he \u201ccannot conclude ... it would be necessarily unreasonable to accept the opinion of one to the exclusion of the others.\u201d Basing his decision upon the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, the trial judge affirmed the agency\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The standard of review applicable to this appeal is governed by the Administrative Process Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. Applying the Act, we have ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">In reviewing an agency decision, \u201c[t]he scope of court review of a litigated issue under the APA is limited to determination [of] whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record to support the decision.\u201d The substantial evidence standard is \u201cdesigned to give great stability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>finality to the fact-findings of an administrative agency.\u201d A trial court may reject the findings of fact \u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d The burden of proof rests upon the party challenging the agency determination to show that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><em>Smith v. Dept. of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy, </em>28 Va.App. 677, 684-85, 508 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1998) (citations omitted). <em>See also Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983). Although \u201c[substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla,\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938) (cited in <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. at 269, 308 S.E.2d at 125), we have held, nonetheless, that this standard of review requires courts to give great deference to the agency\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">The determination of an issue of fact is to be made solely on the basis of the whole evidentiary record provided by the agency and the reviewing court is limited to that agency record. \u201cA reviewing court may not, however, use its review of an agency\u2019s procedures as a pretext for substituting its judgment for the agency on factual issues decided by the agency.\u201d A reviewing court \u201cmust review the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the [agency\u2019s] action,\u201d and \u201ctake due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 263, 369 S.E.2d 1, 18-19 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Based on the medical evidence in this record, a \u201creasonable mind\u201d certainly could find that the evidence did not prove Johnson\u2019s condition was likely to be permanent. The record contains a report from Dr. Griffith noting that Johnson had been given an insufficient medical regimen for controlling hypertension. Indeed, when Johnson began treatments with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Dr. Deschamps, he adjusted her medication and reported \u201cher [blood pressure] is much better controlled at 130/80.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">By statute, the medical board is empowered to review reports of medical examinations, to investigate health and medical statements submitted in connection with disability applications, and to report its conclusions and recommendations to VRS. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-124.23(B). The medical board examined all of the medical reports, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E), including the reports of Drs. Tingle, Deschamps, and Griffith, and found persuasive the opinion of Dr. Griffith. The hearing officer received the medical board\u2019s recommendations and likewise found unpersuasive medical reports of Johnson\u2019s permanent incapacity. The Retirement System upheld that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The trial judge noted that \u201c[t]his record contains conflicting medical testimony from reputable physicians\u201d and ruled that he \u201ccannot conclude that it would be necessarily unreasonable to accept the opinion of one to the exclusion of the others.\u201d In other agency cases, we have ruled that \u201c \u2018[a] question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>WLR Foods v. Cardoso, </em>26 Va.App. 220, 230, 494 S.E.2d 147, 152 (1997) (citation omitted). We have also observed that \u201c[t]he deference that we give to the [agency\u2019s] fact finding on medical questions is based upon the \u2018unwisdom of an attempt by ... [courts] uninitiated into the mysteries [of the medical science debate] to choose between conflicting expert medical opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stancill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>15 Va.App. 54, 58, 421 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1992) (citation omitted). Those principles are applicable in the context of this case. Accordingly, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Relying on the \u201ctreating physician rule\u201d in federal disability cases, <em>see e.g., Coffman v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 514, 517 (4th Cir.1987) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), Johnson additionally argues that the Retirement System should be required to give greater weight to Dr. Tingle\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>We find no basis in Code \u00a7 9-6.14.17 to require the Retirement System to adopt such a rule. By statute, the Retirement System is required to \u201cemploy a Medical Board of four physicians[,] who [serve four-year terms and] are not eligible to participate in the Retirement System,\u201d to review the medical reports and make recommendations to the Retirement System. Code \u00a7 51.1-124.23. Thus, the legislature has designated in the basic law a neutral evaluatory mechanism for the Retirement System to gather and analyze medical opinions and reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Furthermore, we note that even if such a rule were in place, the result in this case would be no different. The Supreme Court applies the following rule in Workers\u2019 Compensation cases where there is conflicting medical evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">The general rule is that when an attending physician is positive in his diagnosis of a disease, great weight will be given by the courts to his opinion. However, when it appears ... that the diagnosis is shaded by doubt, and there is medical expert opinion contrary to the opinion of the attending physician, then the trier of the fact is left free to adopt that view which is most consistent with reason and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Bristol Builders\u2019 Supply Co. v. McReynolds, </em>157 Va. 468, 471, 162 S.E. 8, 9 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The record in this case contains conflicting medical opinions on the issue of whether Johnson \u201chas ever been on a regimen of medications which might reasonably ... control difficult hypertension.\u201d The hearing officer found Dr. Griffith\u2019s opinion to be more credible. Furthermore, the most recent reports from Johnson\u2019s physicians demonstrate that her blood pressure was being controlled. Relying upon the recommendations of the medical board and the hearing officer, the Retirement System found that Johnson had failed to establish that her incapacity is \u201clikely to be permanent,\u201d Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E), and denied Johnson\u2019s claim. Substantial evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the record supports that finding. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
