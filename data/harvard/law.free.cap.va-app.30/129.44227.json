Williams (claimant) for injuries incurred on employer\u2019s premises as claimant was returning to work at the end of his lunch break after having smoked cigarettes during that break while seated in a car parked on employer\u2019s parking lot. Although the parties debate whether the personal comfort doctrine required such award, we view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the pivotal issue to be simply whether the commission correctly ruled that claimant was injured in the course of his employment. There are no significant disagreements with the facts contained in the commission\u2019s opinion. For the following reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Claimant worked for employer as an assistant mailing machine operator. On November 21, 1997, he was working the 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shift. When the machine operator called for a break, claimant ate lunch in employer\u2019s cafeteria, located within employer\u2019s building. The lunch break lasted thirty minutes, and claimant ate quickly in order to have time to smoke cigarettes before returning to work. Although employer prohibited smoking inside the building, employer had no general prohibition against smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Claimant stated that he is addicted to smoking and that he went outside every night to smoke after eating his lunch. Because it was raining on November 21, 1997, claimant went to a friend\u2019s car parked on the company parking lot to smoke inside the car. The parking lot is part of employer\u2019s premises. The lot is enclosed by a fence, and access is controlled by employer\u2019s security guards. The general public has no right to use the lot. At no time did claimant leave the company parking lot. At the conclusion of the lunch break, after smoking two cigarettes, claimant attempted to return to work. Because he was late returning to work, or because it was raining, claimant ran back to the main entrance. As he was hurrying up the wet and slippery concrete steps on the way to his place of work, claimant slipped and fell, injuring his knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Employer places no restrictions on employees regarding where they go or what they do during lunch breaks. Employees are allowed to perform personal errands, and they are not prohibited from going out into the parking lot during breaks. Employer does not pay employees for the time spent on the lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The deputy commissioner held that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment and awarded wage loss and medical benefits. The commission agreed and, while finding that claimant\u2019s need to smoke fell within the personal comfort doctrine, the commission also specifically found that claimant\u2019s habit was satisfied \u201cin a manner and <em>at a place reasonably expected by his employer, without undertaking any unreasonable or unnecessary risk or danger.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The personal comfort doctrine, as applied to workers\u2019 compensation claims, in theory has general acceptance among the authorities.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">Employees who, within the time and space limits of their employment, engage in acts which minister to personal comfort do not thereby leave the course of employment, unless the extent of the departure is so great that an intent to abandon the job temporarily may be inferred, or unless, in some jurisdictions, the method chosen is so unusual and unreasonable that the conduct cannot be considered an incident of the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">2 Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>ch. 21, p. 21-1 (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Virginia Supreme Court has approved the \u201cpersonal comfort and convenience\u201d doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">It is uniformly held that \u201c[a]n injury sustained by an employee while engaged in the performance of an act essential to his personal comfort and convenience, but ultimately for the benefit of the employer, is compensable as \u2018arising out of and \u2018in the course of the employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-10\"><em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 336, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>We neither approve nor disapprove of the commission\u2019s finding that smoking is included in the personal comfort doctrine. Because we agree with that part of the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, we need not decide the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In <em>Jones v. Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, </em>10 Va.App. 521, 392 S.E.2d 848 (1990)(en banc), we affirmed the principle that once an employee is on the employer\u2019s premises with the intent to begin his or her services for the employer, injuries occurring thereon may be compensable. <em>See id. </em>at 523-24, 392 S.E.2d at 850.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201c[Ejmployment includes not only the actual doing of the work, but a reasonable margin of time and space necessary to be used in passing to and from the place where the work is to be done. If the employee be injured while passing, with the express or implied consent of the employer, to or from his work by a way over the employer\u2019s premises, or over those of another in such proximity and relation as to be in practical effect a part of the employer\u2019s premises, the injury is one arising out of and in the course of the employment as much as though it had happened while the employee was engaged in his work at the place of its performance. In other words, the employment may begin in point of time before the work is entered upon and in point of space before the place where the work is to be done is reached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>Brown v. Reed, </em>209 Va. 562, 565, 165 S.E.2d 394, 397 (1969) (quoting <em>Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, </em>276 U.S. 154, 158, 48 S.Ct. 221, 72 L.Ed. 507 (1928)). <em>See </em>1 Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 13.01. This principle applies equally to injuries sustained by an employee on the employer\u2019s premises when returning to work from a designated meal break. <em>See Prince v. Pan American World Airways, </em>6 Va.App. 268, 272, 368 S.E.2d 96, 97-98 (1988) (finding a compensable injury where the claimant was injured when she slipped on the walkway leading to the building where she worked as she was returning to work from her lunch break).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">During his entire lunch period, claimant remained on employer\u2019s premises and was injured on those premises as he attempted to return to perform defined services for employer. There is no evidence in this record from which we could conclude that employer disapproved of claimant using his free time to smoke while remaining on employer\u2019s premises, so long as it did not occur within the building where claimant performed his services for employer. Virginia has not declared smoking to be illegal, and claimant was not injured while committing a dangerous or unreasonable act.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">For employer to prevail in this appeal, it had to prove that claimant\u2019s actions were so unreasonable and dangerous that it could reasonably be inferred that claimant intended to abandon his job when he elected to smoke inside a car parked on employer\u2019s private parking lot. <em>See Wyle v. Professional Servs. Indus., Inc., </em>12 Va.App. 684, 688, 406 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1991) (holding that an employer has the burden of proving an affirmative defense). <em>See, e.g., American Safety Razor Co. v. Hunter, </em>2 Va.App. 258, 262, 343 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1986) (\u201cAn employee may abandon his employment by reaching an advanced state of intoxication which renders the employee incapable of engaging in his duties.\u201d). Employer did not meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Employer concedes that if claimant had gone to his car only to eat lunch, he would be entitled to the benefits awarded by the commission. Thus, employer would necessarily urge us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>hold that if two employees at the same time went to the same place, and one ate lunch while the other smoked, and then, upon their respective returns to the actual work place, each fell on the same slippery steps, the diner would recover for his injury while the smoker would be barred. We rejected a similar analogy in <em>Jones, </em>and we respectfully decline to make such a distinction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">For the reasons stated, we affirm that portion of the commission\u2019s opinion holding that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment and entitling him to the award made.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\">. Professor Larson includes \"smoking\u201d as an incidental act of employment, along with resting, washing, seeking fresh air, coolness and warmth. <em>See </em>Larson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 21.04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-12\">.

Anderson, </em>48 Scot.
