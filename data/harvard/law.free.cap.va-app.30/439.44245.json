We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">In October, 1997, Boone was adjudicated an habitual offender. This adjudication was based on two convictions of driving while his license was suspended for failure to pay fines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and costs, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-395, and one conviction of driving while his license was suspended for failure to submit an insurance certificate or pay the uninsured motorist\u2019s fee, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-706. In February, 1998, Boone petitioned the trial court for reinstatement of his driving privileges, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). The Commonwealth argued that Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) did not apply, because one of Boone\u2019s predicate convictions was for driving without insurance, a conviction not set out in Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C). The trial court held that Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) did apply and granted Boone\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Any person who has been found to be an habitual offender, where the determination or adjudication was based entirely upon convictions as set out in subdivision 1 c of [Code] \u00a7 46.2-351, may, after payment in full of all outstanding fines, costs and judgments relating to his determination, and furnishing proof of financial responsibility, if applicable, petition the court in which he was found to be an habitual offender, or the circuit court in the political subdivision in which he then resides, for restoration of his privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C), in effect at the time Boone filed his petition, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cThis section shall apply only where the conviction resulted from a suspension or revocation ordered pursuant to (i) [Code] \u00a7 46.2-395 for failure to pay fines and costs, (ii) [Code] \u00a7 46.2-549 for failure to furnish proof of financial responsibility, or (in) [Code] \u00a7 46.2-417 for failure to satisfy a judgment....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) and 46.2-361(C) must be read together. To be utilized as a predicate conviction for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>of Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B), a conviction must fall within one of the classes specified in Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C). No other class of conviction can invoke the application of Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). <em>See Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>28 Va.App. 781, 786-87, 508 S.E.2d 916, 919 (1999). Boone\u2019s conviction for operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended for failure to submit an insurance certificate or pay the uninsured motorist\u2019s fee, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-706, is not specified as a predicate conviction in Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C). Thus, his habitual offender adjudication, based on that conviction, does not fall within the application of Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). <em>See id. </em>at 786, 508 S.E.2d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In its opinion, the trial court stated, \u201cInterpreting the statute as DMV urges would require an interpretation that deems Mr. Boone\u2019s conviction arising from a failure to submit a certificate of insurance and pay the uninsured fee the equivalent of a conviction for voluntary manslaughter or for maiming while driving under the influence.\u201d However, this result is prohibited by Code \u00a7 46.2-361(A), which explicitly denies application \u201cwhen such ... adjudication was also based, in part ... on a conviction as set out in subdivision 1 b of [Code] \u00a7 46.2-351.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The 1998 amendment to Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C) changed the provision \u201cthis section shall apply only where the conviction resulted ...\u201d to \u201cthis section shall apply only where the conviction <em>or convictions </em>resulted....\u201d Boone argues that the pre-amendment statute, which governs this case, should be read to permit the application of Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) if at least one of the convictions underlying the habitual offender determination is embraced by Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C). He argues that the amendment evinces a legislative intent to change the law by restricting the availability of relief under Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Ordinarily, a statutory change will be deemed to bespeak a legislative intent to change the law. However, that rule does not apply where the change is plainly intended to clarify the meaning of the existing statute. <em>See Boyd v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 16, 20-21, 215 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1975). The plain purpose of Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C), before its amendment, was to define each underlying conviction that could serve to invoke Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). The amendment merely clarified that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\">. The legislature amended Code \u00a7 46.2-361 effective July, 1998. Because Boone\u2019s petition was filed in February, 1998, we consider the statute as it was in effect at the commencement of the proceedings. The 1998 amendment inserted \"or convictions as set out in subdivision 1 c of \u00a7 46.2-351.\u201d 1998 Va. Acts, c. 749.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
