Husband contends the court erred in holding that the assets at issue, which had been divided into separate shares pursuant to the terms of a revocable <em>inter vivos </em>trust agreement, constituted separate property and, accordingly, were not subject to equitable distribution under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. For reasons set forth below, we agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Husband and wife married on September 1, 1990. On June 26, 1991, the parties entered jointly into a Revocable Living Trust Agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). The Agreement was executed at the same time as the parties\u2019 wills and formed a part of their estate plan. The relevant provisions of the Agreement follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The Agreement created two separate and distinct trusts, one for each spouse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Agreement designated husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>and wife as both \u201cGrantors\u201d and \u201cTrastees\u201d and stated as its purpose to \u201cprovide for the management of the Grantors\u2019 assets during the Grantors\u2019 lifetimes; to provide a preferred alternative to guardianship proceedings; and to provide a simplified means of accomplishing both lifetime and death transfers of the Grantor[s]\u2019 assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The trust property was defined in Article II of the Agreement. Under its terms, assets transferred by the Grantors into the trust were to be designated Schedule A, B, or C assets. All property not specifically designated as a Schedule B or C asset was deemed to be a Schedule A asset. According to the Agreement, \u201cregardless of how [trust] property was acquired, or how titled ..., [the property transferred pursuant to the Trust Agreement] shall for all purposes of [the] Trust be divided into two separate shares, one for each Grantor____\u201d Husband\u2019s share consisted of one-half of Schedule A assets and all of Schedule B assets. Wife\u2019s share consisted of one-half of Schedule A assets and all of Schedule C assets. In describing Schedule A assets, the Agreement specifies: \u201cTo the extent that either [spouse\u2019s] share [of Schedule A assets] exceeds his or her contribution to the Trust, the amount of the difference or excess contribution shall constitute a completed gift from the other [spouse].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Each party retained the right to revoke the trust during their joint lifetime, at which time the Trustee was required to \u201cdeliver to the Grantors, or as may be directed in the instrument of revocation, their respective shares of the trust property.\u201d The parties also had the right to receive during their lifetimes all of the net income and principal of their respective share.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Upon the death of one of the parties, Article III of the Agreement required the surviving Trastee to make a number of dispositions of the decedent\u2019s share in order to take advan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tage of certain tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Among the stipulated dispositions was the transfer of that portion of the decedent\u2019s share which was \u201cnecessary to increase the estate of the [surviving] spouse under federal law to an amount which is equal to the total remaining unused unified credit\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2010 to the share of the surviving spouse (\u201cthe Survivor\u2019s Trust\u201d). Assets allocated to the Survivor\u2019s Trust were further specifically limited to those assets \u201cwhich qualify for the marital deduction\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056. In the event the surviving spouse disclaimed the transferred property and to the extent that property remained in the decedent\u2019s share, the Agreement required that property be transferred into a credit shelter trust in \u201cany portion necessary to make the [trust] equal to the largest amount\u201d that could \u201cpass free of federal estate tax ... by reason of the [decedent\u2019s] available unified credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In contemplation of the tax saving purposes of the Agreement, the following anticipated estate tax goals are set forth in Article III:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">For preservation of the marital tax deduction, [the Surviv- or\u2019s Trust] may be paid or transferred outright to the [surviving] spouse if, in Trustee\u2019s judgment, such payment would be necessary to prevent the loss of the marital deduction....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">The Grantors, by funding the share of the [surviving] spouse [in this manner], are fully aware that the share passing to the [surviving] spouse will be taxed in the estate of the [surviving] spouse if thereafter owned at death. The Grantors prefer to allow [the surviving] spouse the fidlest share that will not knowingly incur estate taxation upon the death of the surviving [spouse], as determined at the time of the death of the Grantor, in order to minimize the likelihood of funding a credit shelter trust and thereby incurring the added expenses of such trust, as well as having to dealing [sic] with the inflexibility thereof....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Husband revoked the trust before the parties separated on January 19,1997. On January 28, 1997, husband filed a bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>complaint for divorce. On February 2, 1998, the trial court held a hearing to determine the classification of the trust property, all of which was transferred into the trust as Schedule A assets. At the hearing, the parties jointly filed the Agreement with the court. Husband\u2019s counsel conceded the trust\u2019s activation by a transfer of property. No other evidence was introduced by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The court, looking to the four corners of the Agreement, found that the Agreement was clear and unequivocal. Further, the court found that the Agreement created two separate and equal trusts and that assets transferred to a spouse\u2019s share pursuant to the Agreement constituted a completed gift from the other spouse. Accordingly, by order of March 19, 1998, the court ruled that all Schedule A assets were separate property to be divided equally among the parties. In doing so, the court did not reference any particular provision of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, declined to consider the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) pertaining to the division of marital property, and referred the case to a special master to determine the precise assets encompassed within Schedule A.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Husband contends the court erred in finding that the transfer of property to the parties\u2019 separate trusts pursuant to the Agreement constituted a completed gift from the donor spouse, the nature of which transformed the assets into separate property. Husband cites as particular grounds, the absence of sufficient proof of donative intent to create separate property. <em>See Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 566, 471 S.E.2d 809, 813, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996) (stating that one of the elements of a valid gift is the donor\u2019s intent to make a gift). <em>See also Dean v. Dean, </em>8 Va.App. 143, 146, 379 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1989) (stating that a person who claims ownership of property by gift must prove the donative intent of the donor by clear and convincing evidence). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The equitable division of property that the parties have transferred to a revocable <em>inter vivos </em>trust for estate planning purposes presents a matter of first impression under Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>divorce law, and one which few of our sister states have had an opportunity to address directly. However, our analysis is not without well-founded roots in settled law, specifically, the law governing the classification of property under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 and of property acquired by interspousal transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Other than a document attached to the Agreement that assigned the parties\u2019 furniture, furnishings, and personal effects to the trust, no evidence was presented to establish that the property transferred under the Agreement was separate property. Thus, we treat the assets as marital at the time of the transfer because property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be marital in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2); <em>Hart v. Hart, </em>27 Va.App. 46, 61, 497 S.E.2d 496, 503 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The query before us, therefore, is whether marital property can be transformed into separate property under the terms of a revocable trust agreement, executed during a marriage. In <em>McDavid v. McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. 406, 451 S.E.2d 713 (1994), we determined that \u201cproperty which is marital may become separate ... through \u2018a valid, express agreement by the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 451 S.E.2d at 717 (quoting <em>Wagner v. Wagner, 4 </em>Va.App. 397, 404, 358 S.E.2d 407, 410 (1987)). In that case, we'affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that real property acquired during the marriage was properly classified as husband\u2019s separate property based on the terms of a deed of gift executed by wife, transferring her interest in the property to husband. <em>See id. </em>at 408, 411, 451 S.E.2d at 715, 717. The <em>McDavid </em>deed provided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>property was to be held by husband \u201cin his own right as his separate and equitable estate as if he were an unmarried man ... free from the control and marital rights of this present ... spouse\u201d and \u201cwith full and complete power ... [to] dispose of the ... property ... during his lifetime ... [or by devise].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 451 S.E.2d at 717. We found that under the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-155, which accords post-marital contracts the same dignity under law as pre-marital contracts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the terms of the <em>McDavid </em>deed rebutted the presumption that \u201cproperty acquired during marriage with marital funds is marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 451 S.E.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Prior to our decision in <em>McDavid, </em>we dealt with an earlier line of cases which held that property transferred by inter-spousal gift was marital property because the property was acquired during the marriage and the evidence was insufficient to support the classification of the transferred property as separate under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. <em>See Garland v. Garland, </em>12 Va.App. 192, 196, 403 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1991). In <em>Garland, </em>husband conveyed his entire interest in the marital residence to wife in anticipation of a pending divorce action. <em>See id. </em>at 193, 403 S.E.2d at 5. Subsequently, the parties reconciled, but legal title to the residence remained in wife\u2019s name. <em>See id. </em>In conjunction with husband\u2019s later suit for divorce, the trial court found that the marital residence was wife\u2019s separate property. <em>See id. </em>at 194, 403 S.E.2d at 6. We reversed, stating, \u201c[e]ven though the wife may retain legal title to the property as a result of the separation agreement, whether the property is separate or marital is determined by the statutory definition and is not determined by legal title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 403 S.E.2d at 6. We further noted that wife\u2019s interest was governed by Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1), which limits the acquisition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>separate property by gift to property received from a source other than the donee\u2019s spouse. <em>See id. </em>at 196, 403 S.E.2d at 7. <em>See also Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>7 Va.App. 488, 496, 375 S.E.2d 374, 377 (1988) (finding insufficient evidence to overcome presumption that jewelry given to wife during the marriage was marital property, not her separate property). Neither <em>Garland </em>nor <em>Kaufman </em>involves a transfer of property or an agreement from which the intent to convey an asset as a spouse\u2019s separate property under Code \u00a7 20-107.3 is proven by express and specific language, as was the situation in <em>McDavid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>Kaufman, Garland, </em>and <em>McDavid </em>each considered the question of interspousal transfer of marital property by gift. In <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>we addressed the same question in the context of an interspousal gift of separate property. The husband in that case retitled his separate real property and two separate financial accounts jointly in his and his wife\u2019s name. <em>See Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 565, 471 S.E.2d at 813. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the transfer constituted a gift to the wife, which provided a ground for distribution of a portion of the property\u2019s value to her as part of an award of marital property. <em>See id. </em>at 566-68, 471 S.E.2d at 813-14. In essence, we held that a gift of separate property during the marriage becomes marital property subject to division pursuant to the factors listed under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). <em>See id. </em>at 567-69, 471 S.E.2d at 813-14. <em>See also </em>J. Thomas Oldham, <em>Divorce, Separation and the Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6.02[3][b] (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The principles that emerge from the cases addressing the classification of property which has been the subject of interspousal gift do not depend upon the classification of the source of the property but rather upon whether one party by clear and express language intended to give the asset as the other spouse\u2019s separate property or merely intended to make a gift during the marriage, which becomes marital property. Where the facts clearly and unambiguously support the conclusion that one of the parties has relinquished all right and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>interest in marital property and has transferred those rights unconditionally to the other, to the exclusion of the donor\u2019s continuing claim upon the property as a marital asset pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3, a separate property right -will be found to exist. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2) (stating that property acquired during the marriage by either spouse and before the last separation of the parties \u201cis presumed to be marital property <em>in the absence of satisfactory evidence that it is separate property. </em>\u201d) (emphasis added)); <em>McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. at 411-12, 451 S.E.2d at 717; <em>Kaufman, </em>7 Va.App. at 496, 375 S.E.2d at 377. However, it is not enough to merely change legal title. <em>See Garland, </em>12 Va.App. at 195, 403 S.E.2d at 6. As noted by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cAn interspousal gift could be construed as evidence of an implied agreement that the transferred asset should not be marital property, but such an agreement is not automatically present merely because an interspousal gift was made. Indeed many interspousal gifts are made without any intent of removing the asset from the marital estate in the event of divorce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>217 (2nd ed.1994) (citing <em>Hemily v. Hemily, </em>403 A.2d 1139, 1143 (D.C. 1979)). <em>See In re Marriage of Davis, </em>215 Ill.App.3d 763, 771, 159 Ill.Dec. 375, 576 N.E.2d 44, 50 (1991) (holding that under Illinois law the presumption that property acquired by either spouse during the marriage is marital property can be overcome only \u201cby clear, convincing, and unmistakable evidence\u201d that the property was acquired by gift from the other spouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">It follows that equivocal evidence of intent, including evidence of a purpose unrelated to the making of a gift, may defeat a claim of separate property before the divorce court. <em>See, e.g., Hoagland v. Hoagland, </em>852 P.2d 1025, 1028 (Utah Ct.App.1993) (holding the trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that real property, conveyed by husband to wife by quitclaim deed in order to protect it from creditors of husband\u2019s failing business, was marital property); <em>In re Marriage of Parr, </em>103 Ill.App.3d 199, 206-07, 58 Ill.Dec. 624, 430 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>N.E.2d 656, 661-62 (1981) (finding that the presumption in favor of classifying property acquired during the marriage as marital was not rebutted when husband quitclaimed his interest in a condominium to wife for business and tax purposes); <em>In re Marriage of Leff, </em>148 Ill.App.3d 792, 807-08, 102 Ill.Dec. 262, 499 N.E.2d 1042, 1052-53 (1986) (affirming the trial court\u2019s finding that the marital residence, acquired during the marriage, was marital property when husband testified he placed title in wife\u2019s name to protect the residence .from a possible malpractice action and wife failed to rebut presumption that property was marital by clear and convincing evidence); <em>Davis, </em>215 Ill.App.3d at 771-73, 159 Ill.Dec. 375, 576 N.E.2d at 50-51 (determining that husband\u2019s transfer of his interest in the marital residence to wife by quitclaim deed was not a gift that transformed the property into wife\u2019s separate property because transfer was made as part of an estate tax planning scheme); <em>In re Marriage of Wojcicki, </em>109 Ill.App.3d 569, 572-75, 65 Ill.Dec. 173, 440 N.E.2d 1028, 1030-31 (1982) (finding that husband\u2019s transfer of his separate real property to joint tenancy with his wife for the purpose of avoiding probate was not a gift of the property to the marital estate); <em>Weberg v. Weberg, </em>158 Wis.2d 540, 550-52, 463 N.W.2d 382, 386-87 (Wis.Ct.App.1990) (rejecting wife\u2019s argument that husband\u2019s separate funds became marital property when placed in a joint account based on the absence of evidence showing donative intent and on husband\u2019s testimony that he placed the funds in the joint account to protect wife in the event of his death); <em>Berry v. Breslain, </em>352 N.W.2d 516, 518 (Minn.Ct.App.1984) (finding that wife\u2019s home, although transferred to joint tenancy with husband upon marriage, remained her separate property because the joint tenancy was created primarily to ensure security on the mortgage).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In short, when evidence of intent to relinquish all present and future dominion over the property so as to remove it from the marital estate is lacking, the presumption of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2) that property acquired by either spouse during a marriage is marital remains unrebutted. <em>See McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. at 411-12, 451 S.E.2d at 717; <em>Kaufman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>7 Va.App. at 496, 375 S.E.2d at 377. <em>See e.g., Davis, </em>215 Ill.App.3d at 771, 159 Ill.Dec. 375, 576 N.E.2d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In determining whether the Agreement contains sufficient evidence of donative intent to create separate estates, principles governing the construction of contracts are applicable.

(32 Gratt.) 530 (1879))).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Applying these principles here, we find that the record does not contain clear and unambiguous evidence that either party intended to relinquish his or her interest in marital property and to create separate estates upon the division and transfer of the property into equal shares under the Agreement. The Agreement reflects a clear purpose to establish a mechanism, using a revocable trust as the vehicle, that would enable the parties to take advantage of provisions in the Internal Revenue Code allowing married persons to minimize federal estate tax liability. Accordingly, the parties\u2019 agreement to divide and place their assets into equal shares must be viewed in light of the contemplated tax purposes that the Agreement was intended to serve. Wife\u2019s contention that the equal division of Schedule A assets into two separate shares evidences the husband\u2019s intent to make a completed gift to her of the property transferred to Schedule A fails to consider that under the estate tax laws, which underlay the parties\u2019 Agreement, the equal division of the marital estate was critical to assuring the avoidance of tax liability upon death. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2001(a), 2010(a), 2056(a), 2523(a); <em>see also </em>James F. Farr &amp; Jackson W. Wright, <em>An Estate Planner\u2019s Handbook </em>\u00a7 50, at 335 (1979) (\u201cBecause of the progressive rates, <em>the impact of federal estate taxes </em>on the combined estate of husband and wife <em>must be least when their taxable estates are approximately </em>equal.... The opportunity to split the taxable estates of husband and wife by means of the estate tax marital deduction is entirely lost if the wife, [for example,] having little or no property of her own, is the first to die. This situation can be guarded against by gifts to the wife during her life, insuring that she can at least use most of the unified credit which will be available to her estate.\u201d) (emphasis added)). The trust provision that directs, to the extent a spouse\u2019s share of trust assets exceeds his or her contributions to the trust, the difference in the contributions \u201cshall constitute a completed gift from the other [spouse],\u201d must be similarly understood, as this provision is likewise critical to the estate planning and tax liability reduction purposes of the instrument. <em>See </em>Farr <em>&amp; </em>Wright, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 50, at 181-82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(Supp.1995) (\u201cIf the [one spouse] does not have sufficient property to utilize [his or her] full credit, [the other spouse] should consider making gifts to her so that she will be able to use her full credit if she should die first.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Furthermore, the evidence fails to support the obverse proposition espoused by wife. The Agreement, by its terms, affords no evidence that, at the time of the trust\u2019s formation, the parties contemplated it would govern the classification of property in the event of divorce. Indeed, the provisions of Article III regarding disposition of the trust\u2019s assets upon the death of either spouse, when coupled with the contemporaneous execution of the parties\u2019 wills, make plain that the parties\u2019 underlying expectation was the survival of their marriage, not its demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Unlike the deed of gift in <em>McDavid, </em>which explicitly stated that husband was to hold the transferred property \u201cin his own right as his separate and equitable estate\u201d as if unmarried, free from the control and marital rights of his spouse, such language of clear donative intent to create separate property pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3 is absent here. Indeed, it is clear that both husband and wife intended to retain their interest in the trusts\u2019 assets, each being named the beneficiary of the share held by the other, with the remainder passing to their children and other named beneficiaries upon the death of both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Finally, we note that the retention of the right to revoke the trust by each spouse supports the conclusion that neither had the requisite donative intent to transform marital property into separate, as was the case in McDavid. Retaining the right to revoke a trust is inconsistent with the notion that a grantor has relinquished all right and interest in the trust property. <em>See Burnet v. Guggenheim, 288 U.S. 280, 284, 53 </em>S.Ct. 369, 370, 77 L.Ed. 748 (1933) (finding that property transferred to revocable trusts did not constitute a completed, taxable gift to the beneficiaries until the grantor\u2019s power to revoke was eliminated); <em>Newman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>222 F.2d 131, 136 (9th Cir.1955) (finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>settlor\u2019s transfer of property under a revocable trust was not a completed gift for purposes of taxation so long as the right to revoke existed); <em>In re Estate of Knickerbocker, </em>912 P.2d 969, 977 (Utah 1996) (\u201cTo make an equitable division of the marital assets, the court needs flexibility to decide upon the evidence whether ... property transferred by one spouse into a revocable trust[] should be included within the marital estate.\u201d); <em>Lynch v. Lynch, </em>147 Vt. 574, 522 A.2d 234, 235 (1987) (finding that property in trust, because the grantor spouse expressly reserved the power to revoke the trust, was owned by the grantor and thus subject to equitable distribution as marital property); <em>Friedrich v. BancOhio National Bank, </em>14 Ohio App.3d 247, 470 N.E.2d 467, 471 (1984) (stating that the grantor of property held in trust \u201cretains the right to reinvest himself with legal title at some point in the future\u201d by reserving a power of revocation); <em>Salvio v. Salvio, </em>186 Conn. 311, 441 A.2d 190, 197-98 (1982) (finding that, in the absence of any unequivocal act rendering savings account trusts irrevocable or otherwise transferring ownership rights to the beneficiaries, trusts established by wife were the property of the marriage and subject to the trial court\u2019s power to distribute marital assets); Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6.28, at 447 (2nd ed.1994) (stating that courts treat the power to revoke a trust as \u201ctantamount to the power of ownership\u201d and that assets transferred into a revocable spousal trust are generally treated as if owned by the settlor spouse individually). Viewed in this light, the power of revocation possessed by the parties under the Agreement supports the conclusion that husband had no intent to divest himself of all of his right and interest in the marital assets transferred into the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Under Virginia law, in the absence of clear and unambiguous evidence of intent to create a separate estate in the other party, an interspousal gift is ineffective as a device to transform an asset into the separate property of the donee spouse. <em>See, e.g., McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. at 411-12, 451 S.E.2d at 717; <em>Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 566, 471 S.E.2d at 813. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court and remand for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>consideration of the division of the parties\u2019 marital assets in accordance with Code \u00a7 20-107.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">. Article II provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING IN THIS TRUST WHICH MIGHT BE RELIED UPON TO THE CONTRARY, THIS TRUST IS IN EVERY RESPECT, TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT REVOCABLE LIVING TRUSTS. The Two Grantors have chosen to maintain their two separate trusts together in this one trust document for reasons personal to themselves. The two trusts held herein shall be viewed as having separate and distinct existence, and shall be construed (in the light of this overriding pronouncement of Grantor\u2019s intent), so as to arrive at that construction which will result in a non-revocable credit shelter trust (THE FAMILY TRUST, as hereinafter defined) not being included in the share of the surviving Grantor, while allowing the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>marital deduction with respect to any portion of the trust of the first Grantor to die which passes to the Survivor\u2019s Trust (as hereinafter defined). The provisions in this document shall apply to the administration of both Grantors\u2019 trust shares.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. We note, however, that whether the property was marital or separate before it was transferred into the trust, the resolution of the issue remains the same under the facts of this case, as the determinative analysis is premised on the issue of donative intent to create separate property, not the source or nature of the property. <em>See Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 566, 471 S.E.2d 809, 813, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996); <em>McDavid v.
