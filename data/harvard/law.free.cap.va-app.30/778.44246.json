For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997). The judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 238, 240, 415 S.E.2d 881, 882-83 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The evidence established that appellant and Nathan Combs (Combs) married in January 1996. Their daughter, A.C., was born October 23, 1996. The family moved to a rented trailer in a mobile home park in April 1997. By June 1997, appellant and her husband were experiencing severe financial difficulties. Neither appellant nor Combs had a steady job, and their public assistance payments expired. They sold a vehicle, furniture, and other items to pay for ordinary household necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">On June 13,1997, appellant contacted Bill Devlin at Catholic Charities, an adoption agency in Roanoke. Devlin met with appellant and Combs at their home on June 20, 1997 and discussed with the couple placing A.C. for adoption through the agency. Appellant and Combs stated they were under a great deal of emotional and financial stress. Combs asked if the agency or the potential adoptive couple could \u201chelp out with their situation.\u201d Devlin explained that any exchange of money or property in return for the child would be a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>of the law. Devlin agreed to return in a few days with the necessary legal documents and to take custody of A.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Devlin returned to appellant\u2019s home as agreed on June 23, 1997, but found no one at the trailer. Devlin saw appellant later that day, and she advised him that her mother was going to keep the child. Subsequently, appellant called Devlin and said she wanted to proceed with the adoption. However, Devlin never heard from appellant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Debbie Farthing (Farthing) testified that in July 1997, one month after appellant\u2019s initial meeting with Devlin, she met with appellant and Combs at their trailer. Farthing did not know appellant or Combs but understood that they were to be evicted from the trailer and that they wanted someone to take their baby. During the meeting, appellant sat and held the baby in the same room with Farthing and Combs. Combs said they wanted someone to take the baby, wanted $1,500 to buy a truck and wanted to leave town. Appellant offered no objection. Combs said an adoption agency \u201cwas wanting to take the baby\u201d but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to do it\u201d because they were going to \u201cmake thousands of dollars off the baby.\u201d Combs said he was not going to \u201cgive the baby away free.\u201d Farthing took A.C. with her after the meeting but returned the baby to appellant and Combs the same day because Farthing\u2019s husband refused to cooperate with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Thelma Farrar (Mrs. Farrar) was the owner of the mobile home park where the Combs lived. She visited appellant\u2019s trailer in late June or early July. At that time, appellant was in the living room holding her baby. Combs told Mrs. Farrar that he would give her the baby in exchange for $1,000. Appellant again offered no objection. Combs also commented, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be selling her, there\u2019s not enough money in the world to buy my baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Combs worked periodically for Bobby Farrar (Mr. Farrar) in a security business. While working on July 19, 1997, Combs asked Mr. Farrar if he and his wife had decided whether they wanted A.C. Combs said he now wanted $2,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>for the child. Combs indicated he wanted to use the money to catch up on his rent and buy a cheap car.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">On July 23,1997, Mrs. Farrar confronted Combs outside the trailer about his overdue rent payments. Combs asked Mrs. Farrar to \u201cgive [him] a little money\u201d and accept A.C. for the rent he owed. Mrs. Farrar refused the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Mrs. Farrar saw Combs outside his trailer two days later. Combs said: \u201c[T]hese nice people in the trailer are from Texas and they\u2019re going to take [A.C.]. I just want to see if you want her, because I would rather you have her than these people.\u201d Combs told Farrar the Texas couple was going to give them $3,000 for the baby. Mrs. Farrar responded that she did not have that kind of money. Appellant left the trailer and asked Mrs. Farrar to call Molly, Combs\u2019s mother, and ask her to bring AC.\u2019s birth certif\u00edcate. Mrs. Farrar saw the Texas couple put AC.\u2019s things in their car. The evidence also established that the Singletons, a couple from Texas, took A.C. from appellant\u2019s home to Texas within twenty-four hours of their having met Combs and appellant. However, the child was subsequently returned to Virginia and placed in the custody of Combs\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Appellant testified that she and her husband pursued an adoption for A.C. because of their financial situation but that they did not attempt to receive money in return. The trial judge accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and rejected appellant\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, appellant was convicted of solicitation of money or other thing of value in connection with a placement or adoption, in violation of Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4, and conspiracy to solicit money or other thing of value in connection with a placement or adoption, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-22 and 63.1-220.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">II. SOLICITATION OF MONEY</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4, the statute under which appellant was convicted, prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the solicitation of money or any thing of value in connection with the placement or adoption of a child. Under Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>[n]o person or child-placing agency shall charge, pay, give, or agree to give or accept any money, property, service or other thing of value in connection with a placement or adoption or any act undertaken pursuant to this chapter ____ <em>No person shall advertise or solicit to perform any activity prohibited by this section. </em>Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">In the instant case, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to establish either that she violated the statute or that she \u201ccounseled, enticed or induced\u201d another to violate Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4. Specifically, she argues that \u201c[t]here is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [she] committed criminal solicitation.\u201d However, appellant was not charged with criminal solicitation, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-29,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant intended to induce another to commit a crime. <em>See Ford v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 224, 227, 391 S.E.2d 603, 604 (1990). To the contrary, appellant was charged with violating Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4 by <em>soliciting payment of money </em>or other thing of value with the placement of A.C.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">\u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 580, 534 (1994). The commonly accepted definitions for the word \u201csolicit\u201d include: \u201cto make petition to,\u201d \u201centreat, importune,\u201d \u201cto approach with a request or plea (as in selling or begging).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2169 (1993). Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4 contains a clear prohibition against the <em>request </em>or <em>plea </em>for payment of money or any other thing of value in connection with an adoption or the placement of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In the instant case, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proved that Combs, in appellant\u2019s presence, attempted to obtain money from Farthing, Mrs. Farrar, and the Singletons in exchange for placing their child, A.C., for adoption. Combs commented that he was not going to give A.C. away for free because he could make thousands of dollars for the child. Appellant did not object to Combs\u2019s comment or to his offers to sell the child. Additionally, it was appellant who first contacted Devlin, only to learn that an adoption through the agency would not result in the payment of any money to her and her husband. In fact, when Devlin saw appellant a few days later, she falsely told him that she had made arrangements for A.C. to stay with a grandmother. Finally, while the Singletons were present at the trailer, appellant tried to obtain the child\u2019s birth certificate to facilitate the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\"> The trial judge accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and rejected appellant\u2019s testimony that she did not attempt to receive money in return for the placement or adoption of A.C. \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters 'solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). \u201cIn its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Considering the totality of facts and attendant circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of violating Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4 by soliciting the payment of money in connection with the placement of her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">III. CONSPIRACY</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Additionally, appellant was convicted of conspiring to violate Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4. On appeal, she contends the evidence was insufficient to prove a conspiracy because the Commonwealth failed to prove that appellant and Combs agreed to unlawfully solicit payment of money or other thing of value in connection with the placement of A.C. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">\u201cConspiracy is defined as \u2018an agreement between two or more persons by some concerted action to commit an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Feigley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 717, 722, 432 S.E.2d 520, 524 (1993) (quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982)). Proof of an explicit agreement is not required, and the Commonwealth may, and frequently must, rely on circumstantial evidence to establish the conspiracy. <em>See Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 238, 241, 415 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1992). \u201c[A] conspiracy may be inferred from the overt actions of the parties, and a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.\u201d <em>McQuinn v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 418, 425, 451 S.E.2d 704, 708 (1994) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>20 Va.App. 753, 460 S.E.2d 624 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">Where ... it has been shown that the defendants \u201cby their acts pursued the same object, one performing one part and the others performing another part so as to complete it or with a view to its attainment, the [fact finder] will be justified in concluding that they were engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-8\"><em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 73, 78, 390 S.E.2d 386, 388 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>The fact that the perpetrators of a crime are husband and wife does not, without more, create an inference that they conspired to commit the offense charged. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 75, 82, 396 S.E.2d 844, 848 (1990). A conspiracy, even one between husband and wife, requires a showing of an agreement between the conspirators. <em>See, e.g., Stumpf v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 200, 206, 379 S.E.2d 480, 484 (1989); <em>Henry v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 194, 197, 342 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The evidence demonstrated a concerted plan of action by appellant and her husband from June 13 to July 25, 1997, to place their child in return for a financial payment. Appellant first contacted an adoption agency about the matter. However, Devlin advised appellant and Combs that they would receive no remuneration in the arrangement, and they withdrew their request. While appellant held the child in the same room, Combs subsequently negotiated with Farthing to exchange the baby for $1,500 and offered the baby to Farrar for $1,000. Appellant, the child\u2019s mother, raised no objection and did not intervene. Combs admitted on July 25, 1997 that they had agreed to give the baby to the Singletons for $3,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \"While the Singletons were present at the trailer, appellant tried to have A.C.\u2019s birth certificate delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Where two or more people act to pursue the same object, such as appellant and Combs, \u201cone performing one part and the other performing another part so as to complete it or with a view to its attainment, [the fact finder] will be justified in concluding that they were engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.\u201d <em>Amato v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 544, 552, 352 S.E.2d 4, 9 (1987) (quoting 16 Am.Jur.2d <em>Conspiracy </em>\u00a7 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>(1979)). Considering all of the attendant circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant and her husband conspired to solicit money in connection with an adoption and, in fact, did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-15\">. Appellant was originally indicted for two counts of solicitation of money or other thing of value in connection with a placement or adoption under Code \u00a7 63.1-220.4 and one count of conspiracy. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ever, after trial, at the sentencing hearing, the trial court granted appellant's motion to set aside one of the solicitation counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">Any person who commands, entreats, or otherwise attempts to persuade another person to commit a felony, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. Any person age eighteen or older who commands, entreats, or otherwise attempts to persuade another person under age eighteen to commit a felony, shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-11\">. The amended indictment charged appellant with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">On or about July 18, 1997, through July 25, 1997, in the County of Pittsylvania, Virginia, Lillie Rosenbaum Combs did unlawfully and feloniously, in connection with the placement or adoption of A.M.C., born October 23, 1996, solicit payment of money or other thing of value not specifically allowed by Code Section 63.1-220.4, Code of Virginia.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">. We need not address appellant's argument that Combs's statements may not be attributed to her as a co-conspirator. Appellant did not object to the statements as being inadmissible at the time they were offered into evidence, and her claim is barred on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Marlowe v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 619, 621, 347 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1986) (\"To be timely, an objection must be made when the occasion arises \u2014 at the time the evidence is offered or the statement made.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
