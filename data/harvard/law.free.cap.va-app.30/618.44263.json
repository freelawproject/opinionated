On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u00e1ppeal, she contends that the trial court erroneously denied her motion to suppress evidence obtained by police incident to an unlawful arrest. We disagree and affirm' the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">At approximately 11:30 p.m. on the evening of January 30, 1998, Officer J.M. Brown, together with another officer, was patrolling the City of Suffolk in an unmarked police vehicle, participating in an investigation of prostitution within that community. As the two proceeded along a public street, defendant, \u201cwalking in the opposite direction,\u201d \u201cmade eye contact\u201d with the officers. Brown stopped the car, defendant approached \u201cof her own free will,\u201d and the officers \u201casked ... if she needed a ride.\u201d Defendant answered, \u201cyes,\u201d entered the vehicle and seated herself on the rear passenger side. The officers inquired \u201c[i]f there was a party going on somewhere,\u201d and defendant immediately offered to \u201cgive [them] head for a dime.\u201d Based upon \u201cexperience as a police officer,\u201d Officer Brown recognized the response as a proposition to provide \u201coral sex\u201d in exchange for $10 and signaled uniformed police, located nearby, to \u201cmove in and arrest\u201d defendant for prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">A search incident to the arrest resulted in discovery of two \u201ccrack stems\u201d on defendant\u2019s person, each containing cocaine residue, evidence that supported the subject offense. Prior to trial, defendant moved the court to suppress the items, arguing that the police lacked probable cause to arrest her for prostitution and, therefore, unconstitutionally seized the contraband. The trial court denied the motion and convicted defendant of the instant offense, resulting in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Upon review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c[t]he burden is upon [defendant] to show that this ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 579, 66 L.Ed.2d 477 (1980). \u201cQuestions of ... probable cause to make a warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>search are subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. \u2018In performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or without evidence to support them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 8, 492 S.E.2d 826, 830 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\u201c \u201cWhether a warrantless arrest was constitutionally valid depends upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 1, 12, 497 S.E.2d 474, 479 (1998) (citations omitted). If so, such \u201carrest of a suspect ... is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment\u201d and, \u201cthat intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conversely, however, \u201ca warrantless arrest that is not based upon probable cause is unconstitutional and evidence seized as a result of an unconstitutional arrest is inadmissible, without regard to the officer\u2019s good faith and reasonable belief that he was not factually or legally mistaken.\u201d <em>Ford v. City of Newport News, </em>23 Va.App. 137, 145, 474 S.E.2d 848, 852 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201c \u2018[P]robable cause is measured against an objective standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 260, 266, 391 S.E.2d 592, 595-96 (1990) (citations omitted). It \u201c \u2018exists where \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the arresting officers\u2019 knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u201d an offense has been or is being committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jefferson, </em>27 Va.App. at 12, 497 S.E.2d at 479 (citation omitted). \u201c\u2018In assessing an officer\u2019s probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>cause for making a warrantless arrest, no less strict standards may be applied than are applicable to a magistrate\u2019s determination that an arrest warrant should issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford, </em>23 Va.App. at 144, 474 S.E.2d at 851 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It is uncontroverted on the instant record that defendant was initially arrested, without a warrant, for prostitution, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-346, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cany person who, for money or its equivalent, ... offers to commit adultery, fornication or <em>any act </em>in <em>violation </em>of <em>\u00a7 18.2-361 and thereafter does any substantial act in furtherance thereof, </em>shall be guilty of being a prostitute, or prostitution----\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-346(A) (emphasis added). Manifestly, evidence of \u201ca <em>[substantial </em>act performed in furtherance of the offer\u201d is essential to the offense. <em>Adams v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 257, 258, 208 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1974) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The record establishes that defendant offered to \u201ccarnally know\u201d the officers \u201cwith the mouth,\u201d a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-361(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in exchange \u201cfor money,\u201d all indispensable elements to prostitution contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-346(A). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-361(A). However, the evidence does not disclose \u201cthereafter any substantial act in furtherance thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-346(A). Thus, at the time of the warrant-less arrest, police lacked reasonable belief that the crime of prostitution or attempted prostitution had been or was being committed and, therefore, arrested defendant without the requisite probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The Commonwealth, nevertheless, insists that the arrest and related search of defendant were valid because police also possessed probable cause to arrest her for solieita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tion to commit oral sodomy, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-29.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth reasons, \u201can arrest supported by probable cause [related to one offense] is not made unlawful by an officer\u2019s subjective reliance on, or verbal announcement of, an offense different from the one for which probable cause exists.\u201d <em>State v. Huff, </em>64 Wash.App. 641, 826 P.2d 698, 701 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Although Virginia has neither accepted nor rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s theory,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the rationale finds support in a majority of other jurisdictions that have confronted the issue, each concluding that \u201c[t]he absence of probable cause to believe that a person committed a particular crime for which a person was arrested does not create an invalid arrest if, at the time of the arrest, the police had sufficient information to support an arrest of the person on a different charge.\u201d <em>City of Seattle v. Cadigan, </em>55 Wash.App. 30, 776 P.2d 727, 731 (1989) (citation omitted); <em>see e.g., United States v. Saunders, </em>476 F.2d 5 (5th Cir.1973) (although accused arrested without probable cause for harboring or concealing fugitive, search valid because probable cause existed to arrest for marijuana possession); <em>United States v. Kalter, </em>5 F.3d 1166 (8th Cir.1993) (police lacked probable cause to arrest for concealed weapon, but search supported by probable cause to arrest for transporting weapon); <em>United States v. Brookins, </em>434 F.2d 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(5th Cir.1970) (\u201cprobable cause for arrest for carrying on the business of a distiller would prevent [improper] arrest\u201d for another offense \u201cfrom being held illegal\u201d); <em>Klingler v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 299 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 859, 90 S.Ct. 127, 24 L.Ed.2d 110 (1969) (search incidental to improper arrest for \u201cvagrancy\u201d valid because probable cause existed for a robbery arrest); <em>Huff, </em>64 Wash.App. 641, 826 P.2d 698 (no probable cause to arrest for \u201cobstructing public servant,\u201d but search valid when officer \u201chad objectively sufficient probable cause to believe\u201d accused possessed controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">We find the rationale of these decisions persuasive. Probable cause is \u201cdetermined by objective facts,\u201d not the \u201csubjective opinion\u201d of a police officer. <em>Klingler, </em>409 F.2d at 304. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">an arrest not supported by probable cause is not made lawful by an officer\u2019s subjective belief that an offense has been committed. By the same token, [however,] an arrest supported by probable cause is not made unlawful by an officer\u2019s subjective reliance on ... an offense different from the one for which probable cause exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\"><em>Huff, </em>826 P.2d at 701. This \u201ceven-handed application\u201d of the constitutional protection against unlawful arrest protects individual freedom with the shield of objective probable cause while at once \u201callowing] room for some mistakes by the arresting officer.\u201d <em>Klingler, </em>409 F.2d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Here, defendant\u2019s offer to engage the officers in oral sodomy, a felony, was sufficient to establish probable cause for solicitation in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-29. <em>See Branche v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 480, 490-91, 489 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1997). Thus, viewed objectively, police possessed sufficient probable cause to arrest defendant for solicitation without a warrant and undertake an incidental search. The probable cause to support an arrest of defendant for the alternate offense otherwise armed the officers, acting in good faith, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the necessary justification to conduct the disputed arrest and search.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">. The well-established authority to search an accused incident to a lawful custodial arrest is generally \"based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. at 235, 94 S.Ct. 467; <em>see also Chimel v.

Nevertheless, the trial court found that \"the 'sawed-off shotgun [was] in plain view, the butt of it sticking out of a bag[,] ... easily identified by anyone knowledgeable with guns.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 391 S.E.2d at 596. In affirming the conviction, we concluded that \"the trial court [is] free to substitute its finding based on the objective facts before it that probable cause to seize the gun existed prior to its removal from the bag ... under the plain view exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 391 S.E.2d at 596. <em>See also Shears v.
