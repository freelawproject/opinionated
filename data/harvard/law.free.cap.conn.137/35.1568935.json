As the case was tried, the principal issue was whether the plaintiff was struck by a state car driven by a state policeman or by another, unidentified car. The plaintiff admits that he cannot recover unless the finding is materially corrected. In spite of his elaborate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>attack thereon, there was ample evidence to support the vital finding that the defendants\u2019 vehicle was at no time in contact with the plaintiff. This finding supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove that the d\u00e9fendant driver was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">The only ruling assigned as error was the admission of a question addressed to a police officer inquiring as to the condition of sobriety of an eyewitness to the accident. The question was claimed to affect the latter\u2019s credibility. It was admissible for that purpose. <em>Olstad </em>v. <em>Fahse, </em>204 Minn. 118, 120, 282 N.

W. 254; see <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>28 Conn. 177, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
