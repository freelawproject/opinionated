Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed on a second petition filed in 1998 to determine whether he is a person the Act defines as an SVP because the proceeding involving his first petition filed in 1996 is still pending review before our Supreme Court <em>{People </em>v. <em>Hedge </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 773 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 693], review granted Oct. 29, 1997 (S063954) <em>{Hedge </em>/)) and because he was not serving a valid parole revocation term at the time these current proceedings were instituted against him. Hedge also claims various instructional and evidentiary errors require reversal of his commitment and the SVP finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we shall conclude the trial court had jurisdiction to proceed on Hedge\u2019s second filed petition due to the nature of the commitment proceedings described by the Act which focus on the current mental condition and dangerousness of a potential SVP, permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>the initiation of such proceedings \u201cwhenever\u201d the potential SVP is scheduled to be released from the custody of the state Department of Corrections (DOC). (\u00a7 6601, subd. (a).) In the unpublished portions, we reject Hedge\u2019s remaining contentions of error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"AaX2\">\n<em>Summary of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">The Act, contained in section 6600 et seq., provides for the continued confinement in the custody of the DMH of those persons identified as SVP\u2019s before they have completed their prison or parole revocation terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act\u2019s uncodified purpose clause states: \u201c \u2018The Legislature finds and declares that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators that have diagnosable mental disorders can be identified while they are incarcerated. These persons are not safe to be at large and if released represent a danger to the health and safety of others in that they are likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. The Legislature further finds and declares that it is in the interest of society to identify these individuals prior to the expiration of their terms of imprisonment. It is the intent of the Legislature that once identified, these individuals, if found to be likely to commit acts of sexually violent criminal behavior beyond a reasonable doubt, be confined and treated until such time that it can be determined that they no longer present a threat to society. The Legislature further finds and declares that while these individuals have been duly punished for their criminal acts, they are, if adjudicated sexually violent predators, a continuing threat to society. The continuing danger posed by these individuals and the continuing basis for their judicial commitment is a currently diagnosed mental disorder which predisposes them to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior. It is the intent of the Legislature that these individuals be committed and treated for their disorders only as long as the disorders persist and not for any punitive purposes.\u2019 \u201d (Historical Note, 73D West\u2019s Ann. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code (1998 ed.) foil. \u00a7 6600, pp. 249-250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">The Act defines an SVP as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>received a determinate sentence[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and who has a diagnosed mental disorder[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">Under section 6601, if the director of the DOC determines that an inmate may be an SVP, the director must refer the inmate for an initial screening, which includes evaluation by two practicing psychiatrists or psychologists in accordance with a standardized assessment protocol, commenced at least six months before the inmate\u2019s scheduled release date.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6601, subds. (a), (b), (c) &amp; (d).) If both evaluators conclude that the inmate \u201chas a diagnosed mental disorder such that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>violence without appropriate treatment and custody,\u201d the DMH transmits a request for a petition for commitment under the Act to the county in which the alleged SVP was last convicted, with copies of the evaluation reports and other supporting documents. (\u00a7 6601, subds. (d), (h) &amp; (i).) If the designated county\u2019s attorney concurs in the request, a petition for commitment is filed in that county\u2019s superior court. (\u00a7 6601, subd. (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Once filed, the superior court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that the individual named in the petition is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> criminal behavior upon his or her release.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6602, as amended by Stats. 1996, ch. 4, \u00a7 4 &amp; by Stats. 1998, ch. 19, \u00a7 3.) If probable cause is found, the judge \u201cshall\u201d order that a trial be conducted \u201cto determine whether the person is, by reason of a diagnosed mental disorder, a danger to the health and safety of others in that the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence upon his or her release . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6602.) If, however, the court finds no probable cause, the court must dismiss the petition. (\u00a7 6602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">The person subject to a trial under the Act is to remain in custody in a secure facility until the trial is completed. (\u00a7 6602.) That person is entitled to trial by jury, the assistance of counsel, the right to retain experts or professional persons to perform further evaluations, and access to relevant medical and psychological reports. (\u00a7 6603, subd. (a).) The trier of fact must determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the person named in the petition is in fact an SVP. (\u00a7 6604.) If there is any reasonable doubt, the person is released at the expiration of his or her prison term. (\u00a7 6604.) If the person is determined to be an SVP, he or she shall be committed to the custody of the DMH for two years \u201cfor appropriate treatment and confinement in a secure facility . . . ,\u201d subject to annual review and extension of commitment if the diagnosed mental disorder and the consequent danger to the community persist. (\u00a7\u00a7 6604, 6605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">The committed SVP is entitled to the appointment of an expert and to review all records for the annual review and, unless waived, is entitled to a show cause hearing in the superior court to determine if the person\u2019s condition has so changed that he or she would not be a danger to the health and safety of others if released from confinement. (\u00a7 6605, subds. (a), (b) &amp; (c).) If the court so finds, the SVP is entitled to a full trial with the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>rights and constitutional protections afforded at the initial commitment proceedings. (\u00a7 6605, subd. (d).) If the ruling is in favor of the SVP, he or she is immediately unconditionally discharged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6605, subd. (e).) Additionally, if at any time the DMH has reason to believe the committed person is no longer an SVP, it must seek judicial review of the commitment. (\u00a7 6605, subd. (f).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Finally, the committed SVP must be provided treatment for his or her diagnosed mental disorder, whether or not it is found the SVP is amenable to treatment. (\u00a7 6606, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) The right to such treatment does not mean it must be potentially successful, but that it \u201cshall be consistent with current institutional standards for the treatment of sex offenders . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6606, subds. (b) &amp; (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">On October 25, 1989, Hedge pleaded guilty to two counts of committing forcible lewd acts on a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)) and to two counts of committing a lewd act on a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)). For these sex crimes which involved more than one victim, Hedge was sentenced to prison on December 14, 1989, for a total determinate term of 12 years. In anticipation of his pending release on parole,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the DMH wrote the San Diego District Attorney\u2019s Office (D.A.\u2019s Office) that Hedge had been identified as an SVP and attached to its letter the reports of two psychiatric professionals who concurred, after separate evaluations, that Hedge fit the Act\u2019s statutory qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">Subsequently, on June 25, 1996, the People filed the first petition, which included the above referenced psychiatric reports, requesting the superior court to commence proceedings under the Act to determine whether Hedge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>should be committed as an SVP. Hedge demurred to the petition on the ground it failed to state a cause of action because the Act was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him. The trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, dismissing the petition. The People appealed the dismissal, which was consolidated for review with six other SVP petitions dismissed on the same constitutional grounds. After considering the Act in light of , its legislative history and the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 346 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501] (Hendricks), we reversed that consolidated action in <em>Hedge I, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 733. <em>Hedge I </em>was then granted review October 29, 1997, by the California Supreme Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">In the meantime, Hedge was returned to the jurisdiction of the DOC after the first petition was dismissed for release on parole. Subsequently, Hedge\u2019s parole was revoked by the DOC. Sometime before his recalculated 1997 parole release date, the DOC again referred Hedge for evaluation as an SVP. Based on new evaluations performed by the same psychotherapists who evaluated him in 1996, the DMH wrote to the D.A.\u2019s Office again identifying Hedge as a potential SVP under the Act. The new reports dated December 12 and 23, 1997, incorporated the psychotherapists\u2019 earlier 1996 reports and concluded Hedge currently had the requisite \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder\u201d and dangerousness to qualify as an SVP. On January 28, 1998, the People filed a second/current petition, attaching the new and old evaluations and a declaration of counsel, which requested the superior court commence proceedings to determine whether Hedge should be committed as an SVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">Before the probable cause hearing was held, the trial court entertained Hedge\u2019s demurrer/motion to dismiss on grounds the court lacked jurisdiction to proceed because the petition was the \u201csame cause of action,\u201d \u201cpending between the same parties,\u201d and was identical to that in <em>Hedge I </em>except for the addition of new evaluations. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (c).) In the alternative, Hedge argued the instant proceedings should be held in abeyance because of the constitutional issues pending in <em>Hedge I. </em>The court overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to dismiss, accepting the People\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>position that, constitutional issues aside, <em>Hedge I </em>focused on Hedge\u2019s then-mental condition and dangerousness which was separate from his current mental condition and dangerousness alleged in this second petition. The court thereafter found probable cause to hold Hedge for trial as a potential SVP. (\u00a7 6602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">At trial, the People presented the testimony of the two psychologists, Drs. L. C. Miccio-Fonseca and Amy Phenix, who had performed the 1996 and 1997 clinical evaluations, and who opined Hedge currently was an SVP under the Act. Each found Hedge had diagnosable mental disorders that affected his emotional or volutional capacity and predisposed him to engage in sexually violent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Dr. Theodore Donaldson, a clinical psychologist, testified on behalf of Hedge<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that the diagnostic procedures used by Miccio-Fonseca and Phenix were unreliable and that any impairment or predisposition Hedge may have had in 1989 no longer existed, and thus he did not qualify as an SVP. Forensic Psychologist Meredith Friedman, who had performed the psychological evaluation for the defense before Hedge was sentenced in his 1989 criminal case, concurred with Donaldson that Hedge did not qualify as an SVP. She opined Hedge had made positive changes in the last decade through his treatment and that it was not \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he would become an SVP in the future. The jury determined otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">At the outset, we note the facts below conflicted as to whether Hedge\u2019s parole was revoked for one year under Penal Code section 3056 on the ground he needed psychiatric treatment within the meaning of section 2616, subdivision (a)(7), of title 15 of the California Code of Regulations (the Regulation) after his first SVP petition was dismissed or whether he remained on parole from July 22, 1996, until he was arrested September 23, 1997, for a parole violation and then reincarcerated. His trial counsel made both representations to the court. Either way, Hedge was in the custody of the DOC at the time the second SVP evaluation was performed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>petition filed. Because the jurisdictional issues raised by Hedge and addressed by both parties on appeal assume he was in custody due to revocation under the Regulation, we accept such premise for purposes of our discussion of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">A. <em>Effect of pending appeal in Hedge I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Relying on the long-established principle that upon the filing of a notice of appeal by either party in a civil action, jurisdiction vests in the appellate court until the appeal is determined and remittitur issues, Hedge contends, as he did below, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed on the second/current petition filed under the Act because his first petition which alleged the \u201csame cause of action\u201d remained on appeal before the California Supreme Court. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 430.10, 916.) In the alternative, he argues that even if the trial court found this petition encompassed a different action than in <em>Hedge I, </em>it should have held this petition in abeyance under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c) because the same constitutional challenges and issues were pending in <em>Hedge I. </em>We conclude, as did the court below, that due to the nature of proceedings under the Act the second petition was properly before the trial court as a new action even though such involved similar issues as in <em>Hedge I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">In reversing the judgment of dismissal in <em>Hedge </em>/, we remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to vacate its orders sustaining his demurrer to the petition and ordering him released and to enter new orders overruling his demurrer insofar as it was based on the constitutional violations addressed in our opinion, to direct his interim detention in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act pending further proceedings, and to conduct the further proceedings specified in the Act in a manner consistent with our opinion. Before our directions could be carried out, <em>Hedge I </em>was granted review by the California Supreme Court. As noted above, the record is unclear as to the dates and circumstances of Hedge\u2019s periods of actual custody with the DOC between the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his first SVP petition and the filing of the second. The supplemental statement of facts submitted by his counsel on the demurrer/motion to dismiss the second petition represented Hedge was released on parole in July 1996 and not again under the custody of the DOC until he was arrested for a parole violation in September 1997. If these facts are taken as true, Hedge\u2019s situation is entirely different than argued below and on appeal that this petition was based on the same identical facts and cause of action as in the first petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">Even if we assume Hedge\u2019s parole was immediately revoked for a year under the Regulation, and that the facts in the second petition were basically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>the same except for new evaluations by the same psychologists who had performed the evaluations for the first petition, we still conclude the court had jurisdiction to entertain the second petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">As the People point out, the Act provides that \u201c[wjhenever\u201d the DOC determines that a qualifying individual in its custody may be an SVP, the DOC shall refer that person for evaluation in accordance with section 6601. (\u00a7 6601, subd. (a).) Once the referral is made, if the person is found to meet the criteria of section 6600, the matter is then directed to the proper designated authority in any particular county to consider filing a petition to commit the alleged SVP because of a \u201c \u2018currently diagnosed mental disorder which predisposes [him or her] to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u2019 \u201d (Historical Note, 73D West\u2019s Ann. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 6600, p. 250; \u00a7 6601, subds. (d), (h) &amp; (i).) The filing of the petition commences a series of proceedings which, if followed through, may conclude with the factual determination, by court or jury, that the person named in the petition is an SVP subject to commitment under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">As the court in <em>Hubbart </em>noted, the Act viewed as a whole \u201cis also designed to ensure that the committed person does not \u2018remain confined any longer than he suffers from a mental abnormality rendering him unable to control his dangerousness.\u2019 [Citation.] In general, each period of commitment is strictly limited and cannot be extended unless the state files a new petition and again proves, beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is dangerous and mentally impaired. (\u00a7 6604.) Although committed for two years, the SVP is entitled each year to a new mental examination and to judicial review of the commitment to determine whether his condition has changed such that he no longer poses a danger to the health and safety of others. (\u00a7 6605, subds. (a)-(c).) . . . The SVP is entitled to unconditional release and discharge if he prevails in this proceeding. <em>{Id., </em>subd. (e).)\u201d <em>{Hubbart </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">The nature of the Act thus envisions a special civil commitment proceeding that is begun and then continues, changes or ends depending upon the current mental condition and dangerousness of the proposed or committed SVP at the time he or she is nearing release from the custody of the DOC. Although the same requirements or issues are involved in alleging any \u201ccause\u201d filed via petition under the Act, the actual facts or circumstances comprising that \u201ccause\u201d in a subsequent petition will necessarily be different due to the addition of new facts bearing on those issues based on the sheer passage of time which may support the release or commitment of the proposed SVP. Because of the short time periods involved for the commencement of proceedings and commitment durations and extensions under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>the Act, the Legislature certainly must have recognized that active civil appeals might often still be pending when a new petition or matter concerning the same alleged SVP comes before the trial court. We thus believe the Legislature intended the trial court to have continuing jurisdiction in such special civil proceedings, as in other civil commitment proceedings (see <em>Conservatorship of James M. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 293, 297-299 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 567]), to consider and review new matters involving the same person even when an earlier petition or matter is pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Hedge would have us treat this proceeding as a regular civil action rather than a special proceeding which is subject to slightly different rules once an appeal of the matter is taken. Generally, \u201cthe perfecting of an appeal stays [the] proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 916, subd. (a).)  It has been stated that: \u201cThe purpose of the rule depriving the trial court of jurisdiction in a case during a pending appeal is to protect the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided. The rule prevents the trial court from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by conducting other proceedings that may affect it. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Betz </em>v. <em>Pankow </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 931, 938 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 841].) This general rule of divestiture of jurisdiction, however, does not apply in \u201cspecial proceedings\u201d unless it is specifically made applicable by statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>(Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Tex-Cal Land Management, Inc. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707 [238 Cal.Rptr. 780, 739 P.2d 140]; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, 1063 et seq.) Moreover, notwithstanding a stay pending appeal, a trial court is not divested of its jurisdiction \u201cto determine \u2018ancillary or collateral matters\u2019 which do not affect the judgment on appeal.\u201d <em>{Silver </em>v. <em>Gold </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 17, 26 [259 Cal.Rptr. 185].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">As the arguments before the court below and the nature of the Act show, the second petition embraced new allegations that Hedge in December of 1997 qualified as an SVP, which were in addition to the allegations in the petition filed in 1996 in <em>Hedge I. </em>The issues on appeal in <em>Hedge I </em>concerned the legal issues of whether the Act is constitutional. At the time of the motion below, Hedge had yet to raise any constitutional issues regarding the Act with respect to this second petition and the United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>had rendered its opinion in <em>Hendricks </em>upholding the constitutionality of a similar Kansas SVP law. Under these circumstances, we cannot say the trial court erred in finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the second (current) petition. Regardless of whether such petition is characterized as new or as supplemental to the first petition, we believe the nature of these special civil proceedings under the Act reflects a Legislative intent that they be exempt from the general civil rule that the perfecting of an appeal automatically divests a trial court of jurisdiction over subsequent petitions properly filed in such proceedings. Because we so hold, we do not address Hedge\u2019s alternative claim the court should have held the second petition in abeyance pending resolution of <em>Hedge I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">B. <em>Effect of invalid parole revocation term.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">Relying on the holding in <em>Terhune </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 864 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 841], which held the psychiatric parole revocation procedure set forth in the Regulation is invalid, Hedge also alleges the trial court was without jurisdiction to proceed under the Act to try him as an SVP because this second petition was filed while he was \u201cunlawfully\u201d in the custody of the DOC. Such assertion is premised upon the ground his parole revocation term under the Regulation was improper as it was subsequently determined to be invalid by the <em>Terhune </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">Essentially, Hedge\u2019s contention, like those raised in <em>Garcetti </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1105 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 724] (hereafter <em>Garcetti) and in People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Whitley) (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1383 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 189] (hereafter <em>Whitley), </em>is whether lawful custody is a jurisdictional requirement for the filing of a petition for civil commitment under the Act. Hedge acknowledges that the courts in <em>Garcetti </em>and <em>Whitley </em>resolved the issue against him, but asserts those cases were wrongly decided. However, after carefully reviewing the reasoning in <em>Garcetti </em>and <em>Whitley, </em>we agree with those courts that the holding of <em>Terhune </em>does not negate the trial court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to proceed under the properly filed second petition to declare Hedge an SVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Moreover, as the People point out, Hedge did not directly challenge the validity of his custody under the Regulation by administrative appeal or petition for writ of habeas corpus. Nor did he challenge the filing of the current second petition under the Act on such grounds until this appeal. As the courts in <em>Garcetti </em>and <em>Whitley </em>determined, the unambiguous language of the Act contains no requirement a defendant\u2019s custody be \u201clawful\u201d at the time such petition is filed, only that the person alleged to be an SVP be in \u201ccustody under the jurisdiction of the [DOC].\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd.

Further, if an inmate is received by the DOC with less than nine months to serve, the director may refer the person for evaluation \u201cat a date that is less than six months prior to the inmate\u2019s scheduled release date.\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd.

The judge hearing Hedge\u2019s demurrer/motion to dismiss the second petition for lack of jurisdiction due to the pendency of <em>Hedge I </em>specifically queried counsel on whether the trial court was the proper court in which to request a stay of the matter in light of the nature of these proceedings. Counsel noted he would take the matter up if the court denied his motion. Counsel did not do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 1466.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
