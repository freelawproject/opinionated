J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASs\">Plaintiff Chaker Suidan appeals a judgment favoring defendants County of San Diego (County), the Superior Court of the County of San Diego (Superior Court), and Kenneth E. Martone on Suidan\u2019s complaint for violation of Government Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 69904, fraud, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Suidan contends the court erred in sustaining without leave to amend defendants\u2019 demurrer to his claim for breach of the implied covenant, granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication on his claim for violation of section 69904, and denying him leave to file an amended complaint alleging fraud against Martone. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">After 17 years of working for the county clerk and then the Superior Court, Suidan was discharged from his employment by the Superior Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>executive officer, Martone. After his employment termination was affirmed by the Superior Court\u2019s personnel committee, Suidan sued defendants in the federal district court on various theories based on his assertedly wrongful termination. Ultimately, the federal appellate court affirmed portions of a defense summary judgment, but reversed another portion of the summary judgment and remanded the matter to the federal district court. Upon remand, the federal district court granted another defense summary judgment on some of Suidan\u2019s claims and dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction Suidan\u2019s remaining claim based on section 69904.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Suidan then filed this lawsuit against defendants in state court for violation of section 69904, fraud, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On the ground of res judicata/collateral estoppel, the court sustained without leave to amend defendants\u2019 demurrer to Suidan\u2019s claim for breach of the implied covenant. Further, concluding section 69898<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permitted the Superior Court to delegate to its executive officer the authority to remove Superior Court employees, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Suidan\u2019s claim for violation of section 69904. Finally, on the alternative grounds of res judicata/collateral estoppel and the statute of limitations, the court denied Suidan\u2019s request to file an amended complaint to allege with specificity a fraud claim against Martone.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Suidan seeks reversal and remand for trial on his claim against the County and the Superior Court for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>fair dealing, his claim against the Superior Court for violation of section 69904, and his claim against Martone for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\n<em>Demurrer to Suidan\u2019s Claim for Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">\n<em>Summary Judgment/Summary Adjudication on Suidan\u2019s Claim Under Section 69904</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In this lawsuit Suidan alleged that the Superior Court\u2019s actions in terminating his employment in March 1991 and attempting to terminate his employment retroactively in March 1996 were wrongful as not complying with section 69904. The court granted the Superior Court\u2019s motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication on Suidan\u2019s claim for violation of section 69904. In concluding the Superior Court properly delegated to its executive officer, Martone, the authority to terminate the employment of Superior Court employee Suidan, the court stated, \u201c[T]he authority granted to superior courts pursuant to section 69898 to delegate to the court executive officer any administrative powers and duties required to be exercised by the court includes the authority to delegate the power to remove superior court employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Asserting the court\u2019s interpretation of section 69904 was an erroneous conclusion of law, Suidan contends the court should have determined that section 69904 imposes a nondelegable duty on the Superior Court judges to make employment termination decisions. According to Suidan, the only permissible delegation of authority by the Superior Court judges would be delegation of the implementation of an employment termination decision once the judges performed their obligation under section 69904 to exercise their discretion in making such decision. Suidan characterizes section 69904 as providing \u201cthe only thin thread that gives the appointed employee protection from a solitary arbitrary removal decision in the first instance\u201d regardless of \u201csubsequent review options, none of which satisfies the section 69904 imperative that a majority of the judges have exercised their discretion in [mjaking the decision.\u201d Hence, Suidan concludes he had a \u201cviable statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>cause of action\u201d since the Superior Court judges assertedly did not exercise \u201ctheir own administrative discretion in the original termination decision\u201d and the 1996 retroactive termination was assertedly \u201can invalid exercise of judicial authority.\u201d However, as we shall explain, under section 69898 the Superior Court judges properly delegated to the court\u2019s executive officer, Martone, the authority under section 69904 to remove Superior Court employee Suidan, and Martone acted within such authority in March 1991 in terminating Suidan\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">\n<em>Undisputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">For purposes of determining the propriety of the summary judgment/ summary adjudication favoring the Superior Court on Suidan\u2019s claim for violation of section 69904, we state the facts in the light most favorable to Suidan. <em>(Stratton </em>v. <em>First Nat. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1083 [258 Cal.Rptr. 721].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">On May 11, 1988, the Superior Court adopted personnel rules containing a provision delegating to the Superior Court\u2019s executive officer authority over personnel matters including removal of court employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">On December 1, 1989, the Superior Court executive officer (Martone) wrote Suidan and offered him a position with the Superior Court. Martone\u2019s letter stated that Suidan would serve at the executive officer\u2019s pleasure, Suidan\u2019s position would be governed by the Superior Court\u2019s personnel rules, and Suidan would no longer be subject to civil service rules. Martone and his management support staff met personally with county clerk personnel before the transfer of Suidan and 295 other employees to the Superior Court and answered questions about posttransfer employment conditions. Suidan attended one such meeting. Martone personally participated in drafting documents that employees were required to sign in order to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">On March 14, 1991, Martone terminated Suidan\u2019s employment without consulting beforehand with any Superior Court judge about such termination. Martone based his authority to terminate Suidan\u2019s employment on the Superior Court\u2019s personnel rules. Suidan sought review of Martone\u2019s decision by the Superior Court\u2019s personnel committee. The personnel committee affirmed the termination decision as within Martone\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>In 1993 Suidan filed a first amended complaint in the federal district court involving the circumstances of his employment termination. Suidan appealed to the federal appellate court the summary judgment granted by the federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">In November 1995 the federal appellate court remanded to the federal district court the issue whether the Superior Court judges had exercised their discretion under section 69904 to terminate Suidan\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In March 1996, after remand of Suidan\u2019s federal lawsuit to the federal district court, the Superior Court judges voted to terminate Suidan effective retroactively to March 14, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">We examine the facts presented on the Superior Court\u2019s summary judgment/summary adjudication motion and independently determine their effect as a matter of law. <em>{Stratton </em>v. <em>First Nat. Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at p. 1083.) \u201cWe also conduct independent review of the trial court\u2019s determination of questions of law. We are not bound by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons, if any, supporting its ruling; we review the ruling, not its rationale.\u201d {Ibid.; see also <em>Environmental Protection Information Center </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1015-1016 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Section 69904, subdivision (b) provides that all personnel appointed by the judges \u201cmay at any time be removed by the majority of the judges in their discretion.\u201d Section 69898, subdivision (a) provides that any superior court \u201cmay delegate\u201d to its appointed executive officer \u201cany administrative powers and duties required to be exercised by the court.\u201d California Rules of Court, rule 207(1) states that the court executive officer shall \u201cadminister a court approved personnel plan\u201d providing for, among other things, \u201cremoval of employees of the court.\u201d San Diego Superior Court Rules, former rule 4.3 provided that a court employee in Suidan\u2019s position \u201cmay be removed by the Executive Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">In sum, section 69898 expressly authorized the Superior Court to delegate to its executive officer any administrative powers and duties required to be exercised by the court. One such administrative power was set forth in section 69904, namely, the power to remove personnel appointed by the judges. Thus, under section 69898, the Superior Court could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>delegate to its executive officer its section 69904 power of removal. Further, in accord with California Rules of Court, rule 207, the Superior Court by its personnel rules in fact delegated such removal power to its executive officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Our construction of section 69898 is consistent with case law construing such statute as permitting superior court judges to delegate to the court\u2019s executive officer various responsibilities for court personnel. <em>(American Federation of State etc. Employees </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 506, 516 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 51]; <em>Sacramento County Employees Organization </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 845, 852 [247 Cal.Rptr. 333]; <em>Service Employees Internat.

Union </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.3d 1005, the appellate court faced the question whether courtroom clerks were county employees under a current memorandum of understanding between the county and a union. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1007-1008.) The superior court in that county had adopted a local rule (Super. Ct. Santa Clara County Rules, former rule 25) transferring from the county clerk to the superior court\u2019s executive officer various administrative duties and responsibilities with respect to the employment of certain specified personnel. <em>(Service Employees Internat. Union </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 1007-1008.) In concluding that courtroom clerks were not county employees subject to the current memorandum of understanding, the appellate court stated: \u201cThe current memorandum of understanding is applicable only to county employees, but it does not define the term. Under general principles of law, several factors\u2014power of appointment, right to control, power to discharge, payment of salary, nature of services, civil service status\u2014will enter into a determination whether a given person employed in a position related to [the superior court\u2019s] functions is a court employee or a county employee.
