Arambula was employed as a field supervisor in a family-owned company in which his brother owned 70 percent of the stock, his parents owned 15 percent, and he owned 15 percent. Despite missing work because of his injuries, he continued to receive his $2,800 weekly salary. He testified his brother \u201cwished\u201d to be reimbursed, but he had not promised to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Arambula sued Wells for negligence. His claim for damages included loss of earnings during the period of his disability. His wife, Diane Arambula, sued for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Wells admitted fault, and the case went to trial on causation and damages alone. Arambula contended he sustained a severe brain injury as a result of the accident. Wells denied this.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">At the start of trial, Wells moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude all evidence and testimony regarding Arambula\u2019s lost wages claim of approximately $50,000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>Her attorney, relying on dicta in a footnote in <em>Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1, 6, fn. 5 [84 Cal.Rptr. 173, 465 P.2d 61, 77 A.L.R.3d 398], argued, \u201cPlaintiff is not receiving payment by means of disability insurance, pension or from utilizing . . . sick time or vacation time. Further, plaintiff has failed to provide any documentation or demand that the monies received from his employer will be required to be reimbursed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The judge agreed. Based on <em>Helfend, </em>he instructed the jury not to award damages for lost earnings \u201cbecause his employer paid for the time he was off without any requirement to do so and there was no agreement by plaintiff to refund same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The jury awarded $54,334 to Arambula, but nothing to his wife. Both appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Under the collateral source rule, plaintiffs in personal injury actions can still recover full damages even though they already have received compensation for their injuries from such \u201ccollateral sources\u201d as medical insurance. <em>{Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 174, 176 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 522].) The idea is that tortfeasors should not recover a windfall from the thrift and foresight of persons who have actually or constructively secured insurance, pension or disability benefits to provide for themselves and their families. A contrary rule, it is feared, would misallocate liability for tort-caused losses and discourage people from obtaining benefits from independent collateral sources. <em>{Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 13-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\"><em>Helfend </em>is the leading case. The court rejected defense efforts to introduce evidence that about 80 percent of an injured motorist\u2019s medical bills had been paid by his Blue Cross insurance carrier. Applying a benefit of the bargain rationale, the Supreme Court allowed the motorist to receive the advantage of his investment of \u201cyears of insurance premiums to assure his medical care.\u201d It stated \u201c[t]he tortfeasor should not gamer the benefits of his victim\u2019s providence.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at pp. 9-10.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\"><em>Helfend </em>on its face says nothing about gratuitous wage payments. Wells, however, cited <em>Helfend </em>to convince the trial court to limit the collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>source rule to situations where plaintiffs incurred an expense, obligation or liability in obtaining the services for which they seek compensation. According to Wells, <em>Helfend </em>is \u201creplete with indications that the California Supreme Court does not intend for the collateral source rule to apply to gratuitous payments and services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Wells specifically relied on footnote 5 in <em>Helfend </em>where the court expounded (at some length) about the collateral source rule as interpreted in New York: \u201cThe New York Court of Appeals has, for example, <em>quite reasonably </em>held that an injured physician may not recover from a tortfeasor for the value of medical and nursing care rendered gratuitously as a matter of professional courtesy. [Citation.] The doctor owed at least a moral obligation to render gratuitous services in return, if ever required; but he had neither paid premiums for the services under some form of insurance coverage nor manifested any indication that he would endeavor to repay those who had given him assistance. Thus this situation differs from that in which friends and relatives render assistance to the injured plaintiff with the expectation of repayment out of any tort recovery; in that case, the rule has been applied.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at p. 6, fn. 5, italics added.)  Wells contends footnote 5 created a new rule of law in California, creating an exception for gratuitous benefits where the injured party has incurred no expense, obligation or liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We disagree. It is arguable whether footnote 5 even rises to the level of dicta. <em>Helfend </em>itself did not see it that way. To the contrary, the court cautioned, \u201cWe expressly do not consider or determine the appropriateness of the rule\u2019s application in the myriad of possible situations which we have not discussed or which are not presented by the facts of this case.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at p. 6, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We take <em>Helfend </em>at its word. Not only do we consider its language at face value, but we construe it in the light of its facts and the issues raised. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 296].)  While we do not take lightly any of the Supreme Court\u2019s statements, we reasonably construe them in the context of the thoroughness of the court\u2019s analysis and in light of its prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>expressions on the same subject. <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 66 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1169 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 819]; see also 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 947, p. 989.) There are five specific reasons why footnote 5 fails to pass these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">First, there is the matter of existing California law (prior to <em>Helfend), </em>which made no special distinction for purely gratuitous collateral benefits. In <em>Tremeroli </em>v. <em>Austin Trailer Equip. Co. </em>(1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 464, 482 [227 P.2d 923], the court stated, \u201cThe same rule [as to collateral sources] seems to apply to wages paid an injured person by the employer. The injured employee may still recover the full amount of such wages from the wrongdoer.\u201d The Supreme Court repeated similar language in <em>Fifield Manor </em>v. <em>Finston </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 632, 637 [7 Cal.Rptr. 377, 354 P.2d 1073, 78 A.L.R.2d 813]: \u201cThe fact that <em>either under contract or gratuitously </em>such treatment has been paid for by another does not defeat the cause of action of the injured party to recover the reasonable value of such treatment from the tortfeasor.\u201d (Italics added.) If the Supreme Court desired to throw into doubt such long-established pronouncements (including its own decision in <em>Fifield Manor), </em>we believe it would have done so more directly than through footnote 5\u2019s oblique references to New York decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Second, no subsequent appellate opinion has construed footnote 5 in the highly expansive manner suggested by Wells. To the contrary, several <em>post-Helfend </em>decisions have allowed plaintiffs to recover the costs of gratuitous medical care as an element of their damages even without any contractual right to reimbursement. <em>(Hanif </em>v. <em>Housing Authority </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 635, 644 [246 Cal.Rptr. 192] [parents who cared for minor child can recover special damages for reasonable costs of such care based on prevailing rates for home care nurses, even though services were rendered \u201cwithout an agreement or expectation of payment\u201d]; <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 626, 662 [151 Cal.Rptr. 399] [same with respect to wife who provided 24-hour-a-day attendant care to her injured husband: \u201cInsofar as gratuities ar\u00e9 concerned, the rule appears to be in keeping with the collateral source rule rationale.\u201d]; see also <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 180 [\u201c[I]n California even [gratuitous] benefits are subject to the collateral source rule.\u201d].) Wells\u2019s proposal would create a conflict in the law with the case authority <em>Hanif, Rodriguez </em>and <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Third, a majority of jurisdictions and many commentators are in accord. (See 4 Harper et al., Law of Torts (2d ed. 1986) \u00a7 25.22, p. 661 [\u201cMost of the cases do not subtract a gift from tort damages.\u201d]; Johns, Cal. Damages (5th ed. 1996) \u00a7 1.66, p. 1-80 [\u201cThe right of the injured person to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>damages for loss of earnings or impairment of earning capacity is not affected by the fact the employer may have continued to pay the injured person while he or she was disabled. . . . This is the weight of authority in other states.\u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">In <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1998) 334 Ark. 561 [976 S.W.2d 382], a hospital partially forgave a patient\u2019s medical bills. The court held the patient was entitled to recover compensation for the full amount of the harm inflicted upon her, notwithstanding the discount, stating \u201cThere is no evidence of record showing that [defendant] had anything to do with procuring the discount of [plaintiff\u2019s] bill by [the hospital]. The rationale of the rule favors her, just as it would had she been compensated by insurance for which she had arranged.\u201d (976 S.W.2d at p. 384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Fourth, public policy concerns weigh heavily in favor of application of the collateral source rule to gratuitous payments and services. Just as the Supreme Court in <em>Helfend </em>found the rule \u201cexpresses a policy judgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for personal injuries and for other eventualities\u201d <em>(Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 10), so too we adhere to the rule to promote policy concerns favoring private charitable assistance. Indeed, until recent times, family assistance has been the primary means of coping with a tragedy in this country. Were we to permit a tortfeasor to mitigate damages because of a third party\u2019s charitable gift, the plaintiff would be in a worse position than had nothing been done. Why would a family member (or a stranger) freely give of his or her money or time if the wrongdoer would ultimately reap the benefits of such generosity?</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The concept of charity is embedded in basic notions of civic virtue, finding expression in legislation ranging from tax law to wills and estates and many others. When called upon to construe private humanitarianism, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>\u201c \u2018courts do not now adopt an antagonistic spirit toward [a donor\u2019s] charitable intent for it is the rule that where doubt exists, a gift must be interpreted in favor of a charity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Heil </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1503, 1510 [259 Cal.Rptr. 28]; see also <em>Estate of Tarrant </em>(1951) 38 Cal.2d 42, 46 [237 P.2d 505, 28 A.L.R.2d 419] [\u201cIt is the policy of the law to favor gifts for charitable purposes . . . .\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">This is more than \u201cdo-gooderism\u201d; the state\u2019s own self-interest is involved as well. To the extent that private generosity steps to the fore, the impact on the state is lightened \u201cby rendering beneficences which the state would otherwise be obliged to furnish or indirectly further the interests of the state by the public benefit they promote.\u201d <em>(Estate of Fleming </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 514, 519 [190 P.2d 611].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Charitable contributions are primarily motivated by the intended use to which donations are put. Under these circumstances, we logically turn to the intent of the donors. Whom did they intend to help when they gratuitously agreed to cover lost wages? The person who caused the accident? Or the victim? We doubt such gifts would continue if, notwithstanding a donor\u2019s desire to aid the injured, the person who caused the injury ultimately stood to gain a windfall. Donors should not have to consult with a lawyer to make sure their largesse is not hijacked by the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">We do not necessarily consider a tort recovery made after gratuitous benefits are received as a windfall to the plaintiff, although- it clearly might be a windfall to the defendant. As one leading treatise puts it, \u201cCompensation in these cases is not double in any true sense. It might be condemned under a system that would give to each only according to his need, but even the Marxists have put aside this part of their philosophy for their nirvana.\u201d (4 Harper et al., Law of Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25.22 at p. 661.) If a generous person chooses to pay the wages of someone who has been injured, intending to add the gift to the latter\u2019s compensation, \u201cthere seems to be no good reason for denying effect to such intention or for diverting it to another beneficiary, whether that other is a wrongdoer or not. ... In these cases of private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>generosity the best solution seems to be a rule of thumb that would give greatest scope to the donor\u2019s generosity and to the adjustment of moral obligations within the more or less intimate relationships that usually bring such generosity into play. The gift should be disregarded in assessing damages.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 661-663.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Even without an ironclad requirement of reimbursement, the plaintiff may be motivated to repay the donor from any tort recovery, or, inspired by example, to similar acts of generosity on the notion that one good act leads to another. Such reimbursement would avoid any prospects of a double recovery, as if there ever could be a double recovery where pain and suffering is concerned. Moreover, as <em>Helfend </em>noted, the injured victim may not have been made whole because generally \u201cplaintiff\u2019s attorney will receive a large portion of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in contingent fees . . . . The collateral source rule partially serves to compensate for the attorney\u2019s share and does not actually render \u2018double recovery\u2019 for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>{Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The rationale of the collateral source-rule thus favors sheltering gratuitous gifts of money or services intended to benefit tort victims, just as it favors insurance payments from coverage they had arranged. No reason exists in these circumstances to confer a bonanza upon the party causing the injury. As one court noted nearly a century ago in connection with an employer\u2019s voluntary wage payment, \u201c[I]f time has been lost as the result of a tort, sound sense, common justice, and, it may be, public policy would demand that the tortfeasor be prohibited from making a defense founded upon the proposition . . . that some third person, not only not in sympathy with the wrongdoer, but despising him and his act, has, from some worthy motive, paid to the injured person an amount which, if it had come from the wrongdoer, would have equaled the damages which would have been assessed against him.\u201d <em>{Nashville, C. &amp; St. L.Ry. </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1904) 120 Ga. 453. [47 S.E. 959, 960].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">While a gift is presumptively intended for the benefit of the donee, the presumption should be a rebuttable one. We can posit examples where a wrongdoer\u2019s family or friends might pay the victim\u2019s bills out of a sense of moral obligation or atonement. Public policy encourages such expiation. Under these circumstances the tortfeasor may well be entitled to an offset to effectuate the donors\u2019 intent and to avoid a double recovery. Put another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>way, such sources might not be considered as \u201cwholly independent\u201d of the tortfeasor. (See, e.g., <em>Kardly </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 479, 485 [255 Cal.Rptr. 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">We also do not decide whether the collateral source rule extends to payments from a public source.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question of gratuitous <em>public </em>benefits is not at issue here and invokes a host of other concerns, which must be considered in light of their specific factual contexts. <em>(Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The collateral source rule operates both as a substantive rule of damages and as a rule of evidence. As a rule of evidence, it precludes the introduction of evidence of the plaintiff being compensated by a collateral source unless there is a \u201cpersuasive showing\u201d that such evidence is of \u201csubstantial probative value\u201d for purposes other than reducing damages. <em>(Hrnjak </em>v. <em>Graymar, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 725, 733 [94 Cal.Rptr. 623, 484 P.2d 599, 47 A.L.R.3d 224]; see also <em>Blake </em>v. <em>E. Thompson Petroleum Repair Co. </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 823, 830-832 [216 Cal.Rptr. 568].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">We do not resolve such issues of admissibility here, but leave them to the sound discretion of the trial judge on remand. <em>(Hrnjak </em>v. <em>Graymar, Inc., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 732-734.) We note, however, our decision does not automatically bar evidence that Arambula\u2019s wages were paid by his brother during his period of disability. For example, such evidence may be admissible, in the court\u2019s reasonable discretion and subject to a limiting instruction, to impeach his claimed inability to work. Evidence of actual wage payments may be persuasive to show that no time was lost, the employee actually performed substantial services during the period of disability, or had a motive to malinger. (See <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co. </em>(1985) 396 Mass. 1 [483 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>N.E.2d 793, 802] [evidence of collateral source income relevant to show employee had motive other than physical disability not to work].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In <em>Pensak </em>v. <em>Peerless Oil Co. </em>(1933) 311 Pa. 207, 210 [166 A. 792], an employee received salary payments (as a supposed gift) from his father and brother (who were co-owners of the business) during the time of his incapacity. But the court distinguished between making a claim of gift and proving it: \u201cCharacterizing as a gift the money paid to him does not make it so. To permit a recovery of money under the guise of wages lost would, with the facts as they here appear, open a wide door to misrepresentation and fraud in this class of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">IV-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The defense verdict on Diane Arambula\u2019s loss of consortium claim in No. G023337 is affirmed. As to Michael Arambula, the cause in No. G023337 is remanded to the trial court for a limited new trial to determine the amount of damages for lost wages (if any) legally caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. The judgment for damages in his favor is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The appeal in No. G023921 is dismissed. In the interest of justice, the parties are to bear their own costs in these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Sills, P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">The petition of all appellants for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 1, 1999.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\">The collateral source rule also recognizes the inadequacies of damage awards for personal injuries. That is because \u201c[ljegal \u2018compensation\u2019 for personal injuries does not actually compensate. Not many people would sell an arm for the average or even the maximum amount that juries award for loss of an arm. Moreover the injured person seldom gets the compensation he \u2018recovers,\u2019 for a substantial attorney\u2019s fee usually comes out of it. The Rule helps to remedy these problems inherent in compensating the tort victim.\u201d (Note, <em>California\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number><em>Collateral Source Rule and Plaintiff\u2019s Receipt of Uninsured Motorist Benefits </em>(1986) 37 Hastings L.J. 667, 672.) Since collateral sources only cover economic damages like medical costs and lost earnings, there is no possibility of a double recovery for intangibles like pain and suffering \u201cwhich can be translated into monetary loss only with great difficulty.\u201d <em>(Capelouto </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 889, 893 [103 Cal.Rptr. 856, 500 P.2d 880].) Rather than overcompensating a plaintiff, the collateral source rule \u201cpartially provides a somewhat closer approximation to full compensation for his injuries.\u201d <em>(Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal.

The reason advanced in support of the majority rule is that if anyone should profit by the payments it should be the injured employee rather than the tortfeasor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">One commentator, however, rates the issue a toss-up: \u201cThe application of the collateral source rule to benefits provided to the plaintiff as- a gratuity is not totally clear. . . . ffl] While the treatment of unconditional gratuities may be unclear, the collateral source rule clearly applies in cases when the plaintiff would be obligated to repay what would otherwise be a gratuity if the plaintiff becomes able to do so.\u201d (4 Levy et al., Cal.

The court acted in part because \u201cif a public entity which had accepted a.gift of property subject to a condition limiting the use of that property were permitted to avoid the force of the donor\u2019s restriction, donors would be discouraged from malting such gifts in the future.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 628.)
