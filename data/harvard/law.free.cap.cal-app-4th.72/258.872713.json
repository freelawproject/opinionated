The Commission on Judicial Performance (the commission) timely appeals from an order granting a petition for writ of mandate filed in June 1997 by The Recorder, a legal newspaper published in San Francisco, in an effort to compel the commission to disclose how individual commissioners voted in formal disciplinary proceedings concerning the Honorable Jose Angel Velasquez of the Municipal Court of Monterey County, and in all subsequent formal proceedings regarding judicial discipline. The Recorder contends that such disclosure is required by California Constitution, article VI, section 18, subdivision (j), a provision enacted as part of Proposition 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The commission claims it acted within its rulemaking authority as conferred by California Constitution, article VI, section 18, subdivision (i)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014 which was also enacted as part of Proposition 190\u2014by adopting procedures allowing it to withhold information about how individual commission members voted with respect to imposition of judicial discipline following \u201cformal proceedings,\u201d despite the fact that pursuant to section 18(j) all such proceedings must now be \u201copen to the public.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In fact, the commission has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>not adopted any specific rule affirmatively authorizing it to withhold this information from the public. Rather, the commission asserts that, even after passage of Proposition 190, it can simply continue its \u201clongstanding historical practice\u201d of revealing only the total vote count.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We conclude the vote of the members on whether or not to impose judicial discipline is such an essential and integral part of the formal proceedings of the commission\u2014perhaps the single most important act a member takes in his or her capacity as such\u2014that it would be plainly unreasonable to accept the commission\u2019s interpretation of its authority under section 18(i) and 18(j). That is, when California voters overwhelmingly approved a requirement that all \u201cproceedings\u201d subsequent to the filing of formal disciplinary charges \u201cshall be open to the public\u201d (\u00a7 18(j)), they must have intended the commission to vote in public or at least to disclose the full results of its vote, including how each commission member voted. We further conclude, however, that\u2014like an intermediate appellate court, or an administrative agency acting in an adjudicative capacity\u2014the commission is not required to conduct its \u201cdeliberations\u201d in public. Section 18(j) was clearly not intended as an \u201copen meeting\u201d law but, rather, as a provision relating to adjudicatory proceedings, as to which it is well settled and universally recognized that the judicial \u201cthought process\u201d need not be publicly revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Accordingly, in the published portion of this opinion, we affirm the order directing the commission to disclose the full results of the vote on discipline in Judge Velasquez\u2019s case and in all subsequent formal proceedings regarding judicial discipline under section 18(j). In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we consider and reject the commission\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its . discretion by awarding The Recorder its attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (hereinafter, section 1021.5). Thus, the order granting The Recorder\u2019s request for attorney fees is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">A. <em>The Enactment of Proposition 190 and Implementing Rules.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Proposition 190 was derived from Assembly -Constitutional Amendment No. 46, and placed on the November 8, 1994, ballot by the Legislature. (Assem. Const. Amend. No. 46 (1994-1995 Reg. Sess.) res. ch. 111.) The voters of California approved Proposition 190 at the November 1994 election, and thereby substantially amended sections 8 and 18 of article VI of the California Constitution. By its terms, Proposition 190 became operative on March 1, 1995. (\u00a7 18(j); and see <em>Dodds </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 163, 168, fn. 1 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 906 P.2d 1260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Proposition 190 effected several significant changes in the system for imposing judicial discipline in California. It increased the total membership of the commission from nine to eleven, and the number of public members from two to six, so that the public members would constitute a majority. (\u00a7 8(a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It vested the commission with ultimate authority to make censure and removal determinations, subject to discretionary review by the Supreme Court. (\u00a7 18(d).) It created absolute immunity for commission members and staff \u201cfrom suit for all conduct at any time in the course of their official duties.\u201d (\u00a7 18(h).) Most importantly for our purposes, Proposition 190 shifted authority to make rules \u201cfor the investigation of judges\u201d and \u201cfor formal proceedings\u201d from the Judicial Council to the commission itself (\u00a7 18(i)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and required that \u201cthe notice of charges, the answer, and <em>all subsequent papers and proceedings shall be open to the public </em>for all formal proceedings instituted after February 28, 1995.\u201d (\u00a7 18(j), italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">After Proposition 190 took effect, the commission undertook a review of its rules and procedures. Proposed rules were circulated for public comment early in 1996, and revised rules were adopted effective December 1, 1996. In the course of this rulemaking proceeding, one of The Recorder\u2019s attorneys, Stephen R. Barnett, submitted a letter urging the commission to amend its rules to provide that \u201cin the case of any official action by the [cjommission, the votes of the individual [cjommission members shall be made public.\u201d This comment was considered by the commission, but rejected, as follows: \u201cOne comment was received suggesting that the votes of the individual commission members should be made public. After consideration, the commission determined not to make this suggested modification, noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>disclosure does not appear to be required by Proposition 190 or any other provision of law. It is the commission\u2019s <em>policy </em>to release only the tally of total votes in favor of and against public discipline decisions in order to foster determinations unaffected by concerns extraneous to the impartial consideration of matters before the commission.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">B. <em>The Recorder\u2019s Prelitigation Requests for the Commission\u2019s Voting Records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Asserting a belief that Proposition 190 assured to the general public a right to know how individual commission members cast their votes in formal proceedings for judicial discipline, The Recorder wrote to the commission on September 5, 1996, asking for this information in each post-Proposition-190 case. The Recorder also took its case to its readership with an editorial entitled \u201cJudicial Panel\u2019s Votes Should Be Public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The commission refused to comply with these requests and, in a letter to The Recorder dated September 18, 1996, then Vice-Chair Robert C. Bonner explained its refusal as follows: \u201cProposition 190 did significantly open up the proceedings of the Commission on Judicial Performance through a series of broad, yet very specific changes. Nothing in Proposition 190, however, requires that the votes of individual members be made public, and individual commissioner\u2019s votes have never been made public during the commission\u2019s history. Because Proposition 190 vested in the commission the authority to promulgate its procedural rules, the issue of what voting information should be released was necessarily left to the commission. ffl] Important policy considerations weigh in favor of disclosing the total votes in support of and against commission action, but against disclosing the way each individual commissioner voted. Releasing only the total number of votes in favor and in opposition to the commission decision is intended to safeguard the independent voting of the commissioners. As distinct from the judiciary, the members of the commission do not serve full-time in their adjudicatory function. As the editorial recognizes, judges no longer comprise the majority of the commission\u2019s members. Today, the majority are public members and attorneys who may be appearing before the judges under the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. Disclosing how individual commissioners voted might well diminish the independence and objectivity so important to the commission\u2019s decision-making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">In a letter dated, October 1, 1996, the commission\u2019s director and chief counsel, Victoria B. Henley, added: \u201c[T]he breakdown of commission votes according to individual members has never been made public and the commission has determined to continue making public only the total number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of votes in support of and against commission action. Moreover, since the tally of votes for and against is the only information which has been made public historically, records have not been maintained by the commission of each member\u2019s individual voting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Judge Velasquez was publicly censured following formal proceedings instituted in August 1996. At the conclusion of those proceedings, the commission issued a decision and order, dated April 16, 1997, which announced its vote as \u201c8 to 2, with one [cjommissioner abstaining.\u201d On April 30, 1997, The Recorder again wrote to the commission, requesting disclosure of the commissioners\u2019 votes in that proceeding. The Recorder\u2019s letter was signed by its counsel and stated that The Recorder was authorized to take legal action if the requested information was not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">After thus receiving notice of the instant lawsuit, the commission issued an order dated May 28, 1997, reporting a modified vote count of \u201c7 to 2, with one [cjommissioner recused.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commission offered no explanation for the change in the vote tally and, in a letter signed by Mr. Bonner and dated June 2, 1997, reiterated its refusal to disclose how individual commission members voted. In the same letter, the commission asserted that it \u201cdoes not vote by written ballots, secret or otherwise, nor does it maintain any other records identifying how individual members voted.\u201d However, Mr. Bonner did not explain how the commission was otherwise able to uncover the error in the vote count (and abstention) disclosed in the April 16 decision and order, or how it confirmed the correctness of the vote count (and recusal) disclosed over a month later on May 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">C. <em>The Instant Litigation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On June 5, 1997, The Recorder filed a petition for writ of mandate in San Francisco Superior Court. Citing section 18(g),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the commission raised a jurisdictional objection to the mandate proceeding in superior court, contending that only the California Supreme Court has jurisdiction over it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>trial court reserved decision on the issue of jurisdiction and issued an alternative writ setting a hearing for June 26, 1997. On July 10, 1997, after considering the parties\u2019 briefs and arguments, the language of Proposition 190 and evidence of the voters\u2019 intent, the trial court issued an order requiring the commission \u201cto reveal how individual commissioners voted\u201d in the Velasquez matter and \u201cin all subsequent formal decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commission timely appealed from this order on July 17, 1997, in No. A079881.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">On August 19, 1997, The Recorder filed a motion seeking attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5. The commission vigorously opposed the motion. After a hearing on September 5, 1997, the trial court granted The Recorder\u2019s motion in full, applying a multiplier of 1.25 and awarding \u201cfees on fees\u201d for preparation of the motion, for a total award of $49,207.20. The trial court\u2019s order recited that it was granting The Recorder\u2019s fee request for \u201call the reasons stated in the Recorder\u2019s motion.\u201d The commission timely appealed from this order on September 30, 1997, in No. A080466.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">II. Discussion\u2014Appeal No. A079881</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In No. A079881, the parties\u2019 dispute centers on the commission\u2019s interpretation of its rulemaking authority under section 18(i), and its interpretation of section 18(j) insofar as it mandates that all \u201cproceedings\u201d subsequent to the filing of formal charges \u201cshall be open to the public.\u201d The commission contends, and The Recorder does not dispute, that all the issues presented in this appeal are pure questions of law, subject to de novo review by this court. <em>(Ghirardo </em>v. <em>Antonioli </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 799 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 883 P.2d 960].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">A. <em>The Superior Court Had Jurisdiction to Adjudicate The Recorder\u2019s Petition for Writ of Mandate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Before turning to the merits of this appeal, we must address the commission\u2019s claim, based on sections 18(g) and 18(h), that the superior court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate against it or its members or otherwise to review any determination it makes regarding judicial discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Obviously sections 18(g) and 18(h) do not, by their express terms, support the commission\u2019s argument. Those provisions make it clear that our Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over any \u201clegal proceeding of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sort <em>brought against the commission by a judge,\u201d </em>and that commissioners cannot be sued for any act undertaken in the course of their official duties. (Italics added.) Sections 18(g) and 18(h) do not\u2014expressly or otherwise\u2014 purport to limit the broad authority of the superior court, as conferred by article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to hear and decide petitions for writ of mandamus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The commission offers no cogent interpretation of the language used in section 18(g), and cites no ballot language or other historical data suggesting that the voters intended to insulate it from suit of any type in any judicial forum, save for actions by individual judges in the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the commission admits that section 18(g) does not \u201cspecifically address the issue of jurisdiction in writ proceedings brought against the commission by persons other than a judge.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Without recognizing even a hint of irony, the commission nevertheless contends that section 18(g) was designed to avoid the problem that arose in cases such as <em>Dodds </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 163, and <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 866 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 606, 897 P.2d 544], where individual judges brought proceedings in superior court seeking to block the commission from conducting <em>open </em>hearings. Vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, the commission claims, was intended to prevent such ancillary actions from delaying or interfering with disciplinary proceedings. However, there is no indication that the instant writ proceeding did, or could, delay or interfere with the Velasquez matter or with any other case pending before the commission.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The commission further contends that third parties should have no greater access to a judicial forum to litigate with the commission than do the judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>who are subject to discipline before that body. This is, however, just another way of saying that the voters intended to insulate the commission and its members from any lawsuit of any type in any judicial forum, except for actions by individual judges in the Supreme Court. As we have noted, the commission cites no statutory language or case law to support this sweeping claim of immunity, and we have found none in our research. Accordingly, we reject the commission\u2019s jurisdictional objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">B. <em>The Vote of the Commission Regarding Imposition of Judicial Discipline Is a Critical Stage of the \u201cFormal Proceedings\u201d Which Must Be \u201cOpen to the Public\u201d Pursuant to Section 18(j).</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfT\">The central issue presented in this appeal involves the commission\u2019s interpretation of sections 18(i) and 18(j). The commission claims it has fully complied with the mandate of section 18(j) by conducting all formal \u201cproceedings\u201d in open session, under rules it duly adopted after the passage of Proposition 190 regarding \u201cConfidentiality and Disclosure.\u201d (Rules Com. Jud. Performance, rule 102.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, during its rulemaking and before this court, the commission has interpreted the word \u201cproceedings\u201d in section 18(j) to mean \u201cany proceeding which the affected judge and his or her counsel could attend,\u201d including \u201call evidentiary hearings before the [cjommission or special masters and any oral arguments before the [cjommission itself,\u201d but not \u201cthe [c]ommission\u2019s deliberations or voting.\u201d For reasons we shall explain, we reject this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The rules governing interpretation of constitutional amendments are well established: \u201cConstitutional provisions must be construed to give full force and effect to every portion thereof. It is the legal intendment that each and every clause has been inserted for a useful purpose and when rightly understood has some practical operation. [Citations.] Furthermore, a constitutional amendment should be construed in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of the words as generally understood at the time of its enactment. [Citations.] Accordingly, where it does not appear that words used in a constitutional amendment were used in a technical sense, the voters must be deemed to have construed the amendment by the meaning apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>on its face according to the general use of the words employed. [Citations.] ... In the absence of definition of words in the Constitution, words having no technical meaning will be taken in their ordinary and generally accepted sense.

Past or contemporaneous agency interpretation can be particularly useful to resolve \u201capparent ambiguities\u201d in a new enactment. <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">1. <em>Section 18(j) Is Ambiguous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Maneuvering for an advantageous position on the battlefield of constitutional interpretation, the commission and The Recorder both contend, at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>initially, that section 18(j) is unambiguous and that the \u201cplain language\u201d used in that provision favors their respective\u2014but diametrically opposed\u2014 positions on the issue whether the votes of individual commission members must be disclosed to the public. That is, The Recorder contends that the term \u201cpapers\u201d or the term \u201cproceedings,\u201d or both, clearly encompass the casting and recording of votes by individual commissioners. For its \u201cplain language\u201d argument, the commission relies primarily on what is <em>not </em>found in section 18(j), i.e., on the <em>absence </em>of any specific provision requiring disclosure of the votes of individual commissioners. However, the commission also appears to contend that the \u201cformal hearing before the special masters and the appearance before the commission\u201d are its only \u201cproceedings,\u201d and that those are the only activities it must conduct in public. (See Rules Com. Jud. Performance, rule 102(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In its reply brief, the commission ultimately comes around to conceding that there is at least a \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d in the term \u201cproceedings.\u201d This concession is appropriate. (See <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 25 </em>Cal.3d at p. 495 [The conflicting contentions of the parties regarding meaning of former section 18(f) point to a latent ambiguity in that provision].)  As the <em>Mosk </em>court explained: \u201c \u2018[A] latent ambiguity is said to exist where the language employed is clear and intelligible and suggests but a single meaning, but some extrinsic evidence creates a <em>necessity </em>for interpretation or a choice among two or more <em>possible meanings.\u2019 </em>\u201d (25 Cal.3d at p. 495, fn. 18, italics in original, quoting Note, <em>Constitutional Law: The Doctrine of Latent Ambiguities as Applied to the California Constitution </em>(1943) 31 Cal.L.Rev. 203, 205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Indeed, the Legislature could hardly have chosen a more malleable term. \u201cThe word \u2018proceeding\u2019 necessarily has different meanings, according to the context and the subject to which it relates. ...

However, we must also examine \u201cevidence\u201d of the intent of the drafters and the voters who approved Proposition 190, including the ballot arguments prepared for the November 1994 elections. <em>{Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 495; <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch.

After carefully considering these ballot materials and the commission\u2019s arguments about the proper construction of section 18(j), we respectfully decline to accept the commission\u2019s interpretation because we believe it is clearly erroneous, and because it is at odds with the express intent and objectives of the drafters of Proposition 190 and the voters who approved the constitutional amendments contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">There are several problems with the commission\u2019s interpretation. It is, above all, far too grudging. In essence, the commission appears to treat the terms \u201cproceedings\u201d and \u201chearings\u201d as interchangeable. California courts</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>have long recognized that the term \u201cproceedings\u201d is broader than the term \u201chearings.\u201d <em>(Forrest </em>v. <em>Trustees of Cal. State University &amp; Colleges </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 357, 367 [206 Cal.Rptr. 595]; <em>Gipe </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 617, 625-626 [177 Cal.Rptr. 590], citing <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>140 Cal. at p. 6.) Indeed, as the <em>Gipe </em>court put it, any attempt to equate the two \u201cflies in the face of the ordinary meaning of \u2018proceedings.\u2019 \u201d (124 Cal.App.3d at p. 626.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The commission\u2019s attempt to equate the terms \u201cproceedings\u201d and \u201chearings\u201d also \u201cflies in the face\u201d of the history of sections 8 and 18. The broad significance of the phrase \u201call subsequent . . . proceedings\u201d in Proposition 190 and section 18(j) can, perhaps, best be understood by contrasting the new scheme with what it replaced. (See <em>In re Quinn, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d at p. 483 [new provisions of the Constitution must be considered with reference to the situation intended to be remedied \u25a0 or provided for]; <em>Resure, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 156, 164 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In 1994, in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 630, our Supreme Court described the evolution of the system of judicial discipline in California, and in particular the provisions of section 18, as follows: \u201cPrior to the passage, at the November 1988 General Election, of the legislative proposal to amend the constitutional provision, \u25a0 former subdivision (f) of article VI, section 18, provided: \u2018The Judicial Council shall make rules implementing this section and providing for confidentiality of proceedings.\u2019 In <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court[, supra,] </em>25 Cal.3d 474 . . . , the court concluded that this former version of subdivision (f) mandated confidentiality of investigations and proceedings before the Commission, and that, accordingly, the Judicial Council did not have the authority to promulgate rules providing for investigations and hearings open to the public. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied upon the language of former section 10b, paragraph (3), of article VI, as adopted by constitutional amendment in November 1960, which expressly provided for the confidentiality of all proceedings before the Commission, and concluded there was no indication \u2018that the people of California intended to change the constitutional requirement of confidentiality by revision of article VI in 1966 . . . .\u2019 (25 Cal.3d at p. 499.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cThe constitutional provision interpreted in the <em>Mosk </em>decision remained unchanged until the November 1988 election. Prior to that election, the Senate resolved, with the Assembly concurring, to propose to the voters that article VI, sections 8 and 18, of the California Constitution, be amended to provide, inter alia, that, under some circumstances, hearings on judicial performance before the Commission could be opened to public scrutiny. (Sen. Const. Amend. No. 6, Stats. 1988 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) res. ch. 67, pp. 6115-6116.) The preamble to the legislative resolution proposing the constitutional amendment states: \u2018Whereas, The Legislature finds and declares that maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system is essential to good government; and [^] Whereas, The Commission on Judicial Performance bears a great public trust which it must currently fulfill in total secrecy; and [5Q Whereas, Because responsible public disclosure and accountability is proper, desirable, and consistent with the goal of public confidence, it is the intent of this measure that appropriate commission proceedings be open to public scrutiny, and that this measure be construed so as to accomplish this purpose which is hereby declared to be the public policy of this state . . . .\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 6115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u201cThe constitutional amendment was submitted to the voters as Proposition 92 and was approved, effective November 9, 1988. . . . Section 18, subdivision (f), now provides that if, after conducting a preliminary investigation, the Commission by vote determines that formal proceedings should be instituted against a judge, the Commission \u2018may in the pursuit of public confidence and the interests of justice, issue press statements or releases or, in the event charges involve moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption, <em>open hearings </em>to the public.\u2019 (Art. VI, \u00a7 18, subd. (f)(3).)\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 646-647, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As the <em>Adams </em>court explained, the history of the constitutional provisions governing judicial discipline in California shows a trend toward greater openness and less secrecy, and that evolution continues with Proposition 190. <em>(See Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 646-647.) The 1988 and 1994 amendments also reflect the growing desire of the voters of California to limit the discretion of those in charge of the machinery of judicial discipline to determine which aspects of the process may be conducted behind closed doors. Thus, the law prior to passage of Proposition 190 <em>permitted </em>open \u201chearings\u201d in certain circumstances, while the language of the 1994 amendments <em>mandates </em>that <em>\u201call. . . proceedings\u201d </em>subsequent to the filing of formal charges must be \u201copen to the public.\u201d (\u00a7 18(j).) This history suggests that the drafters of Proposition 190 purposefully chose the broader term \u201cproceedings\u201d over \u201chearings,\u201d the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that was being replaced, and meant to maximize the openness of formal disciplinary proceedings of the commission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The ballot arguments filed in connection with the November 1994 election support our conclusion on this point. A careful examination of those arguments reveals that the primary purposes of Proposition 190 were to <em>eliminate </em>secrecy in the commission\u2019s formal disciplinary proceedings and to ensure public accountability of the commission for its disciplinary determinations. The proponents of Proposition 190 could not have been more clear about this, as stated in their ballot argument: \u201cProposition 190 is an important and timely reform measure. Judges are public servants and play a critical role in our society. The public must have confidence and trust in those holding judicial office. Proposition 190 Places Judicial Discipline in the Hands of a Broad Panel of Public Citizens, Judges and Attorneys and Opens all Formal Proceedings to the Public Just as Other States Have Done in Recent Years. <em>California Most Eliminate Secrecy and Ensure Integrity in the Disciplinary Process. \u201d </em>(Ballot Pamp., argument in favor of Prop. 190 as presented to the voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994) p. 12, upper case and italics in original.) The ballot argument in favor of Proposition 190 also stated: \u201cUnder Proposition 190, the commission would be required to open <em>all formal proceedings </em>against judges to the public. Currently, all hearings and commission documents, including the actual charges against the judge, are secret. Without Knowledge of Charges or Proceedings, the Public Cannot Have Confidence in the Judicial System.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>upper case and italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Perhaps the most fundamental problem with the commission\u2019s approach is that, by adopting rule 102(b) of the Rules of Commission on Judicial Performance, the commission has, in essence, established a sweeping rule of confidentiality with only a few narrow exceptions for aspects of formal disciplinary proceedings that will be held \u201copen to the public.\u201d This is precisely the <em>opposite </em>of the regime the Legislature and the voters were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>attempting to establish by enacting Proposition 190 and section 18(j).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In short, the commission\u2019s interpretation cannot be sustained because it cannot be reconciled with the clearly expressed intent to inspire public confidence in the California system of judicial discipline by eliminating the secrecy that shrouded formal disciplinary proceedings in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">But the proponents of Proposition 190 did not simply make broad pronouncements of their intent to eliminate secrecy and open judicial disciplinary proceedings to public scrutiny. They also provided some useful guidance as to the procedural model they envisioned for formal judicial discipline by saying: <em>\u201cJust as we require criminal proceedings and attorney discipline proceedings to be open, </em>we should also hold judges to the same standard where serious misconduct is at issue.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., argument in favor of Prop. 190 as presented to the voters, <em>supra, </em>at p. 12, italics added.) That the proponents singled out these two adjudicative systems goes a long way toward persuading us that they, and the voters who approved Proposition 190, intended the commissioners\u2019 votes to be \u201copen to the public,\u201d at least in the sense of revealing how each individual commissioner voted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In criminal proceedings, whether in the trial court or in the Court of Appeal, California judges always make their decisions and \u201ccast their votes\u201d publicly, with no mask of anonymity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even jurors, after rendering a verdict, are regularly required to confirm\u2014individually and in open court\u2014 that they have indeed voted in support of the verdict. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1163.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We note, however, that the commission is less like a trial court, and more</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>closely analogous to an intermediate appellate court such as the Court of Appeal, insofar as it \u201creviews\u201d decisions of the special masters (Rules Com. Jud. Performance, rules 129-135)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> subject to further discretionary \u201creview\u201d in the Supreme Court. (See \u00a7 18(d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 935.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Even more closely analogous to the commission, however, is the State Bar Court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under Business and Professions Code section 6086.1 and rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure of the State Bar, formal attorney disciplinary proceedings (with certain exceptions) are held in public. Public hearings and trials are conducted before hearing judges (see Rules Proc. of State Bar, rules 2.58, 3.16, 20, 23), with review afforded in the Review Department of the State Bar Court (id., rule 300 et seq.). Decisions of the Review Department\u2014the counterpart of the commission\u2014always identify the participating judges, including the author of the majority opinion and of any concurring or dissenting opinion. (See, e.g., <em>In the Matter of Hindin </em>(Review Dept. 1997) 3 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. 657; <em>In the Matter of Jennings </em>(Review Dept. 1995) 3 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. 337.) Thus, it is always disclosed how each of the participating State Bar Court judges \u201cvoted\u201d in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Like the votes of the judges of this court in criminal cases, or those of State Bar Court judges in attorney discipline cases, the commissioners\u2019 votes are the object and culmination of formal disciplinary proceedings against a</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>judge. They are essential to a valid exercise of the commission\u2019s authority, which requires the concurrence of a majority of its members. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68704; Rules Com. Jud. Perf., rule 134.) The commission\u2019s final vote represents its \u201c \u2018. . . formal expression of a will, preference, wish or choice . . .\u2019\u201d with respect to imposition of judicial discipline. (See <em>California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>King City Union Elementary School </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 695, 702 [172 Cal.Rptr. 368].) Indeed, ip all these respects, the vote of the membership is <em>the </em>most critical step in the commission\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Given the broad mandatory language of Proposition 190, the clearly expressed intent of its proponents to eliminate secrecy in formal proceedings for judicial discipline, and the \u201clegislative history\u201d describing the adjudicative model the proponents were seeking to establish, it quite simply defies common sense to suggest that the votes of individual commissioners are not part of the \u201cproceedings\u201d that must, under the express terms of section 18(j), be \u201copen to the public.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the commission\u2019s interpretation of section 18(j) is neither faithful to the language of the constitutional provision, nor \u201c \u2018reasonable, fair and harmonious with its manifest purpose\u2019 \u201d (see <em>Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. </em>v. <em>Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control Dist. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 408, 425 [261 Cal.Rptr. 384, 777 P.2d 157]), and must be rejected.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>3. <em>Interpreting the Term \u201cProceedings\u201d in Section I8(j) to Require Disclosure of the Votes of Individual Members Will Not Produce \u201cHarmful\u201d or \u201cAbsurd\u201d Consequences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The commission issues dire warnings about the dangers of requiring public disclosure of the individual commissioners\u2019 votes, contending that <em>only </em>its interpretation of section 18(j) can ensure integrity in judicial disciplinary proceedings. It claims it must be allowed to continue its \u201clongstanding historical practice\u201d of secret voting because, otherwise, commissioners will be subject to political pressure and (especially with respect to the attorney members) retaliation by the judges who have been or may be called to appear before it. We will not dignify the latter suggestion with any extended discussion. As to political pressure, however, we fail to see how allowing the commissioners to act anonymously promotes, much less guarantees, integrity in the process. On the contrary, if the public is not allowed to see how the individual appointees are dispensing judicial discipline, it will be unable to determine what, if any, political pressure might be at work, or the sources of that pressure. Moreover, while the voters do not have direct control over who serves on the commission, they expressly reserved to themselves a fair measure of indirect control over commission membership insofar as a majority of the commissioners are now appointed by elected officials who must answer to the voters for, inter alia, their appointments to the commission and the conduct of their appointees.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Denying public access to full information about the commission\u2019s disciplinary decisions deprives the voters of an \u201cability to understand how the system operates and, in turn, its ability [to] make informed decisions regarding the need for positive changes to the system . . . .\u201d <em>(San Bernardino County Dept. of Public Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 188, 203 [283 Cal.Rptr. 332].)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The commission further suggests that the voters acted to open up formal disciplinary proceedings <em>only </em>because they were concerned with California judges\u2019 domination of their own disciplinary apparatus. The proponents of Proposition 190 did, of course, state that a chief purpose of the measure was to \u201celiminate judicial domination of the commission in favor of a public majority,\u201d and that \u201ca Public Majority Will Ensure a Fair and Firm System of Judicial Discipline.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., argument in favor of Prop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>190 as presented to the voters, <em>supra, </em>at p. 12, upper case in original.) Obviously, however, they accomplished that objective by amending section 8(a), not section 18(j). Indeed, had elimination of judicial domination been the proponents\u2019 only objective, they could have cured that problem by changing the composition of the panel\u2014to provide a majority of public members\u2014without dispensing with the absolute \u201cconfidentiality\u201d of all \u201cproceedings\u201d discussed in <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 474, or the more limited \u201cconfidentiality\u201d for \u201chearings\u201d at issue in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The commission has also claimed it will be difficult to find citizens willing to serve if prospective commissioners know their votes will be publicly disclosed. This is, however, a bald claim without support in the record. In any event, we fail to see the merit of a system in which public officials, sitting in judgment of other public officials regarding charges of official misconduct, are allowed to hide behind a veil of secrecy when making the \u201ctough calls\u201d necessary to any adjudicatory regime. A certain amount of courage and a \u201cthick skin\u201d are essential attributes for anyone who purports to perform \u201cjudicial\u201d functions. We should expect, and accept, no less from members of the commission. (Cf. <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 273 [84 S.Ct. 710, 722, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412] [\u201cIf judges are to be treated as \u2018men [and women] of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate,\u2019 . . . surely the same must be true of other government officials, such as elected city commissioners.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Finally, the commission contends that interpreting the term \u201cproceedings\u201d in section 18(j) to require disclosure of the votes of individual members leads inexorably to the \u201cabsurd result\u201d that its \u201cdeliberations\u201d (and even those of the Supreme Court upon review of commission decisions) must also be conducted in public. The commission reasons that deliberations and voting are \u201cdual components of the collective decision-making process\u201d <em>(Sacramento Newspaper Guild </em>v. <em>Sacramento County Bd. of Suprs. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 41, 47 [69 Cal.Rptr. 480]), and that, if we hold that voting is part of the formal \u201cproceedings\u201d of the commission, there is no way to draw a line to shield its deliberations from public disclosure. The commission warns that The Recorder is, thus, seeking to \u201cintrude into the judge\u2019s chamber and witness the deliberations of the justices,\u201d to observe \u201cthe deliberations and votes of the jury,\u201d and to \u201c \u2018sit at the table\u2019 during the [c]ommission\u2019s deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The commission\u2019s argument on this point is vastly overstated. Indeed, we agree with the commission that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to interpret the term \u201cproceedings,\u201d as used in section 18(j), to include its deliberations. Unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the commission, however, we believe there is a principled way to define those \u201cproceedings\u201d that must be held \u201copen to the public\u201d to include the vote of the commissioners, but to exclude the deliberative process that produces those votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The argument that the term \u201cproceedings\u201d includes the \u201cdeliberations\u201d of the commission is easily dispatched by reference to the \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning\u201d <em>(In re Quinn, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d at p. 482) of the term \u201cproceedings\u201d as generally understood when section 18(j) was enacted, and as intended by the proponents of Proposition 190. At the risk of sounding repetitious, the point is that when the commission acts in an adjudicatory capacity\u2014as it does when it conducts \u201cformal proceedings\u201d for judicial discipline\u2014the proponents of Proposition 190 intended the commission to conduct its formal \u201cproceedings\u201d as a court does in a criminal case and as the State Bar Court does in attorney discipline cases. It was and is widely understood that internal \u201cdeliberations\u201d of American and California courts are, and always have been, conducted in secrecy and that the \u201cjudicial thought process\u201d need not be disclosed to the public. Likewise, the <em>deliberations </em>of the judges of the State Bar Court are excluded from the provision requiring all State Bar Court proceedings to be public. (Rules Proc. of State Bar, rule 24.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">There are, of course, good and sufficient reasons for secret deliberations in each of these settings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As Professor Laurence Tribe has observed, protecting the confidentiality of \u201cjudicial\u201d deliberations is \u201cvitally needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>encourage collegiality, candor, and courage\u2014both political and intellectual\u2014protection needed not for the benefit of judges but for the benefit of society as a whole.\u201d (Tribe, <em>Trying California\u2019s Judges on Television: Open Government or Judicial </em>Intimidation? (1979) 65 A.B.A. J. 1175, 1179.) Similarly, California courts have recognized the critical importance of allowing state administrative agencies, when acting in an adjudicative capacity, \u201cto review the evidence before it, to exchange views and to deliberate thereon under conditions conducive to calm, orderly and frank discussion.\u201d <em>(California State Employees\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1011-1013 [108 Cal.Rptr. 57].)

However, a long-standing definition found in the case law encompasses both the information-gathering and <em>decisional </em>aspects of such a proceeding: \u201cA \u2018hearing\u2019 is generally understood to be a proceeding where <em>evidence is taken </em>to the end of determining an issue of fact <em>and a decision made </em>on the basis of that evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pennington </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 508, 521 [58 Cal.Rptr. 374, 426 P.2d 942], italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Indeed, the formal hearings before the special masters and the commission are not the only \u201csubsequent . . . proceedings\u201d contemplated by section 18 and by the commission\u2019s own rules. They are not even the only types of \u201chearings\u201d the commission is likely to hold. The commission does not explain why it appears to have excluded from the scope of \u201call subsequent. . . proceedings,\u201d all aspects of discovery, the issuance of subpoenas, depositions of witnesses who are unable or cannot be made to appear before the special masters, and any \u201cpre-trial\u201d motions a judge may wish to make, to name a few types of \u201cproceedings\u201d that are not included among the \u201cexceptions\u201d to confidentiality established by rule 102 of the Rules of Commission on Judicial Performance. Obviously, these additional proceedings are not at issue in this case, but we make this point to highlight how narrowly the commission has construed its constitutional mandate for \u201copen\u201d proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Indeed, the instant case presents the flip side of <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 474. In that case, the Supreme Court held that in view of a constitutional provision which then required the Judicial Council to make rules providing for the confidentiality of proceedings, the commission had acted outside its authority by promulgating rules under its discretionary rulemaking authority providing for public hearings in some cases. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 499.) Here, by contrast, the commission asks us to And that, despite the enactment of a constitutional mandate that \u201call . . . proceedings\u201d subsequent to the institution of formal disciplinary proceedings must be open to the public, it may, nevertheless, under its discretionary rule-making authority, provide for confidential proceedings. Thus, to the extent the commission adopted rule 102(b) of the Rules of Commission on Judicial Performance to compel the confidentiality of the commissioners\u2019 individual votes, it acted outside its authority. (See <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 499.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\">As we have noted, the proponents of Proposition 190 also mentioned approvingly the many other states that have \u201cPlace[d] Judicial Discipline in the Hands of a Broad Panel of Public Citizens, Judges and Attorneys and Open[ed] All Formal Proceedings to the Public ... in Recent Years.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., argument in favor of Prop. 190 as presented to the voters, <em>supra, </em>at p. 12.) In its brief and appendices, The Recorder has set forth detailed descriptions of the system of judicial discipline in 10 such states\u2014Georgia, Kansas, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, and Washington\u2014all of which have attorney and public members, and all of which apparently disclose the individual votes of their members, usually by issuing a signed decision. (See, e.g., Ga. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 VII, ^ VI; Rules Ga. Jud. Qualifications Com., rule 14; Kan. Supreme Ct. Rules Jud. Conduct, rules 602, 608, 622; Nev. Const., art. 6, \u00a7 21, subd. 2; Rules Nev. Com. Jud. Discipline, rule 7; N.Y. Jud. Law, \u00a7 44, subd. 7; Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1.420, subd. (3); Pa. Const., art. V, \u00a7 18, subd. (b); Tenn.

The commission contends that The Recorder\u2019s survey of the law of these 10 states constitutes a tacit concession that the \u201coverwhelming majority of states have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>different procedure,\u201d and that \u201cother states whose judicial discipline bodies, like the commission here, do not make a disclosure\u201d of individual votes. (Emphasis in original.) However, the commission provides us with citations regarding only <em>three </em>such states\u2014Connecticut, Mississippi, and Missouri. (See <em>In re Honorable Bruce L. Levin </em>(Conn. Jud. Review Council, Sept. 21, 1995) 1995 WL 908006; Rules Miss. Com. Jud. Performance, rule 8F, G; Mo. Com. Retirement, Removal and Discipline, Internal Proc. art. VIII.) The foregoing does not conclusively prove the merit of either the commission\u2019s or The Recorder\u2019s interpretation of section 18(j). It does, however, undercut the commission\u2019s argument that disclosing the votes of individual commissioners gravely jeopardizes the integrity of proceedings for judicial discipline. In any event, we need not rely on the laws of other states because we believe the voters of California have spoken quite clearly by approving a measure designed to \u201celiminate secrecy\u201d in proceedings for judicial discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b286-5\">During the trial court hearing on The Recorder\u2019s petition, the commission suggested that the Court of Appeal sometimes issues anonymous decisions by designating an opinion as authored \u201cBy the Court.\u201d This is simply incorrect. California Rules of Court, rule 23.5 requires attribution of the votes of individual justices on a panel deciding a case in the California Courts of Appeal. That rule provides: \u201cThe opinion of a Court of Appeal shall identify the judges participating in the decision, including the author of the majority opinion and of any concurring or dissenting opinion, or the three judges participating when the opinion is designated \u201c \u2018by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid..) </em>Thus, although the <em>author </em>of a \u201cby the court\u201d opinion may remain anonymous, it is <em>always </em>clear that the author (whoever he or she may be) and both of the other named justices all concurred in\u2014i.e., \u201cvoted\u201d in agreement with\u2014the opinion. Similarly, our Supreme Court occasionally issues opinions without designating the author, especially in attorney and judicial disciplinary matters. (See, e.g., <em>In re Wright </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 374 [110 Cal.Rptr. 348, 515 P.2d 292]; <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Committee of Bar Examiners </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 156 [110 Cal.Rptr. 15, 514 P.2d 967]; <em>Geiler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 270 [110 Cal.Rptr. 201, 515 P.2d 1].) Indeed, some of the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cPer Curiam\u201d or \u201cBy the Court\u201d- decisions have not been unanimous. (See e.g., <em>In re Michael L. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 81 [216 Cal.Rptr. 140, 702 P.2d 222] [unsigned majority opinion, signed concurring and dissenting opinions by named justices]; <em>Seaman\u2019s Direct Buying Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 752 [206 Cal.Rptr. 354, 686 P.2d 1158] [majority opinion unsigned; one opinion concurring and dissenting], overruled on other grounds by <em>Freeman &amp; Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>Belcher Oil Co. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 85, 88 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 420, 900 P.2d 669]; <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Panish </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 107 [167 Cal.Rptr. 584, 615 P.2d 1372].) It is, nevertheless, always disclosed how each of the participating justices \u201cvoted\u201d in each decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Of course, there is no authority of which we are aware that a third party has the right to compel jurors to disclose how they voted in a criminal proceeding. By statute, California jurors may be so compelled at the behest of either the defense or the prosecution. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1163.) This right is not one of state or federal constitutional dimension <em>(People </em>v. <em>Masajo </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1340 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 234]), and it will be deemed waived if the defendant fails to assert it at trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flynn </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 289, 294 [31 Cal.Rptr. 651]). However, it is our experience that it is extremely rare\u2014at least in felony prosecutions\u2014for a defendant to fail to request polling and it is, thus, understandable that the occasion for third party intervention rarely, if ever, arises.</p>\n<p id=\"ABb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>We also note the recent enactment of provisions requiring the trial courts to seal identifying information about trial jurors and to maintain the confidentiality of same absent further order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 237; and Cal. Rules of Court, rule 33.6; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodwin </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1088 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 576].) However important and effective these new laws may be in protecting the privacy and safety of citizen jurors, they do not apply to publicly appointed members of the commission. Moreover, to the extent there is a \u201cjury\u201d in formal proceedings for judicial discipline in California, that factfinding role is played primarily by the special masters, not commissioners. (See Rules Com. Jud. Performance, rules 121-129.) As the commission itself contends, the \u201cultimate\u201d responsibility for judicial discipline rests with the commissioners, subject only to review by the Supreme Court when discipline is imposed. Thus, the role of the commissioners is more akin to that played by trial and intermediate appellate court judges in criminal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The special masters\u2019 decision is rendered in a \u201cfinal report,\u201d which must contain \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law, along with an analysis of the evidence and reasons for the findings and conclusions, but shall not contain a recommendation as to discipline.\u201d (Rules Com. Jud. Performance, rule 129(d).) The respondent judge and/or the examiner may file with the commission a brief containing specific objections to the special masters\u2019 report, followed by response and reply briefs, and an opportunity to be heard orally before the commission. <em>(Id., </em>rules 130, 132.) The commission may order the taking of additional evidence. <em>(Id., </em>rule 133; cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 909 [Court of Appeal may take additional evidence on appeal and make additional findings of fact]; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 23 &amp; 41 [procedures for same].) After a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the commission to impose discipline, the judge may seek review in the Supreme Court. (\u00a7 18(d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 935.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Unlike the commission, which originates in the state Constitution (\u00a7\u00a7 8,18), however, the State Bar Court is a creature of statute (see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6086.5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b288-5\">For the first time at oral argument, the commission made an argument based on former rule 902 of the California Rules of Court, which provided, in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in this rule, <em>all papers filed with and proceedings before </em>the Commission . . . shall be confidential until a record is filed by the Commission in the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a), italics added.) Former rule 902 was first adopted in 1966 (see <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 498) and remained in effect until it was repealed in 1996 in response to passage of Proposition 190. Noting that the commission\u2019s consistent practice throughout that period was to disclose only numerical vote totals and not to reveal how individual commissioners voted in disciplinary \u201cproceedings,\u201d counsel for the commission contended that, by drafting Proposition 190 to include language similar to that of former rule 902, the Legislature must be deemed to have understood the term \u201cproceedings\u201d to exclude the commissioners\u2019 voting practices. The commission has waived this argument by failing to raise it in its opening or reply briefs. <em>(Stevenson </em>v. <em>Baum </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 159, 167 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 904]; <em>Chatterjee </em>v. <em>Kizer </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1348, 1366, fn. 4 [283 Cal.Rptr. 60].) Even assuming it was not waived, however, we do not find this argument particularly enlightening. Whatever the meaning of the term \u201cproceedings\u201d in 1966 when the commission had no authority to hold public investigations or hearings (see <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 499-500), and even as late as 1994 when the commission was authorized to conduct public \u201chearings\u201d in limited circumstances (see <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 647), the presumption of confidentiality that previously attached to all commission \u201cproceedings\u201d and \u201chearings\u201d has now been reversed for \u201call. . . proceedings\u201d in cases of formal discipline (\u00a7 18(j)). As we have discussed, the drafters of Proposition 190 and the voters who approved it clearly expressed their intent to \u201celiminate secrecy\u201d in our system of formal judicial discipline and to open all formal disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>proceedings to the public as the California courts do in criminal cases and the State Bar Court does in attorney discipline proceedings. It is, thus, immaterial that the commission has in the past narrowly construed its obligations to open its proceedings to public view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\"> As The Recorder points out, without identifying how individual commissioners vote, it is impossible to know whether they are even showing up for work or whether members have (or should have) disqualified themselves for some reason. The vote tally in the Velasquez matter, and the change therein, suggests both problems, but there is no way to clarify what happened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">SimilarIy, although state administrative agencies subject to the Administrative Procedure Act are required to conduct their \u201cadjudicative proceedings\u201d openly (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11120, 11425.10, subd. (a)(3), 11425.20, 54950), the agency may conduct its deliberations in private <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 11126, subd. (c)(3); and see Cal. Law. Revision Com. com., 32C West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.20 (1998 pocket supp.) p. 94). Of course, thereafter, the agency\u2019s decision must be filed as a public record (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11517, subd. (e)), and must contain a written statement of the factual and legal basis for the decision (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 32C West\u2019s Ann., Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11425.10, subd. (a)(6), 11425.50, subd. (a)). One commentator has noted that the \u201cvote\u201d of the agency is not generally included in the decision because there is no specific statutory provision requiring such disclosure. (Cal. Administrative Hearing Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1997) \u00a7 8.31, p. 384.) However, a quick survey of case reporters from state administrative agencies reveals that many\u2014including the Public Employment Relations Board, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, and the Public Utilities Commission\u2014do, in adjudicatory matters, identify the participating commissioners, and identify the author of the panel\u2019s opinion and any dissenting, concurring, or nonparticipating members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">As we have noted, we express no opinion about the scope of the term \u201cpapers,\u201d as used in section 18(j).

By requiring only the formal \u201cproceedings\u201d of the commission to be \u201copen to the public,\u201d the Legislature and the voters undoubtedly understood they were dealing with an adjudicatory system\u2014an apparatus for \u201cjudging\u201d the judges of California\u2014and not with an ordinary state or local administrative agency that conducts \u201cmeetings\u201d to perform a variety of \u201clegislative\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cjudicial\u201d or \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d functions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The commission appears to object to issuance of mandamus on the ground that the courts are thereby requiring it to account for the individual votes in the Velasquez matter and create a record of individual votes in future cases. The commission suggests it has discretion with respect to the creation and maintenance of such information. This objection rings hollow because the commission has imposed upon itself a <em>mandatory </em>duty to \u201cmaintain records of all <em>actions taken </em>by the commission concerning a judge.\u201d (Rules Com. Jud. Performance, rule 135.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 258.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
