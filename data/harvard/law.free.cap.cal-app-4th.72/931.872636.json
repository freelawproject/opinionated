Code, \u00a7 11470) and to enter a new order sanctioning his verified claim opposing such forfeiture. We hold in part that the provisions of the Evidence Code pertaining to hearsay evidence (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200 et seq.) apply in proceedings under Health and Safety Code section 11488.4, subdivision (g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For this and other reasons, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">\n<em>The Vehicle Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Law enforcement officers seized the $20,040 (the money) at issue here from the clothing of the occupants of a 1994 Saturn automobile. On December 2, 1997, Officer Sigler of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) stopped the driver of the Saturn for a violation of Vehicle Code section 21703\u2014 following another vehicle too closely. Deputy Spino of the Madera County Sheriff\u2019s Department (the department) observed the stop and pulled over at the scene. The driver of the Saturn, Cisneros/Escamilla, did not possess a valid driver\u2019s license (a violation of Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500, subd. (a)); neither did his passenger, Bravo. Each man disclaimed ownership of the vehicle, and explained they were transporting the car to Modesto for an acquaintance of Escamilla\u2019s. After determining the Saturn had not been reported stolen, Sigler decided to impound the vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22651, subd. (p)). He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>cited Escamilla for various violations (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21703, 12500, subd. (a)) and obtained written consent from each occupant to search the Saturn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Spino planned to take the occupants to the nearest telephone. Before transporting them, he conducted a patdown search of the men for weapons. The frisk produced large bundles of United States currency in both men\u2019s pants pockets ($500 on Bravo; $2,560 on Escamilla). Doerak, a CHP drug-detecting canine, thereafter entered the passenger compartment of the Saturn and alerted to a jacket on the rear of the driver\u2019s seat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sigler saw a large bundle of money protruding from one of the pockets of the jacket. Spino removed the jacket and discovered additional cash in the other pocket (for a total of $16,980 in the jacket).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A further search of the vehicle disclosed a cellular phone in the center console but no obvious contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The officers transported Escamilla and Bravo to the Madera County Narcotic Enforcement Team (MCNET) office for further discussion about the origin of the money. Escamilla maintained that none of the cash belonged to him; he was delivering the money to Modesto for a man he knew only as \u201cEnano.\u201d According to Escamilla, Enano had contacted him and asked him to transport the money; Enano allowed Escamilla to drive Enano\u2019s Saturn and use a cellular telephone to make contact through a paging number with an individual in Modesto to whom Escamilla was to give the money. While at the MCNET office, Escamilla and Bravo signed forms disclaiming any interest in the money, the cell phone and the car. Ultimately, both were arrested and booked for violation of section 11370.9 (possession of proceeds over $25,000 derived from controlled substance offenses), among other charges (e.g., Escamilla was also arrested for violation of Vehicle Code section 10851). Neither was ever prosecuted on any of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\n<em>The Forfeiture Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">On or about January 20, 1998, Jauregi appeared at the department and made a claim to the car and the cash. He signed a department-issued form stating the money was his. The department personally served Jauregi with notice of nonjudicial forfeiture of the money on February 5, 1998, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Jauregi appeared to claim the Saturn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Jauregi filed a verified claim opposing forfeiture on March 6, 1998, and the People filed a petition for forfeiture of the money on March 17, 1998. Prior to the hearing, the People filed a motion to compel Jauregi to prove his standing to contest the forfeiture in advance of a trial on the merits of the People\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\n<em>The Hearing to'Determine Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">When the court calendared the hearing on standing, it stated it anticipated the hearing would be \u201chandled as a law and motion matter with proof by way of declaration, as opposed to oral evidence.\u201d Counsel for Jauregi stated he was going to \u201cinclude the police reports\u201d for the court to read, which counsel felt would be sufficient to establish standing. The People did not comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Though subpoenaed, Jauregi did not attend the hearing. His counsel apparently did not submit declarations and instead said he wanted to call two witnesses, the department\u2019s Barker and Benard. Before the first of these witnesses testified, the prosecutor disclosed his intention to object to \u201cthe bulk of the [officer\u2019s] testimony\u201d as hearsay. It was the prosecutor\u2019s position that Jauregi, as the claimant, had the burden to demonstrate standing and anything the officers had to say would be hearsay. Jauregi\u2019s counsel countered that the officers\u2019 testimony, even if hearsay, would be admissible because this was a \u201cpreliminary matter.\u201d Presumably counsel intended to refer to Penal Code section 872, subdivision (b), although he never expressly said so or mentioned this statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Under the People\u2019s continuing hearsay objection, Barker testified that, when Jauregi came to the department to attempt to recover the car and the money, he had with him a registration certificate (pink slip) in his name, his driver\u2019s license, and proof of insurance on the car. Jauregi told Barker he had been in Los Angeles when he learned a family member in Mexico was ill. Jauregi said he did not want to take the money with him to Mexico so he gave the money to a man whose name he did not know to hold for him until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>he returned.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Barker also testified that Jauregi said the money came from the sale of his interest in a jewelry store in Modesto and produced a business card showing he was the owner of La Michoacana Jewelers in Modesto. Barker further testified that Jauregi gave her a document of sale, dated June 14, 1997, conveying his half interest in the jewelry store to one Manuel Gil. The sale price was $30,000, with $5,000 down, installments of $5,000 per month, and final payment due on or before November 15, 1997.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Jauregi had signed a department-generated form in which he claimed the money was his.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Barker initially said this was done in her presence; she later testified she did not know if she in fact was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Barker acknowledged she had provided the verified responses to. the interrogatories propounded by Jauregi, but she testified she was unaware anything had been attached to the responses, even though they referred repeatedly to \u201cattached\u201d reports. When Jauregi\u2019s counsel attempted to have the interrogatory answers admitted, the prosecutor objected on the ground they were not made admissible by the fact that they had been provided by the government in discovery. The court received the interrogatory answers and associated documents and deferred ruling on the admissibility of any aspect of the packet until the prosecutor\u2019s hearsay objection was resolved upon the completion of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Over the People\u2019s renewed hearsay objection, Benard testified he spoke briefly to Jauregi on January 20, 1998; Jauregi was then in the company of Santiago Ramirez, who was the registered owner of the cellular phone seized from the Saturn. Ramirez told Benard that Jauregi left his automobile and the $20,000 with him in Los Angeles when Jauregi went to attend to a family emergency in Mexico. Later, Ramirez received a telephone call from Jauregi who asked Ramirez to turn the car and money over to an individual who would transport the items to Modesto. Ramirez allowed the driver to take his cell phone so he could contact the real estate broker in Modesto slated to receive delivery of the car and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Following the testimony of Barker and Benard, counsel for Jauregi argued he had established his client\u2019s standing. Counsel maintained the testimony of the two officers established Jauregi\u2019s cognizable interest in the money sufficient to oppose the forfeiture, in the same manner as the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>testimony of a qualified police officer is sufficient to establish probable cause at a preliminary hearing in a criminal action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Counsel asserted that the discovery documents referred to during the hearing were admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule and also on the theory that the \u201cdocuments . . . speak for themselves.\u201d The People took the position that there was no admissible evidence establishing Jauregi\u2019s standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Much discussion between court and counsel followed, including references to <em>United States </em>v. <em>1982 Yukon Delta Houseboat </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 774 F.2d 1432, 1434, a federal' case which dealt with probable cause determinations in forfeiture proceedings under federal law. At one point, the court noted that the arguably pertinent language of former section 11488.4, subdivision (g)(1) concerning probable cause, discussed in this court\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 447, 462-463 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 239], had been deleted from the statute in 1994. The court pointed out that the new language of the statute stated simply that the person moving for return of the property must show standing by proving \u201can interest\u201d in the property. (\u00a7 11488.4, subd. (g).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The court ultimately concluded that Jauregi had failed to establish he had standing because all of the evidence he relied upon was inadmissible hearsay. Counsel for Jauregi then represented he could have Jauregi present in court to testify later in the day, at 1:00 p.m., and requested he be allowed to reopen at that time. Citing the facts that Jauregi did not respond to the prosecutor\u2019s subpoena, and that if he had appeared and testified his testimony would have sufficed to establish standing, the court refused to continue the hearing to the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Forfeiture proceedings are statutory civil in rem actions in which property is considered the defendant, on the fiction that the property itself is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the guilty party. <em>(People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 462-463; <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1953 Buick </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 358, 365 [19 Cal.Rptr. 488, 369 P.2d 16]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>$38,000 in U.S. Currency </em>(11th Cir. 1987) 816 F.2d 1538, 1544, fn. 12, disagreed with on another point in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Approximately 2,538.85 Shares of Stock </em>(1st Cir. 1993) 988 F.2d 1281, 1285 [of Stock Certificates of Ponce Leones Baseball Club, Inc.].) Three general principles are relevant to the application of California\u2019s civil forfeiture statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">\u201cFirst, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are applicable to the proceedings in chapter 8 regarding the seizure and disposition of property subject to forfeiture unless otherwise inconsistent with the provisions or procedures in that chapter. [Now \u00a7 11488.5, subd. (c)(3).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">\u201cTwo, federal case law is instructive in the area of forfeiture because the California forfeiture statute is patterned after the federal drug forfeiture statute. (Cf. Health &amp; Safety Code, \u00a7 11470 et seq. with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">\u201cThree, in construing these statutes, it must be remembered that \u2018[statutes imposing forfeitures are not favored and are to be strictly construed in favor of the persons against whom they are sought to be imposed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 463-464.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Section 11488.4, subdivision (g), addresses standing under the current, relevant version of California\u2019s forfeiture law; it reads as follows: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall preclude a person, other than a defendant, claiming an interest in property actually seized from moving for a return of property if that person can show standing by proving an interest in the property not assigned subsequent to the seizure or filing of the forfeiture petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The doctrine of standing seeks to insure that courts decide actual controversies and not abstract questions. Absent standing, the claimant in a forfeiture action cannot contest the government\u2019s decision to seek forfeiture; this is the rule in state and federal proceedings. <em>{People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 467 [involving a former version of section 11488.4].) If it were otherwise, \u201c \u2018persons with no interest whatsoever in seized property could make a handsome living filing claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>{U.S. </em>v. <em>Certain Real Prop. Located at 16510 Ashton </em>(6th Cir. 1995) 47 F.3d 1465, 1473 (dis. opn. of Boggs, J.).) Thus, \u201ca claimant [in a civil forfeiture proceeding] must show he has a recognizable legal or equitable interest in the seized property\u201d in order to establish standing; it is the claimant\u2019s burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>to establish an \u201cinterest in the seized property\u201d sufficient to satisfy the court of his standing to contest forfeiture. <em>{People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 467.) This is a threshold legal issue. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 466-467; <em>People </em>v. <em>$241,600 United States Currency </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1107-1108 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 588]; \u00a7 11488.4, subd. (g).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Jauregi contends the trial court erred in refusing to admit the testimony of the two officers as proof of Jauregi\u2019s standing to contest the forfeiture of the money. Jauregi takes the position that hearsay is admissible to establish what he classifies as the \u201cpredicate\u201d issue of standing. He compares the concept of standing to the concept of probable cause discussed in the federal forfeiture cases and he analogizes proof of standing with proof of probable cause at preliminary hearings in criminal cases under Penal Code section 872, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">We conclude hearsay is not admissible, over a proper objection, to prove standing under section 11488.4, subdivision (g). Nothing in this statute, and nothing we can find elsewhere in California\u2019s forfeiture law, deals with the nature of the evidence that may be admitted on the issue of standing. This silence means that hearsay may not be used for such a purpose. Evidence Code section 300, not mentioned by either party, reads in relevant part that \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, this code applies in every action before <em>...&amp;... </em>superior court, . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If this command were not clear enough, the Law Revision Commission Comment to section 300 resolves any conceivable ambiguity in the statutory language; the Commission states that section 300 \u201cmakes the Evidence Code applicable to all proceedings conducted by California courts except those court proceedings to which it is made inapplicable by statute. . . .\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foil. \u00a7 300, p. 46.) The case law is equally explicit: \u201cEvidence Code section 300 makes it clear that, except as otherwise provided by statute, the Evidence Code applies to every evidentiary hearing in the state courts. . . .\u201d <em>{Hewitt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 923, 927 [85 Cal.Rptr. 493]; see also <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1063, 1074 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 160, 820 P.2d 262].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>The filing of a petition for forfeiture obviously initiates a civil \u201caction [or proceeding] before . . . a . . . superior court.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 300, 120.) The aspect of a forfeiture action which requires a claimant to \u201cshow\u201d standing by \u201cproving\u201d an interest in the property in issue obviously requires an evidentiary hearing. (\u00a7 11488.4, subd. (g).) Accordingly, because no statute exists which exempts such an evidentiary hearing from the application of the Evidence Code, all Evidence Code provisions which deal with hearsay apply to the proof (or disproof) of standing under section 11488.4, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We have not found any case law on point. At the trial court level in <em>$28,500, </em>the People maintained that hearsay evidence could support a \u201cprobable cause\u201d finding under an earlier version of section 11488.4, subdivision (g); the claimant asserted that declarations could only be considered if the information contained in them was within the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 452, 458.) The lower court apparently took into account some or all of the following: the declarations of law enforcement officers involved <em>(id. </em>at p. 452); the declarations of the claimant in which he stated that he loaned the money (proceeds from the claimant\u2019s restaurant business) to the driver of the vehicle in which money was found <em>(id. </em>at pp. 455-456, 460); and the testimony of the driver and the claimant at the probable cause hearing <em>(id. </em>at p. 456). On appeal, this court did not decide whether the hearsay was properly admitted to show probable cause; we simply noted that the trial court did not resolve the issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>$241,600 United States Currency, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th 1100, is also not germane. The case was decided under the forfeiture statutes in effect in 1993, the same version of the law evaluated by this court in <em>$28,500. (Id. </em>at p. 1108, fn. 4.) The claimant alleged he had found the money sought to be forfeited in a briefcase in a rest room before law enforcement (with the help of a narcotics dog) seized it from the trunk of the claimant\u2019s vehicle. The claimant asserted that, as a finder of lost or abandoned property, he had the necessary legal or equitable interest in the money to establish standing. The prosecution brought a motion for summary judgment which the trial court granted, in part because the trial court concluded the evidence established that the claimant did not have standing to contest the forfeiture. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1107.) The trial court found the claimant had \u201cexecuted written waivers and disclaimers and orally disavowed any interest in the money.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed. It held in part that the evidence before the trial court established the presence of a triable issue of fact about whether the claimant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily signed the waivers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>disclaimers. (67 Cal.App.4th at p. 1110.) In finding a triable issue of fact with respect to standing, the appellate court relied on the declarations of the officers involved in the seizure, the claimant\u2019s subsequent claim opposing forfeiture in which he asserted a \u201c \u2018possessory\u2019 \u201d interest in the money as the finder of lost or abandoned property, and the claimant\u2019s letter to the district attorney withdrawing his disclaimers on the ground he signed them under what amounted to duress. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Although it is not clear that all the evidence mentioned by the Court of Appeal met Evidence Code standards, we will not read the case as permitting the admission of hearsay or other normally inadmissible evidence to establish standing. The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>$241,600 United States Currency, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th 1100 did not review a decision following an evidentiary hearing or trial on the matter of standing; it instead evaluated a granted motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no indication in the court\u2019s opinion that any issue was raised in the trial court or on appeal about the admissibility of the evidence cited by the court, and we will therefore assume that all objections, if any, to the admissibility of that evidence had been waived by the opposing party. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We disagree with Jauregi that preliminary hearings in criminal cases provide analogous authority for his position. The fact that sworn hearsay testimony of law enforcement officers possessing certain qualifications is admissible to establish probable cause at a preliminary examination in a criminal matter does not support application of a comparable rule with respect to proof of standing in a forfeiture proceeding. The described hearsay evidence is admissible in a criminal preliminary hearing precisely because Penal Code section 872, subdivision (b), a part of Proposition 115, is a statute of the sort referred to in Evidence Code section 300; that is, one which makes a provision of the Evidence Code (specifically, \u00a7 1200) inapplicable to a specific proceeding. (See <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 1074.) If the exception did not exist, section 1200 would apply to criminal preliminary hearings. (54 Cal.3d at p. 1074. [Because Pen. Code, \u00a7 872, subd. (b) mentions only Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, Evid. Code, \u00a7 1201 (multiple hearsay) applies to preliminary hearings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Nor are we persuaded to Jauregi\u2019s position by the federal precedents permitting federal prosecutors to use hearsay to prove probable cause for forfeiture. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>$150,000 in Currency </em>(E.D.Va. 1988) 686 F.Supp. 133, 134.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this situation, California law, in the form of Evidence Code section 300, furnishes the unambiguous rule by which we are constrained to decide the issue before us. We see no reason to ignore the application of this statute simply because both probable cause in the federal arena and standing in the state arena have been said to be \u201cpredicate\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>$150,000 in Currency, supra, </em>686 F.Supp. at p. 132) or \u201cthreshold\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>$241,600 United States Currency, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 1107) determinations. Moreover, apparently unlike federal law, under California\u2019s forfeiture law a claimant who is not a defendant in an \u201cunderlying or related criminal action\u201d is not authorized to move for return of seized property on the ground there is not probable cause to believe the property is forfeitable. (\u00a7 11488.4, subd. (h).)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Last, requiring the claimant to prove standing by admissible evidence is supported by logic in light of the statutory scheme. Under section 11488.5, subdivision (e), the disputed property must be returned to the holder of an interest in it if the trier of fact does not find the property to have been put to a forfeitable use or does not find that the holder of the interest knew of and consented to the property\u2019s forfeitable use. Requiring proof by admissible evidence of a claimant\u2019s right to the property assures to some extent that such property will not be released to a person whose claim is spurious or contrived. A legitimate claimant can be expected to have access to the evidence necessary to establish his or her professed rights in the property. Finally, whether property is forfeitable is subject to determination by a jury unless jury trial is waived, and the prosecutor bears the enhanced burdens of proof of clear and convincing evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt. (\u00a7 11488.4, subd. (i)(2) &amp; (i)(4).) One who claims property sought to be declared forfeit should be compelled to establish his or her interest by admissible evidence before expenditure of time and expense on the merits of the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We are satisfied our opinion does not do violence to any of the three general principles relevant to the interpretation and application of this state\u2019s civil forfeiture statutes. Nothing we have said raises an inconsistency between the forfeiture law and the Code of Civil Procedure. (\u00a7 11488.5, subd. (c)(3).) Moreover, the unambiguous rule of Evidence Code section 300 must take precedence over the merely \u201cinstructive\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 463) federal cases which address a concept, \u201cprobable cause,\u201d that is not relevant under subdivision (g) of section 11488.4. Finally, the notion that forfeiture statutes must be \u201c \u2018strictly construed in favor of the persons against whom they are sought to be imposed\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, </em>supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 463) does not require the construction of a statute in a manner contrary to its clear language (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 622 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713] [rule of lenity does not apply where statute is not ambiguous), and, in any event, section 300 of the Evidence Code is not a part of the forfeiture law.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied.

Code of Civil Procedure section 437c provides an exception to the Evidence Code to the extent the statute allows the parties to rely upon evidence presented by way of declaration or other means that might not be permitted at trial before the trier of fact. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b); see 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) The Hearsay Rule, \u00a7 831, p. 790.) Except for this authorized departure from the Evidence Code, however, section 437c does not suspend any other rule of admissibility.

The burden of proof then shifts to the claimant to prove that the property is not forfeitable. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>One Single Family Residence </em>(11th Cir. 1991) 933 F.2d 976, 979.) Probable cause may be proved by hearsay found to be reliable in light of the \u201caggregate of the facts.\u201d In determining reliability, the court may consider factors such as the source of the evidence and whether it is consistent with other evidence. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>One Parcel of Real Property </em>(D.Or. 1991) 780 F.Supp. 715, 723 [two of three DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent affidavits, substance of DEA reports of interviews with one of the claimants and other involved parties all \u201cremarkably consistent\u201d and admissible despite hearsay component]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Eight Firearms </em>(S.D.W.Va. 1995) 881 F.Supp. 1074, 1077-1079 [police affidavits admitted]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>7715 Betsy Bruce Lane Summerfield, N.C. </em>(4th Cir. 1990) 906 F.2d 110, 113 [court erred in excluding hearsay evidence of allegedly \u201ccoerced\u201d testimony, police affidavits and bank records].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">We do not decide whether hearsay may be relied upon for purposes of subdivision (h) of section 11488.4, which provides generally that a defendant may move in \u201can underlying or related criminal action\u201d for the return of seized property \u201con the grounds that there is not probable cause to believe that the property\u201d is subject to forfeiture. This provision was put into the statute in 1994, contemporaneously with the repeal of what was then section 11488.4, subdivision (g)(1). (Stats. 1994, ch. 314, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12, eff. Aug. 19, 1994; see <em>People </em>v. <em>$28,500 United States Currency, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 462-463.)

Also eliminated by the 1994 amendments was the portion of former section 11488.4, subdivision (g)(1), which required the prosecution to defend against a claimant\u2019s motion for return by showing, on the basis of \u201cevidence, prior judicial testimony, deposition, affidavit, or declaration,\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>probable cause existed. (Former \u00a7 11488.4, subd.
