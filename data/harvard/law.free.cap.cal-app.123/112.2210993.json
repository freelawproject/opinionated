The trial was had before a jury, and a verdict of $55,000 returned in favor of plaintiff. The appeal is from the judgment entered upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Plaintiff was the owner of an interest in certain real property in Seattle, Washington, which she alleged was worth $75,000, and which was subject to a mortgage of $20,000. Herman Kronfield was the owner of what is known as the \u201cFirst Avenue\u201d property in said city. After negotiations between the parties and their agents, an exchange of these properties was effected. It was alleged in the complaint that defendant, as the agent of Kronfield and acting in connivance with the latter, made false representations in respect to the value of the \u201cFirst Avenue\u201d property; the income therefrom; its condition and state of repair and many other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">While appellant does not definitely so state, we would gather from his \u201cargument\u201d that he relies upon the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. Assuming that he had this idea in view, he is precluded from urging the point for the reason that he has failed to comply with the provisions of section 953e of the Code of Civil Procedure, the appeal being taken under the \u201calternative method\u201d. The record in the case covers some fifteen hundred pages of typewritten transcript, and appellant has failed \u201cto print in his brief or in a supplement appended thereto, such portions of the record as they desire to call to the attention of the court\u201d. In all, about half a dozen questions and answers are quoted from the record. We do not feel called upon, under such circumstances, to assume the vexatious burden of an examination of the typewritten record. <em>(Eddy </em>v. <em>Stowe, </em>43 Cal. App. 789 [185 Pac. 1024].) The insufficiency of the evidence to support a particular point raised will not be considered unless printed in the briefs. <em>(Town of St. Selena </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>171 Cal. 135 [152 Pac. 299].) We presume that the judgment is regular and that there is ample evidence in the record to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The instructions are next questioned by appellant in a manner which is vague and uncertain. Forty-one instructions are printed in appellant\u2019s brief, some given and some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>refused. His attack upon these is made in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cThe appellant contends that the court erred in refusing to give the instructions hereinafter specified and in giving the instructions requested by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s instructions the court instructed the jury on conspiracy, whereas the testimony produced was destitute of any vestige of conspiracy on the part of appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201cLikewise, there was no evidence that Kolmitz or Kronfield was the agent of appellant in this transaction and it was error to instruct the jury on the subject of agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">No portion of the evidence questioned is printed in the brief, and no instruction is specifically attacked. In keeping with his attitude throughout here again we find appellant proceeding upon the mistaken theory that error is presumed, and that we are going to search through these forty-one instructions in order to find reversible error. The quotation given from appellant\u2019s brief is all that he has to say upon the matter of instructions. We deem such a presentation as indicative of an utter lack of confidence in the merit of the point urged for our consideration, and we presume that the court did not err in the giving or refusing of the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The foregoing disposes of all the contentions made by appellant. The appeal has all the \u201cearmarks\u201d of dilatoriness and borders upon the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u25a0 Nourse, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on May 27, 1932, and an application by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on June 24, 1932. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
