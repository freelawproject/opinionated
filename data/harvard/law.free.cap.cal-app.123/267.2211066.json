The respondent lias filed a demurrer and has also filed an answer.  The petitioner states that: \u201cThe sole question presented for determination is whether the power of fixing the number and compensation of justices\u2019 deputy clerks, of the justice\u2019s court of Oakland township, county of Alameda, rests with the board of supervisors of that county or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the legislature of the state of California.\u201d However, he divides his argument into two parts. In the first place he claims that the charter of Alameda County made no direct provision on the subject but, instead of doing so, it purported to delegate the power to the board of supervisors and purported to authorize that board to cover the subject by enacting an ordinance. (Stats. 1927, p. 2033, sec. 12, subd. [c].) In this same connection he argues that the charter made no provision for any \u201cinferior courts\u201d or \u201cother officers of inferior courts\u201d (Const., art. XI, sec. 7\u00bd, subd. 3), and he concludes, therefore, that the passage contained in the charter is invalid and that section 103c of the Code of Civil Procedure is the law in force and which is applicable to his case. Calling attention to the amendment of the Constitution by the enactment of section 11a of article VI of the Constitution, and the later amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure extending the jurisdiction of justices of the peace in certain localities, the petitioner contends that a justice\u2019s court is not an inferior court within the meaning of article XI, section 7\u00bd, subdivision 3, of the Constitution, and therefore the board of supervisors of Alameda County had no authority to enact an ordinance on the subject of assistants and deputies in the office of the clerk of the justice\u2019s court\u2014 in other words, that the Justice\u2019s Court of Oakland Township was not within the contemplation of the board of freeholders when framing the provisions contained in the charter. To these contentions the rsepondent replies as follows. Article XI, section 7\u00bd, provides: \u201cIt shall be competent, in all charters, framed under the authority given by this section to provide, in addition to any other provisions allowable by this Constitution, and the same shall provide, for the following matters: ... 3. For the number of justices of the peace and constables for each township, ...\u201d The board of freeholders did as directed. It incorporated in the charter the following provisions covering the subject: \u201cSec. 21. In each township there shall be as many justices of the peace as are, or may be hereafter provided by general law, and not more than one constable for each justice\u2019s court, together with such clerks, deputy constables and other officers as may be authorized by the board of supervisors; . . . Sec. 22. Justices of the peace in each township shall be nominated and elected at the times and in the manner and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>terms now or hereafter provided by general law. Constables shall be appointed by the sheriff from the eligible civil service list. Sec. 23. The compensation of justices of the peace of each township and of constables shall be fixed by the board of supervisors. ...\u201d The respondent also quotes subdivision 5 of section 7\u00bd, of article XI of the Constitution, that the charter shall provide: \u201c5. For the fixing and regulation by boards of supervisors, by ordinance, of the appointment and number of assistants, deputies, clerks, attaches and other persons to be employed, from time to time, in the several offices of the county, and for the prescribing and regulating by such boards of the powers, duties, qualifications and compensation of such persons, the times at which, and terms for which they shall be appointed, and the manner of their appointment and removal.\u201d The board of freeholders wrote section 12, which, among other things, provides: \u201cSec. 12. It shall be the duty of the board of supervisors: ...(b) To provide, by ordinance, for the compensation of elective and appointive officers, assistants, deputies, clerks, attaches and employees unless such compensation is otherwise fixed by this charter. The compensation of elective officers shall be fixed at least six months prior to the election of such officer. The compensation of elective officers shall not be increased or diminished after the election of such officer or during his term of office; provided, however, that the board of supervisors may allow such.additional deputies or assistants as may be necessary and proper, to elective and appointive officers during their terms of office, and that the board of supervisors may also increase the compensation of such deputies and assistants during the term of office of such officers. . . . (d) To provide, by ordinance, for the number of assistants, deputies, clerks, attaches and other persons to be employed from time to time in the several offices and institutions of the county.\u201d Continuing, the respondent shows that pursuant to the provisions of the charter said ordinances have been enacted and that they provide that seven clerks may be appointed in the office of the justice of the peace of Oakland township and that prior to the appointment of this petitioner seven appointments had been made and that there was no vacancy and the appointment of the petitioner was not provided for. Moreover, the respondent calls attention to the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>charter provides a complete civil service system, that ordinances have been enacted putting it in force, that examinations have been had, and that a list of available qualified persons has been prepared, but that the petitioner\u2019s name was not on said list.  The respondent notes that subdivision 5 of section <em>7\u00bd </em>uses the expression \u201coffices of the county\u201d and does not expressly use the words \u201coffices of the township\u201d, but he contends that a township officer is in fact a county officer of limited jurisdiction. The point is sustained by many cases, <em>(Longan </em>v. <em>County of Solano, </em>65 Cal. 122, 124 [3 Pac. 463] ; <em>Crockett </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>157 Cal. 153 [106 Pac. 575]; <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>34 Cal. App. 340, 341 [167 Pac. 408] ; <em>Kilroy </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>115 Cal. App. 43 [300 Pac. 851]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>133 Cal. 74, 77 [65 Pac. 325] ; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Jerome, </em>31 Cal. App. 97, 99, 100 [159 Pac. 884].) Furthermore, picking up section 7\u00bd of article XI, and reading it in its entirety, no doubt remains that it was intended to apply to all county and township offices and the deputies and assistants therein as those particular offices were heretofore known, to others recently created, and to others to be thereafter created by general statutes or by amendments to the Constitution. Moreover, when the people were called upon to vote on the proposed amendment to the Constitution, adding section 7\u00bd to article XI, there were published by authority of law (Pol. Code, sec. 1195) written statements as to the meaning and scope of the section. Senator Caminetti, the author, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cThis proposal to amend the organic law occupying the second place on the official ballot for the ensuing special election on constitutional amendments, known as the \u2018 County Home Rule Amendment, \u2019 is a logical growth from the successful administration of \u2018 charter cities\u2019 formed under the \u2018home rule\u2019 provisions of our constitution relating to municipalities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cWhen the constitution of 1879 was framed it was with the knowledge that the one adopted in 1849 permitted special legislation for county and local governments and for many other purposes. This privilege had been abused to such an extent as to create a widespread demand for uniformity in county government as well as for the regulation of many other matters of state concern. As a result the uniform system of county and township government, since in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>force, was inserted therein. It was supposed to be impregnable to the assault of those demanding special laws, as to county and township officers, their salaries, and the number and compensation of deputies when such are allowed; but a way was devised, by classifying counties so as to put each county in a class by itself, to obtain on these subjects in the guise of uniformity what formerly was openly secured under special legislation. Thus the old system is still in control and is generally supreme. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cA county should be governed by the same rule that a discreet business man conducts his affairs. The present county system does not work on such a plan. Home rule in county, township and road government will' approximately, if not wholly, secure such a condition. It will have the merit of being a people\u2019s government, with the immediate power of correcting abuses in the possession of the electorate, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cIt will be noted that these subjects, viz.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201c(a) All matters of a local nature, affecting county administration and county and township officers and deputies, their employment, method of selection, amount of compensation, etc.; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201c(b) Road administration, including construction, repair and maintenance of all except state highways, are the two with which it will be competent, under this proposed amendment, for the people of a county to deal. These subjects generally require in the detail of their administration more of the people\u2019s taxes than all the balance of the business affairs of the county; hence it is considered proper that they should form the nucleus for the proposed charter county governments. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Senator T. W. H. Shanahan, writing in opposition to the adoption of the amendment, took the position that by the amendment a charter could be adopted that would provide for the appointment instead of the election of officers, but he was at great pains to indicate that a charter adopted by a board of freeholders would include all of the officers\u2014 both county and township.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">In what has been said above it will be noticed that the respondent bases no right or defense on any part (except the first clause) of subdivision 3, section 7\u00bd, of article XI of the Constitution. He was not bound to do otherwise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The entire subdivision is as follows: \u201c3. For the number of justices of the peace and constables for each township, <em>or </em>for the number of such judges and other officers of such inferior courts as may be provided by the Constitution or general law, for the election or appointment of said officers, for the times at which and the terms for which said officers shall be elected or appointed, and for their compensation, or for the fixing of such compensation by boards of supervisors, and if appointed, for the manner of their appointment.\u201d It will be observed that the passage is in the disjunctive. It will be conceded that the mandate of the Constitution directs the board of freeholders to provide for justices\u2019 courts or inferior courts. However there is no mandate to provide for both. We have shown above that the charter under consideration does provide for justices' courts. That was sufficient. The passage just quoted is closely allied to section 1, article VI, of the Constitution as it read when section 7\u00bd was adopted: \u201cSection 1. The judicial power of the state shall be vested in the senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, in a supreme court, district courts of appeal, superior courts, justices of the peace, and such inferior courts as the legislature may establish in any incorporated city or town, or city and county.\u201d That there should be inferior courts, whether justices\u2019 courts or otherwise, has at all times been provided in the Constitution. Therefore, to the end that a county, governed by a freeholders\u2019 charter, should not depart from the general policy of the state, subdivision 3 was inserted in section <em>7\u00bd </em>of article XI. However, as we have shown above, the provisions of said subdivision have been complied with so far as any element of this case is concerned and other matters need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">As shown above, it has at all times been provided that our judicial system shall include courts inferior to superior courts (Const., art. VI, sec. 1). From time to time, in one place or another, we have had justices\u2019 courts, recorders\u2019 courts, municipal criminal courts, police courts, and quite recently municipal courts. Lately, in some counties where the population is large, it has been provided that the justices\u2019 courts therein shall have a more extended jurisdiction than other justices\u2019 courts. (Const., art. VI, sec. 11a; Stats. 1929, chap. 473.) But we have never had two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>more different classes of justices\u2019 courts. Cases involving municipal courts are not helpful. Those courts are a class unto themselves. (Const., art. VI, sec. 12; <em>In re Rissman, </em>87 Cal. App. 176 [261 Pac. 727].) If in Alameda County provision were to he made for inferior courts as distinguished from justices\u2019 , courts, then the petitioner might claim that the charter should have provided for his appointment, term of office, compensation, etc. (Const., art. XI, sec. <em>7\u00bd, </em>subd. 3; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>79 Cal. App. 780 [251 Pac. 324].) But no such court has been provided. A justice\u2019s court has been provided. Although the Justice\u2019s Court of Oakland Township has a broader jurisdiction than a justice\u2019s court in some other township, it is still a justice\u2019s court. Certainly there is nothing on the face of the Constitution to show that the words \u201cjustice of the peace\u201d were used in subdivision 3, section 7\u00bd, article XI, with any different meaning or limitation than used elsewhere in that same instrument. Nothing is contained in Statutes of 1929, chapters 470 and 473, to the effect that the justices\u2019 courts therein named are not the same justices\u2019 courts as those referred to in the numerous sections of the Code of Civil Procedure (secs. 831h-927q) and other general laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">As shown above the petitioner claims his appointment was validly made under Code of Civil Procedure, section 103c, as enacted by Statutes of 1931, chapter 1092, and that that statute was validly enacted under section 11a, article VI, of the Constitution as that section was adopted in 1928. Continuing, he claims that section 7\u00bd, article XI, of the Constitution, which was adopted in 1911, and the charter adopted thereunder, are not controlling as to his rights. It will be noted, however, that section 11a, article VI, deals with the number of judges, but is wholly silent as to any other officer of the court. On the other hand, section 7\u00bd of article XI, specifically deals with the number, appointment and compensation of the judges, deputies, and assistants in justices\u2019 courts and inferior courts in a county having a charter. But section 11a, article VI, deals with inferior courts generally and in such broad terms as to include justices\u2019 courts. Does it modify or repeal section 7\u00bd of article XI? It is settled law that Constitutions will be construed under the rules for construing statutes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>In <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Colgan, </em>111 Cal. 580, at page 586 [44 Pac. 238, 240], the court quoted with approval: \u201c \u2018It is a rule of construction that a special statute providing for a particular case, or applicable to a particular locality, is not repealed by a statute general in its terms and application, unless the intention of the legislature to repeal or alter the special law is manifest, although the terms of the general act would, taken strictly, and, but for the special law, include the case or cases provided by it.\u2019 \u201d When a charter is involved, general enactments are specially limited by construction in such manner as to protect the charter. <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commrs., </em>58 Cal. 561, 564.) Therefore the petitioner has obtained no rights under section 11a of article VI of the Constitution or the statutes enacted thereunder. That he has no rights under general laws enacted under sections 4 and 5 of article XI is expressly stated in section 7\u00bd of article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The application for a writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Nourse, P. J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on June 1, 1932.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
