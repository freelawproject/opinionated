Gilham, deceased. The contest was filed by Kelsey M. Gilham, the son of the deceased. The defendant Jessie Chittenden answered the contest and a trial was had before the court sitting with a jury. At the end of the hearing the trial court submitted to the jury forms of several special verdicts, among others: \u201cQuestion 1. Did Nellie F. Gilham subscribe her name at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the end of the instrument (contestant\u2019s exhibit 1) dated October 28, 1929? Answer. -. (Note. If question 1 above is answered \u2018No\u2019 then the jury need not find as to any other question.) \u201d The jury answered \u201cNo\u201d and a judgment in favor of the contestant was entered on the verdict. Later the defendants moved for a new trial, basing their motion on all of the statutory grounds. The motion was denied and the defendants have appealed and have brought up a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The defendants contend that the verdict is not supported by the evidence. They assert that the contestant introduced no evidence excepting the testimony of Mr. Chauncey McGovern, an expert witness, whereas the defendants introduced the testimony of the petitioner, Mrs. Jessie Chittenden, Mr. E. L. Geiger and his wife. Continuing, they assert that their witnesses were not in any way contradicted and therefore the verdict should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The uncontradicted evidence is that on October 28, 1929, Mrs. Chittenden wrote the purported will. All disputes involve what happened thereafter. Mrs. Chittenden testified that about ten days later the decedent and Mr. and Mrs. Geiger were at the home of Mrs. Chittenden at Burlingame, in San Mateo County. As to what happened there on the morning of that date, she testified as follows: \u201cMr. Geiger remained a few minutes and then said he would have to go on to work; this was around 10 o\u2019clock in the morning; Nellie F. Gilham then said, \u2018Wait a moment I want you to do something for me before you go.\u2019 She then asked me to get the papers, \u2018that it was as good a time as any to sign them\u2019. I did so, and she said to Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Geiger, \u2018I have made a little will and I want you to sign .as witnesses. \u2019 Mr. Geiger then said, \u2018I would like to read this Aunt Nell before signing my life away.\u2019 She said \u2018All right.\u2019 I then said, \u2018Read it aloud, Mr. Geiger.\u2019 Mr. Geiger then read contestant\u2019s exhibit 1 aloud in full. When he had completed the reading he said, \u2018It does look like a will all right,\u2019 and Nellie P. Gilham said, \u2018Yes, it is my will, \u2019 and she signed her name to it. I then signed my name to the will and Mrs. Geiger signed and then Mr. Geiger signed his name to the will, contestant\u2019s exhibit 1. Mr. Geiger then bade us goodbye and left the house.\u201d Regarding the same incident Mr. Geiger testified: \u201cI stayed a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>minutes and was about to go when Nellie F. Gilham said, \u2018Wait a minute, Erb, I want you to do something for me,\u2019 then she turned to Jessie Chittenden and said, \u2018Jessie, get me those papers.\u2019 I said, \u2018What do you want me to do, Aunt Nell?\u2019 She said, \u2018I have made a little will and I want you and Mrs. Geiger to sign as witnesses.\u2019 Jessie Chittenden got the papers out of a drawer and placed them upon the table. I said, \u2018Before I sign my life away I would like to read it.\u2019 I picked it up and read it aloud. When I had finished I said, \u2018It does sound like a will,\u2019 and Nellie F. Gilham replied, \u2018It is my will.\u2019 I said, \u2018I think that you should see an attorney\u2019 and she said, \u2018Maybe, but it will be all right.\u2019 She then took the will and signed it. Jessie Chittenden then signed and my wife signed; I signed last. When this was done I left to go on to my work.\u201d Regarding the same incident Mrs. Geiger testified: \u201cWe talked a bit and my husband, soon after he arrived, took leave to go to work. As he was doing so Nellie F. Gilham asked him to wait a moment, that she wanted him to do something. He asked what it was, and she replied, \u2018I want you and Mrs. Geiger to sign a will I have made.\u2019 She asked Jessie Chittenden to get the papers and Jessie Chittenden brought the papers, contestant\u2019s exhibit 1, from out of a drawer and placed them on the table. My husband said, \u2018I would like to know what it is before I sign my life away,\u2019 and he picked up the papers to read them. Then he read them aloud. When he had finished he said, \u2018It does sound like a will Aunt Nell, \u2019 and she replied that it was her will. Nellie F. Gilham then signed it and I signed it and Jessie Chittenden and my husband signed. I used the pen that had been used by. Nellie F. Gilham. My husband used a fountain pen. When we had all signed, Jessie Chittenden held the will before a fire to dry the ink. My husband then left the house and I remained the rest of the day.\u201d Comparing the testimony of each of those witnesses with that of each of the others, it will be seen that there is an astonishing similarity in detail that might impress any jury as indicating fabricated testimony. Furthermore, Mr. Geiger and Mrs. Chittenden testified that Mr. Geiger' used a fountain pen but that Mrs. Gilham, Mrs. Geiger, and Mrs. Chittenden used the same pen and the same ink. Mr. McGovern testified that the name Nellie F. Gilham was not entirely written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>with the same ink. By stipulation of counsel the will was produced at the oral argument. An inspection of the signature with the naked eye discloses at least two different inks. The extreme terminal of the name \u201cNellie\u201d is decidedly reddish in color, whereas all of the rest of the signature is black in color. Therefore it may not be said that the witnesses for the defendant were not discredited.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Mr. McGovern, one of the witnesses for the contestant, was examined and cross-examined at length. Tie testified that the signature, Nellie F. Gilham, was a \u201cclumsy forgery\u201d. In explanation of that statement he gave many different reasons, all of wfhich tend to impress one favorably who reads the testimony. There were introduced in evidence many checks written by the decedent either shortly before the date of the alleged execution of the purported will or shortly thereafter. These exemplars show that Mrs. Gilham wrote a firm, well-formed hand that was altogether masculine in appearance. Although she was admitted to be of the age of seventy-seven years or thereabouts, her signature has the appearance of one in middle life. The signature attached to the will distinctly varies from each and all of the exemplars in this, \u201cNellie F. G\u201d is the trembling hand of one in her dotage, but the terminal \u201cilham\u201d is firm and flowing in appearance. After the signature on the will appears a period. At no other time did it appear that the decedent ever used a period when writing her signature. The exemplars, in themselves, were some evidence to the effect that the. signature at the end of the will was not genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The contestant was called as a witness in his own behalf. Among other things he testified: \u201cI am and have been for many years last past familiar with my mother\u2019s signature\u2014 Mrs. Nellie F. \u2022 Gilham. I do not believe the signature Nellie F. Gilham to said purported will is my mother\u2019s signature or was written by her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In view of what appears above, it will suffice to state that, in our opinion, it may not be said there was not substantial evidence in support of the verdict. Under these circumstances the verdict may not be disturbed on appeal. (2 Cal. Jur., pp. 918-935.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Nourse, P. J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
