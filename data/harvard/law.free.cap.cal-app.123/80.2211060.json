The defendant denied that he committed the alleged crime, and offered testimony tending to support an alleged alibi. The only contention made by defendant upon this appeal is that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict of the jury finding him guilty. The questions presented at the trial, as to this phase of the case, were questions of fact. There is to be found in the record evidence of a substantial nature to support the verdict, and under those circumstances this court will not disturb the verdict of the jury. At best there is but a conflict in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
