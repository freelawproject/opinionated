Defendant did so with the expectation that she would get sole or primary custody of PD. The plan quickly unraveled, and defendant was charged and ultimately convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and making a false report of felony child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, defendant argues that she is not criminally liable for making a false report because she did not make the report\n   <em>\n    herself\n   </em>\n   , but instead the report was made by PD to a school teacher, who then reported the matter to the school principal, who in turn reported the matter to Child Protective Services (CPS). Because defendant used PD and the school officials as \"innocent agents,\" we conclude that defendant can still be held criminally liable as a principal for making a false report of felony child abuse. Concluding that defendant's remaining claims of error are similarly without merit, we affirm her convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant and Louis Dominion have a daughter, PD, born in 2006. The parents have never been married, and they have\n   been involved in extensive custody litigation over PD since 2007. Dominion became PD's primary caregiver in January 2009 with defendant having parenting time every other weekend. In November 2013, while PD was visiting defendant, defendant told PD that if PD told a teacher at school that Dominion \"hurt [her] private parts\" and locked her in a closet, then PD would be able to spend more time with defendant. There was also testimony suggesting that defendant offered to buy PD a new horse if she made this allegation at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after this discussion, PD told a teacher that Dominion \"hurts [her] and has hurt [her] private parts.\" PD's teacher reported the statement to the school's principal, who reported the incident to CPS. PD was later interviewed about the allegations, and she admitted that defendant told her to lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, MCL 750.145, and making a false report of felony child abuse, MCL 722.633(5). The district court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, refused to bind defendant over to the circuit court on the charge of making a false report of child abuse. The district court concluded that defendant could not be guilty under MCL 722.633(5) because defendant did not personally make a false report of child abuse. The district court compared the language of MCL 722.633(5) to the language of the false-crime-report statute,\n   MCL 750.411a. MCL 722.633(5) states that \"[a] person who intentionally makes a false report of child abuse or neglect under this act knowing that the report is false is guilty of a crime.\" For its part, MCL 750.411a(1) contains similar language and states that \"a person who intentionally makes a false report of the commission of a crime, or intentionally causes a false report of the commission of a crime to be made, ... knowing the report is false, is guilty of a crime.\" Under the principle that the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of other things, coupled with the principle that laws dealing with the same subject should be interpreted harmoniously, the district court concluded that the inclusion of the phrase \"or intentionally causes a false report of the commission of a crime to be made\" in MCL 750.411a, and the omission of similar language from MCL 722.633(5) must be given effect. Thus, it held that the Legislature did not intend to make punishable a person's intentionally causing a false report of child abuse to be made when that person does not personally make the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The prosecution appealed the district court's decision to the circuit court, and the circuit court reversed. In doing so, the circuit court noted that under the common-law theory of innocent agent, a person was liable for the commission of a crime as a principal when the person used an \"innocent other\" as an instrumentality to commit the offense. The circuit court commented that MCL 722.633 and MCL 750.411a were codified in different chapters of the compiled laws and that the additional language present in MCL 750.411a was the result of the Legislature's 2004 amendment to MCL 750.411a. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20PA%20104\">\n    2004 PA 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because that amendment was enacted 20 years after MCL 722.633(5) was first enacted, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1984%20PA%20418\">\n    1984 PA 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the trial court declined\n   to read MCL 750.411a as conclusive evidence that the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law\n   doctrine of innocent agent by way of MCL 722.633(5). Accordingly, the circuit court allowed the charge of making a false report of child abuse to proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before trial, the prosecution noticed defendant of its intent to introduce evidence that, in 2008, defendant made three false reports that Dominion was sexually abusing PD. Defendant objected to the introduction of this evidence, and the trial court ultimately concluded that the evidence was admissible under MRE 404(b) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he Court finds that evidence of the Defendant's prior allegations or complaints of sexual abuse of [the child] by [Dominion] to CPS, the resulting CPS investigation, resulting parenting time suspension during the CPS investigation, and ultimate disposition of the investigation, are logically relevant to show Defendant's motive and intent to commit the charged offense (intention [sic] false reporting of felony child abuse, MCL \u00a7 722.633(5) ). Similarly, to the extent that it appears the object of the charged act (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   Defendant falsely reporting the child abuse through her daughter) remains at issue, the Court finds that those \"other acts\" have the requisite concurrence and combination of common features, to support the [prosecution's] purpose of showing Defendant's plan or scheme. Thus, as to these stated \"other acts\" involving Defendant initiating reports to CPS, the Court finds that the [prosecution has] satisfied its burden of establishing admissibility under MRE 404(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the jury heard evidence that on three occasions in 2008, defendant took PD to a doctor after PD returned from Dominion's care. Defendant informed the doctor that she had observed redness and swelling in PD's vaginal area, and the doctor reported the concerns to CPS. CPS initiated investigations of each complaint, all of which were unsubstantiated. The jury also heard evidence that these complaints led CPS to file a petition\n   in 2008 against both defendant and Dominion to place PD in foster care while CPS investigated the false allegations. Evidence of this latter petition was not noticed by either party before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury ultimately found defendant guilty of making a false report of felony child abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. For these convictions, the trial court sentenced defendant to seven days in county jail and two years' probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant appealed her convictions as of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. DEFENDANT WAS PROPERLY CHARGED AND CONVICTED AS A PRINCIPAL UNDER MCL 722.633(5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We first address defendant's argument that under traditional canons of statutory construction, she should not have been charged with, let alone convicted of, making a false report of felony child abuse because she did not personally make the report and she did not speak to a mandatory reporter. \"This Court reviews de novo questions of statutory interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

MCL 722.633(5) IS NOT LIMITED TO MANDATORY REPORTERS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that she cannot be held criminally liable under MCL 722.633(5) because defendant and PD were not mandatory reporters, and the statute only criminalizes false reports by mandatory reporters. She buttresses this argument with a second point-because other provisions of Michigan law criminalize false reports of criminal activity by nonmandatory reporters, MCL 722.633(5) must be read to be limited solely to mandatory reporters of felony child abuse or neglect. We reject both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to her first argument, MCL 722.633(5) provides in pertinent part: \"A person who intentionally makes a false report of child abuse or neglect under this act knowing that the report is false is guilty of a crime ....\" Defendant argues that the phrase \"under this act\" refers to mandatory reporters as defined in the Child Protection Law, MCL 722.621 et seq., and therefore the Legislature clearly intended to limit the scope of the statute to only those designated reporters. MCL 722.623(1) identifies the specific categories of persons who are required to report child abuse under the act, and neither a parent nor a child is included. Given this, defendant maintains that she cannot be found guilty under MCL 722.633(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant's argument suffers from a fundamental flaw-while the Child Protection Law mandates that certain persons report suspected child abuse, the law does not preclude a person who is not a mandatory reporter from reporting suspected child abuse. In fact, the Child Protection Law explicitly contemplates these reports. Specifically, MCL 722.624 provides, \"In addition to those persons required to report child abuse or neglect under [ MCL 722.623 ], any person, including a child, who has reasonable cause to suspect child abuse\n   or neglect may report the matter to the department or a law enforcement agency.\" A person who chooses, but is not required, to make a report would still be doing so \"under this act,\" i.e., under the authority of MCL 722.624.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant suggests that such a reading would render the phrase \"under this act\" superfluous. But just because the reading would encompass all instances of false reporting to CPS of child abuse or neglect-those made by mandatory reporters and nonmandatory reporters alike-this does not mean that \"under this act\" is without content. Rather, the phrase clarifies that the activity criminalized by MCL 722.633(5) is the making of a specific report to CPS as authorized by the Child Protection Law, as opposed to some other kind of report not involving abuse or neglect of a child or made to some person or entity other than CPS or law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to defendant's second argument, while she contends that other provisions of Michigan law criminalize false reports by nonmandatory reporters, this contention lends no weight to her position. It is well established that the same activity can violate more than one criminal provision. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1399039\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/262/443/#p447\">\n    262 Mich. App. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447-450,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20N.W.2d%20119\">\n    687 N.W.2d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (recognizing that the Legislature may choose to punish the same activity under multiple criminal provisions). Even if her activity might have violated another provision criminalizing false reports, it does not follow that her activity could not also have violated the Child Protection Law, MCL 722.633(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, because the Child Protection Law expressly contemplates reporting of child abuse by mandatory and nonmandatory reporters, the plain meaning of the reference in MCL 722.633(5) to \"[a] person\n   who intentionally makes a false report of child abuse or neglect under this act\" covers both mandatory and nonmandatory reporters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2. THE DOCTRINE OF INNOCENT AGENT APPLIES TO MCL 722.633(5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant next argues that she is not liable under MCL 722.633(5) because she did not personally make the false report of child abuse. The district court agreed with defendant, concluding that (a) the inclusion of language in a similar statute ( MCL 750.411a ) that criminalizes a false report of a crime by (i) a person who actually makes the report as well as (ii) a person who causes such a report to be made, and (b) the omission of language in MCL 722.633(5) involving those who cause a report to be made, means that the Legislature intended to hold liable only the former (i) and not the latter (ii) with respect to false reports of child abuse. While not without some logical force, we ultimately agree with the circuit court that the better understanding of MCL 722.633(5) covers both groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In construing a statute, the Court's analysis begins with the plain meaning of the statutory language itself. If the plain meaning of the language is clear, then the Court's analysis is at an end, and there is no need to reach for canons of construction for aid.\n   <em>\n    People v.

It is equally clear that the Legislature did not intend to change, amend, or repeal any aspect of the common law by enacting MCL 722.633(5). Thus, the statute must be read in light of the well-established common-law doctrine of the \"innocent agent.\" Under this doctrine, when a defendant uses an innocent person to accomplish a crime on the defendant's behalf, the defendant is guilty of the crime as a principal, rather than under any of the accomplice-liability theories.

As the trial evidence showed, defendant repeatedly used PD and others as agents to make false reports of child abuse against PD's father. As a result, on at least three occasions, PD was removed from her father's care, and, on at least one occasion, PD was removed from the care of both her parents and placed into foster care. With respect to the charged offense, defendant used PD to report to her teacher, who then reported the matter to the school principal, who in turn reported the matter to CPS. Neither PD, the teacher, nor the school principal intended to make a false report; instead, they were acting as the innocent agents of defendant's malicious plan. Nor was the chain of agents too attenuated\n   under the facts of this case, as PD was a minor and both the teacher and principal were mandatory reporters under MCL 722.623, meaning that they had no choice or discretion under the law but to report the allegations in accordance with the Child Protection Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because we conclude that MCL 722.633(5) is not ambiguous with respect to holding liable someone who uses an innocent agent to make a false report of child abuse, we need not resort to the canons of construction used by the district court and suggested by defendant. The district court correctly noted that MCL 722.633(5) shares a similar subject with MCL 750.411a, as both criminalize the making of false reports of certain criminal activity. And the district court applied a common canon of construction that instructs that where language is included in one provision but omitted from a related provision, then the Legislature intended for that omission to be given effect by courts.

One could argue that had the\n   Legislature intended to keep MCL 722.633(5) consistent with MCL 750.411a, it would have enacted identical amendments to both statutes in 2004. This would, however, stretch the canon of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   too thin. There are likely many reasons-policy and nonpolicy alike-why the Legislature would choose to amend one\n   section of law without at the same time amending a related section, including interest, resources, politics, attention, etc. Reflecting this reality, our Supreme Court has limited the canon to instances when the related statute is an earlier enactment.

Every instance immediately followed a weekend in which Dominion had parenting time with PD. The physician, a mandatory reporter of child abuse, contacted CPS, and then CPS and the police opened an investigation into Dominion involving possible sexual abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dominion's parenting time was suspended during each investigation. After each investigation was closed as unsubstantiated, Dominion's parenting time resumed. In the instant case, defendant instructed PD to tell a teacher-a mandatory reporter-that Dominion \"hurt [her] privates.\" PD indicated that defendant told her to make the false allegation so that she could spend more time with defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In both the charged and uncharged conduct, instead of personally lodging a complaint with CPS, defendant used PD to make or infer an allegation of abuse to a mandatory reporter, who would then be legally required to report the abuse to CPS. In each instance, CPS would initiate an investigation of Dominion, and PD would be removed from her father's direct care. Given the similar victims-PD and Dominion-as well as the similar pattern-defendant, through PD, caused a report to be made to CPS and an investigation of Dominion inevitably followed-the uncharged conduct from 2008 was logically relevant under MRE 404(b) to show defendant's common plan, scheme, or system in using PD to make a false allegation of sexual abuse against Dominion in 2013. We likewise find that the uncharged conduct was also relevant to show defendant's motive for causing the false report to be made in the instant case in that the false report could cause CPS to remove PD from Dominion's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Regardless of its relevance, defendant also argues that the other-acts evidence was unduly prejudicial to her defense such that it should have been excluded under MRE 403. \"Evidence is unfairly prejudicial when there exists a danger that marginally probative evidence will be given undue or preemptive weight by the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

As discussed above, the other-acts\n   evidence involving the initiation of the three CPS investigations in 2008 was highly probative to show that defendant used a continuing plan or scheme to use CPS investigations to suspend Dominion's parenting time so that she would have full or primary custody of her daughter. Although this evidence was prejudicial to defendant, it was not unfairly prejudicial or otherwise so prejudicial that an instruction to the jury under MRE 105 would not cure it. See\n   <em>\n    VanderVliet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2007992\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/444/52/#p74\">\n    444 Mich. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=508%20N.W.2d%20114\">\n    508 N.W.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly,\n   we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the other-acts evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   2. DEFENDANT OPENED THE DOOR TO THE 2008 CPS PETITION TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant also argues that testimony regarding the 2008 CPS petition filed against her was inadmissible because the prosecution never noticed her of its intent to admit such evidence and because the evidence's probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Under MRE 404(b)(2), absent good cause, a prosecutor must provide advance notice of the general nature of evidence it intends to introduce at trial. Despite defendant's claim of insufficient notice, the record indicates that it was defendant herself who introduced the specific allegations of the 2008 CPS petition at trial. Dominion briefly testified about the 2008 CPS petition as it involved him but did not testify about the allegations in the petition. Specifically, Dominion testified in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . Now, did anything change in custody in terms of [your daughter]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . It got to a point where the CPS ... finally petitioned the Court to take [my daughter] away from her parents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . And after-that was after the third unsubstantiated allegation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . That was past the third one. It was in October of 2008.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . And did you cooperate with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . And then did you get-after that was all taken care of, did you receive time with [your daughter]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . After that was taken care of, she was put into foster care. [My daughter] was put in foster care so that they could evaluate myself and the other parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . Okay. We are not going to get into that part of it.

Eventually, when that case was taken care of, did you end up getting custody, having time with [your daughter]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This testimony provides only a timeline regarding Dominion's custody of PD, and therefore did not implicate the notice provisions of MRE 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Rather, it was defendant who introduced testimony implicating MRE 404(b) when defense counsel questioned defendant about whether the petition was in response to her making false allegations to CPS, and she responded that she did not remember:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . ... at that point, was there a petition filed at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . And at some point in 2008, did that petition become about you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   . That came about whether you were making false allegations or something else? Do you know what the petition was about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   . I don't remember the specific what-what it was actually about, I just remember that it was-it was about me and if I was doing something to cause\n   [my daughter's] injuries or they'd come-it was something about botched evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant additional questions about the 2008 CPS petition. Defense counsel objected to the relevance of the testimony. The trial court overruled the objection, stating \"No, I'm going to allow it. It's related to-you brought up the petition.\" Defendant does not take issue on\n   appeal with this ruling, and we likewise find no error. Because defendant was the party who first pursued the substantive allegations involving the 2008 petition, any prejudice flowing from the evidence was of defendant's own making. We find defendant's claim to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   3. THE PROSECUTOR'S CLOSING ARGUMENT WAS NOT IMPROPER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, defendant asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct in his closing argument by asserting that defendant essentially had a propensity for making false reports of sexual abuse to CPS. \"Because the challenged prosecutorial statements in this case were not preserved by contemporaneous objections and requests for curative instructions, appellate review is for outcome-determinative, plain error.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.
