Goodman's amended report recommending that this court suspend Attorney Daniel J. Rostollan's license to practice law in Wisconsin for a period of two years and direct him to pay restitution as well as the costs of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 No appeal has been filed so we review the referee's report pursuant to Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 22.17(2). After conducting an independent review of the matter, we agree that Attorney Rostollan should be deemed to have defaulted, we accept and adopt the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are based on the allegations of the complaint filed by the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR). We agree that Attorney Rostollan's law license should\n   be suspended for two years and that he should be directed to pay restitution. We impose the full costs of this proceeding on Attorney Rostollan, which are $2,663.71 as of January 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Attorney Rostollan was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1983. He has not previously been disciplined. However, while this matter was pending, this court granted the OLR's request and temporarily suspended Attorney Rostollan's license to practice law for failure to cooperate in a new and separate disciplinary investigation. As of the date of this order, his license is suspended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Office of Lawyer Regulation v. Daniel J. Rostollan\n   </em>\n   , No. 2018XX173-D, unpublished order (S.Ct. April 9, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On September 30, 2016, the OLR filed a complaint against Attorney Rostollan alleging 21 counts of professional misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 Attorney Rostollan filed an answer and asserted, inter alia, that his practice was adversely affected by depression and family issues. He also stated that he had reimbursed former client, R.W. Thereafter, however, he failed to respond to discovery requests and on June 5, 2017, the OLR moved for a default judgment. On July 11, 2017, the referee advised Attorney Rostollan that he had seven days to respond to the default motion. Attorney Rostollan did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 On July 31, 2017, the referee issued an initial report and recommendation, recommending the court deem Attorney Rostollan to have defaulted, finding the facts as alleged in the OLR's complaint as true, and concluding that Attorney Rostollan had committed the alleged misconduct. The referee recommended we suspend Attorney Rostollan's license to practice law for\n   two years and recommended that Attorney Rostollan be ordered to pay restitution to R.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 The court identified some factual and procedural issues with the report and, on November 13, 2017, remanded the matter to the referee for additional information, with directions to file a supplemental report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 On remand, Attorney Rostollan indicated he wanted to participate in this proceeding. The referee conducted a hearing on December 5, 2017, at which Attorney Rostollan appeared. The referee afforded him an opportunity to respond to discovery, but Attorney Rostollan then failed to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 Accordingly, the referee filed a supplemental report on January 10, 2018, including additional information requested by this court and confirming the previous recommendation. Neither party has appealed so we consider the amended report pursuant to SCR 22.17(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 We review a referee's findings of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    2004 WI 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    269 Wis. 2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    675 N.W.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They have not been shown to be clearly erroneous, and we adopt them. We also accept the conclusions of law that flow from those findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 The first nine counts of the complaint pertain to Attorney Rostollan's representation of R.W. In 2012, R.W. retained Attorney Rostollan to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on his behalf and to represent him in certain adversary claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 There were a number of problems with Attorney Rostollan's representation of R.W. These included no written fee agreement or disclosures, mishandling of the bankruptcy proceeding, mishandling of trust funds, and various misrepresentations that Attorney Rostollan made to his client, the court, and the OLR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 On July 23, 2013, Attorney Rostollan filed the requested Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The bankruptcy court dismissed this petition, so Attorney Rostollan filed a second petition, with documents required for two related adversary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   He then filed inaccurate bankruptcy schedules, and electronically affixed R.W.'s signature to these filings, potentially exposing R.W. to charges of perjury and endangering the bankruptcy matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 Attorney Rostollan also informed the bankruptcy court that he had charged R.W. $4,000 for the bankruptcy action but later acknowledged that he had charged R.W. an additional $4,690 for related adversary actions without disclosing these additional fees to the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 The bankruptcy court has established a presumptively reasonable fee of $4,000 for Chapter 13\n   cases. If attorney fees will exceed the presumptively reasonable amount, the attorney must disclose the additional fees to the bankruptcy court. 11 U.S. Code \u00a7 329, Rule 2016(b). Additionally, it is the bankruptcy court's policy that fees in addition to a presumptively reasonable fee must be approved by the court under local Rule 20.16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18 Meanwhile, R.W. gave Attorney Rostollan a $36,000 check, representing life insurance proceeds that Attorney Rostollan was to hold in trust for R.W. On April 9, 2013, Attorney Rostollan deposited these funds into his trust account, yielding a balance of $36,020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 19 Over several months, Attorney Rostollan transferred money in and out of various accounts. On April 10, 2013, Attorney Rostollan disbursed $4,281 from his trust account to his business account, leaving $31,719 in trust. On June 12, 2013, Attorney Rostollan disbursed $5,000 to R.W. Between April and mid-August 2013, Attorney Rostollan transferred almost all of the remaining funds from his trust account into his business account. By May 30, 2014, Attorney Rostollan's trust account balance was $10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 20 In July 2014, Attorney Rostollan sent R.W. an accounting stating that only $1,500 remained from the insurance proceeds and that some $36,000 had been expended on debts, adversary claims, and legal fees. R.W. questioned this accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21 In August 2014, Attorney Rostollan sent R.W. a second accounting, this time stating that $14,784 remained in trust. Meanwhile, on August 15, 2014, Attorney Rostollan deposited $29,407.53 belonging to another client, M.Z., into his trust account. The next day, Attorney Rostollan wrote a check to R.W. in the amount of $14,784.24 with a memo line stating\n   \"balance from trust account.\" At most, $10 of those funds actually belonged to R.W. Attorney Rostollan failed to disclose his conversion of R.W.'s funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 22 The OLR received notice of an overdraft in Attorney Rostollan's trust account and commenced an investigation. Attorney Rostollan sent the OLR fabricated and misleading trust account ledgers that omitted deposit information, internet transfers, and included non-existent disbursements, and transactions. Attorney Rostollan also made misrepresentations to the OLR orally and in writing regarding the source and use of funds in his trust account. On March 3, 2015, the OLR requested additional information from Attorney Rostollan. Attorney Rostollan failed to fully and timely respond. Eventually, this court issued an order directing Attorney Rostollan to show cause why his license should not be suspended for non-cooperation. This prompted Attorney Rostollan to respond, so the OLR withdrew its motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 23 Based on the allegations in the complaint, the referee concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 By failing to communicate in writing to R.W. the rate and basis for all of the fees he intended to charge related to the representation, and also by failing to state in writing the purpose and effect of any advanced fee payment,\n   Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:1.5(b)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 1);\n   \u2022 By failing to safeguard and hold in trust client funds, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:1.l5(b)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 2);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 By converting client funds to his own use or for the use of other clients, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:8.4(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 3);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 By making misrepresentations to R.W. regarding his handling of R.W.'s funds, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:8.4(c) (Count 4);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 By failing to disclose to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin that he intended to charge and/or that he charged R.W. fees related to the adversary proceedings in addition to the $4,000 fee, Attorney Rostollan failed to comply with 11 U.S. Code \u00a7 329, Rule 2016(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and the Eastern District's local policy, in violation of SCR 20:3.4(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 5);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 By filing with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin documents related to R.W.'s bankruptcy that included false and/or inaccurate information, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:8.4(c) (Count 6);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 By acting under a concurrent conflict of interest by representing R.W. in the bankruptcy proceedings after R.W. had claims against Attorney Rostollan for misuse of R.W.'s funds, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:1.7(a)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 7);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 By making deposits in and disbursements from his trust account via internet banking transactions, Attorney Rostollan violated former SCR 20:1.l5(e)(4)c\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 8);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 By failing to timely file responses to the OLR's investigative letters, and by making misrepresentations to the OLR during its investigation, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 22.03(2) 8 and (6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 9).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 The next nine counts alleged involved Attorney Rostollan's representation of clients in a Chapter\n   13 bankruptcy petition. The clients, who will jointly be called \"E.A.\", informed Attorney Rostollan that they wished to file their petition promptly. There was no written fee or representation agreement. Attorney Rostollan delayed until the clients indicated they intended to hire another attorney. At that point, Attorney Rostollan filed the Chapter 13 petition, but failed to file a fee disclosure statement or a Chapter 13 plan. Attorney Rostollan emailed the clients an affidavit for E.A. to sign and return. The client signed the emailed affidavit outside of Attorney Rostollan's presence, yet Attorney Rostollan notarized it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 The bankruptcy court dismissed the matter because no Chapter 13 plan had been filed. Attorney Rostollan moved the court to reconsider dismissal of the bankruptcy, but did so without informing E.A. of the dismissal or his plans to file a reconsideration motion. Attorney Rostollan filed his fee disclosure with the bankruptcy court, indicating that he was to be paid $2,750 to represent the clients, none of which had been paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 On November 12, 2015, Attorney Rostollan sent E.A. a proposed Chapter 13 plan, disclosed that the court had dismissed\n   their case, but said he had filed a reconsideration motion. On November 14, 2015, E.A. terminated Attorney Rostollan's representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 On November 17, 2015, Attorney Rostollan appeared on E.A.'s behalf at a bankruptcy hearing on his motion for reconsideration, without telling the court that the clients had terminated him. Attorney Rostollan told the court that E.A. had agreed to a Chapter 13 plan, while her spouse had not. In fact, Attorney Rostollan had not presented a plan to the clients until after the dismissal. The court denied the\n   reconsideration motion, citing the clients' alleged inability to agree on a Chapter 13 plan as not excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 The OLR alleged and the referee concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 By failing to communicate the rate and basis of his fees, and any changes in the rate and basis of his fees, in writing to the clients, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:1.5(b)(1) (Count 10);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 By depositing the $300 the clients paid to him in his business account, Attorney Rostollan violated former SCR 20:1.l5(b)(4) (Count 11);\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 By failing to take the steps necessary to file the Chapter 13 plan, or to file a motion for an extension of time to file the plan, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:1.3\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 12);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 By failing to clearly and accurately communicate with the clients when their Chapter 13 petition would be filed, and failing to inform them of the dismissal of their Chapter 13 bankruptcy or of his intent to file a motion to reconsider the dismissal until after the motion was filed, Attorney Rostollan in each instance violated SCR 20:1.4(a)(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 13);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 By appearing on behalf of the clients at the November 17, 2015 hearing without advising the court that they had terminated or attempted to terminate his representation, and without clarifying with the clients whether they wished for him to appear on their behalf or the steps they would need to take to protect their own interests if they did not wish for him to appear, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:1.16(a)(3) and (d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 14);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 By making false statements to the bankruptcy court, and/or by failing\n   to correct false statements previously made to the bankruptcy court, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:3.3(a)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 15);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 By causing, or failing to correct, the bankruptcy court's mistaken belief that the clients had been presented with a Chapter 13 plan for signature prior to the dismissal of their case and had failed to agree to that plan, causing or contributing to the\n   failure of a plan to be timely filed, Attorney Rostollan violated SC 20:8.4(c) (Count 16);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 By notarizing the affidavit signed by E.A., thereby asserting that it had been \"Subscribed and sworn to before me,\" even though E.A. did not sign the affidavit in front of him, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 20:8.4(c) (Count 17);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 By making misrepresentations to the OLR during the course of its investigation of the clients' matter, Attorney Rostollan violated SCR 22.03(6), enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(h) (Count 18).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 In May 2015, J.V.E. filed a grievance against Attorney Rostollan. The OLR requested certain information but Attorney Rostollan did not timely respond, despite repeated requests. This court ordered Attorney Rostollan to show cause why his license to practice law should not be suspended. Attorney Rostollan did not respond and, on December 2, 2015, Attorney Rostollan's license to practice law was temporarily suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 30 On December 8, 2015, Attorney Rostollan appeared at two bankruptcy hearings on behalf of clients, despite the fact that his license was temporarily suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31 On January 19, 2016, Attorney Rostollan provided a response sufficient to allow the OLR to continue its investigation, and Attorney Rostollan's license to practice law was reinstated.

Like Attorney Rostollan, Attorney Ramthun had no prior formal disciplinary history, initially participated\n   in the matter but later defaulted, and cited extenuating medical issues as a reason for his failure to abide by the rules of professional misconduct. He was suspended for two and one-half years for 46 counts of misconduct that included failure to respond to pleadings, failure to appear at court proceedings, failure to communicate, trust account anomalies, including conversion of a portion of the client funds, and failure to cooperate with the OLR, including making misrepresentations.

In his initial report the referee agreed and recommended restitution in the amount on $4,690. In his supplemental report, however, the referee recommended $1,690. In response to an inquiry from the court, the referee confirmed this was a typographical error; the referee recommends restitution in the amount of $4,690. We accept this recommendation. Further, consistent with our standard practice, we impose the costs of this proceeding on Attorney Rostollan which are $2,663.71 as of January 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 36 IT IS ORDERED that the license of Daniel J.
