When a judge expresses his personal wish that the defendant had suffered a violent death instead of being arrested and convicted, the public's confidence in the rule of law is undermined.\n   <em>\n    In re Hocking\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2034108\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/451/1/#p13\">\n    451 Mich. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20N.W.2d%20234\">\n    546 N.W.2d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (\"A judge's mode of articulating a basis for decision may exhibit such a degree of antagonism or other offensive conduct that a single incident would indicate that impartial judgment is not reasonably possible.\");\n   <em>\n    In re Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20533\">\n    500 Mich. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 n. 6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20383\">\n    902 N.W.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges.\"), quoting Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 2(A). This is not to say that there is no role for emotion (including anger, and even vengeance) at a sentencing hearing. But that is for the people personally affected by the defendant's crime and their representatives (such as the prosecutor) to express, not the person in the courtroom charged with ensuring the proceeding's evenhandedness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I would remand the defendant's case for a sentencing hearing before a different judge, because \"the importance of preserving the appearance of justice and fairness outweigh[s] considerations of waste and duplication.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

I dissent from the court's denial because there is a ready remedy for the trial court's transgression-resentencing before a different judge. The stakes here are too great and the corrective step too easy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bernstein, J., joins the statement of McCormack, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
