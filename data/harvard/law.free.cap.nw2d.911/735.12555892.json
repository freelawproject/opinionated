The motion for decision on Standard 4 brief is DENIED as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Wilder, J. (dissenting ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I dissent from the order denying leave to appeal. Rather, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate defendant's conviction and sentence of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b(1)(a) and (2)(b). The lower courts erred in concluding that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant failed to establish his burden that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that there was a reasonable probability that, absent the alleged error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188120\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/491/642/#p669\">\n    491 Mich. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20N.W.2d%20288\">\n    821 N.W.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As to the issue of trial counsel's performance, the Court of Appeals majority found that, had trial counsel consulted with an expert on child suggestibility, \"it is virtually certain\" that such an expert could have provided him with the tools he needed to rebut testimony by an expert or an investigator suggesting that it is a rare case in which a child makes a false report. Further, the Court of Appeals found that had trial counsel consulted with an expert, he would have educated himself on the issues at play and would have been in a better position to evaluate the evidence and determine whether the sexual assault occurred or occurred in the manner described by the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In my view, both lower courts overlooked the crucial facts as testified to at\n   the\n   <em>\n    Ginther\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing, and compounded the error by analogizing this case to the factually distinguishable cases of\n   <em>\n    People v.

Counsel reviewed at least one study and weighed the advantages and disadvantages of putting an expert on the stand. It was only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he conducted an investigation and sought counsel from his superiors that trial counsel made the informed decision not to consult with and call an expert on child suggestibility. This is precisely the type of case that is virtually unchallengeable under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . In my opinion, the lower courts ignored well-rooted\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   principles, and improperly reviewed the case with the benefit of hindsight. See\n   <em>\n    People v.

I think it is important to remind attorneys and the lower courts that \"[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"That requires a 'substantial,' not just 'conceivable,' likelihood of a different result.\"\n   <em>\n    Cullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    563 U.S. at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Here, the Court of Appeals majority found that an expert \"could have\" explained how a child of the victim's age is susceptible to suggestion, and that trial counsel \"could have plausibly argued\" the victim made a false report even though the victim may have honestly believed her recollection was true. In my opinion, the majority was merely conjecturing on what might have happened had trial counsel employed the strategy that it found best suited, and not whether, in the face of the whole record, a substantial likelihood of a different result existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, I would conclude that defendant failed to establish his burden in demonstrating trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel entitling him to a new trial, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate defendant's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Zahra, J., joins the statement of Wilder, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <em>\n     People v.
