BASIC FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A jury convicted Steanhouse of assault with intent to commit murder, MCL 750.83, and receiving or concealing stolen property, MCL 750.535(3)(a). Although Steanhouse's minimum sentencing guidelines range was 171 to 285 months, the trial court departed upward and sentenced him to 30 to 60 years' imprisonment for the assault conviction and to one to five years' imprisonment for the receiving or concealing stolen property conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time Steanhouse was sentenced, a trial court could depart upward from the minimum guidelines range only for substantial and compelling reasons. See MCL 769.34(3). However, in\n   <em>\n    People v.

First, it articulated that an upward departure was appropriate based on the \"horrendous, brutal assault\" on a young man who appeared to have been \"rendered weak or\n   incapacitated by his drug use at that time.\" However, we conclude that both the brutality of the assault and the fact that the victim was weak or incapacitated by drug use were not proper considerations because they were accounted for in the sentencing guidelines and the trial court offered no explanation for why they were given inadequate weight by the guidelines.

OV 10 addresses the \"exploitation of a vulnerable victim.\" MCL 777.40(1). Five points must be scored if \"[t]he offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength, or both, or exploited a victim who was intoxicated, under the influence of drugs, asleep, or unconscious.\" MCL 777.40(1)(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The guidelines indicate that \"[t]he mere existence of 1 or more factors described in [ MCL 777.40(1) ] does not automatically equate with victim vulnerability.\" MCL 777.40(2). No points were assessed or scored for OV 10. Given that the trial court determined that the incapacitation was not significant enough to warrant a score under OV 10-which is the OV that expressly addresses exploitation of a victim incapacitated by drugs-we conclude that this was not a valid reason for departing upward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court's third reason for imposing an upward departure was not accounted for in the sentencing guidelines. The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [T]he action taken by you towards a person who considers you a friend does substantiate the thought that you are a person without a conscience, a person who's violent and depraved and that this is an assault that is quite shocking even to people who have been in the courts for 20 and more years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In evaluating whether the departure sentence imposed for defendant is proportional in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Milbourn\n   </em>\n   , a factor to be considered, which is not adequately reflected in the guidelines, involves the \"prior relationship\" between defendant and\n   the victim.\n   <em>\n    Milbourn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1982785\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/435/630/\">\n    435 Mich. at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20N.W.2d%201\">\n    461 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Milbourn\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained that a prior relationship between the offender and the victim can be either a \"very mitigating circumstance or a very aggravating circumstance, depending upon the history of interaction between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 660-661,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20N.W.2d%201\">\n    461 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the trial court viewed it as an aggravating circumstance. That finding is supported by the record, which shows that Steanhouse and the victim were frequently together at the victim's home, demonstrating that there was a degree of familiarity and trust between them. Steanhouse breached that trust by stealing items from the victim's home, soliciting a \"reward\" for their return, and then ultimately striking the victim with a wrench and slitting his throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, two of the stated reasons for imposing a departure sentence were improper. The trial court only articulated a single valid reason for departing from the sentencing guidelines, and on this record it is unclear whether the court would have departed solely on the basis of the prior relationship between Steanhouse and\n   his victim. Similarly, it is difficult to ascertain the trial court's reasoning or rationale for the extent of the departure imposed and to ascertain where on the \"continuum from the least to the most serious situations\" this case falls.\n   <em>\n    Milbourn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1982785\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/435/630/\">\n    435 Mich. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20N.W.2d%201\">\n    461 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Milbourn\n   </em>\n   , it is necessary for a trial court to articulate its reasons for imposing a departure sentence in order to permit appellate review of whether the court abided by the principle of proportionality.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 659-660,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20N.W.2d%201\">\n    461 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court \"abused its discretion in applying the principle of proportionality by failing to provide adequate reasons for the extent of the departure sentence imposed,\" so-in accordance with our Supreme Court's directive in\n   <em>\n    Steanhouse II\n   </em>\n   -we remand to the trial court for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    Steanhouse II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20453\">\n    500 Mich. at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20327\">\n    902 N.W.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Reversed and remanded for resentencing.
