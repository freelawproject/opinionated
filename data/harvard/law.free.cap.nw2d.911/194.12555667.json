The slip opinion stated: \"As Rhea's husband, Robert was an individual entitled to priority consideration. However, Robert was not entitled to consideration unless the probate court considered an independent fiduciary and found him or her unsuitable. Lyneis, as trustee and independent fiduciary, had statutory priority over Robert, despite Robert's marriage to Rhea. MCL 700.5409(1).\" These sentences are omitted from the advance sheets version of the Court of Appeals opinion, and are therefore not part of that court's final published opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
