He relies on N.D.R.Civ.P. 59(b)(4) and asserts the district court's \"systemic\" or \"commonplace\" disregard of the rules prejudiced him. He broadly claims the court created manifest injustice in proceedings leading to the second amended judgment by allowing newly discovered evidence to be subsequently obtained and admitted without further hearing, deciding to remove joint decisionmaking responsibility, and allowing purported ex parte communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Mark Rath contends the district court's handling of newly discovered evidence,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   documents received by the court from the Family Safety Center after the April 2017 hearing, constitutes grounds for a new trial based on a \"manifest injustice.\" The Family Safety Center facilitated Mark Rath's supervised parenting time. On February 3, 2017, Rath filed a motion in the district court requesting an order to compel the Family Safety Center to produce all records pertaining to his minor children. The court ultimately signed the order to compel on April 25, 2017, one day before the hearing on Rath's motion to modify the judgment. After the hearing, on May 2, 2017, the court entered an order modifying its April 25 order, stating: \"During trial the record request was refined to only include those records from January 2014 to April 2015. This reduces the amount of records needed to be produced by the FCS [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 15] The district court apparently left the record open for submission of additional documents, subject to request for further hearing. On May 19, 2017, documents from the Family Safety Center were filed in the district court. On May 22, 2017, the court entered its memorandum decision for\n   the second amended judgment, in which the court stated, \"Mark was given time to gather FSC records and request further hearing.

We note, however, that Mark Rath has made multiple requests for recusal for every judge that has been assigned to this case. Here, the district court decided Mark Rath's motion to modify parenting time had merit and awarded unsupervised parenting time with his children, subject to certain restrictions, despite the court's articulated concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b6 27] In denying recusal, the district court explained it signed the order compelling the Family Safety Center to produce documents once it was made aware of Mark Rath's request; that Mark Rath did not ask for a continuance of the hearing; and that Mark Rath was given a full opportunity to testify, and did testify, about the Family Safety Center issues at the hearing. The court concluded Mark Rath provided no evidence to support recusal, other than his dislike of its ruling, and discounted his allegation of ex parte communication, concluding his motion was without legal or factual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b6 28] Based on our review of the record, the district court did not act in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable manner; its decision was the product of a rational mental process leading to a reasoned determination; and it did not misinterpret or misapply the law. We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mark Rath's requests for recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b6 29] Mark Rath argues the district court's decision allowing for unsupervised parenting time is clearly erroneous because the court ordered a \"very unreasonable visitation schedule\" between him and his children. He claims no evidence supports any restrictions on his parenting time and the court erred in relying on a prior judge's \"unconstitutional\" restrictions against him, violated his First Amendment rights, and erred in taking judicial notice of a purportedly void restraining order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b6 30] In its memorandum decision, the district court found Mark Rath had complied with earlier court orders requiring him to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program and a psychological evaluation. The court found although he complied with the court-required counseling, circumstances had not sufficiently changed since the 2013 divorce judgment to justify Mark Rath's request for a joint parenting responsibility plan. After finding that Mark Rath had no recent difficulties using the Family Safety Center for his supervised visits, the court noted that an April 2016 restraining order had been placed against him by Kayla Jones because of his harassing conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rath v. Rath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328755\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/892/205/\">\n    2017 ND 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328755\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/892/205/\">\n    892 N.W.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming April 2016 restraining order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 31] The district court found that Mark Rath continues to threaten and harass Kayla Jones through the court system and continues to use threats and vulgarities when arranging parenting time. The court\n   found he continues to show \"an inability to deal with Kayla in a manner to allow for reasonable people to come to some sort of resolution in managing effective parenting time.\" Based on the information in the file, the testimony at the hearing, and the evidence provided, the court found that \"Mark simply wants what Mark wants without regard to the children's best interests,\" while Kayla Jones has the children's best interests at the forefront of her considerations and is afraid of Mark Rath. The court found Mark Rath had not changed in any substantial way to support joint parenting responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b6 32] The district court, however, found a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify modifying parenting time. The court found the children are older and that telephone calls and Family Safety Center visits had gone \"reasonably well\" in the past months. The court, therefore, found parenting time needed to be revisited and allowed the judgment to be modified to allow unsupervised parenting time, subject to certain limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 33] Further, in denying Mark Rath's motion to reconsider, the district court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Mark alleges his right to due process was violated and goes on to point to evidence that he is able to make decisions with Kayla. This allegation by Mark totally ignores the 13 Orders denying Order To Show Cause petitions issued by Judge Hill in this matter, all brought by Mark, during Judge Hill's time on the case. Mark, in October 2016, filed a Motion to Amend the Judgment requesting joint residential responsibility of the children. He alleged a material change in circumstances and this would be in the best interests of the children. Mark requested a four-hour hearing. The Court, after reviewing the file, granted a hearing as prima facie evidence had been provided to show a material change in circumstances as Mark had complied with Judge Reich's conditions in the first Judgment. By Mark's own request, this hearing was to determine a major change in the parenting responsibility. The Court took testimony. The Court allowed for a continued hearing into the [afternoon] of the same date to allow the parties more time. The Court, after hearing all the evidence, issued the Memorandum for [Second] Amended Judgment. Mark's due process rights were not violated and no mistake was made to justify granting a Rule 60(b) motion. Further, no reason exists under Rule 59 to grant a new trial. Mark was provided [the] opportunity to present evidence. The Court took the evidence presented and formulated a Memorandum for a [Second] Amended Judgment in the best interests of the children in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b6 34] We agree with the district court's analysis. Moreover, because Mark Rath has failed to provide on appeal a transcript of the April 2017 hearing, we are unable to review the testimony that he suggests renders the court's findings clearly erroneous. We therefore conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b6 35] We have considered Mark Rath's remaining arguments and conclude they are either unnecessary to our decision or without merit. The second amended judgment and orders are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b6 36] Gerald W. VandeWalle, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Jon J.
