Because the record establishes that defense counsel articulated a specific objection on hearsay grounds, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the issue was unpreserved. We REMAND this case to that court for reconsideration of the hearsay issue under the standard for preserved evidentiary error, see\n   <em>\n    People v. Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190960\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/494/104/\">\n    494 Mich. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20N.W.2d%20738\">\n    832 N.W.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), and for consideration of whether (1) the prosecutor \"made known\" to the defendant \"the particulars\" of the MRE 803A statement, and (2) the defendant was given a \"fair opportunity\" to prepare to meet the statement, as required by MRE 803A. On remand, the Court of Appeals shall determine whether the testimony at issue was erroneously admitted under MRE 803A, and if so, whether, upon an examination of the entire cause, it is more probable than not that the preserved error was outcome determinative. In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
