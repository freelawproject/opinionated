We direct the Clerk to schedule oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other action. MCR 7.305(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The appellants shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of this order addressing whether, to be eligible to receive personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits, they were required to register, in Michigan, the vehicle involved in the accident, and were thus obligated to maintain security for the payment of PIP benefits pursuant to MCL 500.3101 or be precluded from receiving such benefits by MCL 500.3113(b). In addition to the brief, the appellants shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1). The appellee shall file a supplemental brief within 21 days of being served with the appellants' brief. The appellee shall also electronically file an appendix, or in the alternative, stipulate to the use of the appendix filed by the appellants. A reply, if any, must be filed by the appellants within 14 days of being served with the appellee's brief. The parties should not submit mere restatements of their application papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Coalition Protecting Auto No-Fault, the Insurance Alliance of Michigan, the Negligence Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan, and the Michigan Association for Justice are invited to file briefs amicus curiae. Other persons or groups interested in the determination of the issues presented in this case may move the Court for permission to file briefs amicus curiae.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
