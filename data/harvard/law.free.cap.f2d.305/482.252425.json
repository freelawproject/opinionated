Petitioner\u2019s registrations both assert use of its mark since July 14, 1936. The earliest date of use asserted by applicant is July 16, 1957, some 21 years after registrant\u2019s first asserted date of use and some 17 years after the date of petitioner\u2019s first registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The present appeal is from a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissing the opposition (127 USPQ 134), in which it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A50\">\u201cThere can be no doubt but that the suffixes \u2018CRETE\u2019 and \u2018KRETE\u2019 are highly suggestive of concrete or any concrete product. The marks \u2018SAKRETE\u2019 and \u2018SLAGCRETE\u2019 otherwise are distinguishable in sound and appearance and create different commercial impressions, \u2018SAKRETE\u2019 suggesting concrete in a sack and \u2018SLAGCRETE\u2019 a concrete product containing slag. Considering therefore the suggestive nature of the suffixes \u2018CRETE\u2019 and \u2018KRETE\u2019 and the differences between the marks \u2018SAKRETE\u2019 and \u2018SLAGCRETE\u2019, it is concluded that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is not likely to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoMT\">Opposer established its ownership of the registrations in issue, took the testimony of three witnesses, and introduced several physical exhibits to support the averments in its notice of opposition. Applicant took no testimony. Its record consists of some 250 third party registrations in which the term \u201ccrete\u201d (or \u201ckrete\u201d) is shown as part of marks used in fields as disparate as perfume, toilet water and cologne (Reg. No. 435,098, \u201cGoddess of Crete\u201d), brassieres, ladies\u2019 foundation undergarments, and ladies\u2019 bathing suits (Reg. No. 580,618, \u201cTres Sea Crete\u201d), aerial practice bombs made of concrete (Reg. No. 565,281, \u201cJet Crete\u201d) and waterproofing compositions, etc. (Reg. No. 555,541, \u201cResto-Crete\u201d and design) but including some 32 registrations for goods similar in kind or competitive with the goods of the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">A comparison of the respective marks in the light of the record and exhibits here establishes, we think, that the mark's so resemble each other in sound, appearance and meaning that they are likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers when used on applicant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">As to sound and appearance, both marks are two syllable coined words ending in the phonetically identical suffixes \u201ckrete\u201d and \u201ccrete.\u201d The prefixes both start with the letter \u201cs\u201d and contain a \u201cshort a\u201d vowel.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Similarities in enunciation, expression and accent used by different persons pronouncing the marks may well be compounded by the hearing acuity, attention and background of the one hearing the marks. Thus, a housewife requested by her \u201cdo-it-yourselfer\u201d husband, far into his job, with trowel in hand and pipe in mouth to \u201cPick me up a bag of \u2018SAKRETE\u2019,\u201d might well have only the vaguest of notions of whether she is supposed to purchase \u201cSLAGCRETE\u201d or \u201cSAKRETE.\u201d How much she might know about \u201cslag\u201d in \u201cSLAGCRETE\u201d may well depend on whether she has had previous contact with the vernacular of those geographic areas where slag is produced. We think it is unlikely that the confirmed \u201cdo-it-yourselfer\u201d would be confused, for as the witness Mussett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>stated in his testimony \u201cTo the average consumer, the word \u2018Sakrete\u2019 is thought of as the name given commonly to cement mixtures in bags.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">While the two marks differ in details of appearance, it is thought that the resemblances outweigh these differences. It is not likely that the two marks will be subjected to a side-by-side comparison by the average purchaser. Such a purchaser will, therefore, be comparing the mark he sees with a mark he thinks he remembers seeing. The fallibility of memory as to details in such a situation is well known. As stated by this court in Wincharger Corporation v. Rineo, Inc., 297 F.2d 261, 49 CCPA 849:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201c * * * It should be remembered that purchasers usually do not have the opportunity to simultaneously compare two marks but must recall one or the other separately at different times which in this situation would make the avoidance of error quite difficult. Therefore, we believe that if the goods are similar the marks would cause confusion among purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We think, therefore, that it is likely that the similarities in the appearances of the marks will be dominant in the mind of the average purchaser and hence would be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or origin of the goods on which applicant\u2019s mark is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">On first impression, the difference in meaning of the two marks seems rather clear. However, the testimony of Mus-sett,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a partner in Dry Mix Concrete Company one of the licensees of opposer, suggests that different impressions may be conveyed by the marks to those who are familiar with sales of such products and those who are the \u201caverage consumer.\u201d Thus, the mark \u201cSAKCRETE\u201d could convey the impression of a concrete product packaged in a sack while the mark \u201cSLAGCRETE\u201d would convey the impression of a concrete product containing slag. However, such meanings are not necessarily the meanings the average consumer would attach to the marks. It is evident on reflection the first impression that the difference in meaning of the two marks which would be recognized by those \u201cqualified in the trade\u201d is based on two assumptions which do not necessarily apply to the average consumer, (1) that the average consumer will translate \u201cSAKCRETE\u201d as a \u201csack of concrete\u201d and, (2) that the average consumer will have such familiarity with the word \u201cslag\u201d that its meaning becomes dominant and distinctive in the mark \u201cSLAGCRETE\u201d which he will translate as \u201cconcrete containing slag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">Opposer\u2019s thorough and complete record establishes a long commercial \u201cbuild up\u201d and usage of its mark \u201cSAKCRETE\u201d which we think supports the statement of witness Mussett that the word \u201cSAK-CRETE\u201d to the average consumer is the \u201cname given commonly to cement mixtures in bags.\u201d For some 21 years, prior to applicant\u2019s adoption of its mark, op-poser and its licensees had been actively promoting the mark \u201cSAKCRETE\u201d for its products which had been advertised and sold on a national scale as well as in foreign countries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As found by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">\u201cOpposer and its licensees produce in excess of ten million bags of \u2018SAKRETE\u2019 products per year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u2018SAKRETE\u2019 products are advertised in nationally distributed consumer publications through a program maintained jointly by opposer and its licensees. Opposer\u2019s licensees also advertise and promote \u2018SAKRETE\u2019 dry mix concrete materials within their territorial areas on radio and television programs, to a small degree in magazines, and through the distribution of point of advertising materials such as banners, signs, booklets, and the like. Additionally, many of their dealers advertise \u2018SAKRETE\u2019 products in newspapers and other local media. The expenditures for these purposes have been substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><em>We </em>think opposer\u2019s record indicates that its mark \u201cSAKRETE\u201d has acquired such distinctiveness as an indicator of source or origin of opposer for sacks of mixtures of concrete, mortar, and allied products<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that use by applicant of</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">\u201cSLAGCRETE\u201d on its goods would make confusion of purchasers likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">The foregoing conclusion is not entirely free from reasonable doubt and we have reached it in part by applying the established rule that such doubt should be resolved against the newcomer, whose \u201cfield of trade mark selection is not so limited as to require registration of a mark which sufficiently resembles an old and established mark as to likely result in confusion in trade.\u201d Dayton Rubber Co. v. General Felt Products Co., 223 F.2d 734, 736, 42 CCPA 1035, 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">The record clearly establishes diligent efforts on the part of opposer to create and maintain consumer good will in its mark.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find no reason to assist applicant to share in this good will by permitting it to register a mark which, in its entirety, in sound, appearance, and likely consumer meaning so resembles op-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>poser\u2019s long established and registered mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-6\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, concurs in result only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b530-7\">MARTIN, Judge, sat but did not participate in decision.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-16\">.

The inclusion of so many third party registrations, while indicating zeal on the part of counsel, is of little assistance to the court. Their value as \u201csome evidence\u201d in resolving the issues in opposition and cancellation proceedings becomes progressively less as they relate to fields as disparate as from that here involved as \u201cperfume,\u201d \u201cbrassieres,\u201d \u201cladies\u2019 bathing suits.\u201d At best, they establish nothing more here than what opposer should have been willing to admit, i. e., that the sufiix \u201ccrete\u201d (or \u201ckrete\u201d) alone does not have distinctiveness as a trademark indicating the source or origin of goods in the concrete business or in a business associated therewith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">.

We would consider that a cement mortar or a masonry mortar; and there are other products that are allied, plaster mixtures, which are cementing materials, and aggregate, and we also have a black top, which is classified as an asphaltic concrete.
