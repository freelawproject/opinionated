C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., opposes on prior registration of the mark \u201cJOHNSON\u2019S ANT KILLER\u201d coupled with the facsimile signature \u201cM. H. JOHNSON\u201d and a pictorial representation of insects, for use on an insecticide,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and of certain other trademarks comprising \u201cJOHNSON\u2019S\u201d as the mark, or as the essential feature thereof, for waxes, polishes and cleaners.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">To avoid confusion between Johnston and Johnson, the parties will be referred to as applicant and opposer, respectively-</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">So far as opposer\u2019s registrations of its marks for waxes, polishes and cleaners are concerned, the board found no likelihood of confusion and opposer does not appear to question that finding here. We therefore will limit our consideration to the \u201cANT KILLER\u201d registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Applicant\u2019s mark is for use on \u201cinsecticides, namely, brush-on compositions for killing roaches, ants, water bugs and silver fish.\u201d Opposer\u2019s \u201cANT KILLER\u201d mark, as noted above, is also for an insecticide.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">As we understand the record, two questions are presented: Does applicant\u2019s mark so resemble opposer\u2019s \u201cANT KILLER\u201d mark as to be likely to result in confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act; if so, who is the prior user? In considering the first question, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-17\">\u201cOpposer argues that confusion is likely because \u201cJOHNSON\u2019S\u201d and \u201cJOHNSTON\u2019S\u201d are substantially similar names. This contention, however, completely disregards the fact that applicant\u2019s mark includes the notation \u201cNO ROACH\u201d, which, as evidenced by the illustration above, completely dominates applicant\u2019s mark. In view thereof and since \u201cJOHNSTON\u2019S\u201d, as used in applicant\u2019s mark, possesses the significance of a trade name, it is reasonable to assume that purchasers would more than likely rely on the suggestive notation \u201cNO ROACH\u201d to identify applicant\u2019s goods as to source.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-18\">We are unable to agree with that reasoning or conclusion. There can be no doubt that Johnston and Johnson are alike, indeed so alike that, on the facts here, we think the average purchaser could hardly be expected to distinguish the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>While we agree with the board that in applicant\u2019s specimen, \u201cNO ROACH\u201d dominates the mark, we are not satisfied that it dominates so completely as to eliminate Johnston as an indication of source or origin. If applicant\u2019s mark consisted only of \u201cNO ROACH\u201d purchasers would have no alternative, despite the suggestive and descriptive nature of the term, to so identify the goods. However, when \u201cJOHNSTON\u2019S\u201d is added, we think the average purchaser would consider \u201cJOHNSTON\u2019S\u201d as the source of the article. Why else would \u201cJOHNSTON\u2019S\u201d be added?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">While we appreciate the obvious differences between the terms \u201cANT KILLER\u201d and \u201cNO ROACH,\u201d we are also aware that both products are insecticides; they both kill ants and roaches; they appear to be relatively inexpensive products; they are sold through the same over-the-counter channels of trade; and the marks include virtually identical surnames. Under such circumstances we think there would be a likelihood of that confusion contemplated by the provisions of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Turning to the question of priority, we are unable to agree with the board' that applicant has satisfactorily shown use of its mark prior to May 11, 1948, the application date for registration of opposer\u2019s \u201cANT KILLER\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The only testimony is that of Gaston Johnston, president of the Johnston Corporation, accompanied by certain documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We do not think the evidence of record can fairly be held to discharge Johnston\u2019s burden of proof. Nowhere does the witness expressly state that he, his company, or his corporation had used \u201cJOHNSTON\u2019S NO ROACH\u201d prior to the May 11,1948, filing date of the \u201cANT KILLER\u201d application. Applicant\u2019s sales records do not begin before 1949; the earliest copyright date on an exhibit label is 1950; and the earliest evidence of advertising is 1951. We are unable to agree with applicant that the 1949 sales of $80,900 necessarily means that such sales could not have been made without activity prior to 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">For the above reasons we must <em>reverse </em>the decision appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. \u201cSec. 2.
