Registration is opposed by the Goldenrod Ice Cream Company which alleges use of \u201cGOLDENROD\u201d since 1916 on its products including packaged \u201cbutter pecan\u201d ice cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-22\">The record consists of the application, the pleadings and the stipulated facts on behalf of opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">It appears that opposer and its predecessors have since 1918 continuously manufactured and sold its ice cream products under the mark \u201cGOLDENROD,\u201d advertising through various media.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-24\">Since opposer is the prior user, the only issue is whether applicant\u2019s use of the same mark on the instant products would be likely to result in confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers so that registration is precluded under Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-25\">In dismissing the opposition, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-26\">\u201cWhile shelled pecans and ice cream are food products which are sold through the same retail stores, they, nevertheless, are distinctly different types of products, the one being essentially a grocery item and the other a perishable confection, and as such, ordinarily are marketed under different circumstances in different departments or sections of such stores. Under these circumstances, it is not likely that pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>chasers would, merely because of the identity of the marks, attribute such products to a common source.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We are unable to obtain from this record the assurance it seems to have provided the board, viz., that purchasers would not be likely to attribute the instant products to a common source.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The record is silent regarding the channels of trade and the marketing methods employed by the respective parties. We think, however, the board\u2019s view that the goods are sold through the same retail outlets is a reasonable assumption. We also agree that they are \u201cdistinctly different types of products\u201d but not so distinct, when weighed with other elements, as to preclude a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We have no way of knowing whether the products \u201cordinarily are marketed under different circumstances in different departments or sections of such stores,\u201d but even if those assumptions are valid they can hardly be considered decisive. It may well be that in the cavernous confines of the modern super market the products are actually sold in different departments or sections of the stores. However, that situation is far less likely to exist in the \u201ccorner groceries,\u201d which we suggest are doubtless more numerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Although the products are clearly distinct, the fact remains that they are both food products, presumably of a relatively inexpensive nature; that they are sold through the same outlets, in packages as opposed to bulk units, and both bear the identical mark \u201cGOLDENROD.\u201d Under such circumstances we are inclined to think that the average purchaser would be likely to assume the products emanated from the same source. At least we feel obliged to resolve any doubt on that score in favor of the first user. Rank Cintel Limited v.
