Applicant submitted stipulated testimony of its president accompanied by documentary exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">The record establishes that applicant has used the mark \u201cHAR\u00aeVEY\u201d in connection with the sale and advertising of sliding door hardware continuously since some indefinite date in 1946, with its sales increasing from approximately $15,-000 in 1946 to more than $780,000 in 1959, and its advertising expenditures increasing from $5,200 in 1946 to $45,-000 in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">Opposer\u2019s executive vice president testified that its business began in 1913 as Harvey Machine Company. He further testified as to the nature of the business as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">\u201cQ17. Can you tell us in a general way the nature of the business conducted by Harvey Aluminum (Incorporated)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">\u201cA. It\u2019s a metal fabrication business working in different metals of aluminum, steel, brass, and other rare metals, and alloy materials, and manufacturing thousands of different products for various customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-21\">\u201cQ18. Can you tell us what some of those products are ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">\u201cA. Some of those products have to do with the building products line and they comprise all sorts of building products that go into construction industry, residential, commercial, industrial, have to do with walls, interior and exterior, doors, openings of all kinds, door hardware, hinges of various kinds, and a host of variety of products of that general type and nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>He also testified that opposer and its predecessors have used \u201cHARVEY\u201d as a trademark in connection with the sale and advertising of their goods and that total sales of products thereunder amounted to more than $279,000,000 for the years 1943 to 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The same witness, during the taking of his deposition in 1959, identified an exhibit as listing customers to which op-poser had supplied \u201csliding door hardware and parts * * * for the manufacture of doors and assembly of doors.\u201d That list sets out the longest customer tenure as ten years. Apparently on the basis of that evidence, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board found that op-poser and its immediate predecessor had used the mark \u201cHARVEY\u201d for sliding door hardware of various kinds since as early as 1949. The board stated (128 USPQ 451):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cWhile there can be no question on the record presented in this case but that opposer, as between the parties, was the first to use \u201cHARVEY\u201d as a trademark, this cannot in and of itself constitute a sufficient basis for sustaining the opposition. That is to say that it has been incumbent upon opposer not only to establish prior use of its mark but prior use thereof for goods related in some manner to those of applicant as to be likely to result in purchasers ascribing a common origin thereto. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cThe only evidence offered by op-poser in this regard consists of the aforementioned testimony of its executive vice-president which is so vague, indefinite, and general in character that it cannot be ascertained therefrom just what specific products opposer was in fact using its mark on prior to applicant\u2019s use thereof for sliding door hardware, much less that any of the goods were so related to those of applicant as to be likely to cause confusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cIt is concluded, therefore, that opposer has failed to sustain its burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Opposer does not question the date of use credited to applicant by the board nor does it point out any evidence of its own use of \u201cHARVEY\u201d in connection with sliding door hardware prior to that date. Rather, it argues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">\u201cTo limit the area of confusion to sliding door hardware only gives scant recognition to a mark deserving of credibility on many grounds: 1. substantial sales (Exhibit 2A); 2. long use (Q-12); 3. Upon a broad spectrum of goods (Q-17 and Exhibit 1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">We find no merit in that argument. The fact that there have been substantial sales under a mark over a long period on a wide variety of products does not necessarily bar registration of a similar mark to a subsequent user on different goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Opposer makes specific reference to the aluminum extrusions which it sells to the sliding door trade but it fails to point out proof in the record that any extrusions were sold to that trade prior to any time in 1946, the year applicant first used its mark. It is stated by op-poser that, under United States Steel Corporation v. Bijur Lubricating Corporation, 286 F.2d 617, 48 CCPA 820, it \u201cmay refer to its date of use of December 6, 1947, as earlier than the best possible date of appellee.\u201d Apparently that date is extracted from the allegation of the date of first use set out in its registration, No. 646,346, of its mark reproduced hereinabove for goods including aluminum extrusions. However, the cited decision is not authority for giving a registrant the benefit of a date of first use alleged in its application. Rather, a registration, in itself, establishes use only as of its filing date. C. B. Shane Corporation v. Desmond\u2019s, 139 F.2d 502, 31 CCPA 779; General Shoe Corp. v. Lerner Bros. Mfg. Co., Inc., 254 F.2d 154, 45 CCPA 872; Tropic-Aire, Inc. v. Approved Products, Inc., 275 F.2d 728, 47 CCPA 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">In its brief, opposer also relies on its use of \u201cHARVEY\u201d on hinges, apparent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>1 y claiming that use was prior to applicant\u2019s use of its mark. However, op-poser does not point out any evidence proving such priority and our inspection of the record has revealed none. While opposer\u2019s registration, No. 646,-328, specifies hinges as an article of builder\u2019s hardware covered thereby, that registration in itself entitles opposer to no earlier date than its March 5,1956, filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Since we do not find the errors alleged by appellant, the board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-6\">MARTIN, Judge, did not sit or participate because of illness.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-14\">.
