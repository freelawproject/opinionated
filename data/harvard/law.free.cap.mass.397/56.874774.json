We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">It is important to note what <em>Addison Gilbert I </em>decided. In that case, the plaintiffs challenged the validity of a regulation promulgated by the commission. The regulation (114.1 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.06 [1981]) fixed a flat reimbursement rate for health care providers, such as the plaintiffs, to Medicaid patients. The rate was applicable to those days which are called \u201cadministratively necessary days.\u201d <em>Addison Gilbert I described </em>\u201cadministratively necessary days\u201d in the following language: \u201cThe regulation sets the rate at which hospitals are to be reimbursed for their patients who are on \u2018administratively necessary day\u2019 status. These patients are originally admitted to hospitals to receive care for their acute conditions, which could only be provided in the hospital setting. When their conditions change so that the medical services they require can be administered in a lower level facility, such as a nursing home, the patients are usually released from the hospital. However, frequently no nursing home beds are available for these patients, and the hospital is forced to keep them. The days during which the hospital continues to provide care for these patients are known as \u2018administratively necessary days.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 19 &amp; n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>After the issuance of several reimbursement rates for \u201cadministratively necessary days,\u201d in December, 1980, following a hearing before the commission, the department submitted a proposed amendment to the rate regulations to Federal authorities in the Department of Health and Human Services for approval. The department reserved its right to contest the Federal government\u2019s insistence on the need for approval. This new rate for \u201cadministratively necessary days\u201d called for reimbursement at a flat rate of $70 a day for all hospitals. See 114.1 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.06. The rate was to be effective on February 1, 1981, despite the failure of the department to obtain Federal approval. See Addison <em>Gilbert I, supra </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The Federal legislation which created the Medicaid program requires a State to adopt a plan, which complies with Federal law and which must be approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(b) (1982). In particular, the Federal law required States to establish rates for \u201cinpatient hospital services\u201d and these rates require approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. <em>Addison Gilbert I, supra </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The narrow question decided in <em>Addison Gilbert I </em>was \u201cwhether the <em>care </em>provided by hospitals to patients on administratively necessary day status is considered to be \u2018inpatient hospital services\u2019 under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (13)(D) (1976).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. We answered that question in the affirmative. It followed that Federal approval was required and that failure to obtain the approval rendered the $70 flat rate invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Following our rescript in <em>Addison Gilbert I, </em>a judgment was entered for the plaintiffs on November 1, 1983, for the difference between the rate at which the plaintiffs were previously reimbursed for \u201cadministratively necessary days\u201d and the correct rate, but this judgment left open the issue presented on this appeal, i.e., whether the plaintiffs are entitled to prejudgment interest from November 1, 1981, to January 10, 1984 (a time period stipulated by the parties as applicable, if any prejudgment interest is due).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>All parties seem to concede that if interest is due, the computation is governed by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is set forth in full in the margin, and which is invoked in cases based on contractual obligations. They agree that the thrust of the underlying obligations of the defendants to the plaintiffs is in contract. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 206, 209 (1971). They disagree as to the existence of a breach. They do not contest the principle that the Commonwealth may be liable for breach of contract and for interest to the same extent as a private person. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The defendants argue that they did not cause a breach of contract, that they acted in good faith and that they honestly misinterpreted Federal law as to the requirement of approval of the rate. They argue that under the test of <em>Perkins School for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825, 831 (1981), they should be exonerated from the payment of interest because they have \u201cdone all that the law required ... in the particular case.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Language from <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>appearing in <em>Perkins </em>immediately before this quoted language provides that \u201cinterest may be allowed against the Commonwealth for any \u2018detention of money, beyond the reasonable time which the statutes requiring payment to [plaintiffs] fairly should be interpreted as contemplating. \u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins, supra </em>at 831, quoting <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Despite the defendants\u2019 arguments to the contrary, the present case is distinguishable from one in which a provider successfully appeals the <em>amount </em>of the rate under the procedure established in G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 32. In this instance, the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Perkins </em>(\u201ca liability for interest in the Commonwealth does not arise each time an initial rate is subsequently adjusted upward,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 832) is not applicable to the present case since the original appeal in <em>Addison Gilbert 1 </em>was a frontal attack on the <em>legality </em>of the rate. Applying the principles of <em>Perkins </em>and <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>to the instant case, it is clear that the defendants did not do all that the law required because they failed to obtain Federal approval. They knew of the Federal requirement of prior approval when they made the $70 rate effective. The Federal agency informed the defendants that such action would violate Federal law. By statute, G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 32, provides that these rates must conform with the requirements of Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In a word, the defendants\u2019 conduct constituted a breach of contract for which they must be responsible for the payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> The definition used in Massachusetts is \u201ca day of acute inpatient hospitalization on which a lower than acute level of care is determined to be appropriate by the PSRO [Professional Standards Review Organization] but on which an appropriate placement is not available.\u201d 106 Code Mass.
