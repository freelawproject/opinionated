Hirschhom, a neurologist who previously had treated the plaintiff. In essentially overlapping complaints, the plaintiff set forth five causes of action: breach of a confidential relationship; invasion of privacy; unfair and deceptive acts in violation of G. L. c. 93A; negligent testimony; and negligent diagnosis. The cases were consolidated for trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the defendant moved to dismiss all counts for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The motion judge dismissed those counts alleging either a breach of confidentiality or an invasion of privacy, leaving the other three causes of action for trial. The trial judge, anticipating an appeal of the motion judge\u2019s mling, permitted evidence to be introduced on the dismissed causes of action, as well as on those that had survived the motion to dismiss, hoping thereby to alleviate the necessity of a new trial if the motion judge\u2019s rulings should be reversed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The case was submitted to the jury for answers to twenty-five special questions. Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). In response to the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions, the plaintiff moved for a new trial on a number of the special verdicts. The plaintiff also moved for assessment of treble damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and interest for the count brought under G. L. c. 93A (1984 ed.). The defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict with regard to several of the special verdicts returned. The trial judge, in a memorandum and order, denied both of the plaintiff\u2019s motions, granted the defendant\u2019s motion, and entered judgment on all counts for the defendant. The Appeals Court affirmed by an order of summary disposition. <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (1984). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The factual background of the case is as follows. In 1970 the plaintiff was riding as a passenger in an automobile driven by Harold Mandeville when the automobile struck a tree. The plaintiff was rendered unconscious. In the ensuing years, she experienced repeated fainting spells and headaches. Eventually, she was unable to continue her employment and, in March, 1974, sought treatment from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">During the period of treatment, a suit brought by the plaintiff against Mandeville was pending. The plaintiff hoped to prove that, as a result of the automobile accident, she suffered from psychomotor seizures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In May, 1975, prior to the start of the Mandeville trial, the defendant terminated her physician-patient relationship with the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney later obtained a report from the defendant concerning her treatment of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel decided not to call the defendant as an expert witness in the Mandeville trial, but the defendant was subpoenaed by Mandeville\u2019s attorney, Mr. Eugene J. Mulcahy, as a defense witness. The defendant testified that she was unable to say with reasonable medical certainty that the plaintiff suffered from psychomotor seizures, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>that, if the plaintiff so suffered, the seizures were causally related to the automobile accident. The jury in the Mandeville trial returned a verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for $9,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The plaintiff apparently attributed her perceived lack of adequate compensation to the defendant\u2019s testimony and subsequently brought the suit which is now before us on appeal. She alleged that, without her consent, the defendant had discussed the plaintiff\u2019s medical treatment with Mr. Mulcahy and Dr. Samuel J. Brendler, a neurologist retained by Mandeville\u2019s insurer to examine the plaintiff in preparation for the Mandeville trial. The plaintiff asserted that, by engaging in these discussions, the defendant violated her duty of confidentiality to the plaintiff and invaded the plaintiff\u2019s privacy. The plaintiff alleged also that the defendant\u2019s testimony at the Mandeville trial was contrary to the defendant\u2019s earlier statements to the plaintiff indicating that the defendant believed the plaintiff to be suffering from psychomotor seizures caused probably by the automobile accident. This last factual allegation gave rise to the plaintiff\u2019s claims of negligent testimony and negligent diagnosis, as well as her claim under G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, in concluding that the plaintiff could not recover under G. L. c. 93A, and in the wording of the first special verdict question.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">1. <em>Allowance of motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, </em>a. <em>Breach of confidentiality. </em>In response to special questions, the jury found that the defendant had discussed \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s condition or her treatment or diagnosis of that condition with the attorney for Harold Mandeville\u2019s insurance company [Mr. Mulcahy] or with Dr. Samuel Brendler before she testified at the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s case against Harold Mandeville.\u201d The judge granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict, stating that he was bound by the ruling of the motion judge, dismissing the breach of confidentiality cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>That dismissal was predicated on the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that Massachusetts does not recognize or protect any confidential relationship between physician and patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">After this case was tried, we held that \u201ca duty of confidentiality arises from the physician-patient relationship and that a violation of that duty, resulting in damages, gives rise to a cause of action sounding in tort against the physician.\u201d <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 69 (1985). Even <em>if Alberts </em>is given retroactive application, an issue we need not address, the plaintiff\u2019s claim for breach of confidentiality ultimately fails. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant\u2019s discussions with Mr. Mulcahy and Dr. Brendler deprived her of an opportunity for an adequate settlement of the Mandeville claim and resulted in a reduced jury verdict. The jury found specifically, however, that these discussions did not prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of her action against Mandeville, and that she did not recover less than fair and reasonable compensation for her personal injuries. Thus, the plaintiff failed to prove to the jury\u2019s satisfaction that she had sustained any damage as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions, regardless whether those actions constituted a breach of confidentiality. Any error on the judge\u2019s part in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to this cause of action was therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">b. <em>Invasion of privacy. </em>General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1B (1984 ed.), states: \u201cA person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy. The superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce such right and in connection therewith to award damages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury in the instant case found that the defendant\u2019s discussions with Mr. Mulcahy or Dr. Brendler constituted, in the words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the statute, an \u201cunreasonable, substantial or serious interference\u201d with the plaintiff\u2019s privacy and awarded $18,000 as reasonable compensation. The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, however, due to the motion judge\u2019s previous ruling dismissing those counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaints which alleged an invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for invasion of privacy, the motion judge reasoned that: (1) G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, covers breach of confidentiality, but no protected confidential relationship existed between the plaintiff and the defendant; (2) in the absence of a breach of trust, contract, or confidential relationship, public disclosure of private facts requires publication to the public at large, not merely to a few people, as in the instant case; and (3) the matter made public must be one that would be offensive and objectionable to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities, whereas the information divulged about the plaintiff is not of this type.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion judge\u2019s ruling was predicated on several erroneous conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 522 (1984), a decision predating <em>Alberts, </em>this court recognized \u201ca patient\u2019s valid interest in preserving the confidentiality of medical facts relayed to a physician. \u201d <em>Bratt </em>established that disclosure of such facts can give rise to a cause of action under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, for invasion of privacy. Furthermore, we concluded that the success of such a cause of action is not dependent on communication of the personal matters disclosed to the public at large. <em>Id. </em>at 519 &amp; n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Under the principle articulated in <em>Bratt, </em>disclosure without the consent of the patient, of confidential medical information to two individuals, as alleged by the plaintiff, would be suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>cient to warrant a finding of invasion of privacy. The defendant argues, however, that, although the plaintiff introduced evidence indicating that the defendant had engaged in separate conversations with Mr. Mulcahy and Dr. Brendler, such evidence was insufficient to sustain a jury finding that the defendant had discussed any substantive aspects of her treatment of the plaintiff with either of those individuals. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In passing on the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 301 (1982). The plaintiff testified that, during the Mandeville trial, she saw the defendant speaking with Mr. Mulcahy just before the defendant was to testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought to have the jury draw the inference that the defendant and Mr. Mulcahy had been discussing the defendant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff. In their own testimony, the defendant and Mr. Mulcahy disclaimed any memory of the exact content of this conversation, although the defendant denied that she had discussed her medical treatment of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury were free to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s testimony, however, and reasonably might have reached a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The plaintiff also introduced a transcript of Dr. Brendler\u2019s testimony at the Mandeville trial in which the physician acknowledged that he had consulted with the defendant, and that part of his opinion relative to his diagnosis of the plaintiff \u2019 s neurological problems was based on those consultations. This evidence clearly was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had discussed the plaintiff\u2019s condition or her treatment or diagnosis of that condition with Dr. Brendler.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>We conclude that the jury were warranted in finding that the defendant divulged confidential medical information without the plaintiff\u2019s consent to either Mr. Mulcahy or Dr. Brendler; or both. The jury also were warranted in finding that her actions in doing so constituted an unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with the plaintiff\u2019s privacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge therefore erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the plaintiff\u2019s invasion of privacy cause of action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>2. <em>Damages. </em>We turn now to consideration of the $18,000 award of damages. The defendant has not argued before us that the $18,000 award is excessive as matter of law. She did argue this point in her motion for a new trial. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion in light of his ruling on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Although the validity of the $18,000 award is not before us, we believe that the defendant is entitled to have her claim of error as to excessive damages ruled on by the trial judge on remand, in accordance with the provisions of Mass. R. Civ. P. 59 (a), 365 Mass. 827 (1974). Thus, if the judge determines, after reviewing the evidence, that the award was excessive, under rule 59 (a) he must give the plaintiff an opportunity to remit that portion of the $18,000 award which exceeds the amount adjudged to be a fair recovery. If the plaintiff refuses to accede to the remittitur, the defendant then should be granted a new trial on the damages issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">3. <em>General Laws c. 93A claim. </em>Subsequent to the return of the jury\u2019s verdict, the plaintiff moved for assessment of treble damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and interest under G. L. c. 93A. She asserted that the defendant\u2019s failure to assist in the preparation and presentation of the case against Mandeville, as well as the defendant\u2019s discussions regarding the plaintiff\u2019s condition with Mr. Mulcahy and Dr. Brendler, and the defendant\u2019s refusal to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s condition with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, were unfair or deceptive acts in violation of G. L. c. 93A. The judge denied the motion, reasoning that the acts complained of did not rise \u201cto the degree of rascality necessary to constitute unfairness within the meaning of [G. L.] c. 93A,\u201d at least in view of the jury\u2019s finding that the acts were not committed with the intention of prejudicing the plaintiff\u2019s claim against Mandeville. The judge further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>stated that, at the time the acts were committed, recovery under G. L. c. 93A required a loss of money or property by the plaintiff. See <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, 369 </em>Mass. 33, 44-46 (1975). He noted that the acts about which the plaintiff complained did not prejudice her case against Mandeville, and that she sustained no monetary damages as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We need not decide whether the judge correctly determined that the defendant\u2019s acts were neither unfair nor deceptive, as those terms are defined by G. L. c. 93A, for we sustain his decision on the alternative ground stated. We find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the evidence presented required a finding that the plaintiff did, in fact, suffer a loss of money as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">4. <em>Wording of the first special verdict question. </em>The first special verdict question submitted to the jury read as follows: \u201cDid the plaintiff, Elizabeth Recor Tower, suffer from psycho-motor seizures in September 1975 [the month in which the Mandeville trial began]?\u201d The plaintiff contends that the judge erred in so framing this question. Focusing on the distinction between a psychomotor seizure disorder and the seizures themselves, she maintains that there was abundant evidence presented to support a finding that the plaintiff was afflicted with a psychomotor seizure disorder at the time of the Mandeville trial, but that she never claimed to have experienced actual seizures in September, 1975. Accordingly, in her view a literal reading of the question demanded a negative response by the jury, thereby withdrawing from the jury\u2019s consideration several of the causes of action asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">During a lobby conference prior to submission of the special questions to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel expressed his preference to the judge that the first question refer to the plaintiff\u2019s suffering from a seizure disorder rather than from psychomotor seizures, explaining that the latter term meant the actual epileptic fits. The judge declined to reword the question, stating that the jury could better understand the question if left as originally phrased, and that he did not think the jury would focus on whether the seizures were a symptom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the disease or the disease itself, because the phrase \u201cpsychomotor seizures\u201d had been used throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\u201cThe nature, scope, and form of special questions submitted to a jury pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), are matters within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Bucky Warren, Inc., </em>376 Mass. 280, 291 (1978). His determination that the question as posed was not likely to mislead the jury is entitled to deference by this court. Although we might have been inclined to phrase the question differently, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial judge unless the denial of the requested instruction was clearly erroneous. In this instance it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In testifying at trial the defendant used the terms \u201cpsycho-motor seizures\u201d and \u201cpsychomotor seizure disorders\u201d somewhat indiscriminately.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiff, however, used the first term almost exclusively in describing her medical condition subsequent to the automobile accident and the defendant\u2019s diagnoses as to that condition. She testified that after tests were performed during her hospitalization in March, 1974, the defendant told her that she \u201chad probable psychomotor seizures,\u201d that she was hospitalized in October, 1974, for \u201cprobable seizures\u201d and was again told by the defendant that she \u201chad psychomotor seizures,\u201d and that during 1975 she kept having \u201cseizures.\u201d In light of such testimony we think that the judge was acting within his discretion in denying the plaintiff\u2019s request that the first special verdict question use the terminology \u201cpsychomotor seizure disorder.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>5. <em>Conclusion. </em>In conclusion, we affirm so much of the judge\u2019s order as entered judgment in favor of the defendant on those counts alleging a violation of G. L. c. 93A, negligent testimony, and negligent diagnosis. We affirm, as well, that portion of the judge\u2019s order granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the verdicts relating to the plaintiff\u2019s breach of confidentiality cause of action. We reverse the judge\u2019s order insofar as it granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the verdicts relating to the plaintiff\u2019s invasion of privacy cause of action. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-13\"> No explanation is given as to why two complaints were filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> Psychomotor seizures apparently are a symptom of epilepsy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\"> It is questionable whether the trial judge was precluded from reviewing the rulings of the motion judge, see <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 602-603 (1940). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>n.4 (1985). We think, however, that, since the case was going to trial on related counts, the decision of the trial judge to submit all the counts to the jury, to avoid a possible second trial, was warranted and wise. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 627-628 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b599-10\"> Neither party addresses the issue whether the statutory phrase \u201cin equity\u201d precludes a jury\u2019s consideration of a claim based solely on G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. We have declined to determine whether there is a comparable nonstatutory claim in tort for invasion of privacy. <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 70 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> The plaintiff did not refer expressly to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, in either of her complaints. The motion judge assumed, however, that those counts alleging an invasion of privacy were brought under the statute. After the motion judge\u2019s ruling, the plaintiff sought to amend her complaints, referring specifically to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. The motion to amend was denied; the judge concluded that the amended complaints stated substantially the same causes of action as already had been dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> Evidence was introduced indicating that the defendant also had a one-half hour telephone conversation with Mr. Mulcahy some time before their courthouse consultation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> As to the telephone conversation between Mr. Mulcahy and the defendant, Mr. Mulcahy testified that he had a clear recollection of the discussion, and that the defendant\u2019s medical treatment of the plaintiff was not mentioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> It is not clear from the way the special question is phrased whether the jury determined that the defendant had spoken to both Mr. Mulcahy and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Brendler regarding the plaintiff\u2019s medical condition, or just one of them, and, if the latter, which one. The evidence supports a finding that the defendant had discussions with both men as to her treatment of the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\"> In <em>Bratt </em>we stated that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B, proscribes only \u201cunreasonable\u201d interferences with a person\u2019s privacy, so that certain countervailing interests \u201cmay render the disclosure of personal information reasonable and not actionable under the statute.\u201d <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., supra </em>at 520. We went on to articulate a balancing test applicable on the facts of <em>Bratt </em>for determining whether a physician\u2019s disclosure to an employer of personal medical data about an employee is unreasonable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The defendant in the case at bar has not argued that any disclosures she might have made to Mr. Mulcahy or Dr. Brendler were reasonable under the circumstances. We, therefore, need not consider whether, or to what extent, the plaintiff may have waived her statutory right of privacy by commencing her motor vehicle tort action against Mandeville. We note, however, that Massachusetts does not recognize a physician-patient testimonial privilege. Thus, in <em>Alberts </em>we stated that, notwithstanding a physician\u2019s duty of confidentiality, societal interests may require that he testify in court about information obtained from a patient in the course of treatment. <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, supra </em>at 67. See <em>Hammonds </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>243 F. Supp. 793, 805 (N.D. Ohio 1965) (although patient\u2019s institution of personal injury suit may lead ultimately to waiver of his right to confidentiality, and such right will not prevent pretrial discovery of confidential information as to which physician might testify at trial, clandestine conference between physician and attorney for patient\u2019s adversary is not permissible). See also <em>State ex rel. Klieger, </em>125 Wis. 2d 468, 473-474 (1985); <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>25 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 649, 655 (1962), affirmed, 197 Pa. Super. 79 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> We recognize that it is commonplace in the medical profession for physicians to consult with their colleagues regarding the treatment and diagnosis of patients within their care. This exchange of information is desirable, as it generally improves the medical care rendered. The dialogue between the defendant and Dr. Brendler was different in kind, however. Dr. Brendler had been retained by Mandeville\u2019s insurer, and thus stood in an antagonistic relationship to the plaintiff. Additionally, the facts in this case do not involve another common practice whereby, with the knowledge and consent of the parties, the medical experts of a plaintiff and a defendant may discuss the plaintiff\u2019s condition, with a view toward settlement of a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> The defendant shall have thirty days from entry of rescript to seek a hearing on the issue whether the $18,000 verdict is excessive and to seek a new trial on damages only. Should the defendant fail to do so, or should the judge deny a new trial on damages, judgment shall enter for the plaintiff on the invasion of privacy count in the amount of $18,000, together with interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> For example, in several hospital records introduced at trial the defendant made reference to the possibility that the plaintiff was suffering from a \u201cpsychomotor seizure disorder,\u201d while in others she stated that the plaintiff experienced probable \u201cpsychomotor seizures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> The plaintiff argues also that she suffered from posttraumatic headaches, in addition to a psychomotor seizure disorder, as a result of her automobile accident, and that she was so diagnosed by the defendant. She requested that the judge refer to posttraumatic headaches in his special questions to the jury and alleges that the judge erred in denying that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The judge was of the view that the crux of the plaintiff\u2019s case was whether the defendant improperly diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from psychomotor seizures. We agree. For example, while both of the plaintiff\u2019s complaints allege that the defendant told the plaintiff that the latter \u201cprobably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>had brain injury and epileptic seizures\u201d neither refers to any diagnosis regarding posttraumatic headaches. Furthermore, review of that portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony from the Mandeville trial, upon which much of the present action is predicated, reveals that the defendant did not discuss her medical opinion concerning the plaintiff\u2019s recurring headaches. Rather, she testified that she was unable to state, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, whether the plaintiff was suffering from psychomotor seizures. In our view, the evidence presented did not raise an issue as to the defendant\u2019s diagnosis of posttraumatic headaches, and the plaintiff\u2019s request was properly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b606-6\">Hennessey, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZT\">(concurring). I concur in the court\u2019s result and reasoning, including the remand to the trial judge for consideration of the issue of excessive damages. As to that issue, I would add that the judge\u2019s review of the record may show that he is required to reduce the verdict to a nominal sum. Punitive damages are not permissible as to this cause of action, and I think that no compensatory damages have been shown, in light of the jury\u2019s conclusion that the doctor\u2019s discussions did not adversely affect the jury\u2019s verdict in the personal injury case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
