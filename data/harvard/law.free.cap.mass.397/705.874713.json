In 1976, we affirmed his convictions, after reviewing the whole case on both the law and the evidence, pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1984 ed.). For a summary of the evidence presented at trial, and the issues raised on appeal, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>370 Mass. 835, 836-837 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In 1985, the defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). The defendant raised the claims that the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the consecutive sentence for armed robbery was duplicative of the sentence for murder. A Superior Court judge denied without a hearing the defendant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The defendant then petitioned a single justice of this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, for leave to appeal the denial of his postconviction motion. On October 4, 1985, the single justice issued an order and reservation and report, bringing two of the defendant\u2019s claims before the full court. First, the single justice reserved and reported the question whether the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge used \u201ctrivializing language\u201d in his jury instruction was a \u201cnew\u201d claim within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. The single justice made it clear that in his view the full court should reach the merits of the claim only if it concluded that it was \u201cnew.\u201d The single justice also ruled that certain other challenges by the defendant to the jury instruction were not \u201cnew,\u201d and therefore denied leave to appeal those issues, except as they might bear on the impact of the jury charge in its entirety. Second, the single justice allowed an appeal to the full court on the defendant\u2019s challenge to his consecutive sentence for the armed robbery conviction. Finally, the defendant raised an additional claim that the application of statutory and common law principles relating to felony-murder illegally enhanced the crime of which he was convicted from murder in the second degree to murder in the first degree, which in turn resulted in an illegal enhancement of the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>imposed. The single justice ruled that this claim was not new, and therefore denied leave to appeal this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">1. First, we address the question reported by the single justice, whether the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial judge used \u201ctrivializing\u201d language in his jury instruction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a \u201cnew\u201d question for which an appeal should be allowed. Under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, no appeal shall lie from the denial of a postconviction motion \u201cunless the appeal is allowed by a single justice of the supreme judicial court on the ground that it presents a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.\u201d The defendant argues that a \u201cnew\u201d question for the purpose of this provision is one that previously had not been argued or addressed. The defendant did not object to the allegedly \u201ctrivializing\u201d language of the instruction, either at the time of his trial, or on direct appeal. We did not address this issue in our plenary review of his conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>370 Mass. 835, 838 (1976). The defendant argues that, because he is raising the issue for the first time in his postconviction motion, it is a \u201cnew\u201d question within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">An issue is not \u201cnew\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, where either it has already been addressed, or where it could have been addressed had the defendant properly raised it at trial or on direct review. \u201cThe statute requires that the defendant present all his claims of error at the earliest possible time, and failure to do so precludes relief on all grounds generally known and available at the time of trial or appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 365-366 (1981), and cases cited.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gricus, </em>317 Mass. 403, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>405 (1944) (\u201cEven in a capital case, a party may not bring up by exceptions to the denial of a motion for a new trial a question of law that he raised or could have raised at trial\u201d). A claim will not be considered \u201cnew\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, where the grounds advanced for it were available to the defendant at the time of his trial or direct appeal. <em>Pisa, supra </em>at 367. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>391 Mass. 123, 126 (1984). Cf. <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 248 (1980) (unavailability of constitutional claim at time of trial excuses failure to raise claim in ordinary course). We thus must examine our case law to determine if the theory on which the defendant\u2019s argument is based was sufficiently developed at the time of his trial or appeal so that his claim reasonably could have been raised during those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We first reversed a conviction on the ground that the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury \u201ctrivialized\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116 (1977). We held that the judge\u2019s analogy to important social and economic decisions in the everyday lives of the jurors tended to understate and trivialize the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 128-129. In <em>Ferreira, </em>we traced our criticism of this method of jury instruction to our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>362 Mass. 672 (1972), judgment vacated and remanded on other grounds, 411 U.S. 945 (1973), aff\u2019d on rehearing, 365 Mass. 66 (1974), reviewed on petition for writ of habeas corpus sub nom. <em>Bumpus </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>452 F. Supp. 1060 (D. Mass. 1978), denial of writ aff\u2019d, 635 F.2d 907 (1st Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003 (1981). In <em>Bumpus, </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he inherent difficulty in using such examples is that, while they may assist in explaining the seriousness of the decision before the jury, they may not be illustrative of the degree of certainty required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682. Subsequent decisions of this court reversing criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>convictions on the basis of such \u201ctrivializing\u201d examples<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have also traced the genesis of this doctrine to our decision in <em>Bum-pus. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelleher, </em>395 Mass. 821, 825 (1985) (the defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury charge \u201cis founded on principles first enunciated . . . in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus\u201d); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, supra </em>at 128 (\u201cOur first criticism of the practice was expressed in <em>Bumpus\u201d). </em>The defendant in this case was tried in December, 1973, after our decision in <em>Bumpus. </em>His direct appeal was argued before this court on April 6, 1976, after our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>365 Mass. 1, 12 (1974) (where we noted that judge\u2019s analogy to important decisions in the jurors\u2019 personal lives was \u201cnot entirely apt,\u201d and was \u201cbest discontinued\u201d). Having had the benefit of both of these decisions, the defendant could reasonably have been expected to object to the judge\u2019s instruction either at trial or on direct appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201ctrivializing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>instruction\u201d argument was available to him at those junctures in the case, and therefore cannot now be considered \u201cnew\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We answer the question reported by the single justice in the negative, and therefore do not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">2. The single justice allowed the defendant leave to appeal his claim regarding the duplicative nature of his sentence for armed robbery. The defendant was sentenced to thirty-five to forty years\u2019 incarceration for his armed robbery conviction, to be served from and after his life sentence for murder. The defendant argues that this consecutive sentence should be vacated, because proof of the armed robbery did not require proof of any facts apart from those necessary to convict him of first degree (felony) murder. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>375 Mass. 380, 392-393 (1978). The Commonwealth correctly concedes that this result is mandated by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 125 (1980), and, accordingly, we shall order, <em>infra, </em>that the sentences for murder and armed robbery are to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">3. The defendant attempts to argue before us that his sentence for murder in the first degree was an illegal enhancement of his conviction for armed robbery. The single justice expressly ruled that this claim was not \u201cnew,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and therefore denied the defendant leave to appeal the issue to the full court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>justice\u2019s denial of a petition for leave to appeal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, is final and unreviewable. <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547 (1982). See <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 742 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">4. The defendant also argues that he has been deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel, due to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the judge\u2019s allegedly \u201ctrivializing\u201d jury instruction. We do not address this claim, as the defendant did not obtain leave to appeal from the single justice as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. <em>Leaster, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">5. The case is remanded to the single justice with instructions that he remand it to the Superior Court, where the sentence on the conviction for armed robbery is to be vacated and a new sentence is to be imposed, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on the conviction of murder in the first degree. Because we have answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question reported by the single justice, the appeal is otherwise dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\"> In discussing the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, the judge equated proof beyond a reasonable doubt with the degree of certainty with which people make important decisions in their personal lives, such as the decision to undergo \u201copen heart surgery\u201d with a \u201cfifty-fifty chance of survival.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> In <em>Pisa, </em>we analogized the \u201cnewness\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to the standard under which a trial judge will consider claims raised in a motion for postconviction relief under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, 378 Mass. 901 (1979), citing \u201cour \u2018unbroken practice\u2019 of not allowing a motion for new trial to be used as \u2018a vehicle to compel a trial judge to review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>reconsider questions of law . . . which could have been raised at trial and in appellate review after trial but which were not so raised.\u2019\u201d <em>Pisa, supra </em>at 366, quoting <em>Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 229 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-5\"> We have never held, nor do we hold now, that a judge\u2019s reference to important decisions in the personal lives of jurors necessarily constitutes error, constitutional or otherwise. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 144-145 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 596, 598-601 (1980). In some instances such instructions may so inadequately convey to the jury the concept of reasonable doubt as to amount to a denial of due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelleher, </em>395 Mass. 821, 825 (1985), citing <em>Rembiszewski, supra </em>at 128-130. See also <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358 (1970). However, we continue to adhere to the view that a jury instruction must be considered in its entirety to assess the impression which it may have left with the jurors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 441 n.12 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 690-691 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\"> The defendant argues that the constitutional significance of his argument was not apparent until our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422 (1980), which was announced after his trial and direct appeal. Even assuming that our disapproval of specific analogies to the personal decisions of jurors achieved constitutional status in 1980, see n.3, <em>supra, </em>this result was foreshadowed in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We make no distinction under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, between constitutional and nonconstitutional claims for the purpose of determining whether they are \u201cnew\u201d within the meaning of that statute. The relevant inquiry is whether the legal basis for the defendant\u2019s argument was <em>sufficiently developed </em>at the time of his trial or direct appeal so that he could reasonably be expected to have raised it at that time. This court\u2019s disapproval of \u201ctrivializing\u201d examples \u2014 even if it rested solely on common law principles \u2014 was first enunciated in 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> The single justice noted in his order that this issue also \u201cseems insubstantial, but I need not so decide.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\"> The defendant cites <em>Gallinaro </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>362 Mass. 728, 734-735 (1973), for the proposition that a challenge to an illegal sentence may be raised at any time, without leave of a single justice. In <em>Gallinaro, </em>we allowed the defendants to raise a double jeopardy challenge to their multiple punishments for the same offense by writ of error, despite the fact that the defendants had failed to raise this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\"><em>Gallinaro </em>did not involve a capital offense subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. By its express terms, the statute prohibits an appeal from \u201cany motion\u201d filed in Superior Court after rescript, unless such appeal is allowed by a single justice. This includes postconviction motions challenging the legality of the defendant\u2019s sentence. In <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 744 (1986), we commented that this court will already have engaged in a plenary review of capital cases on direct appeal (including the defendant\u2019s sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
