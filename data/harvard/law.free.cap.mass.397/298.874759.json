See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (1985). We granted further appellate review to consider the defendant\u2019s allegations that the use of certified copies of records of his convictions containing extraneous matter deprived him of a fair trial, and that the judge\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences \u201cviolated the defendant\u2019s right to be secure from double jeopardy.\u201d We conclude that the use of the certified conviction records with extraneous material requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Appeals Court summarized the facts as follows: \u201cResponding in the early morning of February 22, 1984, to an alarm from the Radio Shack at South Hingham Plaza, Detective Joel McGinnis and other officers found that the store had been burglarized: the glass entrance door had been bashed in, a glass display case worth $400 broken, and (according to the store manager, called to the scene) nine items worth $8,000 \u2014 two television sets and seven pieces of electronic equipment \u2014 carried off. About 7:30 that morning, McGinnis, accompanied by Detective John Kichler of the same police unit, went to the Easton police station and met John Ford, the defendant\u2019s brother. John Ford admitted complicity in the Hingham break. Upon evidence gathered in the course of the day, a warrant was obtained to search the house of one Menassian, in Saugus. A large amount of merchandise was recovered there, including perhaps five of the items taken from the Radio Shack.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u201cOn April 10,1984, Detective Kichler arrested the defendant upon warrant at the Boston Municipal Court, and, with Officer Larry Schofield, took him to the Hingham police station. He was led into the detectives\u2019 room and presently confronted McGinnis and Kichler. Electronic equipment, including material taken from the Radio Shack, was stacked on the floor. Given his rights, the defendant first denied any knowledge of the break, but after McGinnis asked whether he recognized the loot from the Radio Shack, and went on to mention the brother John Ford and the Menassians, the defendant admitted that he, his brother John, Vinnie Ruggerio, and Julio Caban had done the job; they had taken the stuff from the case, and \u2018screwed out in the car. \u2019 They \u2018always\u2019 wore gloves (no finger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>prints had been found). The defendant added that the articles taken from Menassian were worth $90,000, and that Menassian had put out a \u2018contract\u2019 for him and the other three. Then there was talk about \u2018protection\u2019 for the defendant and the prospect of bail or release on personal recognizance upon arraignment. When the defendant was arraigned the following day, several officers were there, apparently for \u2018protection. \u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201cTestifying on his own behalf, the defendant denied he had made any confession on April 10: the implication was that the detectives were lying in order to get a conviction in this, for them, \u2018big\u2019 case. On cross-examination, however, the defendant conceded that he had lied in claiming that he did not know Ruggerio or Caban. He also conceded that on the night of February 23, 1984, he was in a car with these two and his brother. Further, the defendant was impeached by certified records of his numerous convictions of crime, including convictions for possession of stolen motor vehicles, operating under the. influence of intoxicating liquor, operating to endanger, operating after license revocation, possession of burglarious implements, and receiving stolen property.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 576-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The certified records of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions included docket entries which showed defaults, warrants issued, arrests on warrant, and violations of probation. The admission of unexpurgated records was error. We agree with the Appeals Court that where certified records of prior conviction are used to impeach, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21 (1984 ed.), \u201cthey should hew to the convictions, and extraneous entries should not pass to the jury as part of the exhibits. See <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>169 Mass. 338, 340 (1897) (Holmes, J.); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>358 Mass. 808 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 781, 783 (1979).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, supra </em>at 578-579. If, as the judge believed, masking the extraneous material risked inducing the jury to speculate about the missing portions of the records, to the defendant\u2019s prejudice, he should have denied the Commonwealth\u2019s request to mark the records as exhibits. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 664 (1979). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The judge should have limited the use of the records to testimony \u201cestablishing the identity of the witness with the person named in the record of conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>358 Mass. 808, 808 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Further, the judge twice allowed the prosecutor to impeach the defendant with a bench trial conviction and then with a jury-of-six conviction for the same offense. This may have given the jurors the misimpression that the defendant had been convicted of additional offenses, clearly to the defendant\u2019s detriment, and should not have been allowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 380-381 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We do not, however, agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that the error was nonprejudicial. The only evidence that tied the defendant to the break-in was the defendant\u2019s confession to the police officers. The confession as reported by the officers did not reveal details that only the culprit would know,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and there was no circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement. The defendant denied making the confession. It may be that the record of prior convictions so undermined the defendant\u2019s credibility that the extraneous entries were superfluous to the Commonwealth\u2019s successful attempt to impeach. Or, it may be that the records of defaults, warrants, arrests, and probation violations, \u201cwent beyond the fact of prior conviction to paint the defendant as a chronic criminal and a man at constant war with society,\u201d as the defendant argues. Credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>bility is for the jury, not for appellate courts. We will not substitute our view of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelleher, </em>395 Mass. 821, 827-828 (1985). Because the decisive, if not sole, issue at trial was witness credibility, and there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement apart from the disputed confession, we cannot say \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that the improperly admitted evidence did not have a signficant impact on the jury\u2019s decision. See <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 763-765 (1946). We conclude that the defendant has shown that \u201cthe error possibly weakened his case in some significant way. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The defendant also argues that his \u201cright to be secure from double jeopardy\u201d was violated by the judge\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences for the offenses of breaking and entering in the night time with intent to commit a felony, larceny in a building, and malicious destruction of property over the value of $100. Because the issue may arise on retrial, we address it. We agree with the Appeals Court that \u201c[t]here was no such overlap or congruence among the three crimes of which the defendant was convicted as might call for cancelling any one of them as redundant or duplicative in the sense of <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 306-307 (1972).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, supra </em>at 580. Conviction for each of the offenses required the Commonwealth to prove an additional fact riot required for conviction of the other two offenses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>379 Mass. 190, 195 (1979). <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871). <em>Josslyn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 6 </em>Met. 236, 240 (1843). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, ante </em>244 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases remanded to the District Court jury-of-six session for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-16\"> The cases were tried in the six-member jury session of the Hingham Division of the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> The judge compounded this error by allowing the defendant to attempt to explain the disposition of the various proceedings. The judge should have allowed a record only of the final disposition on each conviction and each such conviction should have been left unexplained. <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> Detective McGinnis testified to the confession as follows: \u201cHe says, \u2018Yeah, I did the break with my brother, Vinnie Ruggerio and Julio Ca[v]an. \u2019 And I asked him, \u2018Did you wear gloves?,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah, we always wear gloves.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, who did the break\u2019 and he said, \u2018Julio smashed a window out with a baseball bat, we went in and grabbed all the items and threw them in the trunk and we screwed out in the car. \u2019 \u201d The substance of Detective Kichler\u2019s version of the confession was similar. There is no indication in the record that the police officers asked the defendant to sign a written statement of his confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
