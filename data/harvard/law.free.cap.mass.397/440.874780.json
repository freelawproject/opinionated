The defendant, Paul S. Reed, stands convicted of murder in the first degree for the victim\u2019s death. Critical to the Commonwealth\u2019s case was the evidence provided by one Patton Flannery, an inmate at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater. Flannery said that the defendant admitted to him that he had killed the victim. At the Commonwealth\u2019s urging and over the defendant\u2019s timely objection, the judge admitted testimony from Flannery that he (Flannery) had a conversation with the defendant\u2019s wife, in the defendant\u2019s absence. In that conversation, the defendant\u2019s wife told Flannery that the defendant had told her that he (the defendant) had committed the crime. The judge admitted this hearsay evidence as an adoptive admission and in his instructions told the jurors that they could consider the evidence of this conversation as \u201ccorroborative evidence.\u201d There is no dispute that the judge\u2019s ruling is erroneous. At issue is whether the admission of that evidence was prejudicial error. We conclude that the error is prejudicial. Consequently, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Apart from Flannery\u2019s testimony that the defendant admitted to him that he was the culprit, there was evidence that on November 8, 1981, the defendant\u2019s wife reported the theft of her automobile to the Bridgewater police. The police recovered the vehicle from an area in Plympton where the defendant frequently went to pick grapes and blueberries. The vehicle had been burned. A State police chemist found traces of rabbit hair in the automobile which were similar to the hairs from a rabbit fur coat worn by the victim and found near her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">1. <em>The Conversation as an Adoptive Admission. </em>On Monday, November 9, 1981, the defendant\u2019s wife visited Flannery at M.C.I., Bridgewater.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Flannery, the defendant\u2019s wife said that the defendant told her that he had slain the victim on Saturday, November 7. On Saturday, November 14, 1981, the defendant visited Flannery. Again according to Flannery, and at Flannery\u2019s prompting,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant told him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>details of the homicide. In his instructions, the judge told the jury that the evidence of the wife\u2019s conversation with Flannery was admitted under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule for the purpose of corroborating the admissions made by the defendant to Flannery. The admission of the conversation between Flannery and the defendant\u2019s wife was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">An adoptive admission is \u201ca statement . . . made in the hearing of another, in regard to facts affecting his rights, and [that person\u2019s] reply, wholly or partially admitting their truth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>12 Met. 235, 237 (1847). The declaration and the reply are admissible, as an exception to the hearsay rule, because \u201cthe <em>reply </em>... is the act of the party, who will not be presumed to admit any thing affecting his own interest, or his own rights, unless compelled to it by the force of truth; and the <em>declaration </em>. . . give[s] meaning and effect to the reply\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 201-202 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sazama, </em>339 Mass. 154, 156-157 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 317 (1944); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence, 287-289 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Because the defendant was not present at the conversation between his wife and Flannery, there was no adoptive admission. The evidence was hearsay not within an exception and therefore should pot have been admitted. We turn to the question whether the admission of this evidence was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Flannery testified that the defendant made admissions to him; the defendant denied the conversation took place. Thus, the jurors were faced with a classic duel of credibility. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence apart from Flannery\u2019s testimony was not decisive of the defendant\u2019s guilt, but merely corroborated bits and pieces of Flannery\u2019s testimony, or attempted to establish Flannery\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity in his community (M.C.I., Bridgewater). A witness for the defendant asserted that he was with Flannery and the defendant on November 14, 1981, and that they did not have a private conversation. Defense witnesses also testified differently from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses as to Flannery\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity. In these circumstances, testimony by Flannery of a private conversation between the defendant and his wife may have had a decisive bearing on the verdict. Further, the prosecutor, on redirect, had Flannery identify the defendant\u2019s wife in the courtroom, thus, perhaps, encouraging the jurors to draw a negative inference from her failure to testify.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In his summation, the prosecutor argued that Flannery\u2019s credibility was the critical issue. He reminded the jury that the defendant\u2019s wife was the first person to take Flannery \u201cinto their confidence about the facts of this murder.\u201d The prosecutor then said that, because of the conversation between Flannery and the defendant\u2019s wife, the defendant had no choice but to take Flannery into his confidence. We cannot say that the evidence and the prosecutor\u2019s argument did not have the effect the Commonwealth intended it to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Nor can we say \u201cwith fair assurance,\u201d that the jury did not attach substantial significance to evidence of a private conversation between husband and wife or that such evidence did not have a substantial impact on the issue of Flannery\u2019s credibility. We conclude that the defendant has shown that \u201cthe error possibly weakened his case in some significant way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741 (1983).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>2. <em>Other Issues Likely to Recur at a New Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">a. <em>Evidence of prior convictions. </em>The defendant filed a motion in limine which sought to bar the introduction of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record for purposes of impeachment. The defendant argues that the admission in evidence of prior convictions gave rise to unfair prejudice which outweighed the probative value of that evidence for impeachment purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v.' <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984). This case, however, was tried before the <em>Maguire </em>opinion was issued. Because we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial on other grounds, we need not decide whether the admission of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">b. <em>Testimony of James Lawson. </em>James Lawson, a Bridge-water inmate, testified to a telephone call to the defendant\u2019s wife. The defendant was in the same room as his wife but neither affirmed nor denied the conversation. Again, on the record before us there is no evidence that the defendant heard the conversation or that he was in a position to make a reply. This conversation is not admissible. See <em>supra </em>at 442. \u201cWe are not inclined to extend the scope of the doctrine of admission by silence.\u201d <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>363 Mass. 1, 16 (1973).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The judgment is reversed, the verdict set aside and the case remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> The Commonwealth offered evidence of the friendship between Flannery and the defendant\u2019s wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> The defendant, according to Flannery, said that Flannery had \u201cheard it all from Nance\u201d [the defendant\u2019s wife].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> No jury instruction was requested or given that the wife had a privilege not to testify against her husband.

Second (1984 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> The United States Supreme Court has stated the rule for nonconstitutional errors in similar terms. \u201c[I]t is not the appellate court\u2019s function to determine guilt or innocence. . . . Nor is it to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out. Appellate judges cannot escape such impressions. But they may not make them sole criteria for reversal or affirmance. Those judgments are exclusively for the jury, given always the necessary minimum evidence legally sufficient to sustain the conviction unaffected by the error. . . . And the question is, not were they [the jurors] right in their judgment, regardless of the error or its effect upon the verdict. It is rather what effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision. The crucial thing is the impact of the thing done wrong on the minds of other men, not on one\u2019s own, in the total setting. . . . [I]f one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected. The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d (Citations omitted, footnotes omitted.) <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 763-765 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\"> The judge, of course, may condition the exclusion of such records by requiring similar restraint by defense counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>392 Mass. 192, 194 n.1 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-12\"> The defendant also challenges testimony by Flannery of threats against him. The defendant opened up the issue of threats on cross-examination. The judge permitted further testimony as to the threats on redirect examination. There was no error. \u201cThe purpose of redirect examination is to explain or rebut adverse testimony or inferences developed during cross-examination. . . . The subject matter of the [threats] . . . was opened up in cross-exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>nation, and therefore an exploration of them on redirect was clearly within\u201d the judge\u2019s discretion. (Citation omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 375 (1978). We add that many of the questions excluded on cross-examination appear to have been excluded because of the form of the questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b459-6\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1v\">(dissenting, with whom Nolan, J., joins). I respectfully dissent. I agree that Flannery\u2019s testimony regarding statements by Nancy Reed should not have been admitted. Although that testimony should have been excluded, I believe that no prejudice resulted. This is so because the defendant testified and denied that he ever made either statement. If the jury were willing to believe that the defendant himself confessed to Flannery, then that was enough evidence. If they chose to disbelieve Flannery\u2019s testimony on that point, then surely they would have rejected Flannery\u2019s testimony regarding the statements of Nancy Reed. As Judge Learned Hand put it, \u201c[i]f, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court.\u201d <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>6 F.2d 364, 368 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 268 U.S. 706 (1925). As such, the evidence of Nancy Reed\u2019s statements could only be cumulative and not prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>391 Mass. 97, 106, cert. denied, 105 S.Ct. 143 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 342 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">My opinion in this regard is fortified by the fact that the judge limited the use of this testimony to corroboration of the defendant\u2019s own admissions to Flannery. Thus the statements properly could not have been considered as proof of the matter asserted. In this limited form the evidence pales into insignificance in the face of Flannery\u2019s statement that the defendant admitted the crime and the defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In regard to the admission of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, I wish to emphasize that I do not depart from the view I expressed in my concurrence in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 834 (1985): \u201cEvidence of a prior conviction, especially of a violent crime or one involving dishonesty, is probative as to the defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. See Advisory Committee Note to First Draft of Proposed Fed. R. Evid. 609(a), reprinted in 46 F.R.D. 161, 297 (1969) (\u2018A demonstrated instance of willingness to engage in conduct in disregard of accepted patterns is translatable into willingness to give false testimony\u2019). A reasonable basis exists, therefore, for the legislative determination that evidence that the defendant has been found guilty of a failure to conform his conduct to the legal norms of society should be brought to the jury\u2019s attention, as an aid in evaluating the defendant\u2019s sincerity and reliability as a witness. The judge\u2019s role should generally be limited to preventing misuse of the evidence, through appropriate limiting instructions and careful monitoring of the prosecutor\u2019s use of the evidence at trial. Only in extreme circumstances, not shown to be present here, would I conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice <em>required </em>the exclusion of such evidence\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 835 (Lynch, J., concurring).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
