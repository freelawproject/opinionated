The plaintiff, individually and as administratrix of her husband\u2019s estate, brought this action under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.), the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act; G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11 (1984 ed.), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act; and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), the Federal Civil Rights Act, to recover damages allegedly caused by the defendants\u2019 negligent failure \u201cto properly administer safe road standards at River Street and throughout the Town of Hudson\u201d and for failure \u201cto enforce the ordinances and statutes relative to . . . supervision over serving liquor to minors at licensed drinking establishments. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 <em>(b) </em>(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The plaintiff appealed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we ordered the matter transferred to this court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>We summarize the facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint. The Appletons were residents of River Street in Hudson for five years. River Street is a public way in the control of the town of Hudson, and had been the site of numerous accidents and fatalities from 1972 to 1982. Also situated on River Street was the Hudson Portuguese Club, which held a liquor license issued by the selectmen. The Portuguese Club had had numerous problems with drinking by minors; six months before the accident, the Appletons had complained to the town police and selectmen about underage drinking at the club and about dangerous speeding conditions on River Street. \u201cThe drinking at the Hudson Portuguese Club by minors and the dangerous traffic conditions on River Street were potentially explosive situations within the control of the town of Hudson, its selectmen, Police Chief and supervisory personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">On the evening of June 25, three minors purchased liquor illegally at the Portuguese Club and at several other drinking establishments licensed by the town. The three youths, under the influence of alcohol, then raced their automobiles through the streets of Hudson. About one o\u2019clock on the morning of June 26, the three youths, still drunk, raced along River Street at speeds over ninety miles per hour, crossed into the wrong lane, and crashed into an automobile driven by Allen Appleton. Allen Appleton was killed and the plaintiff, a passenger in the car, was seriously injured and hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">\u201c \u2018[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim which would entitle [her] to relief. \u2019 Furthermore, the allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, are to be taken as true.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). Applying these generous principles , we conclude that the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">1. <em>Claims under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. </em>The defendants include the town of Hudson, the selectmen of Hudson, and the town administrator. The complaint alleges negligence in the performance of their official duties by the selectmen and the administrator. Under \u00a7 2 of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, a public employee is not liable for \u201cpersonal injury or death caused by his negligence or wrongful act or omission while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d The public employer, however, is liable for such an injury or death as if it were a private individual, subject to certain limitations. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. The selectmen and the administrator are \u201cpublic employees\u201d within the terms of the act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and thereby exempt from liability. Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s claims against them under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act were properly dismissed. <em>Taplin </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>390 Mass. 1, 2 (1983). <em>Pruner </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Superior Court in the County of Norfolk, </em>382 Mass. 309, 313-315 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In pressing her remaining claim against the town of Hudson, the plaintiff must show that the defendants owed her a special duty of care beyond the duty owed to the public at large. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>at 476, 478 (1986). <em>Ribeiro </em>v. <em>Granby, </em>395 Mass. 608, 613 (1985). <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 810 (1982). The plaintiff relies <em>on Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745 (1984), to argue that such a special duty is established by the town\u2019s licensing of the Portuguese Club under the State statutes and town by-laws that prohibit serving liquor to minors and driving while intoxicated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In <em>Irwin, </em>we did find a special duty in the relationship between \u201ca police officer who negligently fails to remove an intoxicated motorist from the highway, and a member of the public who suffers injury as a result of that failure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762. As we stated there, and reiterated in both <em>Ribeiro </em>and <em>Nickerson, </em>our conclusion that a special duty existed was based on the \u201clegislative intent to protect both intoxicated persons and other users of the highway,\u201d <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 762, <em>and </em>on \u201cthe risk created by the negligence of a municipal employee ... of immediate and foreseeable physical injury to persons who cannot reasonably protect themselves from it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Even if we assume that the relevant liquor licensing and traffic statutes and by-laws (none of which the plaintiff cites) evince a legislative intent to protect both intoxicated minors and other users of the highways, the allegations of the complaint do not show that the alleged negligence created a risk of immediate and foreseeable physical injury. Unlike the situation in <em>Irwin, </em>there was no foreseeably identifiable perpetrator whom the town negligently failed to remove from the highways. Nor was the risk \u201cimmediate.\u201d As in <em>Ribeiro </em>and <em>Dinsky, </em>this case presents a \u201crelatively leisurely course of events.\u201d <em>Irwin, supra </em>at 756. The complaint alleges that the dangerous traffic conditions had existed at least ten years, and that drunk driving by minors had continued for at least six months after the Appletons had notified the town of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Taking all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, we may assume that the situation was indeed dangerous and that town officials ought to have done something. But the obligation to provide adequate police protection in a neighborhood is precisely the type of general duty which the \u201cpublic duty\u201d rule protects. The fact that the Appletons complained about this particular condition does not transform this generalized public duty into a specific duty to protect them. Citizen redress ordinarily is through the political process. We sympathize with the severe loss suffered by the plaintiff. However, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act is not a remedy for shortcomings of the political process.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>2. <em>Claims under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. </em>The plaintiff also seeks damages under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To establish a claim under the Act, a plaintiff must allege and prove (1) that her \u201cexercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with,\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, and (2) that the interference or attempted interference was by \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 \u00a7 11H, 11I. We need not decide whether the defendants interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s or her decedent\u2019s rights. Taking all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the complaint still does not allege any conduct by anybody that can be considered a \u201cthreat, intimidation or coercion.\u201d See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 182-184 (1985). This claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">3. <em>Federal Civil Rights Act. </em>The plaintiff also seeks to recover under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), the Federal Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Rights Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To establish a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the defendants acted \u201cunder color of state law\u201d and (2) that the defendants deprived them of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981). There is no question that the defendants acted under color of State law, but the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a finding that the defendants deprived them of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In her complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the \u201cpublic officials of the municipality of Hudson did implicitly or tacitly authorize, approve or encourage this harassment of the Appletons and residents of River Street\u201d and that \u201cthe defendants combined and conspired to commit an individual act, or to commit a lawful act by unlawful means and unlawful acts in agreement between all parties to inflict a wrong or injury upon the Apple-tons.\u201d Apart from these conclusory statements, the complaint does not allege any affirmative or intentional acts by the defendants. The essence of the complaint is that the defendants\u2019 negligent failure to act in response to dangerous conditions along River Street caused the Appletons\u2019 injuries and deprived them of their rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently held that \u201cthe Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>liberty or property\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986). \u201c[L]ack of [due] care simply does not approach the sort of abusive government conduct that the Due Process Clause was designed to prevent.\u201d <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 336, 347-348 (1986). Our inquiry need go no further.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent failure to provide better police protection along River Street was a policy judgment with which the Appletons and other Hudson citizens could express their disagreement through petition and the ballot box; it does not amount to an abuse of power against which the Fourteenth Amendment provides protection. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 335. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, supra </em>at 348. The plaintiff\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-11\"> The complaint also named as a defendant the acting chief of police. The trial court docket does not reflect any appearance by counsel for the police chief or that service of process was ever made on him. The police chief also did not participate in the motion to dismiss which precipitated dismissal of the action and the instant appeal. Because the action involved multiple parties, the court should not have entered judgment against fewer than all the parties without \u201can express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 <em>(b), </em>365 Mass. 820 (1974). <em>See, New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1977). We do expect strict compliance with this rule. <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Bradford O. Emerson, Inc., </em>19 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>App. Ct. 420, 422-423 &amp; n.3 (1985). Nevertheless, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to serve process on the police chief, the police chief\u2019s nonparticipation in all of the proceedings, and the fact that a remand would needlessly delay conclusion of the case, we treat this appeal as properly before us. <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc., supra. </em>See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943). We express no opinion on the status of the claim against the police chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\"> General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.), defines \u201cpublic employee\u201d as \u201celected or appointed, officers or employees of any public employer, whether serving full or part-time, temporary or permanent, compensated or uncompensated, and officers or soldiers of the military forces of the commonwealth.\u201d The plaintiff does not dispute that the individual defendants are public employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 11H (1984 ed.), provides: \u201cWhenever any person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any other person or persons of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, the attorney general may bring a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the peaceable exercise or enjoyment of the right or rights secured.
