That authority is claimed by the mayor of Boston, through the mayor\u2019s office of consumer affairs and licensing, also known as the licensing division (division), on one side, and the Boston Licensing Board (board), a body whose members are appointed by the Governor, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Before the court are four consolidated cases, variously pitting combinations of the two governmental parties and potential licensees against each other. Cross motions for summary judgment were filed by the board and the division in the Superior Court. The judge issued a memorandum and order and a supplemental memorandum and order in which he granted the board\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Parties aggrieved by the judge\u2019s orders appealed, and, additionally, the judge reported \u201cthe questions of law raised by both defendants\u2019 and plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d to the Appeals Court. Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). The mayor and the board filed applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tians in this court seeking direct appellate review. Mass. R. A. P. 11, as amended, 378 Mass. 938 (1979). We allowed those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The questions presented for our review may be summarized as follows: (1) By what authority are automatic amusement devices (including electronic and video games) and amusement arcades in Boston licensed? (2) What licensing body in Boston is meant by the term \u201clicensing authorities\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A (1984 ed.), and other related provisions of G. L. c. 140? (3) How does \u00a7 183A apply to establishments in Boston? (4) What is the basis, if any, of the entertainment licensing authority of the mayor of Boston?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have reviewed the statutes bearing on these questions. We conclude that the Legislature has delegated the over-all authority for the licensing of entertainment within the city of Boston to the mayor of Boston; the Legislature, however, has given the board authority over a few specifically designated types of entertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>No single entertainment licensing statute comprehends all the categories of entertainment which a Massachusetts customer might enjoy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The various statutes, by their terms, present a patchwork coverage, sometimes apparently overlapping. The parties disagree, not only about the construction of statutes, but also over which statutes are still in effect. We resolve this ambiguity by tracing the history of the relevant statutes, so as to understand the purpose and scope of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>1821 Boston charter. </em>Throughout the early history of Massachusetts, theatrical entertainment was forbidden by a series of Provincial laws. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>247 Mass. 589, 594 (1924). In 1805, the Legislature enacted a statute penalizing the building of a theatre, the leasing of a building for a theatrical performance, and the performance of \u201cany stage play, interlude or other theatrical entertainment\u201d without a license, to be obtained from the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the county, with the approval of the town selectmen. St. 1805, c. 98. Boston was at that time a town, and theatrical entertainment in Boston was covered by that statute. In 1821, Boston became the first city in the Commonwealth under the provisions of its original charter. St. 1821, c. 110. See <em>City Council of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 716, 719-721 (1981) (describing, in part, history of city charter; statute designated in that opinion as St. 1822, c. 110, is same as one to which we refer as St. 1827, c. 110). Section 14 of c. 110 changed the licensing procedure for entertainment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>in Boston. The mayor and aldermen were given the power \u201cto license all theatrical exhibitions and all public shows, and all exhibitions of whatever name or nature, to which admission is obtained on payment of money, on such terms and conditions as to them may seem just and reasonable.\u201d St. 1821, c. 110, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><em>Section 181. </em>Outside Boston, St. 1805, c. 98, remained the law governing theatrical entertainment, until it was repealed by St. 1825, c. 152, \u00a7 4, the first section of which granted to the selectmen of each town the same licensing power given to Boston\u2019s mayor and aldermen. St. 1825, c. 152, \u00a7 1. In 1836, the power of selectmen was codified in Rev. Sts. c. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. In 1849, the Legislature modified the revised statute, adding a prohibition against masked balls, St. 1849, c. 231, \u00a7 3, and clarifying the entertainment licensing authority in cities without a special charter provision like Boston\u2019s. St. 1849, c. 231, \u00a7 1. The statute was recodified in 1860, Gen. Sts. c. 88, \u00a7 74; in 1882, Pub. Sts. c. 102, \u00a7 115; in 1902, R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 172; and in 1921, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\"><em>Division of authority in Boston: St. 1908, c. 494, and G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177. </em>Meanwhile, the power of the mayor and aider-men of Boston had been transferred to the aldermen alone under Boston\u2019s revised charter, St. 1854, c. 448, \u00a7 33. In 1878, the Legislature created a board of police commissioners for the city of Boston, to be appointed by the mayor. St. 1878, c. 244, \u00a7 1. The city council was given the power to transfer the licensing authority of the aldermen to the board of police commissioners, St. 1878, c. 244, \u00a7 2, which they did by Boston Revised Ordinances c. 24, \u00a7 3 (1883).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Shortly after this ordinance was passed, however, the city council passed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>amendment revoking the transfer in so far as it included general entertainment licensing by striking the words \u201ctheatrical exhibitions, public shows, public amusements\u201d from the ordinance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result, the licensing authority for entertainment in Boston was split between the board of aldermen and the board of police commissioners when St. 1885, c. 323, took effect. Chapter 323 replaced the mayor-appointed board of police commissioners with the Boston Board of Police, to be appointed by the Governor. St. 1885, c. 323, \u00a7 1. The new board was given all the powers vested in the old board. St. 1885, c. 323, \u00a7 2. These powers included licensing of billiard tables and bowling alleys, but not \u201ctheatrical exhibitions, public shows, [or] public amusements.\u201d The mayor received the licensing authority for the excluded entertainments when he was given the exclusive executive power in Boston under St. 1885, c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 12.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In 1906, the Boston Board of Police was replaced by the Boston Licensing Board and the Boston police commissioner. St. 1906, c. 291. The licensing board assumed the duties of licensing the sale of alcoholic beverages, innholders, and victuallers in Boston, and licensing of picnic groves, skating rinks, intelligence offices, billiard tables, and bowling alleys. St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7 4. Two years later, the Legislature reaffirmed the mayor\u2019s authority to license \u201ctheatrical exhibitions, public shows, public amusements and exhibitions of every description\u201d for which an admission fee is charged, but imposed a limitation of $100 for a license fee for entertainment given in a licensed theatre. St. 1908, c. 494, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Arguably, this statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>removed the licensing board\u2019s authority over picnic groves, billiard, pool, and sippio tables, bowling alleys, and skating rinks. Whatever the state of licensing for picnic groves, billiard, pool, and sippio tables, bowling alleys, and skating rinks between 1908 and 1920, after 1920 they were under the authority of the board by enactment of St. 1920, c. 191, specifically so providing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><em>Section 183A. </em>Neither G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 181,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the 1921 re-codification of R. L. (1902) c. 102, \u00a7 172, which governed licensing of entertainment outside Boston, nor St. 1908, c. 494, which governed licensing of most entertainment in Boston, provided a means to regulate entertainment provided free of charge. This regulatory gap permitted restaurateurs to present entertainment without a license, so long as the patrons were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>charged only for the food and not for the entertainment. In 1926, Mayor James Michael Curley, 1926 House Doc. No. 270, and Governor Alvan T. Fuller, 1926 Senate Doc. No. 1, both sought statutory change. The Legislature responded by enacting St. 1926, c. 299,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> providing for the licensing of \u201ca concert, dance, exhibition, cabaret, or public show of any description\u201d at which food or drink were sold or a cover charge made.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">By the terms of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, inserted by St. 1926, c. 299, the license was to be obtained from \u201cthe licensing authorities,\u201d and under \u00a7 182, amended by c. 299, no penalty was to be imposed on a person holding a \u00a7 183A license for not obtaining, in addition, a \u00a7 181 license.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201clicensing authorities\u201d in Boston included the board, whose duties included licensing of victuallers, innholders, and a few specified forms of entertainment, see St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7 4, and the mayor, who licensed theatrical exhibitions and public shows of every description to which admission was charged. St. 1908, c. 494, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201cThe familiar rule of statutory construction requires us to interpret a law so as to effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it. <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934).\u201d <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., 392 </em>Mass. 811, 813 (1984); <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757 (1975) (statute must be construed in light of objectives served by its enactment). Additionally, \u201c[t]o the extent possible, local statutes and statutes of general application should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purposes of both.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>383 Mass. 693, 701 (1981). Considering the gap being filled by St. 1926, c. 299 (now G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A), it is apparent that the authority appropriate to issue licenses under the 1926 statute is the mayor. Had an innholder or victualler charged admission for entertainment presented in his establishment, the mayor would have had the authority to license the entertainment under St. 1908, c. 494. It was the gap in the mayor\u2019s authority \u2014 not the board\u2019s \u2014 that the Legislature filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In <em>Venuti </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>521 F. Supp. 1027, 1031 (D. Mass. 1981), a Federal District Court judge ruled that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, as amended through St. 1936, c. 71, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The Legislature responded by passing St. 1981, c. 694,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a new version of \u00a7 183A, designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to meet the objections of the Federal court. The 1981 (current) version of the statute omits the language differentiating entertainment offered without charge from that offered for a fee, the difference that required passage of the 1926 statute. The 1981 statute thus expanded the coverage of \u00a7 183A, but did not grant any additional power to the licensing authorities, nor did it reassign the licensing power.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><em>Section 177A. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>323 Mass. 379, 383 (1948), we held the operation of coin-activated amusement devices delivering \u201cfree plays\u201d to be gambling within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 271, \u00a7 7. Consequently, the Legislature enacted St. 1949, c. 361,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> codified as G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A, \u201cfor the purpose of permitting the use and maintenance of automatic amusement devices such as pinball machines, including \u2018free play\u2019 pinball machines, if duly licensed and if used for amusement only.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macomber, </em>333 Mass. 298, 301 (1955). Before \u00a7 177A made legal the use and maintenance of these devices, they, of course, could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>offered legally for public amusement or entertainment, and no license under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 181, or St. 1908, c. 494, could legalize their use. The Legislature, by enacting St. 1949, c. 361, made exempt from the gambling statute machines licensed under \u00a7 <em>111 A. A </em>license issued by \u201c[t]he licensing authorities\u201d under \u00a7 <em>111 A </em>does' not authorize the holder to offer entertainment to the public. It simply provides that use of the licensed machine shall not be a violation of the gambling statute. See <em>Marshfield Family Skateland, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>389 Mass. 436, 441, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 987 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The term \u201clicensing authorities,\u201d without specific reference, refers to those authorities generally charged with amusement licensing, not to those charged with licensing a narrow and specific class of entertainments. Therefore, in Boston, that term, as used in St. 1949, c. 361, \u00a7 1, referred to the mayor, not the board. We perceive no other intended meaning in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>387 Mass. 879, 884 (1983), we declined to address the perceived conflict between \u00a7 177A and the general entertainment licensing statute,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> noting that \u201clicenses may be required under either or both.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our analysis today demonstrates that one who offers as entertainment or amusement the use of a machine requiring a license under \u00a7 177A<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> must obtain a license under the entertainment-licensing statute as well, i.e., in Boston, St. 1908, c. 494. The division has the authority to issue such licenses under both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><em>Mayor\u2019s fee-setting authority. </em>One other statute affecting the power of the mayor should be examined. In 1949, the Legislature provided that Boston, by ordinance, might set fees for licenses. St. 1949, c. 222. Certain licenses were excluded from this procedure. Among those excluded were \u201clicenses granted under chapter four hundred and ninety-four of the acts of nineteen hundred and eight.\u201d St. 1949, c. 222, \u00a7 1. Fees for c. 494 licenses were to be set by the mayor as one of the \u201cterms and conditions as he deems reasonable,\u201d St. 1908, c. 494, \u00a7 1, with the $100 limitation on entertainment provided in a licensed theatre. <em>Id. </em>The mayor therefore retains his fee-setting authority under the 1908 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>We return to the questions raised in this case. (1) Video games and video game arcades are public amusements. In Boston, public amusements are licensed by the mayor, under St. 1908, c. 494. We assume, without deciding, see <em>supra </em>note 18, that the use of a video game machine offering free plays would be gambling if the machine were not licensed under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A (1984 ed.). In Boston, the licensing authority under \u00a7 177A is the mayor. (2) The \u201clicensing authority\u201d in Boston for the purposes of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A (1984 ed.), is the mayor. (3) Section 183A requires a license for any concert, dance, exhibition, cabaret, or public show to be held on the premises specified in that section, whether or not an admission fee is charged. (4) The mayor is empowered generally to license entertainment by St. 1908, c. 494, reaffirming the authority stemming from the 1821 charter. Except for references specifically to other officials, a reference to entertainment \u201clicensing authority\u201d in Boston is a reference to the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The order and supplemental order of the Superior Court are vacated. The cases are remanded to the Superior Court for entry of judgment declaring the rights of the parties in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-12\"> No separate document entitled \u201cJudgment\u201d appears in the joint appendix, but, to the extent some of the matters here are on appeal, we treat the judge\u2019s memoranda and orders as final judgments. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (a), 365 Mass. 820 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\"> The multiple parties\u2019 prayers for declaratory relief do not present the issues as phrased here. Indeed, the record and briefs submitted by the parties in these cases are as redundant and confusing as the statutory provisions on which they rely for their various claims. Nor are we helped by the absence from the voluminous joint appendix of the division\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the document on which the judge granted summary judgment, and on which, in part, he reported the case. We believe, however, that the four questions we state encompass the specific live questions raised by the parties on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We do not reach three constitutional questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Plaintiff G.J.T., Inc., sought a declaration that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A (1984 ed.), is unconstitutional on its face or as applied. It did not pursue this question in the Superior Court, pending resolution of the dispute between the board and the division. G. J.T., Inc., seeks to have this question remanded in the event the board were held to be the licensing authority under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A. In light of our holding, we neither reach the merits of this question nor do we direct that it be considered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Plaintiff First Amendment, Ltd., sought a declaration that the mayor\u2019s fee-setting power was limited by constitutional constraints. The orders of the Superior Court judge did not answer this question, nor have the parties adequately presented it as a live issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The board sought a declaration that St. 1908, c. 494, was unconstitutional because it was vague and violative of due process. The judge of the Superior Court did not address this question, and it has not been pursued by the parties on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\"> Rather than provide extensive quotations from miscellaneous statutes, we invite the reader to compare, for example, G.

(2) The term \u2018automatic amusement device\u2019 as used in this section shall be construed as meaning any mechanism whereby, upon the deposit therein of a coin or token, any apparatus is released or set in motion or put in a position where it may be set in motion for the purpose of playing any game involving, in whole or in part, the skill of the player, including, but not exclusively, such devices as are commonly known as pinball machines including free play pinball machines. ... (6) No person keeping or offering for operation or allowing to be kept or offered for operation any automatic amusement device licensed under this section shall permit the same to be used for the purpose of gambling. (7) The provisions of section seven of chapter two hundred and seventy-one of the General Laws shall not apply to machines licensed under the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> The board relies on the definition in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 1, as its major source of power to license amusements and automatic amusement devices. General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 1, states: \u201c \u2018Licensing authorities, as used in this chapter, unless a contrary meaning is required by the context, shall mean the boards in Boston and other cities which by special statutes or city charters have the power to issue licenses for innholders or common victuallers, licensing boards appointed under section four of chapter one hundred and thirty-eight in cities which at the municipal election next preceding the first day of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-five, voted to authorize the granting of licenses for the sale of certain non-intoxicating beverages and also in cities wherein by special statutes said boards are vested with all the powers and duties exercised by licensing boards in cities that vote to grant such licenses, the aldermen in all other cities and the selectmen in towns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In our view, the phrase \u201clicensing authorities\u201d in Boston is a phrase varied in meaning in light of the extensive history (of which we have only recounted a part) of divided licensing authority in the city of Boston. The Legislature seemed aware of this when it provided the exception \u201cunless a contrary meaning is required by the context.\u201d We view the statute in context mindful of the principles that \u201cabsent a clear legislative intent to the contrary the provisions of a special charter generally prevail over conflicting provisions of a subsequently enacted general law,\u201d and that a \u201csharp conflict between the local and State legislation is required before the local regulation will be held invalid.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 700-701. We see no \u201csharp conflict\u201d when these statutes are read in proper historical perspective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> The parties in <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, supra, </em>did not raise the question of the source of the mayor\u2019s general entertainment-licensing authority. That question has been raised for the first time in this case. We did not address the parties\u2019 assumption in <em>1001 Plays </em>that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7181, was the applicable statute. Nor need we address that assumption today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> The applicability of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A (1984 ed.), to video games has not been adjudicated conclusively before today. We have upheld against constitutional challenge video game licensing under \u00a7 177A, <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864 (1983), and, as noted <em>supra, </em>we declined to address the issue in <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, supra </em>at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Plaintiff G.J.T., Inc., makes a cursory reference to the question, but does not pursue it, and other parties apparently have assumed the statute\u2019s applicability to video games. With nothing before us calling for a contrary reading, we likewise assume that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 177A, applies to video game machines.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
