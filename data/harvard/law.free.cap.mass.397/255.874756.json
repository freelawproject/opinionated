At that time, Bagley was a veteran and a member of a public employee contributory retirement system, with more than thirty years of creditable service. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (1984 ed.). Members of public employee contributory retirement systems meeting minimum age and length-of-service requirements are entitled to certain rights under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16. Among those is the right of a member facing removal or discharge to request a hearing before the local retirement board. G L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2) (referring to \u00a7 16 [1] for procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Bagley filed a timely request for a hearing before the Boston retirement board (board). No hearing occurred. Bagley then sought relief by appealing to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB). A hearing officer of CRAB held a hearing on the appeal and submitted a recommended decision.' The hearing officer\u2019s findings were favorable to Bagley, but he recommended, nevertheless, that the appeal be dismissed because, in his view, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4) \u2014 the statute providing for an appeal to CRAB \u2014 did not apply to Bagley\u2019s case. The hearing officer said that the proper appeal of the board\u2019s inaction was to a District Court, under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (3). CRAB adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and incorporated his recommended decision, concluding, \u201cThis Board [CRAB] has no jurisdiction to entertain this particular appeal. Consequently, the decision of [the board] is affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c.. 30A, \u00a7 14,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bagley sought judicial review of GRAB\u2019S alleged abnegation of authority. A judge of the Superior Court appointed a special master who held a hearing on the matter. The special master examined the language of the two statutory provisions, concluded that Bagley was entitled to appeal the local board\u2019s inaction to CRAB, and submitted to the court a recommendation incorporating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>conclusion. The judge followed the recommendation of the special master, vacated the decision of CRAB, awarded Bagley back pay from the date of his removal, and awarded costs and attorney\u2019s fees to Bagley. The board and CRAB appealed under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15 (1984 ed.). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The procedure governing hearings on removal or discharge and appeals from those hearings is set forth in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 16 (3) <em>(a) </em>provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny member . . . who is aggrieved <em>by any action taken or decision </em>of a board . . . rendered with reference to his . . . removal or discharge . . . may, within thirty days after the certification <em>of the decision </em>of the board, bring a petition in the district court . . . praying that such action and decision be reviewed by the court\u201d (emphasis supplied). Section 16 (4) provides, in pertinent part: <em>\u201cOn matters other than those subject to review by the district court </em>as provided for in subdivision (3), . . . any person when aggrieved by any action taken or decision of a retirement board rendered, <em>or by the failure of a retirement board to act, </em>may appeal to the contributory retirement appeal board ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Bagley was a qualified member aggrieved by the local board\u2019s failure to act. There was no decision of the board to be certified, thereafter to be susceptible to review by the District Court. <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>302 Mass. 111, 116 (1939). A reading of the plain statutory language, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>393 Mass. 150, 167 (1984); <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>392 Mass. 216, 219 (1984), compels the conclusion that Bagley\u2019s appeal lay to the CRAB, not to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>CRAB contends that an harmonious reading of the statutory provisions demonstrates that the Legislature designated CRAB to hear those appeals relating to retirement benefits, not those relating to the member\u2019s removal or discharge. We cannot discern the source of the distinction which CRAB proposes. The language of the statute plainly states that \u201caction[s] and decision[s]\u201d are reviewable by the District Court, while a \u201cfailure ... to act\u201d is appealable to CRAB. We perceive no discord in our reading of this legislative scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The legislative scheme makes sense. A certified decision of the board is easily reviewable by a District Court, while an empty failure to act is better considered by the administrative agency with experience in these matters. An administrative remedy provided by the Legislature is to be preferred over judicial interference in the administrative process. See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Casualty Co., </em>361 Mass. 582, 585-588 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We turn to the appropriate remedy. On judicial review under G. L. c. 30A (1984 ed.), \u201c[T]he findings of the [administrative agency] must be sustained if justified by substantial evidence, <em>Wilmington </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>341 Mass. 599, 605 [1961], and \u2018the burden is on the appealing party to show that the [agency\u2019s] decision was invalid.\u2019 <em>Wilmington </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., supra, </em>at 606.\u201d <em>Almeida Bus Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>348 Mass. 331, 342 (1965). The Superior Court judge correctly relied on CRAB\u2019s findings of fact. One of those findings was that \u201c[t]he Boston School Department failed to file written notice with [the board] containing a fair summary of the facts upon which [Bagley\u2019s] removal was based as required by M. G. L. c. 32, .\u00a7 16 (2).\u201d General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), further provides that the removal or discharge of an employee in Bagley\u2019s position \u201cshall not become effective unless and until a written notice thereof containing a fair summary of the facts upon which such action was based has been filed with the board.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to the facts found by CRAB, it is clear that Bagley\u2019s layoff was never effective, and he is entitled to restoration of pay and benefits for the period of his purported layoff. The judge awarded Bagley back pay for the period of his layoff. Though no reasoning was given to support this relief, we assume that the order was based on G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Bagley\u2019s employer, the school committee of Boston (school department), is the party properly subject to the judge\u2019s order for back pay. The school department is not a party in this case, however, and consequently must be joined in order to accord complete relief to Bagley. Mass. R. Civ. P. 19 (a) (1), 365 Mass. 765 (1974). On remand, the Superior Court judge shall order the joinder of the school department and shall afford the school department the opportunity to be heard on the question of its liability for Bagley\u2019s back pay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The judge also awarded costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The award of attorney\u2019s fees was made in error. Absent an explicit statutory or judicial directive authorizing attorney\u2019s fees in a case of this kind, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable. <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>371 Mass. 303, 311-312 (1976). <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>318 Mass. 238, 241 (1945).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated. The case is remanded for the entry of a new judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1984 ed.), provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[A]ny person . . . aggrieved by a final decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding . . . shall be entitled to a judicial review thereof.\u201d See <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>335 Mass. 610, 616 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> Neither CRAB nor the board disputes the applicability of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, to Bagley\u2019s claim. Thus, their reliance on <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>343 Mass. 502 (1962) (city official\u2019s removal not subject to provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 [2]; cf. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 [5]); and <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 214 (1979) (firefighter who sought accidental disability retirement is within procedural provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 [4]), is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), also provides that, \u201c[u]less the board shall find that such removal or discharge was justified, such member shall forth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>with be restored to his office or position without loss of compensation.\u201d For discussion of the limited powers of the teachers\u2019 retirement board in reviewing the discharge of a teacher, see <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\"> The court may modify the agency decision and compel action unlawfully delayed if the agency decision was based on an error of law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b273-12\"> The school department is entitled to contest the crucial facts found by the CRAB hearing officer. The following findings of fact are, in our view, crucial to the school department\u2019s liability: \u201c1. Gerald Bagley . . . has rights under M. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2) .... 5. [Bagley was] laid off [from his position as supervisor of attendance for the Boston school system] on March 15, 1982. ... 9. The Boston School Department failed to file written notice with the [board] containing a fair summary of the facts upon which [Bagley\u2019s] removal was based as required by M. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Unless the school department is able to prove these statements of fact erroneous, we foresee no need for a factual determination of any other issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> Cf. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1984 ed.) (attorney\u2019s fees authorized in private civil rights action); G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34O (1984 ed.) (attorney\u2019s fees authorized in action against insurer who unreasonably refuses to pay claim under no-fault automobile insurance); G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F (1984 ed.) (attorney\u2019s fees in frivolous suits). Reasonable costs, however, may be recoverable. See, e.g., G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
