L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A (1984 ed.), providing for admission of the results of a blood grouping test in a paternity proceeding to exclude the possibility of paternity of the alleged father, prohibits the introduction of inculpatory human leukocyte antigen (HLA) test results. Further, we consider whether HLA test results may be admissible to establish paternity, if not barred by G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The defendant, Michael Beausoleil, was charged by Sharon Burke with fathering her child, in a proceeding under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12 (1984 ed.). The defendant moved for a court order pursuant to G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A (1984 ed.), requiring that he, the mother, and the child submit to an HLA blood test to determine whether his nonpaternity might be established. The trial judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, but proceeded to trial and took other evidence. Later, the University of Massachusetts Medical Center\u2019s department of laboratory medicine submitted a report stating that, based on a statistical analysis of the results, the probability of paternity was 98.2%, which it termed \u201cvery likely.\u201d Because the report did not exculpate the defendant, the judge entered a finding of guilty and ordered the defendant to pay child support of $75 a week. The defendant appealed for a trial de nova before a jury of six. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Prior to the trial de nova, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine requesting admission of the HLA test results. The judge denied the motion without a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth then filed a petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u00a7 3 (1984 ed.). Treating the denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion as an allowance of a motion to suppress under Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. (1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a single justice of this court transferred the case to the Appeals Court. G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A (1984 ed.). Subsequently, we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Commonwealth asserts on appeal that the judge improperly denied its motion in limine, arguing that G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A (1984 ed.), does not prohibit the introduction of HLA test results to prove paternity. The defendant argues to the contrary. The Commonwealth further contends that, in the absence of any statutory prohibition, inculpatory HLA test results are sufficiently reliable to satisfy the fundamental admissibility requirements for scientific evidence. The defendant argues that the record is barren of evidence of the scientific reliability of HLA test procedures. He further argues that he would be \u201chighly\u201d prejudiced if HLA test results were admitted as evidence of his paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Before we address these issues, a brief discussion of the basic scientific principles and procedures involved in paternity testing is warranted. In view of the absence of evidence or judicial findings, we draw on the authorities cited herein for our generalized discussion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Paternity testing is based on the existence of genetic markers which are inherited from a child\u2019s parents and are found in the various components of the blood. More than 260 genetic markers have been identified for red blood cells (red isoantigens) and over fifty genetic markers have been identified for white blood cells (white isoantigens). Paternity testing involves the identification of such markers followed by application of Mendelian rules of inheritance. Traditionally, exclusion of paternity has been the primary use to which these rules have been put. If a child lacks a genetic marker that a child of the accused must have, or if the child displays a marker that neither the mother nor the putative father has, paternity is conclusively excluded. Lee, Current Status of Paternity Testing, 9 Fam. L.Q. 615, 616-617, 621 (1975). In such cases the impossibility of the accused\u2019s paternity is established to a medical certainty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Avella, </em>339 Mass. 642, 645 (1959) (\u201cThe reliability of [blood] tests to prove nonpaternity is well established as a scientific fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Six red blood cell tests most commonly have been employed in paternity testing. The first three were discovered by Dr. Karl Landsteiner and his colleagues and consist of the ABO, MNS\u2019s, and Rh systems, known collectively as the Landsteiner series. Lemmon &amp; Murphy, The Evidentiary Use of the HLA Blood Test in Virginia, 19 U. Rich. L. Rev. 235, 238-239 (1985). These three systems yield a cumulative probability of between 52% and 57%, depending on the race of the putative father, that at least one of them will exclude paternity of a falsely accused man. Joint AMA-ABA Guidlines: Present Status of Serologic Testing in Problems of Disputed Parentage, 10 Fam. L.Q. 247, 256-258 (1976) (hereinafter, Joint Guidelines). Even with the addition of three other red isoantigen tests, Kell, Duffy, and Kidd, now typically employed in conjunction with the Landsteiner. series (enhanced Landsteiner series), the probability of exclusion of a nonfather is still no greater than 63% to 72%. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, although exclusion of paternity by means of these tests is conclusive, nonexclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>is not, because there may remain a greater than 30% probability that a falsely accused man would not have been excluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In recent years there have been claims of substantial advances in the field of paternity testing. HLA testing was developed in the 1960\u2019s by Dr. Paul Terasaki to determine donor-recipient compatability of organ transplants, but more recently has been used for purposes of determining paternity. See Terasaki, Resolution by HLA Testing of 1000 Paternity Cases not Excluded by ABO Testing, 16 J. Earn. L. 543 (1978). The HLA test is based on the identification and typing of more than fifty antigens found in the white blood cells. Unlike the enhanced Landsteiner series which only can be performed on blood, the HLA test can be performed on certain body tissue in which HLA antigens appear. Consequently, it is often termed a tissue typing test, although for purposes of paternity testing, economic feasibility usually dictates that it be performed on blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">HLA testing allegedly represents an improvement over red isoantigen blood tests in two respects. First, it has a greater capability than the enhanced Landsteiner series for excluding falsely accused men. When administered by itself, the HLA test excludes between 78% and 80% of all nonfathers; this figure increases to over 90% when it is administered in conjunction with the enhanced Landsteiner series. See Joint Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at 257, 258. Second, because of this increased exclusionary capability and the relative rarity of HLA markers, it is claimed that the HLA system can be utilized to calculate a reliable statistical estimation of a accused\u2019s likelihood of paternity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This statistical calculation is \u201cmade on the basis of estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>lished data regarding the frequency with which particular genes appear in certain segments of the population and the combinations in which these genes appear in the child and putative father.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>229 Va. 276, 280 (1985). This information is then used to derive the probability of paternity by use of Bayes\u2019 Theorem, a mathematical formula which describes the way newly discovered statistical information alters a previously established probability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Peterson, <em>supra </em>at 681. In most cases in which the putative father is not excluded by HLA testing, the estimated probability of paternity will be high, typically exceeding 90%. Terasaki, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We turn now to consideration of the issues raised on appeal. Statute 1954, c. 232, now G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A, is entitled, \u201cAn Act providing for blood grouping tests to aid in the determination of paternity.\u201d The statute is a so-called \u201cexclusionary\u201d blood test statute, that is, one permitting the introduction of blood test results only to exclude the possibility of paternity. The statute provides: \u201cIn any proceeding to determine the question of paternity, the court, on motion of the alleged father, shall order the mother, her child and the alleged father to submit to one or more blood grouping tests, to be made by a duly qualified physician or other duly qualified person, designated by the court, to determine whether or not the alleged father can be excluded as being the father of the child. <em>The results of such tests shall be admissible in evidence only in cases where definite exclusion of the alleged father as such father has been established. </em>If one of the parties refuses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>comply with the order of the court relative to such tests, such fact shall be admissible in evidence in such proceeding unless the court, for good cause, otherwise orders.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The statute refers specifically to \u201cblood grouping tests,\u201d terminology that has come to be associated with the red blood cell isoantigen tests of which those comprising the enhanced Landsteiner series are typical. The HLA system, however, is a tissue typing procedure. See, e.g., Ellman &amp; Kaye, Probabilities and Proof: Can HLA and Blood Group Testing Prove Paternity?, 54 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1131, 1139 (1979) (\u201cHLA testing can be thought of as tissue typing rather than blood group typing\u201d); Terasaki, <em>supra </em>at 543 (discussing the \u201cHLA system of tissue types\u201d). Thus, the Supreme Court of Ohio, construing a statute similar to G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A, held that HLA tests \u201care basically genetic comparison examinations, rather than blood grouping tests\u201d and are, therefore, not within the statutory proscription against admission of inculpatory blood grouping tests. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Bell, 6 </em>Ohio St. 3d 46, 53 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>We are convinced by our review of the case law from other jurisdictions as well as the available scientific and medicolegal commentary that the HLA system is not a blood grouping test, but is a tissue typing system. Assuming, however, that the statutory language is ambiguous,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we would be reluctant to ascribe to the Legislature by virtue of G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A, an intent to prohibit the introduction of evidence of paternity derived from a technique that was not in existence when the statute was enacted in 1954, long before the advent of HLA testing. At that time red blood cell isoantigen testing was prevalent, but was capable of disproving paternity only. Massachusetts, like many other States, enacted an exclusionary blood test statute to give effect to the scientific knowledge of the time. As the Supreme Court of Idaho stated, given a similar historical perspective, \u201cit would be illogical to conclude that by enacting [the Idaho Paternity Act], the legislature expressed an intent to bar the use of evidence obtainable through scientific techniques not then known to it.\u201d <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Crain, </em>104 Idaho 666, 671 (1983). Accord <em>Callison </em>v. <em>Callison, </em>687 P.2d 106, 110 (Okla. 1984); <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>615 P.2d 1228, 1233 (Utah 1980). In our view, therefore, G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A, does not govern the admissibility of inculpatory HLA tests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We turn now to consider the admissibility of inculpatory HLA tests as a matter of the common law rules of evidence. We stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stappen, </em>336 Mass. 174, 176 (1957), that, even in the absence of statutory authority, blood grouping test results which exclude the possibility of paternity are admissible, \u201cif otherwise competent.\u201d The court held that exclusionary blood tests satisfy this standard, noting that there is substantial authority to support the reliability of blood grouping tests to prove the impossibility of paternity. <em>Id. </em>at 176-177. See <em>Symonds </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>385 Mass. 540, 542 (1982). It follows that, in the absence of a statutory directive, inculpatory HLA test results should likewise be admissible if \u201cotherwise competent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">This court has adopted the standard of admissibility for scientific evidence articulated in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1923), wherein the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cJust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d Thus, we have said that \u201c[j]udicial acceptance of a scientific theory or instrument can occur only when it follows a general acceptance by the community of scientists involved. When supported by substantial authority establishing scientific reliability, this court has not hesitated to accept the benefits of science.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>346 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>266, 269 (1963).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. 421 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Because this case is before us, in effect, as an interlocutory appeal of a denial, without hearing, of a motion in limine, we do not have the benefit of expert testimony adduced at trial on which to make the requisite <em>Frye </em>determination. We may properly consider, however, the plethora of articles concerning HLA paternity testing, as well as the decisions by other courts addressing the issue now before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>388 Mass. 519, 527 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 431-439; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>367 Mass. 191, 198-199 (1975). On review of these authorities, we conclude that HLA testing has been accepted as a reliable method of proving paternity both in the scientific community and in the courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The American Medical Association, the American Association of Blood Banking, and the American Association of Histocompatibility have all approved HLA testing to determine paternity. See <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Shanholtz, </em>57 Md. App. 92, 100 (1984). Moreover, while there is some disagreement among medicolegal commentators as to how inculpatory HLA test results should be presented to the fact finder in paternity cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>nearly all agree that such evidence is reliable and should be admitted in one form or another. See, e.g., Ellman &amp; Kaye, Probabilities and Proof: Can HLA and Blood Group Testing Prove Paternity?, 54 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1131, 1161 (1979); Page-Bright, Proving Paternity \u2014 Human Leukocyte Antigen Test, 27 J. Forensic Sci. 135, 143, 150 (1982); Peterson, A Few Things You Should Know About Paternity Tests (But Were Afraid to Ask), 22 Santa Clara L. Rev. 667, 676 (1982); Lemmon &amp; Murphy, The Evidentiary Use of the HLA Blood Test in Virginia, 19 U. Rich. L. Rev. 235, 238-239 (1985). Finally, those courts in other jurisdictions that have determined the admissibility of inculpatory HLA test results by reference to <em>Frye </em>have concluded unanimously that such evidence is generally accepted as reliable in the scientific community.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Crain, supra </em>at 672; <em>Tice </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>7 Kan. App. 2d 509, 513 (1982); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth ex. rel. Kessinger, </em>652 S.W.2d 655, 661 (Ky. 1983); <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Shanholtz, supra </em>at 98; <em>Imms </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>654 S.W.2d 281, 284 (Mo. App. 1983); <em>Callison </em>v. <em>Callison, supra </em>at 111.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Although we conclude that HLA testing is generally accepted in the scientific community as a reliable means of determining paternity, and that inculpatory evidence derived from HLA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>testing is therefore admissible, we think it prudent to adopt the following limitations on the affirmative use of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">First, inculpatory HLA test results may not be presented to the jury expressed simply in the form of a probability of exclusion calculation, that is, as a stated percentage of the population of nonfathers who would have been excluded by the specific array of tests conducted. The probability of exclusion may be relevant to the issue of paternity as it tells the jury that the defendant falls within the relatively small per cent of the male population who could have fathered the child; however, \u201cit does nothing to distinguish the true father from the perhaps millions of men who fall into this group.\u201d Peterson, <em>supra </em>at 680. Furthermore, the jury are apt to confuse the probability of exclusion with the likelihood of paternity even though there is no direct relationship between the two. See notes 4 &amp; 5, <em>supra. </em>Thus, even if the probability of exclusion is considered relevant, \u201cthe potential for confusing and misleading the fact-finder is so great that the court should exclude it under its general power to exclude evidence which creates a substantial danger of prejudice, of confusing the issues, or misleading the fact-finder\u201d (footnote omitted). Peterson, <em>supra. </em>See Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 403. See also <em>State ex rel. Hausner </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>233 Kan. 223, 229 (1983) (probability of exclusion is not probative on the issue of paternity and its introduction is prejudicial); <em>Imms </em>v. <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 285 (probability of exclusion, unless in \u201cextreme range,\u201d is of little aid to jury in determining paternity issue); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>State, </em>476 N.E.2d 127, 137 (Ind. App. 1985) (probability of exclusion, without more, has been viewed as incomplete and misleading).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Second, we believe it preferable that the HLA test results be presented to the jury in terms of the probability of paternity,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>as that has been termed \u201cthe most accurate way of conveying the significance of the test data.\u201d Ellman &amp; Kaye, <em>supra </em>at 1146. It appears to be generally accepted in the scientific community that a statistically meaningful probability of paternity calculation can only be derived from a combination of HLA and red blood cell tests yielding a mean probability of exclusion of 90% or more. See Joint Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at 256-258; <em>Imms </em>v. <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 286. Accordingly, as a further limitation on the affirmative use of HLA evidence, we conclude that the jury may be presented with a statistical estimate of the putative father\u2019s likelihood of paternity only where the combined tests administered would exclude at least 90% of the nonfathers tested.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Third, we think it necessary to establish a minimum threshold for admissibility of probability of paternity estimates. The Joint Guidelines recommend that, if the blood test results show a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d of paternity, the evidence should be presented to the jury. This is to be determined by reference to a table in the Joint Guidelines matching various probabilities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>paternity with corresponding \u201cverbal predicates.\u201d Probabilities of paternity between 90% and 95% are said to make paternity \u201clikely,\u201d while those between 95% and 99% make it \u201cvery likely.\u201d Joint Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at 262, 282. Thus, we read the Joint Guidelines as recommending that probabilities of paternity below 95% be inadmissible. This accords with the view of many commentators. As one stated: \u201cThe significance of a \u2018high\u2019 probability of paternity is difficult to evaluate. It is clear that nonexcluded nonfathers can score comparatively high probabilities of paternity (since most nonfathers are excluded, the rest must of necessity \u2018fit\u2019 reasonably well). In one study, as many nonexcluded nonfathers scored over 88% as scored under 88%. On the average, fathers have higher probabilities of paternity than nonexcluded nonfathers (in the same study, the mean for fathers was 98.04%), so a paternity index must be rather high before it really differentiates the nonexcluded nonfathers from the (obviously nonexcluded) fathers. There is no general agreement in the scientific community that a probability below 95% has significance. Scientists generally agree that a probability greater than 95% ... is significant, so significance should be attached only to those probabilities exceeding 95%.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Peterson, A Few Things You Should Know About Paternity Tests (But Were Afraid to Ask), 22 Santa Clara L. Rev. 667, 707-708 (1982).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We agree, and require that inculpatory blood test evidence shall be admissible only if the probability of the putative father\u2019s paternity is 95% or greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Fourth, though admissible, inculpatory blood test evidence establishing a likelihood of paternity equal to or greater than 95% should not' be conclusive on the issue of paternity. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>merely some evidence of paternity which the jury must consider, along with all of the other evidence presented in mating their determination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Crain, supra </em>at 672-673; <em>Turek </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>312 Pa. Super. 158, 163 (1983); <em>South Carolina Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Bacot, </em>280 S.C. 485, 489 (1984). The jury are free, for example, to disbelieve that the putative father ever had intercourse with the mother, or that he had intercourse with her during the period of probable conception, despite the blood test evidence indicating a high likelihood of paternity. In such a case, the jury would be warranted in concluding that paternity had not been established. See, e.g., <em>Commissioner of Social Servs. of the County of Erie ex rel. Mannion </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>112 A.D.2d 724 (N.Y. 1985) (finding of nonpaternity affirmed despite a greater than 90% probability of paternity because Family Court judge was warranted in disbelieving mother\u2019s testimony). We emphasize that HLA evidence is but one factor for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Finally,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> inculpatory HLA blood test evidence shall be admissible only if a proper foundation is laid establishing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>proper testing procedures were employed in the particular case and that the expert witnesses through whom the evidence is sought to be introduced are qualified properly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, 456 (1978); <em>Tice </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>7 Kan. App. 2d 509, 513 (1982); <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>615 P.2d 1228, 1235 (Utah 1980). This determination is, of course, for the trial judge to make in the first instance as a threshold inquiry whenever inculpatory blood test results are sought to be introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The estimated probability of the defendant\u2019s paternity in the instant case is 98.2%, above the minimum threshold for admissibility established today. Although the record indicates that this figure was derived from HLA and red blood cell typings, it is not clear exactly what red blood cell tests were performed and whether the cumulative probability of exclusion for all the tests administered was at least 90%. Normally, we would remand the case to the trial judge to make this factual determination. However, we conclude that a remand is unnecessary in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Considerations of fairness dictate that the results of the blood tests sought to be introduced to prove the defendant\u2019s paternity be excluded. The defendant requested that the HLA blood test be performed pursuant to G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12 A, citing the statute in his motion to the judge. It was clearly his belief that, under the terms of this statute, the results of the test would be admissible only if exculpatory. No judicial decision had given him cause to assume otherwise.

As to the Fourth Amendment, the Court noted that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant for the crime charged, and stated that the extraction of blood is a commonplace procedure involving virtually no risk, trauma, or pain. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 771. With regard to the Fifth Amendment claim, the Court held that the privilege against self-incrimination only protects against testimonial compulsion and does not extend to compulsory blood testing, because blood-testing evidence is physical in nature rather than testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">HLA and red blood cell testing procedures are no more intrusive or testimonial than those at issue in <em>Schmerber. </em>In addition, probable cause to believe that the test results will be inculpatory exists when a complaint is issued on probable cause, as in the instant case, charging a putative father with paternity. Consequently, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments provide no grounds for prohibiting court-ordered HLA and red blood cell testing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Meacham, </em>93 Wash. 735 (1980) (court rejected right to privacy and Fourth Amendment challenges to court-ordered HLA testing); <em>Albany County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. ex rel.

L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A. Exclusionary results relevant at common law (see <em>supra </em>at 222 &amp; note 20) may, however, be admitted. Further, we conclude that HLA testing is accepted generally in the scientific community as a reliable procedure for proving or excluding paternity. On offer of the prosecution, statistical evidence of the accused\u2019s probability of paternity shall be admissible provided the HLA test on which the calculation was derived, either alone or in conjunction with whatever standard red isoantigen tests were performed, yields a cumulative probability of exculsion of 90% or greater, and provided further that no evidence of probability of paternity under 95% shall be admissible. Such inculpatory evidence is not conclusive on the issue of paternity, and its admission is subject to normal foundational requirements for the admission of scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The inculpatory HLA test results sought to be introduced in the instant case shall be excluded, and the defendant may not be compelled to undergo additional blood tests. After the date of this opinion, an alleged father (as well as the mother and child) may be required to submit to such test procedures (see <em>supra </em>222, 223). Trial on the paternity charge is to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\"> The basis for the judge\u2019s denial is not apparent from the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> Rule 15 (b) (2) provides that either a defendant or the Commonwealth has the right to apply to a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court for leave to appeal disposition by a lower court of a motion to suppress evidence prior to trial.

Consequently, absent a determination by the judge that there is other evidence which would warrant a jury\u2019s finding of intercourse during the period of probable conception, such HLA test results should be excluded. Additionally, the judge should instruct the jury, if he is so requested, that they may not consider HLA test results as evidence of intercourse, and that they may not consider such evidence of paternity unless they have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that sexual intercourse at or about the time of conception had taken place between the mother and the alleged father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> There has been criticism of the probability of paternity statistic because it is based on a preliminary assumption of a 50% likelihood of the accused\u2019s paternity.

Consequently, the ultimate probability of paternity estimate is only correct in those few cases in which the fact finder believes initially that the probability of paternity is exactly 50%. <em>Id. </em>at 684-686. Thus, various proposals have been advanced so that the jury might be enabled to determine the probability of paternity based on their own initial assessment, on consideration of the soft evidence, of the prior odds of paternity. See, e.g., Ellman &amp; Kaye, Probabilities and Proof: Can HLA and Blood Group Testing Prove Paternity?, 54 N.Y.U.L.

While we acknowledge the basic flaw in the probability of paternity calculation, we reject these alternative proposals as unduly complicated. In our view, they present an even greater likelihood that the paternity adjudication will degenerate into a trial by mathematics than if a single probability of paternity estimate is introduced.

I conclude, however, differently from the court, that, because the probability of paternity yielded by a statistical analysis employing HLA test results is premised on an assumption that that intercourse occurred, the test results should not be admitted in evidence unless that assumed fact is first established by a finding made by the trier of fact.

The Commonwealth has the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s involvement beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lobo, </em>385 Mass. 436, 445 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613, 619 n.5 (1975). It cannot be said reasonably and with confidence that an expert\u2019s testimony that the probability of the defendant\u2019s paternity is 95% will not be misused by the fact finder to resolve the credibility issue in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor. Even if an assumption be gratuitously made that the expert\u2019s testimony will be fairly and clearly given and skillfully tested on cross-examination, the danger that the fact finder will be moved to decide between the conflicting claims on the basis of the expert\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cfits the mold\u201d is inescapable. The portion of Peterson\u2019s article quoted in n. 1 of my opinion supports that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The court recognizes the risk of which I speak, but, in my view, does not adequately appreciate or deal with it. The court counters the risk by requiring the judge, if requested in a jury case, to instruct the jury not to consider HLA test results as evidence of intercourse, and not to consider that evidence \u201cunless they have found . . . that sexual intercourse at or about the time of conception had taken place between the mother and the alleged father.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 220 n. 18. Because the interests at risk are so substantial, the incidence of risk is so high, and a way to avoid the-risk is so simple, I am not content to meet the risk by simply requiring jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cThe naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury ... all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.\u201d <em>Krulewitch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 453 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring) (citation omitted). See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135 (1968) (\u201c[T]here are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 681-682 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is reasonable for us to be confident that in most cases limiting instructions accomplish their intended purpose. Nevertheless, in cases . . . where the evidence subject to limitations has an extremely high potential for unfair prejudice, we have a duty to be skeptical as to the effectiveness of limiting instructions .... The reasoning of the <em>Bruton </em>case is highly relevant. . . since that case recognized the futility, even the absurdity, of expecting a jury in some circumstances to conform to limiting instructions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Because of the futility in expecting triers of fact, especially juries, to comply with an instruction to ignore the probability of paternity factor based on HLA testing in determining whether the defendant had intercourse with the mother at or about the time of conception, I would hold that HLA based probability of paternity estimates are inadmissible except in the second segment of a bifurcated trial following a finding on that critical issue by the judge or the jury. After an affirmative finding, and within the limitations expressed by the court, <em>ante </em>at 217-221, I would hold the evidence to be admissible to show the probability that the defendant is the father of the child. Obviously, then, if the court were to accept my reasoning, the utility of HLA-based probability paternity estimates would be quite limited. Such evidence not only would be inadmissible in the absence of the above finding, but it would be superfluous in any case in which the fact finder (perhaps the jury in response to a special question) finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the only one to have had intercourse with the mother at a relevant time. The test results would have value only in those cases in which it is open to the defendant to contend that, even though his act could have resulted in the conception, another man or other men, perhaps unidentified, also had sexual relations with the mother at a relevant time. It is at that time, and only then, that a probability of paternity estimate meeting the requirements articulated by the court is highly probative without being unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-5\"> \u201cIn a paternity trial, a fact-finder is naturally tempted to seize upon statistical figures, like the paternity index or the probability of paternity, as lifelines of objective truth in a sea of prevarication. \u2018Soft\u2019 evidence involving difficult questions of credibility and other circumstantial matters may be submerged or lost because it appears unnecessary to resolve the questions in light of the hard, scientific, mathematical proof. Under these circumstances it is absolutely essential that the significance of the mathematical proof be clearly understood by both counsel and the fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cThe paternity index, and the probability based upon it, can be easily misused. Returning to the example of the man with a paternity index of 19 (probability = 95%), it is clear that in a large population many men will have a phenotype compatible with fathering the child. If only one man in a thousand were to have the proper phenotype, there would be 1,000 men who could have fathered the child in an urban population containing only one million men. Bayes\u2019 Theorem cannot tell us which of these 1,000 men is the father. The most that the blood group evidence can tell us is that, assuming paternity is limited to the men in this city and the defendant is one of them, his probability of paternity is only one in a thousand, or. 1 %.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201cThe reason for this apparent discrepancy between the relative probability of 95% and the actual probability of .1% is clear if we again consider Bayes\u2019 Theorem. The Theorem only tells us how to modify the prior odds of paternity in light of the new blood test evidence. The Theorem can do nothing to tell us what those prior odds are. Without the prior odds as a multiplier, Bayes\u2019 Theorem is virtually useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u201cThe paternity index merely represents the relative likelihood that a man with the phenotype of the accused father would contribute the required genes compared with the likelihood that a random man of the same ethnic group would do so. In order to convert this figure into the actual probability of paternity, we must also know the probability that the accused father had intercourse at the right time, and the probability that a random man did likewise. If the accused had no intercourse, then, regardless of his index, his probability of paternity is zero. If the accused is the only man to have had intercourse then, regardless of his index, his probability of paternity is 100%. The paternity index equals the odds of paternity only if it is assumed that the prior odds of paternity are 1:1 (or the accused is already 50% likely to be the father). <em>In other words, before the paternity index accurately represents the odds of paternity, one must assume that the defendant had intercourse with the mother and that a random man (whom we shall call Mr. X) also had intercourse with her. In addition, the calculation assumes that both had intercourse at a time, and under circumstances, in terms of timing, fertility, frequency of coition, and use of birth control, making them </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>both equally likely to have fathered the child. If these assumptions are true, then, and only then, does Bayes\u2019 Theorem accurately reflect the odds that the accused is the father.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201cSince there is no way to calculate the prior odds of paternity, they must be inferred from the \u2018soft\u2019 evidence \u2014 the testimony of witnesses, circumstantial evidence, admissions and all of the other evidence which the fact-finder may prefer to ignore in favor of the \u2018scientific proof.\u2019 <em>Until the fact-finder, disregarding the paternity index, is persuaded that the above assumptions are true, use of Bayes\u2019 Theorem will yield a false result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u201cTime and again, courts, commentators, and possibly even experts have disregarded the importance of the soft evidence and jumped hastily to the conclusion that the paternity index represents the actual odds of paternity. As a practical matter it may well be that justice is usually done because the soft evidence would justify the conclusion that the above assumptions are satisfied. The danger is that the habit of incorrectly applying these statistics will mesmerize fact-finders to such an extent that the statistics will be improperly used in cases where the soft evidence is tmly weak.\u201d (Emphasis added.)
