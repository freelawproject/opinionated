In 1984, the defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief, claiming that he had been placed twice in jeopardy contrary to his rights under the United States Constitution and Massachusetts common law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>this motion, on the ground that the defendant had waived his double jeopardy claim. The defendant appealed. A panel of the Appeals Court reported the case to this court for determination pursuant to G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 12 (1984 ed.). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 588 (1985). We affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">A comprehensive description of the labyrinthian procedural history of this case is necessary to a full understanding of the waiver issue. Deeran was indicted by a Suffolk County grand jury in 1970 on charges of murder in the first degree and unlawfully carrying a firearm. Beginning on June 8, 1971, Deeran was tried before a jury in the Superior Court. After deliberating for eight hours, the jury were unable to reach a verdict. The judge, acting sua sponte, declared a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to this declaration of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">At a second trial before a jury in 1972, Deeran was convicted of murder in the second degree and unlawfully carrying a firearm. Deeran appealed, but did not raise the issue of double jeopardy. We affirmed his convictions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>364 Mass. 193 (1973), after reviewing the whole case, on both the law and the evidence, pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1962, c. 453. For a summary of the evidence presented at trial, and the issues raised on appeal, see <em>id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In 1975, Deeran filed a petition for writ of error, alleging for the first time that his double jeopardy rights had been violated. Deeran also claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, due to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the judge\u2019s declaration of a mistrial. In 1976, a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court denied Deeran\u2019s petition for writ of error. The single justice ruled that Deeran was barred from raising the double jeopardy claim, due to his failure to object to the mistrial either at the time it was declared, or prior to the second trial. The single justice also ruled that Deeran was not denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>effective assistance of counsel, because his lawyer\u2019s failure to object to the mistrial may have been a \u201ctactical choice.\u201d Finally, the single justice determined that there was no \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d apparent from the record. Deeran did not appeal the single justice\u2019s denial of his petition to the full bench of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In 1976, Deeran filed pro se a motion for a new trial. Deeran again raised the issues of double jeopardy and ineffective assistance of counsel. However, before a determination on the motion was rendered, Deeran sought leave to withdraw the motion without prejudice, on the ground that these issues \u201cwere resolved\u201d by the single justice. The defendant was allowed to withdraw the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In 1979, Deeran filed yet another motion for a new trial. In this motion, Deeran alleged that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on self-defense and provocation were constitutionally deficient. The motion was denied. The Appeals Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s denial of Deeran\u2019s motion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 646 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Undaunted, Deeran in 1981 filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court, once again claiming that his double jeopardy rights had been violated. In 1982, Deeran\u2019s petition was dismissed on the ground that he had failed to exhaust State remedies. <em>Deeran </em>v. <em>Ponte, </em>No. 81-2527-G (D. Mass. Dec. 29, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Deeran then filed the present motion in the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, 378 Mass. 900 (1979). After a hearing, the motion judge ruled that Deeran had waived his double jeopardy claim by failing to assert it in his 1979 motion for a new trial. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2). The judge declined to exercise his discretion under rule 30 (c) (2) to entertain the claim, on the ground that the double jeopardy issue was \u201cknown\u201d to the defendant prior to his 1979 motion, and therefore should not be \u201cresurrected\u201d on the defendant\u2019s third appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Deeran\u2019s motion for postconviction relief. Massachusetts R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) provides as follows: \u201cAll grounds for relief claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>by a defendant under . . . this rule shall be raised by the defendant in his original or amended motion. Any grounds not so raised are waived unless the judge in his discretion permits them to be raised in a subsequent motion, or unless such grounds could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended motion.\u201d Under this rule, a defendant must assert all reasonably available grounds for postconviction relief in his first rule 30 motion, or those claims are lost. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 366-367 (1981). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wooldridge, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 169 (1985) (no waiver where issue could not reasonably have been raised in first motion). This waiver rule applies equally to constitutional claims which could have been raised, but were not raised, in the defendant\u2019s original motion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291, 297 (1982) (constitutional challenge to sentences waived where not asserted in prior postconviction motion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1984) (postconviction claims of involuntary plea and ineffective assistance of counsel waived where not asserted in prior motion). Because Deeran failed to assert the double jeopardy issue in his 1979 motion for a new trial, he properly is deemed to have waived the claim under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Although Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) empowers a motion judge, in his discretion, to hear the merits of a petitioner\u2019s postconviction claim despite a finding of waiver, the judge in this case properly declined to do so. The judge cited the following factors influencing his decision not to entertain the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>jeopardy claim: Deeran clearly understood the significance of the double jeopardy issue prior to his 1979 motion for a new trial; Deeran was represented by counsel of his choice at all relevant times since 1976; Deeran\u2019s failure to raise the double jeopardy claim in 1979 suggests that it was \u201cnot thought to be critical\u201d; and, considerations of judicial administration warrant \u201crequiring defendants to assert all known constitutional claims in a timely and unified manner.\u201d We conclude that the judge\u2019s refusal to overlook Deeran\u2019s waiver was an appropriate exercise of the discretion vested in him by Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 984 (1984) (motion judge did not act arbitrarily or improperly in refusing to reach issues raised in second motion for new trial). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 229 (1973) (motion judge acted within his discretion in refusing to consider issues not objected to at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Our conclusion that the judge appropriately exercised his discretion based upon a waiver in the 1979 proceedings is bolstered by the events of 1973 and 1976. These several proceedings, singly or in combination, could be said to constitute a waiver of the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy assertion. In 1973, Deeran failed to assert his double jeopardy claim during this court\u2019s plenary review of his convictions on direct appeal. In 1976, a single justice of this court ruled that the defendant was barred from raising the double jeopardy claim in a petition for writ of error, and Deeran failed to appeal this decision to the full bench. And again in 1976, Deeran filed a motion for \u201cnew trial\u201d on the ground of double jeopardy, but subsequently withdrew this motion, stating that he realized the single justice had \u201cresolved\u201d the issue earlier in 1976. All of these prior proceedings were before the motion judge, and it is appropriate for us to consider them in determining whether he properly concluded that the 1979 events constituted a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Deeran argues that he cannot be deemed to have waived his double jeopardy claim under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) in the absence of a \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d waiver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Johnson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 507 (1985) (court will indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 53 (1976). Deeran argues that mere silence on his part in failing to assert the double jeopardy claim in 1979 does not constitute an \u201cintentional\u201d relinquishment of a constitutional right. <em>Zerbst, supra. </em>Yet Deeran fundamentally misperceives the waiver at issue in this case. Deeran\u2019s waiver under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) constitutes a procedural waiver of his right to assert a constitutional <em>claim </em>in a postconviction motion. The \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d standard of <em>Zerbst </em>applies only to a defendant\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to the actual relinquishment of the constitutional <em>right. Id. </em>at 468 (whether defendant knowingly consented to lack of representation). In this case, Deeran\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to being placed twice in jeopardy occurred, if at all, when he stood silent at the time of his retrial in 1972. Yet the motion judge\u2019s finding of waiver, and our affirmation thereof, are not based on Deeran\u2019s failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to the declaration of mistrial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>on his failure to assert the double jeopardy claim in his 1979 motion. The procedural waiver of a claim, as opposed to a defendant\u2019s express or implied consent to the loss of a substantive constitutional right, need not be \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cintelligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Ironically, Deeran urges us to put an end to the \u201cseemingly endless series\u201d of postconviction motions, and finally to reach the merits of his \u201ccompelling\u201d double jeopardy claim. The waiver provisions of Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) were designed to achieve \u201cfinality of convictions,\u201d and to eliminate \u201cpiecemeal litigation. . . whose only purpose is to vex, harass, or delay.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 484 (1979), quoting <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 18 (1963). The very purpose of the rule is to curtail successive and vexatious postconviction proceedings initiated by dissatisfied defendants who have already obtained review of their convictions on direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291, 297-298 (1982). It is neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome to require a defendant such as Deeran to assert all known constitutional claims in his first motion for postconviction relief. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 366 (1981). \u201cAny other practice would unfairly consume public resources without any corresponding benefit to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The waiver provision of Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) reflects the State\u2019s valid interest in seeking a visible end to the criminal process. \u201cThere must be a reasonable moment for a judgment to become final and a time beyond which further challenges must be barred.\u201d <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 398, 403 (1980). That time has passed for Deeran, who waived his double jeopardy claim by failing to assert it in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The order of the Superior Court denying the defendant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-15\"> Although the motion is at times referred to as a motion for a \u201cnew trial,\u201d it is clear that the relief the defendant seeks is dismissal of the indictments on the ground of double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> The judge\u2019s declaration of mistrial occurred shortly after midnight on Saturday morning, June 16. The judge stated that he feared lengthy or overnight deliberations might coerce those jurors espousing a minority view to surrender their positions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> Deeran\u2019s 1979 motion for a new trial is properly governed by the waiver provisions of Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2), even though the motion was filed prior to the effective date of the rule. Deeran filed his first motion for a new trial, in which he failed to raise the double jeopardy claim, on February 21, 1979. The rules of criminal procedure, although adopted by the Justices of this court on October 19, 1978, were not given effect until July 1, 1979. 378 Mass. 842 (1979). However, no action was taken on Deeran\u2019s motion until November, 1979. The 1979 motion was thus a case \u201cin progress\u201d within the meaning of Mass. R. Crim. P. 1A (7), 378 Mass. 843 (1979), which provides that pending matters should be governed, in so far as \u201cfeasible,\u201d by the new rules. The judge acted within his discretion in finding a waiver under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2) based on Deeran\u2019s failure to raise the double jeopardy issue in his 1979 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> Deeran also argues in his brief that, if he is deemed to have waived his double jeopardy claim, then he has been denied his right to the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to raise the claim in the 1979 motion for new trial. This issue is not properly before us on appeal because Deeran did not raise it below in his motion for postconviction relief. We pause only to note that, because a defendant does not have a constitutional right to the representation of counsel on a motion for a new trial, or a right under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (5) (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, </em>388 Mass. 255, 258-264 [1983]), there can be no viable claim that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness deprived him of this \u201cright.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\"> Because we conclude that Deeran waived his double jeopardy claim by failing to assert it in his 1979 motion for a new trial, we need not decide whether his failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to the trial judge\u2019s declaration of mistrial constituted an effective waiver of his double jeopardy rights. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d 1335, 1365 (11th Cir. 1984) (waiver of double jeopardy claim where defense counsel failed to lodge an objection prior to the completion of the second trial); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Milhim, </em>702 F.2d 522, 524 (5th Cir. 1983) (same); <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>698 F.2d 589, 592 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 835 (1983) (same). But see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Broce, </em>753 F.2d 811, 822 (10th Cir. 1985) (no waiver of double jeopardy rights in absence of \u201cinformed and intentional\u201d waiver); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>620 F.2d 683, 687 (8th Cir. 1980) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young, </em>503 F.2d 1072, 1075 (3d Cir. 1974) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
