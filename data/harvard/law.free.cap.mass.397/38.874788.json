In October, 1982, the plaintiff, an accident victim, commenced this action for declaratory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, seeking a favorable interpretation of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. After the parties submitted a statement of agreed facts, a judge in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Superior Court reported the case to the Appeals Court, without decision, in accordance with Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111. This court granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The parties are in agreement as to the following facts. In November, 1981, the plaintiff, John F. Manning, was seriously injured when the automobile he was driving was struck by another automobile registered to Conceptual Design Corp. (the tortfeasor). The tortfeasor\u2019s automobile was covered by a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant, Fireman\u2019s Fund American Insurance Companies (Fireman\u2019s). In July, 1982, Fireman\u2019s paid Manning $100,000, the maximum benefits provided under the tortfeasor\u2019s \u201cbodily injury to others\u201d and \u201coptional bodily injury to others\u201d coverage. In addition, Manning\u2019s insurer, Peerless Insurance Company (Peerless), paid Manning $20,000, the maximum underinsured motorist benefit available under his policy. For purposes of this appeal the parties do not dispute Manning\u2019s claim that his damages exceeded the $120,000 he has collected to date from Fireman\u2019s and Peerless. Part 7 of the tortfeasor\u2019s Fireman\u2019s policy, \u201cBodily Injury Caused By An Underinsured Auto,\u201d however, also provides for a maximum of $100,000 in under-insured motorist benefits. Manning made a claim for this $100,000, and Fireman\u2019s denied liability. In doing so, Fireman\u2019s cited part 7, third par., item 3, of its policy, maintaining that the clause \u201c[did] not apply to Mr. Manning under the facts of this accident.\u201d That clause provides in relevant part: \u201cWe will pay damages to or for: ... 3. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of injury to a person covered under this Part.\u201d Manning contends that, as a victim who has exhausted his own underinsured motorist coverage, as well as the limits of the bodily injury coverage available under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, he is entitled to benefits under the tortfeasor\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. He claims that the fair meaning of the language used in part 7 of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy so provides, and that, in any event, the language and intent of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 532, effective January 1,1981 (making underinsured motorist coverage mandatory), compels this result. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Part 7 provides in pertinent part:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is underinsured. Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily injury to people injured or killed as a result of certain accidents caused by someone who does not have enough insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cWe will only pay if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the underinsured auto. We consider an auto to be underinsured if the insurance covering the auto or operator is not sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the injured person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cWe will pay damages to or for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201c1. You or any household member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\u201c2. Anyone occupying your auto with your consent at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u201c3. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of injury to a person covered under this Part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">We must construe the words of the policy according to \u201cthe fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter,\u201d <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984), quoting <em>Save-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 226 (1971), as long as the statutory language or legislative policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, is not contravened. <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453-454 (1985), and cases cited. This is true whether the language of a standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy is considered ambiguous, <em>Bilodeau v. Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., supra, </em>or explicit. <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra. </em>Manning argues that, since he has suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>bodily injury as a result of an automobile accident caused by Fireman\u2019s insured, and since his damages exceed the bodily injury limits of the Fireman\u2019s policy, he comes within the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of part 7, first par. and third par., item 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The interpretation relied upon by Manning is not a reasonable one. Underinsured motorist protection \u201cis limited personal accident insurance chiefly for the benefit of the <em>named insured\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra </em>at 452, quoting <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bittler, </em>14 Ohio Misc. 23, 32-33 (1968). See 12A M.S. Rhodes, Couch\u2019s Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 45:649, at 202, \u00a7 45:620, at 17 (2d ed. rev. 1981). To read underinsurance provisions in the manner urged by Manning would effectively convert a form of coverage which is distinct from automobile liability insurance, see <em>Cardin, supra, </em>to additional liability coverage. See <em>Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 45:620, at 17-18 (underinsurance coverage is \u201cnot an additional liability coverage, but rather is direct compensation to the insured who is injured\u201d). This we decline to do. Moreover, the language of part 7 of the Fireman\u2019s policy is unambiguous. Benefits for victims such as Manning are plainly not provided under the tortfeasor\u2019s own underinsured motorist coverage. Paragraph 3 is the only portion of part 7 which identifies the individuals for whom the carrier will pay underinsurance benefits. Item 1 lists the insured<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and members of the insured\u2019s household, and item 2 specifies persons occupying the insured\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> automobile with the insured\u2019s consent at the time of the accident. Item 3 provides benefits for \u201c[a]nyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover <em>because of injury to a person covered under this Parr </em>(emphasis added). It is evident that the only persons \u201ccovered under this Part\u201d are those identified in items 1 and 2. \u201cAnyone else\u201d in item 3, therefore, obviously refers to those individuals, such as administrators or conservators, who have claims deriving from bodily injuries incurred by the insured, a member of his household, or anyone occupying the vehicle with the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>sent of the insured. Manning, as the accident victim, is not entitled to recover under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy because of an injury to such a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Neither the legislative policy nor the statutory language of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, suggests a contrary interpretation. Nowhere has the Legislature indicated that by mandating under-insured motorist coverage it intended to convert limited personal accident insurance for the benefit of the insured into additional liability insurance. The statute does, however, suggest that the term is used in the traditional sense which we adopt. See, e.g., G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2) and (3) (1984 ed.), which, in effect, extends uninsured motorist benefits<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to an insured \u201cwhere the <em>liability insurer </em>of the <em>tort-feasor </em>has been declared to be insolvent ...\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We remand this case to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment declaring that the plaintiff may not recover under-insured motorist benefits under the Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant to Conceptual Design Corp., as a result of injuries sustained by the plaintiff in November, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\"> The language we quote in the text is from the Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy, Second Edition (issued in 1979), which was in effect at the time of Manning\u2019s accident in November, 1981. Underinsurance coverage became mandatory as of January 1, 1981, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, yet, according to the plaintiff\u2019s brief, the Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy, Third Edition, was not effective until January 1, 1983. Although there are semantic differences in the equivalent section of the Third Edition, the new wording does not affect the issue presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> \u201cYou\u201d is defined in the definitions section as \u201cthe person named on the Coverage Selections page.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> The definition of \u201cyour\u201d is identical to that of \u201cyou.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\"> In 1981, the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle coverages\u201d was expanded to include underinsured motorists.
