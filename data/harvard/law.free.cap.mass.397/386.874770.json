The plaintiff is the mother of two minor children. In 1983, she was receiving a grant from the department. See G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2(1984ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">To qualify for AFDC, an applicant must meet the categorical and financial eligibility requirements established by the department. See <em>Civetti </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>392 Mass. 474, 476 n.4 (1984). See also 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.000, 324 Mass. Reg. 20-32 (Aug. 12, 1982). Financial eligibility is determined by the application of two tests. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.260. Under the first test, as it was applied to the plaintiff, the total income of the \u201cassistance unit\u201d (family), excluding noncountable income, see 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.250, 324Mass. Reg. 34-35 (Aug. 5,1982), could not exceed 150% of the established \u201cneed standard.\u201d The standard of need in Massachusetts is determined in part on the basis of the cost of food, rent, fuel, utilities, and other necessities. <em>See ABCD, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>378 Mass. 327, 331 n.9 (1979). In April, 1983, the need standard for a family of three was set at $398.20. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.410 (1982) (table of need standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In January, 1983, the plaintiff had a gross monthly income of $423.80. Since this amount did not exceed 150% of the existing need standard,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff satisfied the first test. After applying the second test of financial eligibility, see 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.260(B), it was determined that the plaintiff and her two children were eligible for a grant in the total amount of $150.65.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 106 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00a7 304.500 (1982). The plaintiff\u2019s family received this grant during the early months of 1983. On March 12, 1983, the plaintiff lost her job. Her only income, therefore, was the AFDC grant. The plaintiff promptly reported her changed circumstances to the department and requested that her grant be increased to $379.20, the maximum AFDC amount then payable to a family of three. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.420 (1982) (table of payment standards). The department refused to adjust or to supplement the plaintiff\u2019s grant for March. The plaintiff was informed that because of the department\u2019s \u201cretrospective budgeting,\u201d see <em>infra, </em>her grant could not be increased until May, 1983. On March 31, 1983, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the department. A hearing was held on April 11, 1983. On April 25, 1983, the hearing referee ruled that \u201c[t]he denial by the Department to issue a supplementary payment [was] correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">On May 25, 1983, the plaintiff filed this action in the Superior Court seeking review of the department\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1984 ed.). The plaintiff also sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On August 8, 1983, the plaintiff filed a motion pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974), seeking to certify as a class all \u201crecipients of AFDC who have been, are being or will be subjected to the defendant\u2019s practice of refusing to supplement the monthly AFDC grants of recipients whose incomes have decreased since the Department determined the amount of benefits to which they were entitled.\u201d The plaintiff also filed a motion for summary judgment. See Mass. R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>P. 56 (a), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The department filed a cross motion for summary judgment on August 23, 1983. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On July 18, 1984, the judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In his judgment, the judge (1) certified the class; (2) issued a declaration pursuant to G. L. c. 231A (1984 ed.), stating that the department\u2019s refusal to supplement AFDC grants violated G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2; (3) permanently enjoined the department from refusing to supplement the AFDC grants of recipients whose incomes decrease after the department has determined the amount of aid to which they are entitled; (4) ordered the department to pay money owed as a result of the department\u2019s failure to supplement AFDC grants; and (5) awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party. We granted the department\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>The AFDC program. </em>AFDC is a joint Federal and State welfare program that originated as part of the Social Security Act of 1935. State participation in the program is voluntary. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 316 (1968). However, if a State elects to participate, it must comply with Federal requirements \u201cas a pre-condition to [receiving] reimbursement by the Federal government of a percentage ... of the payment made to AFDC recipients.\u201d <em>ABCD, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 331. See generally Lupu, Welfare and Federalism: AFDC Eligibility Policies and the Scope of State Discretion, 57 B.U.L. Rev. 1, 1-3 (1977). The Commonwealth has participated in the AFDC program for the past fifty years. See St. 1936, c. 413, \u00a7 1. At the present time, the Federal government reimburses the Commonwealth for approximately 50% of the payments made to AFDC recipients. See <em>Civetti </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 476 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In 1981, Congress enacted the \u201cOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981\u201d (OBRA), Pub. L. No. 97-35, reprinted in 1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 357. Sections 2301 through 2321 of OBRA legislated major changes in the Federal AFDC program. See <em>Philadelphia Citizens in Action </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>527 F. Supp. 182, 185 (E.D. Pa. 1981), rev\u2019d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>on other grounds, 669 F.2d 877 (2d Cir. 1982). Of significance to this case is the change effectuated by \u00a7 2315(a), which requires States to use a system of prospective budgeting to determine whether a family is eligible for AFDC, and a system of retrospective budgeting to determine the amount of such aid after eligibility has been established. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (13) (1982); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.31(a) (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In October, 1982, the department adopted regulations to implement the changes mandated by Congress. See, e.g., 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 302.900-302.920, 332 Mass. Reg. 2-3 (Oct. 7, 1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Under the prospective budgeting system, the State agency administering the AFDC program determines eligibility (and the amount of the grant for month one) based upon an <em>estimate </em>of the income and circumstances that will exist during the application month. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.31(b)(1) (1985). With retrospective budgeting, however, the agency determines the amount of assistance a family will receive in a subsequent month based upon the <em>actual </em>income or circumstances that existed in a previous month. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.31(b)(2) (1985). For example, in the plaintiff\u2019s case, she was required to report her January, 1983, earnings of $423.80 to the department in February, 1983. Under retrospective budgeting, January is denoted as the \u201cbudget month.\u201d See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 302.910; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.32(b)(3) (1985). The department would then use the plaintiff\u2019s actual budget month earnings to determine the amount of aid she and her family should receive during the \u201cpayment month\u201d of March, 1983. See 106 Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 302.900, 302.910(F); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.31 (b)(4) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">As the plaintiff correctly points out, a problem arises with retrospective budgeting when the AFDC recipient does not actually earn the money in the payment month that was taken into consideration by the department when it determined the amount of the grant that should be paid to the recipient. As a result of this occurrence, the recipient has less money for that payment month than anticipated by the department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff does not, however, dispute that the department was required to adopt retrospective budgeting procedures. Rather, the plaintiff argues that to comply with G.L.c. 118, \u00a7 2, the department must supplement the AFDC grant of a recipient who suffers a loss of income in the payment month. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In relevant part, G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2, provides that the aid furnished to an AFDC recipient \u201cshall be in an amount to be determined in accordance with the budgetary standards of the Department, and shall be granted from the date of application therefore. Such assistance shall be paid . . . semimonthly in advance unless the applicant prefers less frequent payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The thrust of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that payment \u201cin advance\u201d means payment in advance of need, and thus an AFDC recipient should not be required to wait to receive an increase in aid in those circumstances where there is a loss of income in the payment month. We are not unsympathetic to the financial plight of a person in the plaintiff\u2019s position. Nevertheless, G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2, specifically provides that the \u201camount\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>assistance a recipient is entitled to receive is to be determined \u201cin accordance with [the] budgetary standards of the department.\u201d We have consistently recognized that an agency \u201chas considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979). This principle, however, is \u201cone of deference, not abdication,\u201d and this court will not hesitate to overrule agency interpretations of statutes when those interpretations are unreasonable. See <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489, 498 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In the circumstances of this case, the department\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2, is not unreasonable. The plaintiff has pointed to no language in the statute that would mandate the supplemental payments ordered by the Superior Court. The amount of aid the plaintiff was to receive during March and April, 1983, was determined based on the department\u2019s retrospective budgeting standards. The amount of aid to be received is a matter which the statute clearly leaves to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The fortuity that the grant received by an AFDC family might not reflect the actual needs of the family during the payment month was not unforeseen by Congress. In 1982, Congress enacted Pub. L. 97-248, \u00a7 157(a), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 603(a) (1982). Under this statute, a State may supplement an AFDC grant to reflect a family\u2019s current or anticipated needs. Although the Federal government will not reimburse a State for such a supplement, the amount awarded by the State will not be considered as income for purposes of determining the amount of the family\u2019s grant in a succeeding month. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">However, it was not until 1985 that the Massachusetts Legislature provided appropriations for a supplemental payment to families that have suffered a \u201creduction in [AFDC] benefits due to their loss of earned income and participation in retrospective budgeting.\u201d St. 1985, c. 140, \u00a7 2, line item 4403-2000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree that G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2, otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>requires the department to provide supplemental AFDC payments to families who have suffered a loss of earned income. Even though the plaintiff was to receive less money than indicated by 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.420 (1985), she was still receiving this money \u201cin advance\u201d and in an amount calculated according to the department\u2019s budgeting standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> One hundred and fifty per cent of the need standard for a family of three was $597.30 in April, 1983. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304.400 (1982) (table of eligibility standards).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\"> The plaintiff received a cash grant of $87.65 and a recoupment vendor payment of $63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\"> The plaintiff requested the Superior Court to declare that the department\u2019s refusal to supplement AFDC grants constituted a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, post </em>394, 398-400 (1986). The plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees was based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The judge did not reach the issue whether the department\u2019s conduct violated either the Federal or State Constitution. Nevertheless, the judge awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees based on his ruling that the plaintiff was the prevailing party. Since we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, see <em>infra, </em>the plaintiff is not the prevailing party, and, therefore, not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> In relevant part, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.31(a) (1985) provides: \u201cA State plan for AFDC shall specify that all factors of eligibility shall be determined prospectively and the amount of the assistance . . . shall be determined using retrospective budgeting . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\"> The regulations adopted provide: \u201cThe Department shall establish initial eligibility prospectively based on its best estimate of income and circumstances which will exist in the first cyclical month and the cyclical month immediately following.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u201cAfter the first two (2) cyclical months in which benefits have been paid, the grant amount shall be determined retrospectively based on information received on the corresponding budget month.\" 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 302.920(A), (B) (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> A different problem occurs under prospective budgeting. With prospective budgeting, the amount of the grant that will be paid during a given month is based on an estimate of the income and circumstances that will exist in that particular payment month. Thus, overpayments result when the amount of a recipient\u2019s grant is based on a low estimated income for that particular month, and the recipient actually earns more money than the department anticipated. The legislative history of OBRA indicates that retrospective budgeting was implemented in part to correct the high percentage of payment errors existing under the prospective budgeting system. See S. Rep. No. 139, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 516-517 (1981). See also <em>DeJesus </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>770 F.2d 316, 323 n.9 (2d Cir. 1985). It was estimated that retrospective budgeting would result in a saving of $187,000,000 in 1983 and $195,000,000 in 1984. See S. Rep. No. 139, <em>supra </em>at 517.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> The department asserts that appropriations were available prior to the Superior Court judgment on January 4, 1985, citing St. 1984, c. 234, \u00a7 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>line item 4405-2000.
