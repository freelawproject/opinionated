Plaintiff, Andre Southall (\u201cSouthall\u201d), alleges that Arias used excessive force against him in violation of his constitutional rights and seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Arias moved for summary judgment on three grounds: (1) that Southall did not allege sufficient facts suggesting Arias\u2019s personal involvement in the incident; (2) that Southall\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, 512 </em>U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); (3) that Arias is entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied Arias\u2019s motion on all grounds. Because we lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal, we dismiss without reaching the merits. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 93-94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (holding that federal courts should not assume jurisdiction over a claim and then reject it on the merits, but should decide jurisdiction first).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Southall appeals the district court\u2019s initial denial of his requests for counsel during the discovery phase that occurred pri- or to Arias\u2019s filing for summary judgment. We dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Southall was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail as a pretrial detainee when an altercation took place between Southall and another inmate at the jail. During the officers\u2019 attempts to restrain Southall, he injured officer James Cunningham (\u201cCunningham\u201d) who had to be treated at the hospital for scrapes and cuts to his face and neck, as well as bruises to his legs. Southall pled guilty and was convicted of misdemeanor assault based on the incident with Cunningham. Southall, in his verified complaint, avers that he was thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and placed in leg restraints by Arias and another officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Southall states that, after being restrained, Cunningham, with the assistance of Arias, \u201cmaliciously and sadistically stomped\u201d his head and beat him causing injuries to his back, neck, and face, requiring stitches to his face. Arias filed the affidavits of two officers at the scene, the affidavit of another officer not at the scene, and police reports on the incident by which he claims that no excessive force was used. Neither the affidavits of the officers nor the reports include any indication that the post-restraint violence alleged by Southall occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">First, Arias contends that the facts alleged in Southall\u2019s complaint are deficient to show Alias\u2019s personal involvement in a constitutional violation. This cannot be reviewed prior to a final judgment. Our interlocutory review extends only to denials of summary judgment sought on qualified immunity grounds. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that ordinarily a denial of summary judgment is not final within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Second, a district court\u2019s failure to apply <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>cannot be reviewed on interlocutory appeal. The <em>Heck </em>doctrine, a facet of issue preclusion or collateral estoppel, prevents persons, in most situations, from bringing a \u00a7 1983 action for damages where recovery would require the invalidation of a prior conviction or sentence based on the same facts. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Unlike immunity rights, an appellate court can effectively review the applicability of <em>Heck </em>after an entry of final judgment making interlocutory review unnecessary. <em>See Cunningham v. Gates, </em>229 F.3d 1271, 1284 (9th Cir.2000) (finding no appellate jurisdiction to review applicability of <em>Heck </em>on denial of summary judgment); <em>cf. Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., </em>511 U.S. 863, 872, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994) (suggesting that the collateral order doctrine does not apply to a district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss on grounds of res judicata).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Considering Alias\u2019s third ground, a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds can be immediately appealed under the collateral order doctrine. However, our interlocutory review is limited. \u201cIn an interlocutory appeal we lack the power to review the district court\u2019s decision that a genuine factual dispute exists.\u201d <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). We must \u201caccept the plaintiffs version of the facts as true and may review <em>de novo </em>only the purely legal question of whether the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that officials are not entitled to qualified immunity on [that] given set of facts.\u201d <em>Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 345 (citing <em>Kinney) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">On appeal, Arias attempts to establish that he is entitled to qualified immunity by undermining the factual allegations raised in Southall\u2019s verified complaint. He supplies a single sentence stating that, \u201ceven if Plaintiffs factual allegations are taken as true, they are not sufficient to constitute deliberate indifference.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, he offers no argument to establish that he is entitled to qualified immunity in light of Southall\u2019s factual allegations. Instead, his brief analyzes the propriety of his actions based on his own version of the facts, a version that does not include the stomping alleged by Southall. Arias\u2019s entire argument for qualified immunity depends on disputed factual issues that we cannot resolve at this stage. As a result, he has waived any opportunity for interlocutory review that might otherwise have been available. <em>See United States v. Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d 1369, 1376 (5th Cir.1995) (refusing to address an argument for which no legal authority was given); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that issues not argued are abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Southall\u2019s cross-appeal argues that the district court erred in denying him appointed counsel at an earlier stage in his action, when counsel would have been more able to aid in discovery. In its order on Arias\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court appointed counsel and also determined that an additional period of discovery would be proper. Because Sout<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>hall has now been appointed counsel and further discovery will occur, we dismiss Southall\u2019s cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">For the foregoing reasons we DISMISS the appeal because we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order denying summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\">. We, as did the district court, treat verified complaints as having the force and effect of an affidavit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, which provides that \"in all federal proceedings, written declarations made under penalty of perjury are permissible in lieu of a sworn affidavit subscribed to before a notary public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">. Arias immediately follows this statement with: \"The issue of whether the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate deliberate indifference is a legal issue that the Fifth Circuit may review on interlocutory appeal.\" Arias appears to misunderstand the nature of our review on interlocutory appeal. Our precedent is clear in stating that, \"in an interlocutory appeal we cannot challenge the district court\u2019s assessments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence.\" <em>Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 347.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
