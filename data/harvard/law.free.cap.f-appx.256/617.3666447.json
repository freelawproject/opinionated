We conclude that Hutchinson is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power will justify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). \u201cMandamus \u2018has traditionally been used in the federal courts only to conf\u00edne an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967)). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">The relief sought by Hutchinson is not available by way of mandamus. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
