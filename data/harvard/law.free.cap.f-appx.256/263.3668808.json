For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">A federal grand jury indicted Coleman in February 2006. Akil Secret filed a notice of appearance on Coleman\u2019s behalf in March 2006 and the district court scheduled trial for 8 May 2006. On May 1, Coleman\u2019s attorney moved for a continuanee and the court reset Coleman\u2019s trial for 15 May 2006. For reasons not clear from the record, the district court did not hear Coleman\u2019s case on this date. Instead, on 23 May 2006, a second attorney, R. Gary Spencer, filed a notice of appearance on Coleman\u2019s behalf. On June 26 the district court allowed Coleman\u2019s first lawyer, Secret, to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Spencer filed a second motion to continue on Coleman\u2019s behalf, which was unopposed by the government and granted by the district court. The district court first reset the trial date for 17 July 2006, then, to better fit Spencer\u2019s schedule, the district court set trial for 18 September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">On the first day of trial, Coleman, through counsel, moved to continue the trial to allow him to terminate Spencer\u2019s representation and seek a third attorney to represent him. After the government\u2019s attorneys were removed from the courtroom, Coleman indicated that he needed a continuance for a \u201ccouple of days,\u201d and stated that he wanted replacement counsel because he did not trust Spencer. R2 at 5. Coleman\u2019s distrust stemmed from an incident that occurred Friday, 8 September 2006 when Spencer invited the government attorneys to a meeting to discuss a plea deal without first notifying Coleman. The government\u2019s attendance at the meeting apparently surprised Coleman and led him to distrust Spencer. Coleman then told the district court that he had spoken to a different attorney the morning of trial about representing him, but that the attorney was in a meeting and could not come to court. Coleman had not paid that attorney to represent him, nor had that attorney contacted the court clerk about the possibility of representing Coleman. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Spencer, however, indicated that he was ready for trial to begin that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The district court denied Coleman\u2019s motion to continue, and the case proceeded to trial that same day. The district court provided the following reasons for its denial of Coleman\u2019s motion: (a) Coleman or his attorney had successfully moved to have his trial continued on two prior occasions, R2 at 4; (b) the court already had permitted one of Coleman\u2019s attorneys to withdraw, <em>id.; </em>(c) a new attorney would need more than a couple of days to familiarize himself with the case and to prepare for trial, <em>id. </em>at 5; (d) Spencer indicated that he was ready for trial, <em>id. </em>at 6-7; (e) Coleman had not paid the other attorney to represent him, nor had that attorney contacted the court clerk or the court\u2019s chambers about representing him, <em>id. </em>at 7; (f) other defendants had \u201cmade a practice\u201d of firing their attorneys immediately before trial in order to have their trials postponed, <em>id. </em>at 8; (g) Coleman had the option of representing himself or having his choice for replacement counsel participate at any time during the trial proceedings, <em>id.; </em>(h) Spencer did not divulge any information to the government at the meeting that could have prejudiced Coleman\u2019s defense, <em>id. </em>at 13; and (i) Coleman had not provided a sufficient reason for the court to continue the case or to discharge Spencer, <em>id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of [a motion for] trial continuance for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1248 (11th Cir.2005). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is not inexorable. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2565-66, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006); <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1616, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983). Thus, a denial of a continuance request will not always amount to a Sixth Amendment violation of a paying defendant\u2019s choice of counsel. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1248 (citing <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589-91, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849-50, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964)). A court may limit a defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice for many reasons including \u201cthe demands of its calendar,\u201d or \u201cfairness.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The district court, in exercising its discretion, must balance a defendant\u2019s right to adequate representation against the overall interest in the efficient administration of justice. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1248. \u201cConsequently, broad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Morns, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616. (internal citations and quotation marks excluded). A defendant is guaranteed only a \u201cfair or reasonable opportunity to select the attorney of [his] choice.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1248. An appellate court, when reviewing whether the denial of a continuance violated a defendant\u2019s \u201cfail- or reasonable opportunity\u201d to choose counsel, should consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">(1) the length of the delay; (2) whether the counsel who becomes unavailable for trial has associates prepared to try the case; (3) whether other continuances have been requested and granted; (4) the inconvenience to all involved in the trial; (5) whether the requested continuance is for a legitimate reason; and (6) any unique factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted) (citing <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>221 F.3d 1183, 1190 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Analysis of the factors listed above weighs in favor of the soundness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>district court\u2019s exercise of discretion and against Coleman\u2019s claim. First, the length of delay necessary to allow a new attorney to familiarize himself with the facts of the case and Coleman\u2019s defense would not have been a matter of days, but a matter of weeks. Second, the counsel of record, Spencer, was available and ready to try the case on 18 September 2006. Third, the district court had already granted two of Coleman\u2019s attorneys\u2019 continuance requests in the past and the scheduled trial date had already slipped four months, from 8 May 2006 to 18 September 2006. Fourth, a continuance on the morning of trial would have inconvenienced the court, its docket, the citizens called for jury duty, and all of the witnesses, three of whom had come from out of state; two from South Carolina and one from Indiana. Fifth, Coleman\u2019s reason for distrusting Spencer, while apparently sincerely held at the time, does not raise procedural concerns or worries about Coleman\u2019s adequate representation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Coleman argues that <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (2006), should control our analysis. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>concerned \u201ca trial court\u2019s <em>erroneous </em>deprivation of a criminal defendant\u2019s choice of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2560 (emphasis added). In that case the government conceded that the district court incorrectly deprived the defendant of his counsel of choice. <em>Id. </em>at 2561, 2563. Accordingly, before Coleman can take advantage of the remedy outlined in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>he must first show that the district court erroneously denied the defendant his choice of counsel. <em>United States v. Zangwill, </em>197 Fed.Appx. 888, 891 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The government has not conceded that the district court erred in this case, and according to our review of the record, the district court did not erroneously deprive Coleman of his counsel of choice by denying his continuance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Coleman appeals his conviction on the grounds that the district court denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice. After considering the factors outlined in <em>Baker </em>we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Coleman\u2019s motion to continue the trial proceedings, and, consequently, that it did not violate Coleman\u2019s right to counsel of his choice. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Coleman\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\">. Although Coleman has completed the custodial portion of his sentence, he is currently serving the supervised release portion of his sentence. Thus, his appeal is not moot. <em>See United States v. Page, </em>69 F.3d 482, 488 n. 4 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
