Ridgely first challenges the transfer of his civil action from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. However, we do not have jurisdiction to review this issue because Ridgely failed to challenge the change of venue in the Eastern District of Virginia. <em>Brock v. Entre Computer Ctrs., Inc., </em>933 F.2d 1253, 1257 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we dismiss Ridgely\u2019s appeal as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">Ridgely next contends the district court improperly concluded that he failed to exhaust his retaliation claim. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Ridgely v. Chao, </em>No. 1:06-cv-00343-GBL-TC (E.D.Va., Dec. 29, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
