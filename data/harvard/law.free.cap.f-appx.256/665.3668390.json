In 2001, Harrison filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied by the district court. Harrison sought review of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. A certificate of appealability was denied on appeal in October 2002. Harrison filed his relation back motion in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-21\">We must always consider the basis of our jurisdiction, sua sponte if necessary. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). In his relation back motion, Harrison argued that the district court erred under Fed.R.CrimP. 11 in taking his plea because it failed to go over his plea agreement with him; the Government filed an untimely information concerning enhancement of his sentence based on pri- or convictions pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851; his plea agreement was invalid because he was an enemy combatant in the United States\u2019 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d; and his counsel provided ineffective assistance. Harrison\u2019s relation back motion was an unauthorized motion that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we affirm on alternate grounds. <em>See Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000). We do not consider Harrison\u2019s remaining claims raised for the first time in this appeal. <em>See Key, </em>205 F.3d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
