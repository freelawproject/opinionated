Reid appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised probation and sentencing him to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal but questioning whether the sentence imposed was reasonable. Reid was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-31\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Reid\u2019s sentence is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>advisory guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum sentence, and thus the district\u2018court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a nine-month term of imprisonment. The district court\u2019s revocation proceedings otherwise comport with due process. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000). Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in wilting, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
