Charles admitted to violating the conditions of his supervised release. During the sentencing portion of Charles\u2019s revocation hearing, the district court judge considered sentencing him to time-served plus seven days\u2019 imprisonment so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Charles could take advantage of the probation officer\u2019s different drug and mental health treatment options upon release. When Charles reacted vociferously to the probation officer\u2019s suggestion that he wear a monitoring bracelet on his ankle upon release, the district court continued sentencing. At the continued sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Charles to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Charles argues that the district court had to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and its decision to sentence him to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment was unreasonable given that it had previously considered sentencing him to time-served plus seven days\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Where a defendant under supervised release possesses a controlled substance, he is subject to mandatory revocation of his supervised release and a prison term not in excess of the statutory maximum. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1). We have previously determined that when revocation of supervised release is mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), the statute does not require consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, to the extent that Charles argues that the district court did not adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing him, that argument fails because the district court was not required to consider those factors as Charles\u2019s revocation for drug possession was mandatory. We note, that, in any event, the district court did consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the record reflects that Charles\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
