He was sentenced to 168 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-23\">Lopez asserts the district court erred by applying a presumption of reasonableness to the advisory guidelines sentencing range and by failing to give sufficient weight to the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Lopez thus contends his sentence is unreasonable and should be vacated. The record refutes Lopez\u2019s assertions. The district court\u2019s remarks at sentencing show that Lopez\u2019s sentence was the result of a balancing of the proper factors, including the guidelines and the considerations of \u00a7 3553(a). There is no indication in the record that Lopez-Morales\u2019s sentence is the result of \u201ca clear error in the court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-26\">Lopez further asserts this court\u2019s jurisprudence affording a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence falling within a properly calculated guidelines range is contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Lopez concedes, this claim is foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-29\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
