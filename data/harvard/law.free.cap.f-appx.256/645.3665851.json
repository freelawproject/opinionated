Ten months later, Weymouth filed a motion in the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to have his conviction vacated, contending that in pleading guilty, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. He claimed that in one of three letters advising him what sentence to expect, his counsel told him that he faced a <em>minimum </em>sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, whereas he actually faced a <em>maximum </em>sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, as provided by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion, finding that Weymouth had satisfied neither prong of the analysis under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), required to demonstrate that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">After law enforcement officers purchased ecstasy at a house in Chesapeake, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Virginia, they executed a search warrant there on February 21, 2003. During this search, the occupants of the house advised the officers that \u201cDan, Mike and Mike\u201d would be coming to the house later with an additional supply of ecstasy. As represented, three men arrived at the house at about midnight, and two of the men went to the side door, where law enforcement officers detained and searched them. Michael Riopel was found to have 100 tablets of ecstasy in his pocket, and the defendant Weymouth was found to have $2,470 in cash and more than 40 pills and capsules. The pills found on Weymouth were later determined to contain ecstasy and PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After being advised of his constitutional rights, Weymouth told officers, \u201cyou got me.\u201d When they asked him about the $2,470 in cash that he was carrying, Weymouth indicated that he was planning to travel to New York City that night to purchase more ecstasy. He informed the officers that he had previously made 10 to 20 trips to New York to obtain ecstasy, and on each trip he had returned with between 500 and 1,000 pills. He said that on most of the trips he returned with 500 pills, and that a smaller quantity was not worth his while.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Weymouth was indicted in six counts: one for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute ecstasy and PCP, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(C); two counts for possession with intent to distribute ecstasy and PCP, in violation of <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C); and three counts for possession of ecstasy and PCP, in violation of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">During the pretrial period, Weymouth\u2019s court-appointed attorney corresponded with him by letter at least three times, giving him advice on how to proceed. In her first letter, dated June 20, 2003, Weymouth\u2019s attorney indicated that a \u201crough estimate\u201d of the Sentencing Guidelines calculation placed Weymouth at level 28. With an estimated criminal history category of V and a potential two or three-point reduction if Weymouth accepted a plea bargain, she estimated that the likely sentence would be 110-137 months\u2019 imprisonment. She confirmed that the residents of the house where Weymouth was arrested would testify against him and that his <em>post-Miranda </em>statements to law enforcement officers were \u201ccompletely inculpatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In her second letter, dated June 25, 2003, Weymouth\u2019s counsel informed him that if he went to trial he faced 140-175 months\u2019 imprisonment and that \u201c[o]f course, if you go to trial, you have no defense.\u201d She also informed him that he probably had a criminal history of category VI, which would increase the Sentencing Guideline range to approximately 151-188 months\u2019 imprisonment, even after a plea bargain. She stated, however, that she was still investigating whether he qualified as a career offender. She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atf\">You advised me today in lock up after the arraignment that you would take a plea and cooperate if you were a [Career Offender] but that you only wished to plead \u201cstraight up\u201d if you were not a [Career Offender].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">As I currently understand it, you are willing to plead in either case, you just don\u2019t want to have to cooperate if you don\u2019t qualify as a Career Offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">In her third letter, dated July 15, 2003, Weymouth\u2019s attorney advised him that \u201c[he] really [did] not have standing to contest the search warrant\u201d which led to his arrest. Furthermore, she reminded him that \u201c[y]ou still must face the reality that Mike Riopel will be testifying against you at trial, as will Daniel Clair/Reese and maybe Mike Phillips. Their testimony will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>still be sufficient to convict .... \u201d She also made the following statement, which forms the basis of Weymouth\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">Lastly, if you go to trial the government will most definitely file an 851 notice of intent to increase your potential penalties (see highlighted part of enclosed statute). That would mean your statutory low end would be 20 years, and the maximum would be life. Of course, if it turns out you are a career offender, then your guidelines will put you very near the 20 years anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Attached to the letter was a xeroxed copy of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 and the portion of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) which provides for a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence. The language of Weymouth\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter is confusing and in some parts incorrect. It is apparently correct insofar as it states that if Weymouth is a career offender the recommended sentence would be near 20 years. But it is obviously incorrect to \u2022 state that if the government filed a \u00a7 851 notice, Weymouth\u2019s sentencing range would be 20 years to life. While that would be true under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), it was not true for an offense under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which provides for a 20-year maximum sentence, or 30 years if a \u00a7 851 information of a prior drug conviction were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Weymouth ultimately pleaded guilty to Count I of the indictment, charging him with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute ecstasy and POP, in return for the government\u2019s dismissal of the remaining charges. In sentencing Weymouth, the district court found that under the Sentencing Guidelines Weymouth\u2019s offense level was 25, including credit for acceptance of responsibility. With a criminal history Category VI, therefore, the Sentencing Guidelines provided for a sentencing range of 110-137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Weymouth to 124 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Weymouth thereafter filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to set aside his conviction and sentence, claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel stated to him that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for an indictment charging him with a violation under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). He claimed, \u201c[i]f it was not for counsel\u2019s mistake I would have continued to trial like I had wanted.\u201d The district court denied Weymouth\u2019s motion, concluding first that Weymouth had not demonstrated that his attorney\u2019s performance, \u201cwhen considered in its totality,\u201d was outside of \u201cthe wide range of reasonably professional conduct that <em>Strickland </em>permits.\u201d The court also concluded that even if his counsel\u2019s performance was sufficiently deficient to establish the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>Weymouth failed to establish the prejudice prong, given his acknowledgment of his guilt, his indication to the court at the Rule 11 hearing that he fully understood his plea agreement, and the lack of evidence that he would have proceeded to trial absent counsel\u2019s isolated erroneous statement. In response to Weymouth\u2019s petition for relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b), the court explained yet further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Here, petitioner has failed to establish that a <em>reasonable </em>defendant would not have pled guilty but instead insisted on going to trial. Petitioner not only stated under oath in front of this court that he was in fact guilty but he stated in his reply to the government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t wish to insult the court\u2019s intelligence by claiming actual innocence.\u201d Reply, p. 8. The petitioner has presented no evidence that a reasonable defendant, in the petitioner\u2019s position, in light of the evidence the government had against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>him, would have insisted on going to trial. Furthermore, the defendant acknowledges that if he went to trial and was found guilty he would have likely received a sentence greater than what he received as a result of the guilty plea. Instead, petitioner merely relies on his personal preference to risk a significantly higher sentence as evidence that <em>he </em>would have insisted on a trial but for the single mistake his counsel made. Petitioner has failed to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Hill.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We granted the certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Weymouth\u2019s attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">To be entitled to relief, Weymouth must show that his counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and that he was thereby prejudiced. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Because his claim follows a plea of guilty, demonstrating prejudice requires showing \u201c \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hooper v. Garraghty, </em>845 F.2d 471, 475 (4th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Petitioner bases his claim on the single misstatement by his counsel that he was subject to a <em>minimum </em>sentence of 20 years and a maximum of life imprisonment. He claims that but for that statement, he would not have pleaded guilty. That claim, however, is belied by the record and by what any reasonable defendant in his position would have concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\"><em>First, </em>his counsel repeatedly provided him with calculations under the Sentencing Guidelines, advising him correctly of the estimated sentencing ranges for a violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In her first letter, his counsel advised that based on a criminal history Category V, Weymouth\u2019s likely sentence would be in the range of 110-137 months\u2019 imprisonment. In her second letter, Weymouth\u2019s counsel informed him that his criminal history was probably a Category VI and therefore his estimated sentencing range would be 151-188 months\u2019 imprisonment. She also confirmed Weymouth\u2019s statement that he was willing to plead guilty <em>regardless </em>of whether he had to cooperate with the government, as he had no defense. Her third letter to Weymouth contained a misstatement of the sentence, but it also included a correct explanation that, \u201cif it turns out you are a career offender, then your guidelines will put you very near the 20 years anyway.\u201d If Weymouth had paid attention to the one misstatement, he certainly would have raised a question in view of the extensive amount of correct information given to him about the applicable Guidelines range over the course of three letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\"><em>Second, </em>any doubt about the proper estimated range would have been put to rest by the written plea agreement which clearly stated, on its first page, that Weymouth was charged with a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) -with a <em>maximum </em>penalty of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. The plea agreement\u2019s information was consistent with the indictment, which Weymouth acknowledged having receiving, charging him with a violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), not \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A), and having a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\"><em>Third, </em>and perhaps most compelling, is the fact that at the Rule 11 colloquy, the district court clearly repeated the charges against Weymouth and the <em>maximum </em>sentence of 20-years\u2019 imprisonment. When asked at the Rule 11 colloquy if he under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>stood this penalty, Weymouth stated that he did. The transcript reveals no evidence to indicate that Weymouth was in any way confused. To the contrary, he assured the court that he was not confused and understood what he was being told. This colloquy alone denies Weymouth the opportunity to claim that he reasonably relied on his counsel\u2019s mistake when the mistake was corrected at the Rule 11 hearing. As we explained in <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1395 (4th Cir.1992) (en banc):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADlS\">[I]f the information given by the court at the Rule 11 hearing corrects or clarifies the earlier erroneous information given by the defendant\u2019s attorney and the defendant admits to understanding the court\u2019s advice, the criminal justice system must be able to rely on the subsequent dialogue between the court and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The burden falls on Weymouth to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any deficiency in his counsel\u2019s performance, and in this case, he has failed to carry that burden of showing prejudice. <em>See United States v. Foster, </em>68 F.3d 86, 88 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Weymouth relies on <em>Hammond v. United States, </em>528 F.2d 15 (4th Cir.1975), to argue that he was prejudiced by his advice of counsel. In <em>Hammond, </em>counsel erroneously advised his client that he faced a 90-year sentence, when in reality he could at most have received a 55-year sentence. The error that counsel made in <em>Hammond, </em>however, unlike that which occurred in <em>Lambey, </em>was reinforced by the clerk of the court during the Rule 11 hearing and was never corrected by the court. <em>Hammond, </em>528 F.2d at 16. Accordingly, we vacated Hammond\u2019s guilty plea because counsel\u2019s erroneous advice had been \u201ccorroborated by the information supplied by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. In <em>Lambey, </em>on the other hand, the district court provided the defendant with the correct statement at the Rule 11 colloquy, correcting the erroneous advice given by the defendant\u2019s counsel earlier. Because those are the circumstances here, <em>Lambey </em>is the relevant precedent, and Weymouth\u2019s reliance on <em>Hammond </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Finding no prejudice, we need not reach the question of whether Weymouth\u2019s counsel was in fact deficient. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
