This case was previously remanded for a determination of timeliness of the appeal in the ten-day appeal period. On November 21, 2006, the district court determined that the appeal was timely noted and returned the case to the court. On July 2, 2007, judgment was entered affirming the district court\u2019s order. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>231 Fed.Appx. 282 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished). The mandate issued on August 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-25\">On December 1, 2006, Walker, proceeding pro se, noted another appeal of the order denying \u00a7 3582(c) relief, which is the notice of appeal related to the subject case. Having reviewed the record and the <em>Anders </em>brief, the court finds that this appeal is duplicitous and dismisses the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
