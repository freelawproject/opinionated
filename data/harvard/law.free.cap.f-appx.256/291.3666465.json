He concedes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) except the fact of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>prior conviction from the Sixth Amendment requirement that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Roundtree also concedes that he failed to preserve the issue below. When a defendant fails to preserve an issue below, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u201cThe Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), provides a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for anyone who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after three convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1269 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is <em>not </em>a fact that must be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The Court\u2019s subsequent seminal decisions in <em>Appretidi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>have not disturbed the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres. Id. </em>Although <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) \u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As Roundtree acknowledges in his brief, his arguments are contrary to our precedent. Thus, the district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\">.
