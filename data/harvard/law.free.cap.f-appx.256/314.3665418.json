After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">(1) Whether the district court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims in the absence of the trial transcript.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">(2) Whether the district court\u2019s resolution of appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims was sufficient for this Court to conduct a meaningful review on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">As to the first issue, the parties now agree that the district court had the trial transcript when it ruled on Jack\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, and the record supports their position. The entire trial transcript, including the closing arguments, was filed in the district court on August 3, 2006. The magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) was entered on August 18, 2006 and the district court adopted the R&amp;R and denied Jack\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition on November 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">As to the second issue, the parties also now agree that the district court\u2019s ruling on Jack\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is sufficient to allow us to conduct meaningful review. After reviewing the district court\u2019s order and the R&amp;R it adopted, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Finally, Jack raises the merits of his claims regarding the ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel. However, the COA does not cover those issues. Furthermore, the questions posed in the COA are procedural ones that can, and have been, answered without a need to consider the merits of Jack\u2019s ineffective assistance claims. Thus, we decline to address Jack\u2019s additional arguments. <em>See Murray v. United, States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that \u201cin an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
