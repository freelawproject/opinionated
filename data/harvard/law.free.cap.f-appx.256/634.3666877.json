We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Because this is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Moser, the nonmovant. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, </em>538 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">A. General</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">Fairway Outdoor Advertising of the Triad in Greensboro, North Carolina, is a division of MCC Outdoor, L.L.C. and Shivers Trading and Operating Company (collectively, \u201cFairway\u201d). Fairway hired Mos-er as a sales representative on July 9, 2003. Her responsibilities involved calling on potential customers and selling outdoor advertising space, such as billboard space. She was one of nine sales representatives in the Greensboro office, seven of whom were men. As a sales representative, Moser was required to report to the office for a short time at the beginning and end of every day, but she otherwise spent her work time outside of the office. Moser and her fellow sales representatives operated in an open area with no partitions or walls. Her supervisor was sales manager Eddie Jones, who in turn reported to general manager Dan O\u2019Shea.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">Moser\u2019s time at Fairway was a rocky one. She had disputes with several Fairway employees, sometimes resulting in heated exchanges. Although Moser was on the receiving end of much objectionable behavior, she at times contributed to the less than professional atmosphere at Fairway. For example, she sometimes called other employees names, she joked that she was smarter than they were, and she once shot other employees with a water gun. On one occasion, she \u201cdressed ... [Jones] down\u201d in front of O\u2019Shea after a sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>meeting in which she felt that she was being treated unfairly. J.A. 282. Another time, she was in Jones\u2019s office complaining about the behavior of another sales representative. When the meeting was not going as she had hoped, she told Jones, \u201cYou\u2019re getting on my nerves\u201d and \u201cwalked off.\u201d J.A. 257 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moser received written warnings for both of these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">B. Moser\u2019s Complaints Concerning Other Sales Representatives</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Moser\u2019s primary antagonist in the office among the salesmen was George Wilkes. Moser and Wilkes were very competitive and often needled each other, leading to escalating conflicts that sometimes re- \u25a0 quired intervention and resulted in verbal reprimands. Even when the two were not openly hostile, Wilkes often irritated Mos-er. For example, he asked her about her personal life and tried to set her up with men; he commented that he thought she would have an affair with someone from the office; he once told her to slow down because she was \u201cbouncing,\u201d J.A. 308 (internal quotation marks omitted); and once he made a comment about her backside. He smacked her on the bottom with a water bottle on one occasion. He also called her a \u201cdingbat\u201d and a \u201cdumb blonde\u201d after she had an accident while driving a company car. J.A. 242 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moser complained to O\u2019Shea about Wilkes\u2019 behavior, specifically mentioning his popping her on the bottom with the bottle and a number of non-sexual comments he made to her. She lodged similar complaints about Wilkes to Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Moser also had a few unpleasant interactions with sales representative Kelly Phipps, although she admits that she had no \u201creal problem[]\u201d with him. J.A. 322. On one occasion, Phipps asked her if she was gay. On another, Phipps told her that he felt like she dressed like a man, and he \u201cwent to touch [her] breast.\u201d J.A. 255. She rebuffed him, resulting in only his fingertips touching her. Another time, Phipps told Moser that he \u201cwould do\u201d her. J.A. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Although Moser identifies sales representative Tom Poe as a friend and the only person she felt \u201ccomfortable talking with\u201d at Fairway, J.A. 317, he also was guilty at times of acting unprofessionally toward her. For example, Poe once asked Moser if she was wearing a thong and if she had had sex with her then-current boyfriend. He suggested that she find someone with whom she could have casual sex. He said he himself would consider having sex with her if he were not married. Poe talked about another woman suffering from premenstrual syndrome and told Moser details of how he had sex with his wife. He also told her how female clients used to rub their breasts against him. One time Poe picked Moser up around the waist and carried her around, trying to \u201cpull up [her] skirt.\u201d J.A. 309 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Moser did not explain why she thought Poe did that, she testified that at the time she \u201cdidn\u2019t think [he] meant anything by it,\u201d and she soon \u201cforgot about\u201d the incident. J.A. 310. Moser admitted that she and Poe \u201cdid joke around.\u201d J.A. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">C. Complaints Concerning Jones</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Moser experienced far more serious problems with her supervisor, Jones. Jones once told Moser she was a \u201chottie,\u201d J.A. 295 (internal quotation marks omitted), and made a similar comment on another occasion. He once said to Wilkes (in front of Moser) that Moser seemed to come by Jones\u2019s house whenever Jones\u2019s wife was not around. Jones told Moser one time on a car trip that he \u201cwould do [her] in a heartbeat.\u201d J.A. 300 (internal quotation marks omitted). Another time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you work out, because you don\u2019t have a boyfriend to have sex with.\u201d J.A. 306 (internal quotation marks omitted). He once showed her a pornographic picture of a little boy \u201cwith a very large penis\u201d and told her that it was him when he was young. J.A. 301. When she told him that that was very inappropriate and pinched him, Jones told her that if she pinched him again, he would grab her breast.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He told her on one occasion that he liked small breasts, which she understood to refer to her. Finally, Jones once commented to another male employee, in front of Moser, \u201c[W]e need to talk to Serena about different sexual techniques.\u201d J.A. 307 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Jones also talked to Moser on several occasions about how to tell how long a man\u2019s penis is and how he liked women\u2019s breasts and bottoms. In Moser\u2019s presence, Jones commented one time to Poe that he could help a particular woman with back problems by having sex with her \u201cdoggy-style.\u201d J.A. 286 (internal quotation marks omitted). On another occasion, he and Poe agreed in front of Moser that they \u201cwould do [a particular woman] in a heartbeat.\u201d J.A.287.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">One day, before an upcoming conference, Jones told Moser to \u201cbring a bikini [because] there\u2019s a hot tub at the hotel we can use.\u201d J.A. 293 (internal quotation marks omitted). He also told Moser that he \u201ccare[d] for\u201d her and that he otherwise would have fired her for inappropriate behavior. J.A. 270, 300 (internal quotation marks omitted). One time when Moser and Jones were trying to resolve a disagreement, Jones \u201cjust threw his hands and arms up into the air and said, \u2018But, Serena, I love you.\u2019 \u201d J.A. 303. He used to ask Moser what she was cooking for dinner and would say that he would not come over if she was not making something he liked. Once when Moser told him that she would like to get married within five years, he told her that he would be divorced within that time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Unfortunately, Jones\u2019s unwelcome conduct toward Moser was not limited to the verbal. One day when Jones was driving Moser and some others in his car-Moser and Jones were in the front seat-Jones placed his hand on Moser\u2019s left thigh at least three times, each time for \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d until Moser squirmed away from him. J.A. 285. Jones once slid his arm around Moser\u2019s waist at an after-work-hours reception, causing Moser to \u201cf[a]ll back into a crowd of people\u201d as she tried to extricate herself. J.A. 236. Mos-er recalled two times when Jones hugged her from the side, squeezing her shoulder. At least two times, Jones hugged Moser after they had gone together to the YMCA to work out. And, one evening when the two were at a bar with friends, Jones hugged her and kissed her head when she left. Jones also \u201cwould eyeball [Moser] up and down constantly,\u201d J.A. 268, and looked down Moser\u2019s blouse on several occasions, often forcing her to cover herself when she sensed Jones was in position to look.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Moser often objected to Jones\u2019s sexual comments and actions when they occurred. As a result, Jones became increasingly hostile toward her and repeatedly expressed concern to Moser that she was going to claim that he had sexually harassed her. Moser described the uncomfortable pattern that developed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">[Jones] would make some kind of sexual advance toward me and I would say no or I would confront him on it to get him to understand it makes me uncomforta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ble per his request and he would get really mad and start yelling. Then, later on, he would be real nice and make some other advance toward me and the whole cycle would start over again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">J.A. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">One of the most upsetting incidents with Jones occurred just 12 days before Moser was fired. On the day in question, Jones called Moser into his office after a sales meeting. He opened the door only a couple of feet and when she walked in he \u201ccornered\u201d her, \u201ccame right up on [her] person,\u201d \u201cpushed [her] behind the back of the door,\u201d \u201clook[ed] down [her] blouse,\u201d and shut the door. J.A. 266, 294. As he backed away from her and began to sit down in a chair, he said, \u201cSerena, what do we need to do to get our relationship back on track?\u201d J.A. 266 (internal quotation marks omitted). The incident ended when she said that she did not know what they should do. Moser also described another bizarre event in which Jones \u201cwalked up to [her] and just yanked [her] out of [her] chair.\u201d J.A. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">As a result of the mistreatment she received, many times in front of other Fairway employees, Moser felt she \u201chad to work ten times harder to earn people\u2019s respect.\u201d JA. 356. As the abuse began to escalate in January and February of 2004, she became very anxious. The stress prevented her from sleeping, which, in turn, affected her work performance. She became frustrated and depressed and eventually consulted with a counselor to help her \u201cdeal with the offensive behaviors at Fairway.\u201d J.A. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">D. Moser\u2019s Termination</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">According to Fairway\u2019s answers to interrogatories produced as discovery in the present case, general manager O\u2019Shea decided to terminate Moser in late June 2004, effective immediately, because of what Fairway contends were \u201cconstant conflicts with other staff members that were instigated by [Moser], her condemnation of management, her disruptive disposition, her failure and refusal to cooperate with others and her rude, arrogant and condescending treatment of others.\u201d J.A. 652. Moser was called into O\u2019Shea\u2019s office, where Jones told her the news, and O\u2019Shea told Moser, \u201cI back up [Jones].\u201d J.A. 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). When Moser asked why she was being let go, both men told her that she no longer appeared happy to work at Fairway and no longer fit in.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">E. Moser\u2019s Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">Moser brought this action against Fairway in the district court, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, namely, quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment, retaliatory discharge based on Moser\u2019s complaints of sexual harassment, and discriminatory discharge based on her gender. She also alleged a state law claim for wrongful termination in violation of North Carolina public policy. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Fairway on all claims. The court disposed of the quid pro quo and discriminatory discharge claims on the ground that Moser failed to properly contest Fairway\u2019s motion with regard to those claims under the court\u2019s local rules. As for the hostile environment claim, the court determined that the forecasted evidence was insufficient to create a prima facie case because it could not support a reasonable inference that the unwelcome sexual conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms of her employment. Regarding retaliation, the district court noted that Moser relied only on her alleged complaints about Wilkes\u2019s behavior to show that she had engaged in protected conduct, but she failed to forecast evidence that her complaints about Wilkes covered sexual or gender-based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>harassment. Finally, the court ruled that Moser\u2019s violation of North Carolina public policy claim failed because Moser did not point to evidence tending to show that Jones continually made sexual advances toward her and because the court was not aware of any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Moser first argues that the district court erred in ruling that the evidence she forecasted was insufficient to create a prima facie case of hostile environment sexual harassment. We agree there is sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing any facts and inferences drawn from them in the light most favorable to Moser, the non-moving party. <em>See Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958 (4th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits an employer from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). This prohibition \u201cnot only covers \u2018terms\u2019 and \u2018conditions\u2019 in the narrow contractual sense, but evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment.\u201d <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, it is a violation of Title VII to maintain a sexually hostile work environment, i.e. a \u201cworkplace, permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (internal quotation marks &amp; citation omitted). To establish a hostile environment sexual harassment claim, a plaintiff must show conduct that \u201c(1) was unwelcome, (2) was based on her sex, (3) was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive work environment, and (4) was imputable to her employer.\u201d <em>Ocheltree v. Scollon Productions, Inc., </em>335 F.3d 325, 331 (4th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The district court determined that the evidence was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the third element. In deciding as a matter of law whether harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to bring it within Title VII\u2019s purview, we must examine the totality of the circumstances, including \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. This standard is designed to \u201cfilter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.\u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnlike other, more direct and discrete unlawful employment practices, hostile work environments generally result only after an accumulation of discrete instances of harassment.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Alternative Resources Corp., </em>458 F.3d 332, 339 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>S.Ct. 2036, 167 L.Ed.2d 804 (2007). \u201cHarassment reaches the sufficiently severe or pervasive level when it creates \u2018an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive\u2019 and that the victim herself \u2018subjectively perceive[s] ... to be abusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jennings v. Univ. of N.C., </em>482 F.3d 686, 696 (4th Cir.2007) (en banc) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. 367), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 247, 169 L.Ed.2d 147 (2007). In this case, Moser clearly forecasted sufficient evidence that she perceived her work environment to be abusive. The issue on which we focus is whether this evidence created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Moser\u2019s perception was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We have recognized \u201cthat the line between a merely unpleasant working environment and a hostile or deeply repugnant one\u201d is sometimes difficult to locate. <em>Hopkins v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>77 F.3d 745, 753 (4th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks &amp; alteration omitted). While this case demonstrates just how difficult placing that line can be, we nonetheless conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Moser\u2019s hostile environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Even without taking into account the conduct of Moser\u2019s fellow sales representatives, a reasonable jury could determine that Jones constantly made Moser reasonably feel that she was his sexual prey. By telling Moser that she was a hottie, that he would like to see her in a bikini, or that he \u201cwould do [her] in a heartbeat,\u201d J.A. 300, Jones communicated to Moser that he wanted to have sex with her. Furthermore, the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Moser, showed that Jones regularly took opportunities to treat her in a sexual way. He slipped his arm around her waist, hugged her, repeatedly placed his hand on her thigh during a car trip, and \u201ceyeball[ed] [Moser] up and down <em>constantly.\u201d </em>J.A. 268 (emphasis added). He also repeatedly sought to look down her blouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Although not quite as severe, many of Jones\u2019s other actions could be found by a reasonable jury to have contributed to the pervasiveness of the unwanted sexual conduct. Such a jury could find that many statements or actions that Moser otherwise might have perceived as simply boorish or inappropriate under other circumstances reasonably were humiliating to her in light of the sexually predatory relationship Jones had developed with her. For example, Jones\u2019s subjecting Moser to his general comments about what parts of the female anatomy he enjoyed and what sex acts he would like to perform on other women could reasonably be expected to make Moser much more uncomfortable because she knew that he was interested in her body specifically and would like to perform the same acts <em>on her. See Jennings, </em>482 F.3d at 698 (concluding that a jury could reasonably find that two incidents of direct harassment of the plaintiff \u201cwere more abusive in light of the general, sexually charged environment\u201d created by other inappropriate sexual conduct); <em>see also Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 115, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (\u201cHostile environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts. Their very nature involves repeated conduct.... Such claims are based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.\u201d). Similarly, Jones\u2019s showing Moser a pornographic picture, talking about male sex organs, noting that Moser did not have anyone to have sex with, and saying that he and another employee needed to talk to Moser about sexual techniques could reasonably have made Moser extremely uncomfortable for the same reason. And, Jones\u2019s telling Moser that he cared for her or loved her and suggesting that he would like to come over to her house also reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>ably could be viewed as reiterations of the sexual desire for Moser that Jones had already expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Indeed, the fact that Moser was a specific object of Jones\u2019s sexual attention and not just a witness to inappropriate sexual behavior concerning other women makes much of the conduct that Moser allegedly endured arguably more severe\u2014more humiliating in an objective sense\u2014than the conduct we found sufficient to support a plaintiffs verdict in <em>Ocheltree. </em>In <em>Ocheltree, </em>a female employee was subjected every day to graphic sexual talk from her male coworkers, including descriptions that often portrayed women in a \u201csexually subservient and demeaning light.\u201d <em>Ocheltree, </em>335 F.3d at 333. She was once sung a vulgar song that arguably used her as the subject, and \u201csomething sexual\u201d was done to a mannequin anytime Ocheltree walked by. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 332 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, in contrast, it was Moser\u2019s own body that her supervisor was \u201cconstantly\u201d \u201ceyeballing\u201d \u201cup and down\u201d\u2014particularly when Jones was able to look down her blouse. And while the coworkers in <em>Ocheltree </em>discussed having sex with their wives and girlfriends, Jones told Moser that he wanted to have sex with her and stated that he and another employee should talk to her about different sexual techniques. While the male employees at <em>Ocheltree </em>touched a mannequin in sexual ways in front of the plaintiff, Jones actually touched Moser\u2014in the most egregious examples, by placing his hand on her thigh several times during a car trip as she squirmed away to avoid his touch and by pushing her behind a door in his office and looking down her blouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Moreover, in our view, the evidence forecasted of Jones\u2019s sexual conduct was substantially different from that in <em>Weiss v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Chicago., </em>990 F.2d 333 (7th Cir.1993), on which the district court relied. There, the plaintiffs supervisor \u201casked her for dates, called her a \u2018dumb blond,\u2019 put his hand on her shoulder several times, placed T love you\u2019 signs in her work area [during one week] and attempted to kiss her in a bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Seventh Circuit concluded that the district court had properly granted summary judgment because the incidents were \u201crelatively isolated\u201d and not sufficiently serious considering their infrequency. <em>Id. </em>Here, in contrast, Moser forecast-ed evidence that, viewed in the light most favorable to her, showed that Jones\u2019s abuse was relentless. And, it is important to emphasize that all of the numerous incidents Moser described occurred during Moser\u2019s less-than-a-year tenure at Fairway. <em>Cf. Hopkins, </em>77 F.3d at 753-54 (holding that male supervisor\u2019s alleged harassment of male employee, including bumping into employee, positioning magnifying glass over his crotch, giving him a congratulatory kiss at his wedding, staring at him in the bathroom, commenting on his appearance, and making inappropriate sexual comments, was not sufficiently severe or pervasive when the alleged incidents occurred only intermittently over a seven-year period).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">In holding that the forecasted evidence here was sufficient, we emphasize that a reasonable jury could infer from the evidence that the hostility that Jones developed toward Moser when she repeatedly objected to his sexual behavior further interfered with her opportunity to have an effective working relationship with her supervisor and contributed heavily to the abusiveness of the working environment. The cycle Moser described of Jones engaging in sexually inappropriate conduct toward her and then lashing out at her as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>she attempted to distance herself from him left Moser in an impossible situation. In this respect, the evidence in this case resembles that of <em>Beardsley v. Webb, </em>30 F.3d 524 (4th Cir.1994). There, the plaintiff, a second lieutenant in the sheriffs office, alleged that her supervisor harassed her for a five-month period, thereby prompting her resignation. The alleged harassment included the supervisor calling the plaintiff \u201choney\u201d and \u201cdear\u201d in front of subordinates; standing behind the plaintiff during roll call and touching her shoulders; and, following the plaintiffs complaint that this made her and her husband (also a member of the sheriffs department) uncomfortable, massaging the plaintiffs shoulders while staring at her husband. It also included unjustifiably accusing her of having an affair with a deputy, asking her what kind of underwear she wore and what type of birth control she used, and ordering her to drive him to pick up his car from a repair shop and stating that \u201cit was his turn to make out in the parking lot\u201d with her. <em>Id. </em>at 528 (internal quotation marks omitted). After the plaintiff complained, she was given the \u201ccold shoulder\u201d by her supervisor and her relationship \u25a0with the deputies suddenly soured. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs evidence was not substantial enough to require submission to the jury of the question of whether the supervisor\u2019s discriminatory conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to make out a sexual harassment claim, stating that: \u201cIn combination, his acts altered the condition of [the plaintiffs] employment and created an objectively abusive work environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529. We conclude that the same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In sum, a jury could reasonably conclude from the evidence forecasted that Jones was unyielding in his sexual treatment of Moser, crippling her ability to have a healthy working relationship with him, and causing her significant personal anguish as she attempted to avoid his sexual behavior and deal with the antagonism he directed toward her. On this basis, a rational jury could conclude that Moser reasonably found her working environment to be both hostile and abusive such that the terms of her employment were altered. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment on Moser\u2019s hostile environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Moser next maintains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against her on her quid pro quo sexual harassment claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Although quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment claims both arise under Title VII, each type of claim requires proof of an element that the other does not. To wit, to establish quid pro quo liability, a plaintiff must prove \u201cthat a tangible employment action resulted from a refusal to submit to a supervisor\u2019s sexual demands.\u201d <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 753, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998). In contrast, to establish a hostile environment claim, the plaintiff must prove that the objectionable conduct was \u201csevere or pervasive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 118 S.Ct. 2257.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In Moser\u2019s quid pro quo claim asserted in her complaint, Moser alleged that her \u201cexpress rejection of [Jones\u2019s] demands for sexual favors caused her termination.\u201d J.A. 19. The district court granted summary judgment against Moser on this claim (as well as on her discriminatory discharge claim), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">Under these facts, the court considers summary judgment on those claims to be uncontested. <em>See </em>L.R. 7.3(k), L.R. 56.1(e). Because Defendants\u2019 uncontested argument appears to be reasonable, summary judgment on those grounds will be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>J.A. 42.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s application of its local rules for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See Northwest Bank &amp; Tr. v.

The failure to file a response may cause the court to find that the motion is uncontested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">M.D.N.C. Local Rule 56.1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s application of its local rules. Moser\u2019s brief to the district court argued that Moser had presented a prima facie case of sexual harassment <em>amounting to a hostile work environment. </em>The brief then proceeded to present facts that Moser contended demonstrated that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to impose liability. It included no mention of quid pro quo liability or the elements that would establish such liability, and it did not identify any issue of material fact concerning those elements. Especially considering that Moser\u2019s brief did not assert that she could prove sexual harassment liability if the harassment were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a jury issue on hostile environment, the district court\u2019s application of its local rules was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">Moser next contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against her on her illegal retaliation claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">The relevant portion of Title VII provides: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Moser sought to establish her Title VII retaliation claim under the well-known <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting proof scheme. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under this scheme when she presents evidence that 1) she was engaged in a protected activity, 2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action, and 3) there was a causal link between the two.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Beall v. Abbott Labs., </em>130 F.3d 614, 619 (4th Cir.1997). In order to satisfy the first element, a plaintiff must proffer sufficient evidence that she had an objectively reasonable belief that she was complaining of conduct that constituted a Title VII violation. <em>See Jordan, </em>458 F.3d at 340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In granting summary judgment against Moser on this claim, the district court concluded that Moser had failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether she engaged in a protected activity. The court rejected Moser\u2019s claim that she \u201ccomplained to her employer about unlawful harassment\u201d because the complaints she relied on as constituting protected activity\u2014\u201ccomplaints about Wilkes\u201d\u2014did not concern conduct that could reasonably believed to be prohibited by Title VII because it was mostly unrelated to gender. J.A. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Although Moser maintains that she in fact forecasted evidence that she engaged in protected activity, she does not directly challenge the district court\u2019s ruling that she failed to create a genuine factual issue regarding whether she reasonably believed that the conduct of Wilkes about which she complained violated Title VII. Moser now argues that she forecasted evidence of complaints about <em>Jones\u2019s </em>conduct that a jury could reasonably find constituted conduct protected under Title VII. In so doing, she does not so much as acknowledge\u2014let alone challenge\u2014the district court\u2019s determination that, in opposing Appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion on her retaliation claim, Moser relied exclusively on her complaints about Wilkes. We need not address the issue of whether Moser forecasted evidence of the record of her complaints of conduct of people other than Wilkes in light of the district court\u2019s unchallenged' determination that she did not present that legal theory in the district court. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (refusing to reverse summary judgment on the basis of an issue raised for the first time on appeal). We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment on Moser\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Moser finally argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against her on her state law claim that she was terminated in violation of North Carolina public policy since she was fired for refusing the sexual advances of her supervisor. The district court ruled against Moser on the basis that she did not highlight any forecasted evidence in support of her claim that Jones continually made sexual advances toward her and the court was not aware of any such evidence. Moser now argues that she forecasted evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Jones implicitly conditioned Moser\u2019s employment upon her consenting to have sex with him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Although North Carolina employees are generally terminable at will, an exception exists for discharges made in contravention of North Carolina public policy. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Coman v. Thomas Mfg. Co., </em>325 N.C. 172, 381 S.E.2d 445, 447 (1989). We have held that \u201c[w]hatever the breadth of the <em>Coman </em>exception, it most definitely includes firings resulting from an employee\u2019s refusal to follow his employer\u2019s instructions to violate the law.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Edison Bros. Apparel Stores, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 530, 534 (4th Cir.1991). Reasoning that a supervisor\u2019s requiring an employee to have sex with him in order to retain her job would amount to requiring her to commit prostitution, we have held that terminating an employee for refusing such demands constitutes a wrongful termination in violation of North Carolina public policy. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We, like the district court, see no evidence that Jones conditioned Moser\u2019s continuing employment on her consent to have sex with him. Jones\u2019s constant lechery (and eventual hostility) may well have ruined any opportunity Moser had to have a successful working relationship with him and caused Moser tremendous anguish in the process. However, Moser did not forecast any evidence that he sought to require her to have sex with him or even evidence that he asked her to have sex. The closest she came in that regard would have been her testimony concerning an incident in which Jones pushed her behind the back of his office door before backing up and asking, \u201cSerena, what do we need to do to get our relationship back on track?\u201d J.A. 266. We conclude that it would be simply too big a leap for a jury to be able to <em>reasonably </em>find that with that question he was asking her for some sort of sexual favor. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that there was no evidence that Jones had ever actually asked Moser for sex before; that at the time of the incident she did not believe he was asking for sex; and that when she responded that she did not know what they could do to improve their relationship, he gave no indication that he was suggesting anything sexual. On these facts, any finding that Jones actually propositioned Moser could only be based on rank speculation. We therefore conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this cause of action. <em>See Beale v. Hardy, </em>769 F.2d 213, 214 (4th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe nonmoving party ... cannot create a genuine issue of material fact through mere speculation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In sum, because we conclude that Mos-er forecasted evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the sexual conduct she complained of was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on that claim, and we remand to the district court for further proceedings. Finding no other error, we otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. Moser testified to this fact in her deposition, but shortly before, in the same deposition, she had testified that Jones had threatened to \"grab [her] butt\u201d rather than her breast.

When a plaintiff makes such a showing, the burden then shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption of retaliation by articulating a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation for its actions. <em>See Carter v. Ball, </em>33 F.3d 450, 460 (4th Cir.1994). The plaintiff then must prove that the offered explanation is false and that retaliation was the actual reason for the adverse action. <em>See Jiminez v. Mary Washington College, </em>57 F.3d 369, 377-78 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
