On appeal, Jenkins argues that under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) (2006), the district court should have considered whether time served on a Virginia sentence for a related offense would be credited by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), and if not, should have adjusted his sentence accordingly. The Government agrees that Jenkins\u2019 sentence should have been adjusted pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l). We vacate Jenkins\u2019 sentence and remand for the district court to consider USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">\u201c[I]f a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction\u201d and \u201cthat was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense,\u201d the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed as follows: (1) \u201cthe court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons;\u201d and (2) \u201cthe sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Jenkins\u2019 Virginia abduction conviction was \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for purposes of his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u201cwas the basis for an increase in the offense level\u201d because Jenkins\u2019 offense level was adjusted upward by four levels based on his commission of the firearm offense \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (defining \u201cSpecific Offense Characteristics\u201d for offense of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A) (specific offense characteristics determined on the basis of \u201call acts and omissions\u201d committed by the defendant). Therefore, Jenkins was eligible for concurrent sentences for his state and federal convictions (which the district court considered and ordered) and also for an adjustment of his federal sentence for the time he served in state custody pursuant to the state abduction conviction (which the district court declined to consider). Because federal law does not credit to a federal sentence time that will be credited to a state sentence, it is clear that the BOP would not credit Jenkins\u2019 federal sentence for time served on the state charge. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 53.1-187. Thus, while the district court indicated that it had no role in the matter, the court should have considered and applied USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) to adjust Jenkins\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Accordingly, we vacate Jenkins\u2019 sentence and remand to the district court with directions to follow the dictates of USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) in resentencing Jenkins. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
