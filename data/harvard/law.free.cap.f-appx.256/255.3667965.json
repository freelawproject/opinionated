In 1990, Alebord was convicted of one count of possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (2), and sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, in accordance with the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines provisions. Alebord contends he should be resentenced because the Supreme Court subsequently held the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">With limited exceptions, a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. One exception is \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o),\u201d where, \u201cupon motion of the defendant ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">We previously held <em>Booker </em>is not a retroactively applicable Guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, and is not a ground on which a defendant\u2019s sentence can be reduced pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Alebord\u2019s motion to modify his sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1219 (reviewing a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
