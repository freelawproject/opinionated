Reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurers de novo, <em>Hobbs v. Alcoa, Inc., </em>501 F.3d 395, 397 (5th Cir.2007), we affirm for the following reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-21\">1. The insurers\u2019 duty to defend is governed by Texas state law, which requires the court to examine only the \u201ceight corners\u201d of the underlying pleadings and the plain language of the insurance policies. <em>Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. Reyna, </em>401 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-22\">2. Appellant Martinez argues that the relevant policies and schedules read as a whole show that Autobuses is an insured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She urges that Auto-buses is an insured because the bus that it leased to Ronald Drummer is listed as a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d The policy states that the insurers are liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>for damages that \u201can insured\u201d legally must pay, and it lists only \u201cRonald Drummer DBA Tres Amigos Tours\u201d as the named insured. Although the \u201cAdditional Insured-Lessor\u201d endorsement modifies the \u201cwho is an insured\u201d provision to include \u201cthe lessor named in the Schedule or in the Declarations,\u201d the district court correctly observed that Auto-buses is not named in any schedule or declaration. The lessor endorsement names as an additional insured only MCI/Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Therefore, the plain language of the policy shows that Autobuses is not an insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">3. Martinez next argues that Autobuses is an insured because a certificate of insurance states that Autobuses is \u201clisted as an Additional Insured see schedule attached.\u201d No schedule was attached to this certificate, which specifically provided that it \u201cconfer[red] no rights\u201d and did not \u201camend, extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies.\u201d In light of this language, Texas law provides that the certificate of insurance does not supersede the plain language of the insurance policy. <em>See TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James of Washington, </em>184 F.Supp.2d 591, 597 (S.D.Tex.2001). Furthermore, we find no ambiguity in the policy language or in the absence of Auto-buses as a named insured under the policy, and we note that extrinsic evidence may not be used to create an ambiguity. <em>See Valmont Energy Steel, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>359 F.3d 770, 773-74 (5th Cir.2004). Because the district court correctly determined that Autobuses is not an insured under the relevant policy language, it correctly held that the insurers have no duty to defend or indemnify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">4. Martinez also argues that the insurers are estopped from denying coverage because they assumed the defense of both Drummer and Autobuses without obtaining a reservation of rights or a non-waiver agreement. <em>See Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Kitty Hawk Airways, Inc., </em>964 F.2d 478, 480-81 (5th Cir.1992). The record shows that the insurers undertook a defense of Drummer, but Martinez points to no evidence that they also assumed the defense of Autobuses. In a letter to Autobuses\u2019 counsel National Fire denied that Autobuses was an insured and declined to defend. Martinez cites only to an opinion letter from an expert stating that both insurers assumed Autobuses\u2019 defense. This conclusory letter is insufficient to avoid summary judgment. <em>See In re Segerstrom, </em>247 F.3d 218, 227 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that conclusory statements in expert\u2019s affidavit were unsupported by evidence and failed to create a genuine issue of material fact).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-23\">. Martinez apparently claims an interest in this matter as a judgment creditor. We assume that she is a proper appellant with standing to raise this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
