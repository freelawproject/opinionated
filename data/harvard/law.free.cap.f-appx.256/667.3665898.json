He has also moved for reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s denial of an extension of time in which to file a reply brief. Abimbola untimely petitioned this court for review of the BIA\u2019s August 2, 2005, denial of his third motion for reconsideration. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of that motion. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676-77 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">Abimbola argues that the BIA erred in determining that he was ineligible to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c) and, additionally, that he was erroneously deemed removable as an aggravated felon. The Second Circuit has already expressly held that Abimbola\u2019s Connecticut conviction was an aggravated felony. <em>Abimbola v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 173, 177-80 (2d Cir.2004). Therefore, the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel prevent Abimbola from relitigating that claim. <em>See Moch v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </em>548 F.2d 594, 596 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">With regard to his eligibility for former INA \u00a7 212(c) relief, Abimbola has failed to carry his burden of establishing that his aggravated felony conviction was obtained by a plea agreement reached prior to April 1, 1997. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(a), (c). The June 20, 2005, correspondence from Connecticut\u2019s Senior Assistant Public Defender, which Abimbola contends establishes that his failure to appear did not invalidate his initial plea, was adduced as evidence only for purposes of his third motion for reconsideration, which the BIA denied as numerically barred and from which he did not file a timely petition for review. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the issue whether Abimbola\u2019s new evidence renders the BIA\u2019s merits determination erroneous. <em>See Navarro-Miranda, </em>330 F.3d at 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">Abimbola additionally argues that the BIA erred in upholding the immigration judge\u2019s credibility finding with respect to Abimbola\u2019s applications for withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and that the BIA erred in denying the remainder of Abimbola\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred. In conformity with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(g)(4), the BIA rejected on the merits Abimbola\u2019s argument that he was eligible for an INA \u00a7 212(c) waiver and did not hold the motion to reopen untimely or numerically barred for purposes of that claim. In conformity with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), the BIA\u2019s determination that the motion to reopen was untimely and numerically barred precluded it from reaching the arguments that were unrelated to INA \u00a7 212(c) eligibility, i.e., that he was entitled to withholding of removal and relief under the CAT based on erroneous credibility determinations and the actions of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">To the extent Abimbola asks this court to review his entitlement to withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, contending that the immigration judge\u2019s factual and credibility finding were erroneous, such an argument fails to raise either a constitutional issue or a question of law, and, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
