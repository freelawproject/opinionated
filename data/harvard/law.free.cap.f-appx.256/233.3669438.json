We see no reversible error; and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The record shows that Defendant and a co-conspirator, Wesley Wayne Adkins (\u201cAdkins\u201d), transported drugs from California to Panama City, Florida, where they separated while Defendant met with prospective buyers. After local law enforcement responded to a call reporting suspicious activity at a convenience store, Adkins admitted that controlled substances were located in a nearby vehicle and was arrested. After <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Adkins admitted to the drug conspiracy and showed police where he had hidden a gun just before the police\u2019s arrival at the convenience store. After impoundment of the vehicle, a routine search uncovered 850 grams (mixed) and 611.6 grams (actual) of methamphetamine, some drug paraphernalia, and several forms of identification for Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">Defendant pleaded guilty to all counts of the indictment. The Pre-Sentencing Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) proposed a sentencing range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on the drug quantity involved, the possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator, and Defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and criminal history. The PSI also referenced Defendant\u2019s many earlier drug and stolen property-related arrests. At the sentencing hearing, Defendant did not object to the PSI, but requested a reduced sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on several factors, including: (1) Adkins\u2019s reduced sentence;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) Defendant\u2019s education and previous employment; (3) Defendant\u2019s lack of criminal history, including the lack of convictions for ten years and the lack of conviction on the arrests referenced in the PSI; (4) Defendant\u2019s cooperation with investigators; and (5) the advisory nature of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">In denying Defendant\u2019s request for a downward departure and announcing the 150-month sentence, the district court stated that \u201cwhat [Defendant requested] might be appropriate for a novice who had sort of stumbled unwisely on their first adventure, but from what I see here, even though there may not have been arrests or whatever, [Defendant] is certainly a seasoned veteran in the eyes of law enforcement.\u201d The court also noted that Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>dant had already received a safety-valve reduction for his cooperation with investigators and did not merit an additional reduction. The court then adopted the PSI\u2019s sentencing calculation and concluded that the mid-range sentence was appropriate \u201c[u]pon review of all factors properly considered under 18 U.S.Code, section 8553(a), and taking into account the advisory nature of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not give proper weight to the section 3553(a) mitigating factors and relied too heavily on the Guidelines. He specifically contends that the sentencing court did not consider his continued employment, college education, or that the crime was motivated by his own drug use. He also argues that the Court did not give proper weight to his lack of criminal history and failed to consider Adkins\u2019s reduced sentence and Defendant\u2019s lack of connection to the firearm Adkins hid from the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, he asserts that the Guidelines\u2019 heavy reliance on drug quantity resulted in an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264-65, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although a sentence within the Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we have noted that we would \u201cordinarily\u201d expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id.; see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (concluding that court of appeals may apply non-binding presumption of reasonableness to a properly calculated Guidelines-range sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertions, a review of the record shows that the district court in this case considered Defendant\u2019s arguments and the section 3553(a) mitigating factors in imposing a sentence at the middle of the applicable Guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. The district court\u2019s reliance on the Guidelines range was not erroneous, as the court did take the section 3553(a) factors into account and the sentence was ultimately case-specific. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185-86 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding sentence as reasonable where the court expressly acknowledged that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors and \u201cultimately decided to give considerable weight to the Guidelines in this case\u201d). The court was not required to analyze specifically and accept or reject each of Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>arguments. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d); <em>accord Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469 (\u201cWhere ... the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">As in <em>Scott, </em>the district court heard lengthy arguments from Defendant and his counsel on circumstances that might warrant a reduced sentence and specifically responded to some of Defendant\u2019s arguments, including his criminal history argument. Adkins received a reduced sentence because he implicated Defendant and informed police about the gun, which otherwise may not have been discovered; the district court could therefore reasonably view Adkins\u2019s cooperation as more substantial. And, we have earlier rejected Defendant\u2019s argument that the perceived harshness of penalties for drug offenders is an appropriate basis for a lower sentence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that a court\u2019s general disagreement with Congress\u2019s policy decision regarding the severity of punishment for crack cocaine offenses is an improper basis for sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">When coupled with the court\u2019s statement that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors, the transcript adequately shows consideration of section 3553(a). <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30 (noting that such a \u201cstatement alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that Defendant has failed to show that the district court did not comply with <em>Booker. </em>Because the district court imposed a reasonable sentence after considering the factors listed in U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), we affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">. Adkins was sentenced to 108 months' imprisonment for the drug conviction and for illegal possession of a firearm. Adkins\u2019s sentence was based in part on a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1 for substantial assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">. Defendant does not explicitly argue that the firearm enhancement was improperly applied to him. Thus, he has waived the argument. <em>See United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006). In any event, Defendant acknowledges that he did not challenge in the district court the firearm enhancement and concedes that the government proffered that Adkins would state that Defendant knew about the gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-13\">. Defendant urges <em>de novo </em>review, but <em>Booker </em>clearly requires us to review an ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264-65, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Government, in turn, argues that we should review only for plain error because Defendant did not raise a specific objection to the reasonableness of his sentence below. But, we need not resolve that question here because of our conclusion that Defendant\u2019s sentence satisfies the higher reasonableness standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
