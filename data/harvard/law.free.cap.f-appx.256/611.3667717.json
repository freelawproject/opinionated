Palmer petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on his habeas petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). Palmer seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">In August 2007, we ordered the Government to file a response to Palmer\u2019s petition. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket reveals that, in the interim period between the Government\u2019s submission of its response and our adjudication of the petition, Palmer moved in the district court to withdraw his \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court recently granted Palmer\u2019s motion and dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition with prejudice. Accordingly, the instant mandamus petition is now moot and we deny it as such. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
