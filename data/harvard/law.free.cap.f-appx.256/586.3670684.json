We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-23\">Howe worked as an asset manager for FT Mortgage for four years. In 1997, Howe was forced to stop working by a heart condition and began receiving short-term disability benefits under FT Mortgage\u2019s benefits plan. On September 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1997, near the end of Howe\u2019s short-term disability period, a benefits counselor at FT Mortgage sent Howe a letter stating that he understood that Howe might be applying for long-term disability benefits under the plan. The 1997 letter explained the long-term disability benefits Howe would receive if Howe\u2019s application were approved and concluded: \u201c[y]our Long-Term Disability Benefits will continue until 03/06/2020 as long you remain disabled. At that time, you will be eligible to retire from First Tennessee Bank.\u201d The statement that Howe\u2019s long-term disability benefits would continue until March 6, 2020 when Howe became eligible to retire was in error because Howe would be 80 years old in 2020 and would have been eligible to retire 15 years earlier at age 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In a separate action in 1998, Howe sued FT Mortgage and First Tennessee to recover certain retention and severance benefits he believed he was due. The parties settled the lawsuit. Under the settlement agreement, FT Mortgage and First Tennessee agreed to pay Howe $22,144 plus attorney\u2019s fees. In return, Howe agreed to release FT Mortgage and First Tennessee from all liability to him except for certain stock options and for the \u201cbenefits outlined in the September 3, 1997 letter from the Company to Mr. Howe ... subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying prospectus and plan documents that govern those benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">Howe brought this state law contract action claiming that the 1998 settlement agreement, which incorporated the 1997 letter, provided that he would receive long-term disability benefits until 2020 and that FT Mortgage and First Tennessee breached that agreement by terminating benefits at age 65, in 2005. Alternatively, Howe sought leave to amend his complaint to claim that the 1998 settlement agreement and letter constituted an ERISA plan. The district court held that ERISA preempted Howe\u2019s state law contract claim. The court also denied Howe leave to amend because the settlement agreement did not create an ERISA plan and that even if the agreement had created a plan, it was expressly subject to the existing plan\u2019s documents which provide that eligibility for long-term disability terminates when the employee reaches 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">We agree with the district court and affirm on its reasoning, which we see no reason to explore further here. We also affirm on the additional ground that whether we were to apply Maryland contract law or ERISA to the 1998 settlement agreement, we would reach the same result because the settlement agreement is expressly and unambiguously subject to the same underlying plan documents and under those plan documents Howe\u2019s disability benefits terminated at age 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Construction of the meaning of an agreement begins with the language of the agreement. When the language employed is unambiguous, the court is required to give effect to its ordinary, natural or plain meaning. <em>Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. City of Rock Hill, </em>501 F.3d 368, -(4th Cir.2007) (stating that objective interpretation of contracts gives force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>to the language of the contract when it is plain and capable of legal construction); <em>Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, </em>150 Md.App. 604, 822 A.2d 551 (Md.2003); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The 1998 settlement agreement expressly subjects Howe\u2019s disability benefits to the terms and conditions of FT Mortgage\u2019s plan documents. The plan documents terminate long-term disability benefits at the time of retirement eligibility, age 65. Howe attempts to create ambiguity by claiming that only the stock options listed after the disability benefits in the settlement agreement are subject to plan documents. However, this court reads the entire sentence and finds that the unambiguous language of the settlement agreement forecloses any further argument. Howe\u2019s benefits are subject to FT Mortgage\u2019s benefits plan, and that plan terminates benefits at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Therefore, this court finds that Howe is entitled only to long-term disability benefits provided for in FT Mortgage\u2019s ERISA plan until age 65, not until 2020 when he reaches age 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">For the reasons stated above, this court affirms the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-15\">.
