On appeal, Tyler argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, and that it is excessive in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">I. Reasonableness of Tyler\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After <em>Booker, </em>sentencing requires two steps: first, the district court must correctly calculate the guideline range; second, the district court must consider several factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in arriving at a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Tyler does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>challenge the calculation of his guideline range, but rather contends that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">A sentence may be procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA sentence may be unreasonable if it is the product of a procedure that does not follow <em>Booker\u2019s </em>requirements, regardless of the actual sentence. Additionally, a sentence may be substantively unreasonable, regardless of the procedure used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our reasonableness review is deferential, and requires us to \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [\u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable in light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court is required to consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 <em>(citing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court shall impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of factors two through five listed above. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). It is sufficient for the district court to acknowledge that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it need not explicitly discuss each of them. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Necessarily, there are also \u201csentences outside the range of reasonableness that do not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a) and that thus the district court may not impose.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">In the instant case, Tyler contends that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider his lack of criminal history, age, and drug addiction. The district court, however, did in fact consider these mitigating factors by considering Tyler\u2019s sentencing memorandum and the pre-sentence investigation report. Furthermore, the district court expressly found that Tyler\u2019s conduct was not attributable to his drug abuse. Tyler also argues that the district court was not permitted to rely on factors incorporated in the calculation of his guideline range when conducting a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This argument, however, is not supported by our case law. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Tyler argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court created an unwarranted sentencing disparity. He cites various district court cases in which defendants convicted of child pornography offenses received sentences no greater than 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Assuming without deciding that this approach is acceptable, the cases cited are distinguishable from the instant case because, unlike Tyler\u2019s conduct, none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of the defendants in those cases engaged in repeated sexual misconduct with multiple children including the defendant\u2019s adopted son, documented that conduct, and transmitted it over the Internet. Tyler has, thus, not demonstrated an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Furthermore, Tyler has not demonstrated that his sentence was otherwise substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">II. Tyler\u2019s Eighth Amendment Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We review Tyler\u2019s Eighth Amendment challenge for plain error because Tyler failed to raise this issue in the district court. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cThe Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments, contains a narrow proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences.\u201d <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 20, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1185, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (quotations omitted). Outside the context of capital punishment, the Supreme Court has made clear that successful challenges to the proportionality of sentences are exceedingly rare. <em>Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1323. In reviewing an Eighth Amendment challenge, the defendant has the burden to make a threshold showing that \u201cthe sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense committed....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We have held that, \u201c[i]n general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted); <em>accord United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243-44 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 462, 166 L.Ed.2d 329 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Tyler argues that his sentence was excessive in violation of the Eighth Amendment. This argument fails because the district court sentenced Tyler to the statutory maximum on all three counts. Because the court sentenced Tyler within statutory limits, Tyler has not made the required threshold showing of disproportionality. <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243. Thus, Tyler\u2019s sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">. We need not address the government's contention that plain error applies because we can affirm Tyler\u2019s sentence even under a review for reasonableness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
