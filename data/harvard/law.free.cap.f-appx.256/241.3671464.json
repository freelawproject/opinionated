(\u201cAMEX\u201d), by a former employee, Maria Cuevas, under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a), and the Florida Civil Rights Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) of 1992, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.01, <em>et. seq. </em>Cuevas claimed that AMEX discharged her from her employment on account of her sex. AMEX, in response, denied that it discriminated against Cuevas as alleged and asserted, moreover, that it discharged Cuevas for legitimate non-diseriminatory reasons. AMEX moved the district court for summary judgment, and the court granted the motion, on alternative grounds. First, it concluded that Cuevas failed to establish a material issue of fact regarding a crucial element of her <em>prima facie </em>case\u2014that AMEX treated a similarly situated male employee more favorably. Second, assuming for sake of argument that Cuevas actually established that element, the court concluded that she failed to create an issue of fact as to whether AMEX\u2019s non-discriminatory reasons for discharging her were a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>pretext for discrimination. Cuevas now appeals the court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In her brief, Cuevas argues: that the district court erred in failing to find the existence of a genuine issue of material fact under a mixed-motive analysis because AMEX\u2019s decision to discharge her was \u201ctainted with gender-based animus\u201d; that the court utilized the improper \u201cnearly identical\u201d standard in determining that she had not satisfied the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d prong of her <em>prima facie </em>case; that the court should have applied instead a \u201ccomparable seriousness\u201d standard; and that the record reveals a material issue of fact as to whether AMEX\u2019s proffered reasons for her termination were a pretext for gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discharging an employee on the basis of sex. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). When a plaintiffs Title VII claim of racial discrimination is based on circumstantial evidence, as it is here, the claim is evaluated under the so-called <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 98 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, the plaintiff may show that: \u201c(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to adverse employment action; (3) her employer treated similarly situated male employees more favorably; and (4) she was qualified to do the job.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999). Where, as here, the plaintiff claims that the employer discriminated against her in meting out discipline, in determining whether the plaintiff and the employees she says are similarly situated, \u201cwe evaluate whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct [must] be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Maniccia, </em>171 F.3d at 1368. Although the \u201cnearly identical\u201d misconduct requirement was called into question by <em>Alexander v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>207 F.3d 1303, 1334 (11th Cir.2000), we are \u201cbound to follow <em>Manic</em>cia\u2019s \u2018nearly identical\u2019 standard rather than the standard articulated in <em>Alexander </em>because when a later panel decision contradicts an earlier one, the earlier panel decision controls.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1323 n. 2. In any event, Cuevas fails to satisfy either standard in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">In <em>Burke-Fowler, </em>the plaintiff, an African-American correctional officer, claimed racial discrimination in the form of disparate treatment after she was fired for violating anti-fraternization policies when she married an inmate she met while the inmate was incarcerated at the prison where she worked. 447 F.3d at 1321-22. She asserted that similarly situated white employees were treated more favorably because they were not let go when they fraternized with inmates. <em>Id. </em>at 1324. We held that the comparators did not engage in misconduct that was \u201cnearly identical\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s, noting that two of the comparators had relationships with individuals who <em>subsequently </em>became incarcerated and two others were not romantically involved with inmates. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. We therefore affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Cuevas failed to show that her comparator, Octavio Cespedes, was similarly situated to her, and thus failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. She also failed to raise an issue of material fact as to whether AMEX\u2019s reasons for discharging her were pretextual. AMEX was therefore entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">. Cuevas also appeals the court's denial of her motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Since the motion essentially repeated the arguments she made in opposition to AMEX\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we need not mention it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
