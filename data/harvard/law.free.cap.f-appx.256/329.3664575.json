Gomez-Carreno first argues that he was entitled to a minor role reduction in his total sentence under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because he played only the minor role of driving the van with cocaine, and because his role was subordinate to other members of the conspiracy. Second, he argues that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence because (1) it improperly presumed that a sentence within the guidelines range was reasonable, which placed a burden on him to overcome that presumption, thereby rendering the guidelines mandatory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) it failed to consider his cooperation with authorities regarding other participants in the drug conspiracy, a relevant factor in his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-23\">We affirm. First, the record demonstrates that the district court did not clearly err in denying Gomez-Carreno\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>request for a minor role reduction as Gomez-Carreno was not a minor participant in the drug transaction for which he was held responsible, and he was not substantially less culpable than the other participants in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Second, the record does not support Gomez-Carreno\u2019s argument that the district court presumed that a sentence within the guidelines range was reasonable. We are satisfied that the district court adequately considered the statutory sentencing factors and the record shows that the district court properly considered his argument regarding his cooperation with authorities. Gomez-Carreno fails to demonstrate that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-17\">. Gomez-Carreno challenges only the procedural reasonableness of his total sentence, because he argues that the district court's sentencing procedure, in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his arguments, was unreasonable. He never argues that his 78-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>month total sentence is substantively unreasonable, in light of all the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
