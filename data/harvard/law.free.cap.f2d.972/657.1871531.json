Our authority to review final orders of deportation lies in section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1105a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Ayo Martins (\u201cMartins\u201d), a native and citizen of Nigeria, entered the United States in 1981 on a student visa. He is married to a U.S. citizen and has two U.S. citizen children. In April 1986, Martins was convicted of conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), and 846. He was sentenced to 15 years incarceration and three years special parole. While Martins was serving his sentence, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) served him with an Order to Show Cause why he should not be deported, based upon his convictions, as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 ^(aXll).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">At his deportation hearing, Martins conceded his deportability, as charged by the INS, admitting that he was convicted for the above-described offenses. Martins then requested a continuance and advised the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) that he would be submitting an application for political asylum. The IJ expressed doubt that Martins was eligible to obtain asylum as an alien convicted of a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d. Under the INS regulations concerning asylum, an alien convicted of a particularly serious crime is held to be a danger to the community and cannot apply for asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">The IJ accepted Martins\u2019 asylum application for identification purposes only, and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether a person convicted of a particularly serious crime can apply for and receive asylum. The IJ noted that neither party, briefed this precise issue. The INS argued that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d), aliens convicted of aggravated felonies<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are precluded from applying for or obtaining asylum. Martins argued that he would experience extreme hardship if deported to Nigeria because he would be subject to criminal prosecution in that country. Without reaching whether the convictions were \u201caggravated felonies\u201d under the new statute, the IJ found that Martins was convicted of at least one \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that this, in and of itself, was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>cient to pretermit Martins\u2019 application under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.14(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s ruling, finding that Martins\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of deportation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> must be denied. The BIA based its holding on the language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(2), which provides, in pertinent part, that the withholding of deportation provision shall not apply if an alien, \u201chaving been convicted by final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States.\u201d The BIA further noted that the new asylum regulations applied to all applications for asylum or withholding of deportation that are filed on or after October 1, 1990. Since Martins\u2019 application for asylum was filed on March 7, 1991, it was properly denied under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Martins now contends that the IJ and the BIA erred in not allowing him to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation. Martins also contends that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of relevant statutes is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AXrQ\">A. The Application for Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">First, Martins argues that he was improperly precluded from applying for asylum because the IJ and the BIA misinterpreted 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.14 on mandatory denials of asylum. Their interpretation will be upheld if it is reasonable and not contrary to congressional intent. <em>Martinez-Montoya v. I.N.S., </em>904 F.2d 1018, 1021 (5th Cir.1990), citing <em>Martin v. Kilgore First Bancorp., </em>747 F.2d 1024 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Martins\u2019 argument is without merit because Martins is statutorily ineligible to apply for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d). Subsection (d) to \u00a7 1158 was added by the 1990 Immigration Act and states that \u201can alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, ..., may not apply for or be granted asylum.\u201d The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d was first defined in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (\u201cADAA\u201d) codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and includes any \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Martins\u2019 heroin convictions are within the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d. Therefore, Martins\u2019 conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under the ADAA definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">Martins next contends that he is not an aggravated felon because he was convicted in 1986 and the aggravated felony provision was adopted as part of the ADAA in 1988. We must now decide whether section 1158(d) precludes an alien from applying for asylum if the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony prior to the effective date of the ADAA. This court has already addressed this issue, in a different context, in <em>Ignacio v. I.N.S., </em>955 F.2d 295 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc). In <em>Ignacio, </em>an alien was seeking to avoid the consequences of an Immigration Act provision, barring aggravated felons from invoking an automatic stay of deportation, because his conviction was prior to the ADAA. <em>Id. </em>at 297. In <em>Ignacio, </em>the court noted that the 1990 Immigration Act did not address the \u201csubstantive retroactivity question \u2014 when the [aggravated felony] conviction must have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, quoting <em>Ayala-Chavez v. I.N.S., </em>945 F.2d 288, 291 n. 5 (9th Cir.1991). The <em>Ignacio </em>court found that Congress answered this question in its 1991 Technical Amendments to the Immigration Act, which state that the 1990 amendments \u201capply to convictions entered before, on, or after [the effective] date.\u201d Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ments of 1991 (Technical Amendments), Pub.L. No. 102-232, 105 Stat. 1733, \u00a7 306(a)(11) (1991). Like the <em>Ignacio </em>court, we conclude that Congress inserted the \u201con, before, or after\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> language, into \u00a7 1158(d), in order to bar from asylum those aliens whose convictions fall under the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d, regardless of the date of those convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 298. We hold that Martins is an \u201caggravated felon\u201d under \u00a7 1158(d), and the BIA did not err in finding Martins ineligible to apply for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">B. The Application for Withholding of Deportation</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Martins alleges that the BIA erred in not allowing him to apply for a withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(2) for two reasons: first because the INS did not show that his crime was particularly serious and second, because there was no separate findings to show that he was a danger to the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Martins contends that the IJ must examine the underlying facts and circumstances of the conviction to determine if the crime is particularly serious. Section 1253(h)(2) was amended by the 1990 Immigration Act to provide that \u201can alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.\u201d Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-649 \u00a7 515(a)(2), 104 Stat. 4978, 5053 (1990). This amendment also applies to convictions for aggravated felonies entered \u201cbefore, on or after\u201d the date of the act (November 29, 1990). <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Martins\u2019 aggravated felony conviction constitutes a conviction for a particularly serious crime, as defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Martins\u2019 second contention is that under the wording. of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(2)(B), the INS is required to show that an alien has both committed a particularly serious crime and is a danger to the community. This Circuit has not yet confronted this question. However, both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have ruled that the statute does not require this dual showing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">The Eleventh Circuit based its decision on Congressional intent and the plain language of the statute. The statute \u201cdoes not connect its two clauses with a conjunction, rather the statute set[s] forth a cause and effect relationship: the fact that the alien has committed a particularly serious crime makes the alien dangerous within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Arauz v. Rivkind, </em>845 F.2d 271 (11th Cir.1988), citing <em>Crespo-Gomez v. Richard, </em>780 F.2d 932 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also, Zardui-Quintana v. Richard, </em>768 F.2d 1213, 1222 (11th Cir.1985) (Vance, J., concurring in result). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit holds that \u201cthe only finding required by section 1253(h)(2)(B) is that the alien has been convicted of a \u2018particularly serious crime\u2019.\u201d <em>Arauz, </em>845 F.2d at 275, citing <em>Crespo-Gomez, </em>780 F.2d at 934-35. Furthermore, the <em>Arauz </em>court said that since the \u201cnarcotics conviction was in the record, the Immigration Judge did not have to consider additional information concerning Arauz\u2019s request for deportation, because no amount of evidence would have negated the fact of Arauz\u2019s statutory ineligibility for withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Arauz, </em>845 F.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">In connection with the wording of \u00a7 1253(h)(2)(B), the Ninth Circuit has stated, \u201cthe participle phrase \u2018having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,\u2019 modifies the word \u2018alien\u2019 and thus limits those aliens who may be determined to be a danger to those who have been finally convicted of serious crimes.\u201d <em>Ramirez-Ramos v. I.N.S., </em>814 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>F.2d 1394, 1397 (9th Cir.1987). The court also holds that the statute only requires \u201cthe factual finding of conviction of a particularly serious crime to support the determination of danger to the community.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Martins bases his contention on two factors first, on the intent of Congress and second, on principles of grammar. Martins\u2019 congressional intent argument is based on a letter to the INS from Senator Edward Kennedy, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs. The letter suggests that Congress intended to require the INS to make a dual showing of a conviction for an aggravated felony and a danger to the community. However, this interpretation is in direct conflict with the legislative history accompanying the Refugee Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The House Judiciary Committee Report clearly states that the act intended to make those aliens, \u201cwho have been convicted of a particularly serious crime which makes them a danger to the community\u201d, ineligible for a withholding of deportation. H.R.Rep. No. 608, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1979), cited in <em>Zardui-Quintana, </em>768 F.2d at 1222 (Vance, J., concurring in result). Although the Senate version of the Refugee Act was passed, the final version incorporated the House provisions on Asylum and Withholding of Deportation. <em>Zardui-Quintana, </em>768 F.2d at 1222 (Vance, J., concurring in result), citing S.Conf.Rep., No. 590, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1980), U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1980, p. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In his concurring opinion in <em>Zardui-Quintana, </em>Judge Vance discusses the practical problems which would result from a dual findings requirement. \u201cA separate determination of an alien\u2019s potential dangerousness would require a prediction as to an alien\u2019s potential for recidivism and would lead to extensive, drawn-out hearings complete with psychological evaluations and expert testimony. <em>Zardui-Quin-tana, </em>768 F.2d at 1222-23 (Vance J., concurring in result). The fact that Congress did not address these potential problems indicates that it did not intend to burden the INS with these complexities. <em>Id. </em>at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Martins also argues that basic principles of grammar dictate that participle modifiers set off by commas are not essential to the principal thought of the sentence and therefore, the wording of section 1253(h)(2)(B) requires a separate showing of a danger to the community. However, even accepting this principle arguendo, it does not further Martins\u2019 claim. The statute requires a showing of a danger to the community, and Congress clearly intended that a conviction of a particularly serious crime is sufficient to show a danger to the community. <em>See, Zardui-Quintana, </em>768 F.2d at 1222, and <em>Ramirez-Ramos, </em>814 F.2d at 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">In summary, based on the rationale of these prior decisions and the intent of Congress, we now join the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits in holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(2)(B) requires only a showing that the defendant was convicted of a particularly serious crime. We hold, therefore, that the BIA\u2019s decision to deny the withholding of deportation is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Zamora-Morel v. I.N.S., </em>905 F.2d 833, 838 (5th Cir.1990) (review of BIA\u2019s conclusion on withholding is subject to \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">C. The Constitutional Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Martins\u2019 final argument is that the BIA's interpretations of the withholding of deportation and asylum statutes violate the Fifth Amendment principles of Due Process.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">Martins correctly states that aliens subject to deportation are entitled to a fair hearing. <em>Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, </em>339 U.S. 33, 49-50, 70 S.Ct. 445, 454, 94 L.Ed. 616 (1950). However, Martins did receive a hearing on his deportation and was found by an IJ to be deportable. Martins\u2019 claim then goes one step further to allege that he was entitled to a \u201cfull and fair\u201d hearing not only on deportation, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>also on his applications for asylum and withholding. The Eleventh Circuit, while reviewing a denial of a request for withholding of deportation, stated that because the \u201cnarcotics conviction was in the record, the immigration judge did not need to consider additional information ... because no amount of evidence would have negated the fact of statutory ineligibility for withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Arauz, </em>845 F.2d at 275. Furthermore, this Court has ruled that \u201cabsent statute or regulation requiring a hearing, we see no reason why, and are cited to no authority supporting that, due process is offended if no hearing is granted on an application that on its face must be denied as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Dominguez v. I.N.S., </em>780 F.2d 1203, 1206 (5th Cir.1986) (Aliens were not denied due process when they did not receive hearing on their application for suspension of deportation where their application on its face showed failure to meet threshold requirement of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">Martins relies on the <em>Arauz </em>case to establish that an application for asylum requires an \u201cindividual balancing of all relevant factors\u201d. <em>Arauz </em>required a hearing on an application of asylum, but the ruling was based on the INS regulations that were in place at that time. <em>Arauz, </em>845 F.2d at 275-76. The Attorney General has since revised the regulations in an attempt \u201cto overcome the line of decisions, represented by <em>Arauz.\u201d </em>53 Fed.Reg. 28232 (1988) (codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208). The regulation now lists conditions for mandatory denials of asylum applications<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and also expressly state that a hearing is not required for mandatory denials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\">We, therefore, cannot agree that an alien would be entitled, under the Due Process principles of the Fifth Amendment, to a hearing on an application, which he is statutorily ineligible to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the BIA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\">.
