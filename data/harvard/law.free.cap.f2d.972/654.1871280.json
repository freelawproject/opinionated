Halver-son appeals the dismissal of his action against the government, Defendant-Appel-lee herein, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). The district court\u2019s dismissal was grounded in the exception found in \u00a7 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) for claims based on loss of goods and merchandise obtained by law enforcement officers, thus presenting this circuit its first opportunity to consider that issue. We hold that the subject exception is not limited to losses resulting from detention of goods and merchandise by customs or tax officers only, but is applicable to claims arising from the detention of goods and merchandise by any federal law enforcement officers in the performance of their lawful duties, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauper-is, </em>Halverson filed a complaint against the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) under the FTCA, seeking $5,735 in damages for the alleged loss of his personal property. Halverson had been arrested at an immigration checkpoint when Border Patrol agents found cocaine concealed under the back seat of the car in which he was a passenger. In seeking recompense for the loss of personal belongings\u00a1 Halver-son alleges that the arresting agent took possession of the missing articles and that his resulting loss was caused by the arresting officers\u2019 failure to follow proper inventory procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">The government filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) for Hal-verson\u2019s failure to file his complaint within six months following the denial of his administrative claim. Halverson responded to the government\u2019s motion and also filed a motion of his own for summary judgment. In its response to Halverson\u2019s summary judgment motion the government conceded that his complaint was filed timely. The government alleged, however, that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Halverson\u2019s claim was barred by an exception contained in \u00a7 2680(c) of the FTCA and therefore should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). The court denied Halverson\u2019s, motion for summary judgment and granted the government\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. Halverson\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">Halverson insists that the \u00a7 2680(c) exception applies to property losses involving customs or tax agents only, and is therefore inapplicable to the INS officers here implicated. The issue is <em>res nova </em>in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">The FTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity, providing general authority for tort suits against the government: \u201cThe United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances_\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 2680, however, creates several exceptions to this broad waiver of sovereign immunity, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>eluding one for damages resulting from the detention of goods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">(c) Any claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, <em>or the detention of any goods or merchandise by </em>any officer of customs or excise or <em>any other law-enforcement officer.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 2680(c) to cover not only damages <em>occurring </em>in the act of detention itself, but also those flowing from the detention, such as the negligent storing of antiques or art objects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court did not address, however, whether the \u00a7 2680(c) exception applies when the officers who detain such property are not customs or tax officials and are not acting in a customs or tax capacity. In fact, the Court expressly refused to decide what types of officers other than customs or tax were covered by the \u00a7 2680(c) exclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We have applied the \u00a7 2680 exclusion to IRS agents and customs officers,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but have not addressed its application to other law enforcement officers. Other circuits have found, however, that \u201cother law-enforcement officer\u201d may include officers in other agencies performing their proper duties. <em>See, e.g., Schleaebitz v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (luggage confiscated by U.S. Marshal); <em>Ysasi v. Rivkind,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(property confiscated by Immigration and Naturalization Service); <em>Formula One Motors v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (merchandise destroyed by the Drug Enforcement Agency); <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned </em>Beef,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (property seized by the Department of Agriculture).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">We find persuasive the reasoning of the other circuits, not to mention the plain language of \u00a7 2680(c) that exempts \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of ... the detention of any goods or merchandise by ... any other law-enforcement officer.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Halverson has not alleged that the Border Patrol agents acted outside their lawful authority; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> he alleges only that they were negligent in failing to follow proper inventory procedure. We hold that \u00a7 2680(c) exempts from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity any claim based on the detention of goods by any federal law enforcement officers in the performance of their lawful duties. The district court, therefore, committed no error in dismissing Halverson\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-18\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">. <em>Kosak v.
