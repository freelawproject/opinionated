Wife argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that it could not consider for equitable distribution funds defendant James Edward Standridge (\"Husband\") had deposited into his personal account and farm account but later withdrew. Because no claim for equitable distribution was filed after the parties' date of separation, the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the equitable distribution order, so we do not reach this issue on appeal and instead must vacate the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Husband and Wife were married on 26 November 1992. On 15 April 2015, Wife filed her complaint for divorce from bed and board and equitable distribution of the marital property. On 15 June 2015, Husband filed a motion to dismiss, answer, and counterclaims for divorce from bed and board and equitable distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A pretrial order was entered on 14 April 2016 and the parties stipulated to several facts, including their date of separation, 12 September 2015. On 21 January 2017, following a hearing, the trial court entered an equitable distribution order. In the order, the trial court found as fact that \"although this action was filed on April 15, 2015, the final date of separation of the parties for purposes of this trial and of this Order is by stipulation of the parties September 12, 2015.\" Wife timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Neither party raised a question of jurisdiction on appeal, but where the record shows subject matter jurisdiction does not exist, this Court should address it\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The question of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, even in the Supreme Court. When the record clearly shows that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking, the Court will take notice and dismiss the action\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   . Every court necessarily has the inherent judicial\n   power to inquire into, hear and determine questions of its own jurisdiction, whether of law or fact, the decision of which is necessary to determine the questions of its jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Lemmerman v.

Wife filed her complaint on 15 April 2015 requesting a divorce from bed and board from Husband. In her complaint, Wife noted that the parties\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   were married on November 26, 1992 in Richmond County, North Carolina, and lived together as husband and wife until sometime in 2004, and since that time, although they have continued to live under the same roof, they have\n   been living in a constant state of separation from each other, and have at no time since 2004 resumed the marital relationship which formerly existed between them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wife's 15 April 2015 complaint requested an equitable distribution of the marital property of the parties. Husband filed his motion,\n   answer, and counterclaim-including a claim for equitable distribution-on 15 June 2015. Husband alleged that the parties \"are not separated and continue to reside with one another in the same house as a married couple.\" Wife filed her reply to the Husband's counterclaim on or about 14 July 2015 and admitted \"that the parties continue to live in the same house[.]\" The parties stipulated in the pretrial order that their date of separation was 12 September 2015-roughly five months after Wife's complaint was filed and three months after Husband's counterclaim. Thus, while both parties raised a claim for equitable distribution, both raised it\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the date of separation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   No claim for equitable distribution was made after the date of separation, so the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over equitable distribution of the marital property.

It appears the basis for both motions (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that plaintiff and defendant were not separated at the time the ED claim was filed and it therefore was premature) was the same. ... In addressing the merits of the motion to dismiss, Judge Smith concluded that plaintiff's ED claim was not asserted after the date of separation and before the entry of the divorce, thus making it invalid. I agree. There are findings to support this conclusion and those findings are supported in this record. Because plaintiff had no valid ED claim prior to the time she dismissed it, the refiling of that same claim is also invalid.\"\n    <em>\n     Atkinson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236981\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/132/82/\">\n     132 N.C.
