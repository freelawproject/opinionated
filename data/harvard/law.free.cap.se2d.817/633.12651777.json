Carolinas argues the purpose and effect of the ALC's application of the CON Act, the Project Review Criteria, and the 2004-2005 State Health Plan is to protect Piedmont from out-of-state competition, and, therefore, such an application violates the Dormant Commerce Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill is the sole hospital in York County. It provides standard community hospital services as well as specialized services such as open heart surgery, neurosurgery, neonatal intensive care, and behavioral health. Amisub of South Carolina, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare Corporation, operates Piedmont Medical Center. Tenet Healthcare Corporation is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and owns forty-nine hospitals in ten states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carolinas, which is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, owns multiple hospitals in North Carolina with a large network of employed physicians, the Carolinas Physician Network (CPN), many of whom have practices in York County. As of the date of the final contested case hearing, Carolinas employed between seventy and ninety York County physicians. Additionally, Carolinas owns and operates Roper Hospital in downtown Charleston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2005, Piedmont, Carolinas, Presbyterian Healthcare System (Presbyterian), and Hospital\n   Partners of America, Inc. submitted applications to DHEC for a CON to build a sixty-four-bed hospital near Fort Mill based on the 2004-2005 State Health Plan's identification of a need for sixty-four additional acute care hospital beds in York County. Subsequently, Piedmont withdrew its application and submitted a new application for a one-hundred-bed hospital, which would include thirty-six beds transferred from Piedmont's Rock Hill facility to its proposed Fort Mill facility. In 2006, DHEC approved Piedmont's new application and denied the other three applications. Carolinas and Presbyterian filed separate requests for a contested case hearing before the ALC, which took place in September 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ALC concluded DHEC misinterpreted the 2004-2005 State Health Plan to allow only existing providers to obtain a CON. The ALC remanded the case to DHEC for a determination of which applicant most fully complied with the CON Act, the State Health Plan, Project Review Criteria,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and applicable\n   DHEC regulations. By October 2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the three remaining applicants submitted to DHEC additional information to supplement their respective applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2011, DHEC granted Carolinas' application and denied the applications of Piedmont and Presbyterian. Piedmont and Presbyterian submitted their respective requests for a contested case hearing before the ALC, and the ALC consolidated the cases. Presbyterian later withdrew its request, and the ALC dismissed Presbyterian as a party. The ALC ultimately ordered DHEC to award the CON to Piedmont. Carolinas filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, and the ALC issued an Amended Final Order denying the motion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Administrative Procedures Act governs the standard of review on appeal from a decision of the ALC, allowing this court to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) affected by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-23-380\">\n    S.C.

Further, Carolinas does not challenge the\n   constitutionality of the 2004-2005 State Health Plan or the Project Review Criteria. Rather, Carolinas argues the purpose and effect of the ALC's application of the CON Act, the\n   2004-2005 State Health Plan, and the Project Review Criteria is to protect Piedmont from out-of-state competition, and, therefore, such an application violates the Dormant Commerce Clause. Carolinas essentially challenges the ALC's conclusions of law concerning adverse impact and outmigration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On this record,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   we hold the ALC properly applied the provisions of the CON Act, the 2004-2005 State Health Plan, and the Project Review Criteria in considering the needs of residents in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   areas of York County and, therefore, did not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. The ALC placed appropriate significance on adverse impact, as required by the Project Review Criteria, and outmigration, as we explain herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We will address each criterion Carolinas references in turn. But first, we will provide a primer on the general principles surrounding the Dormant Commerce Clause and the general provisions of South Carolina's CON law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Dormant Commerce Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states.

In other words, the ALC assessed whether awarding a CON to Carolinas would have an adverse impact on Piedmont without assessing whether awarding the CON to Piedmont would have an adverse impact on Carolinas. Carolinas maintains the purpose underlying the ALC's analysis was to protect Piedmont from non-local competition and to reduce the number of South Carolinians seeking healthcare in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   a. Criterion 16(c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Criterion 16 is entitled \"Cost Containment (Minimizing Costs)\" and is grouped under the general category \"Economic Consideration.\" \u00a7\u00a7 801.1, 802.16. Criterion 16(c) states, \"The impact of the project upon the applicant's cost to provide services and the applicant's patient charges should be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The impact of the project upon the cost and charges of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   providers of similar services should be considered if the data are available.\" \u00a7 802.16 (emphasis added). Carolinas asserts (1) the ALC incorrectly included Criterion 16(c) in its adverse impact analysis and (2) the intent and effect of the ALC's application of this criterion was \"to protect the local hospital's profitability from being harmed by a new market entrant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In its conclusions of law regarding adverse impact, the ALC stated, \"The most heavily disputed application of the Project Review Criteria relates to DHEC's analysis of the Project Review Criteria on adverse impact.\" The ALC identified Criterion 16(c) as being included in the adverse impact criteria, and explained its conclusion that Piedmont best met Criterion 16(c) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The effect on Piedmont of the loss of over one thousand (1000) patients and millions of dollars a year will make it more difficult for the hospital to recoup its fixed costs. Its associated per unit cost per unit of services associated would increase. As a result, the operation of [Carolinas' proposed facility] would have an adverse effect on existing providers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Carolinas is correct in its observation that Criterion 16(c) is not grouped together with the criteria entitled \"Adverse Effects on Other Facilities,\" which falls under the general category of \"Health System Resources.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20Regs.%2061\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -15 \u00a7\u00a7 801.1, 802.23. However, the ALC was obviously aware of this when it recounted DHEC's establishment of the relative importance of the Project Review Criteria, which includes \"Cost Containment (16a-16c)\" in the group of the third-most-important criteria and \"Adverse Effects on Other Facilities (23a, 23b)\" in the group of the fourth-most-important criteria. Yet, when presented with the task of choosing\n   \"which applicant most fully complies with\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Criterion 16(c), the ALC focused on the second part of this criterion, which requires consideration of \"the impact of the project upon the cost and charges of other providers of similar services.\" \u00a7 802.16. Here, the ALC determined Carolinas' proposed facility would have an adverse impact on the cost and charges of Piedmont's existing facility. Therefore, it was logical for the ALC to\n   include its application of Criterion 16(c) within its discussion of adverse impact generally. Further, the protection of\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   providers' patients from increased costs is an obvious objective of Criterion 16(c), which Carolinas does not challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   b. Criterion 22\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Criterion 22 states, \"The existing distribution of the health service(s) should be identified and the effect of the proposed project upon that distribution should be carefully considered to functionally balance the distribution to the target population.\" \u00a7 802.22. This criterion falls under the general category of Health System Resources. \u00a7\u00a7 801.1, 802.22. Carolinas maintains the ALC concluded Piedmont best met Criterion 22 \"because increased competition from [Carolinas' proposed facility] would negatively impact Piedmont's ability to retain its staff physicians and receive their referrals.\" Carolinas argues the ALC applied Criterion 22 for the purpose of \"protecting an existing local hospital from competition from a non-local hospital.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The ALC explained its conclusion that Piedmont best met Criterion 22 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [T]he operation of [Carolinas' proposed facility] would have an adverse effect on the distribution of services provided by existing healthcare providers to the residents of York County. Section 802.22 calls for an evaluation of the effect of the proposed facility or service not only on Piedmont but also on other healthcare providers. Letters from over forty (40) physicians to DHEC during its staff review as well as the testimony of ... three physicians is compelling evidence that the ability of existing York County healthcare providers to serve residents of the county would be jeopardized by the operation of [Carolinas' proposed facility].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Carolinas states that despite the ALC's reference to the adverse effects on physicians, the ALC's findings of fact \"demonstrate that the ALC's primary concern was the extent to which changes in the physician market arising from the establishment of [Carolinas' proposed facility] would affect Piedmont.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, an adverse effect on Piedmont's existing facility alone would be sufficient to warrant the conclusion that Piedmont,\n   rather than Carolinas, better meets Criterion 22 because of the specialized services the existing facility offers. In its findings of fact, the ALC stated, \"In addition to standard community hospital services, Piedmont Medical Center provides specialized services not usually offered by a hospital its size, including open heart surgery, neurosurgery, cardiac catheterization, vascular surgery, neonatal intensive care, specialized women's and pediatric services, and behavioral health.\" Notably, Carolinas has not challenged any of the ALC's findings of fact as not being supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, the ALC's findings discussing the adverse impact on Piedmont that would result from physicians shifting their patient referrals from Piedmont's existing facility to Carolinas also referenced the likely adverse impact on physicians themselves. The ALC highlighted the testimony of a cardiology physician concerning the effect of awarding the CON to Carolinas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Dr. Singhi recognized the challenges that would exist if [Carolinas' proposed facility] was approved that would not permit his practice to maintain its present status (e.g.[,]\n   <em>\n    being able to refer and admit patients to any facility\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    his choosing at which he has privileges\n   </em>\n   ).... If the Carolina Cardiology Physicians become employed by [Carolinas], Dr. Singhi acknowledged that [Carolinas] would expect his group to comply with the CPN physician network referral policy and transfer patients from Piedmont to [Carolinas'] facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (emphasis added). The ALC also discussed the testimony of a pulmonologist illustrating the impact Carolinas' proposed facility would have on not only Piedmont's existing specialty services but also specialty physicians' ability to maintain their proficiency as to certain skills due to the decline in the demand for those skills. The ALC found that the \"[l]oss or paring of Piedmont's specialty programs would be detrimental to York County citizens,\n   <em>\n    especially those living in the western, more rural part of the county farther away from [Carolinas'] specialty facilities in North Carolina\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). Again, Carolinas has not challenged any of the ALC's findings of fact as not being supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The ALC properly identified the \"existing distribution of the health service(s),\" as required by Criterion 22, by referencing Piedmont and physician providers in York County. Further, the ALC properly considered the impact Carolinas' proposed facility would have on that distribution in order \"to functionally balance the distribution to the target population.\" The ALC implicitly recognized that, in balancing the distribution of health system resources, DHEC may not ignore the needs of citizens in the western part of York County now being served by Piedmont and physicians practicing in that area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   c. Criterion 23(a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Criterion 23 is entitled \"Adverse Effects on Other Facilities\" and falls under the general category of Health System Resources. \u00a7\u00a7 801.1, 802.23. Criterion 23(a) states, \"The impact on the current and projected occupancy rates or use rates of existing facilities and services should be weighed against the increased accessibility offered by the proposed services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Carolinas argues the ALC focused solely on the adverse financial impact that Carolinas' proposed facility would have on Piedmont's existing facility, and the \"sole purpose and practical effect of the ALC's ruling in this regard was to protect Piedmont's market share from competition.\" While the ALC did not address the increased accessibility offered by Carolinas' proposed facility in its conclusions of law concerning Criterion 23(a), the ALC recognized the increased accessibility offered by\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   Carolinas' and Piedmont's respective proposed facilities in its findings of fact. Nevertheless, the ALC found Piedmont's proposed 100-bed facility would provide superior accessibility to meet the rapid population growth in northern York County. The ALC further found Carolinas would provide inferior accessibility to medically underserved patients due to the restrictions York County physicians in the CPN had placed on accepting these patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Amended\n   Final Order as a whole reflects the ALC's proper balancing of the impact of Carolinas' proposed facility on the occupancy rates of Piedmont's existing facility against the increased accessibility offered by Carolinas' proposed facility as required by Criterion 23(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the ALC properly applied Project Review Criteria 16(c), 22, and 23(a) without any discriminatory purpose. We acknowledge that the proper application of these criteria in any case may have the effect of protecting competing providers who already\n   <em>\n    have a presence\n   </em>\n   in the service area, but this particular group of providers is not limited to in-state interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hazel II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087791\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/145/#p152\">\n    813 F.3d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The [D]ormant Commerce Clause is exclusively designed to address the 'differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Granholm v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Patient outmigration data is typically used in the CON application process to demonstrate the need for an additional provider or service in a particular service area, and the outmigration from one service area to another usually occurs intrastate. In other words, need can be shown by evidence of residents traveling to a provider located outside the service area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marlboro Park Hosp. v. S.C.

While some of these residents may live in close proximity to a provider outside the\n   service area, many would experience a significant reduction in travel time by the addition of a service or provider within the service area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Therefore, the goal of reducing outmigration reflects a legitimate concern regarding patient travel time, which obviously can affect health outcomes in an emergency. While the reduction of outmigration may reduce patient travel to a neighboring state when the service area happens to border another state, the very purpose of this case is the issuance of a CON to build a hospital to be located in\n   <em>\n    South Carolina\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the analysis must focus on participation in South Carolina's healthcare market rather than \"the flow of patients in interstate commerce\" as suggested by Carolinas. Further, reduction of patient travel to a neighboring state does not limit participation in South Carolina's healthcare market to only those providers with in-state interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hazel II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087791\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/145/#p152\">\n    813 F.3d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that in order to prove discriminatory effect, the party asserting a Dormant Commerce Clause violation must show that the state law, \"if enforced, would negatively impact interstate commerce to a greater degree than intrastate commerce\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hazel I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714631\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/535/#p543\">\n    733 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   543 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As to community need, presumably, either Piedmont's proposed facility or Carolinas' proposed facility would meet the need for sixty-four more general hospital beds in York County. However, the ALC's analysis of which proposal would best meet community need as set forth in criteria 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(e) was more complex:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition to meeting the need for new hospital services, Piedmont's application was specifically intended to strengthen the York County healthcare system by reducing outmigration from York County. While patients have sought medical services outside of York County for years, primarily in the Charlotte area, the outmigration accelerated from 2005 to 2011. The effects of the outmigration, which are detailed in the relevant Findings of Fact and are incorporated herein, reduced the ability of Piedmont and many of the independent physicians on Piedmont's medical staff to meet the healthcare needs of York County residents. Piedmont demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the establishment of [its proposed facility] would strengthen the capacity of existing York County providers to meet those\n   needs. For these reasons, Piedmont best meets \u00a7 802.2(a, b, c, e).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The ALC also concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   One of the principal differences between the applicants is that the approval of [Carolinas' proposed facility] would have the effect of causing the erosion of quality of care at Piedmont and among specialists practicing there as a result of the diminution in the volume of patients and the degradation of the payor mix of the patients who would continue to be seen at Piedmont. Consequently, there would be no hospital in York County providing many\n   of the high quality and tertiary services that Piedmont has added. Alternatively, the establishment of [Piedmont's proposed facility] will ensure that high quality services continue to be provided and added within York County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The ALC's unchallenged findings of fact support these conclusions. The ALC found outmigration would continue if Carolinas' proposed facility was built in Fort Mill because Carolinas would refer its Fort Mill patients needing specialty care to one of Carolinas' North Carolina facilities providing these types of services rather than to Piedmont's existing facility in Rock Hill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALC also found that if Carolinas' proposed facility was built in Fort Mill, Carolinas would further reduce Piedmont's market share, thereby reducing the volume necessary for Piedmont's continued provision of its specialty services to residents of Rock Hill and western York County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Piedmont had already lost a significant volume of\n   complex cases from 2005 to 2011, forcing one of its physicians to terminate use of a new invasive technology acquired by Piedmont in 2009, due to the referral patterns of physicians aligned with Carolinas. In contrast, Piedmont's proposed facility in Fort Mill would strengthen Piedmont's ability to serve residents \"throughout York County by increasing the number of patients treated at Piedmont's Rock Hill facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   While Carolinas would have the court believe the ALC was simply looking out for Piedmont's bottom line, the ALC was looking at the big picture for all of York County, i.e., how to preserve the quality of care and the larger complement of services Piedmont's existing facility provides to York County residents who do not live in the more affluent northern part of the county. These objectives are consistent with the Project Review Criteria, which Carolinas has not challenged, and serve as an additional justification for the goal of reducing outmigration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to Carolinas' argument that the ALC's application of the community need criteria \"seeks to limit out-of-state and out-of-county interests from accessing the local market,\" we disagree. As we previously stated, the proper application of the Project Review Criteria may have the effect of protecting competing providers who already have a presence in the service area, but this particular group of providers is not limited to in-state interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Carolinas next argues the ALC provided Piedmont with an advantage over Carolinas by considering Piedmont's transfer of beds from its Rock Hill facility when Carolinas could not lawfully transfer beds from its North Carolina facilities and this advantage discriminates against \"out-of-state hospital systems.\" However, even if Piedmont had not proposed to transfer beds from its Rock Hill facility, the ALC's findings support its conclusion that Piedmont best meets criteria 2(a, b, c, e)-these\n   findings indicate Piedmont's proposed facility would better preserve the quality of care and the larger complement of services that Piedmont's Rock Hill facility provides to York County residents who live in Rock Hill or the western, rural part of the county. Therefore, the ALC's approval of Piedmont's proposed bed transfer does not\n   constitute reversible error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judy v.

The ALC concluded Piedmont had the superior capacity to expand, and Carolinas has not presented any authorities or evidence indicating it was unfairly prevented from competing with Piedmont on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the ALC properly applied Project Review Criteria 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(e) without any discriminatory purpose.

Criterion 17 states, \"The proposed project should improve efficiency by avoiding duplication of services, promoting shared services[,] and fostering economies of scale or size.\" \u00a7 802.17. The ALC concluded, \"Piedmont better satisfies this criterion because its proposal fosters economies of scale by spreading costs over a greater number of beds. Not only will [Piedmont's proposed facility's] 100 beds better accommodate future growth, [Piedmont's proposed facility] is better designed for expansion than is [Carolinas' proposed facility].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As with criteria 2(a, b, c, e), Carolinas argues the ALC's application of Criterion 17 provided Piedmont with an unfair advantage over Carolinas by considering Piedmont's transfer of beds from its Rock Hill facility. However, Piedmont's bed transfer proposal was not the sole reason for the ALC's determination that Piedmont best met Criterion 17.

Recognizing that the CPN primary care physicians \"would function as the gatekeepers for\" Carolinas' proposed Fort Mill facility, the ALC stated, \"If the flow of medically underserved patients into [the CPN] primary care offices is restricted, the referrals and ultimate admissions of those individuals into [Carolinas' proposed Fort Mill facility] would be restricted as well.\" Carolinas has not challenged these findings of fact.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <em>\n     For example\n    </em>\n    , Carolinas owns and manages Roper Hospital in Charleston and, thus, has an existing presence in the corresponding service area.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    \u00a7\u00a7 802.2(a), (b), (c), (e) (2011).

Piedmont presented the testimony of Arun Adlakha, M.D., who had requested Piedmont to acquire an instrument that would allow him to perform navigational bronchoscopies. Piedmont acquired the instrument, which was the first of its kind in the greater Charlotte area. When it was first placed in operation, Dr. Adlakha performed enough procedures to maintain his proficiency. However, after the patient volume for this service significantly declined, Dr. Adlakha decided \"to terminate the use of the instrument as he found it 'very difficult to maintain [his] proficiency and justify keeping it for so long.' \" Dr. Adlakha attributed the decrease in patient volume to CPN's referral practices.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Carolinas also argues the ALC erred in failing to conduct the proper Dormant Commerce Clause analysis because the ALC stated, \"The same plan, criteri[a,] and analysis would have been utilized regardless of whether competing applicants were out-of-state or in-state providers.\" Carolinas asserts that this is the incorrect standard for a Dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Because the ALC properly applied the provisions of the CON Act, the 2004-2005 State Health Plan, and the Project Review Criteria without any discriminatory purpose or effect, we find no reversible error.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Judy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859826\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/384/634/#p646\">\n     384 S.C. at 646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859826\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/384/634/#p646\">\n     682 S.E.2d at 842\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Generally, appellate courts will not set aside judgments due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
