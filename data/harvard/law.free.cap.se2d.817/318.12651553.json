The case ultimately settled and the Commonwealth approved the settlement. The relators and the Commonwealth agree that the relators are entitled to 28% of the proceeds of the settlement. They disagree, however, with respect to whether that 28% share should come out of the total, or gross, proceeds of the settlement, or whether the 28% share should come out of the Commonwealth's\n   <em>\n    net\n   </em>\n   share of the proceeds, specifically, what remains after the Commonwealth has refunded a portion of the proceeds to the United States. The trial court found in favor of the relators, concluding that they were entitled to receive 28% of the gross proceeds of the settlement. For the reasons noted below, we agree with the relators, and accordingly we affirm the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

THE\n   <em>\n    QUI TAM\n   </em>\n   CASE AND ITS SETTLEMENT .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The relators in this case filed a complaint alleging that, starting November 1, 1997, the defendant laboratories defrauded the Commonwealth's Medicaid program by overcharging for certain lab tests. The Commonwealth declined to intervene and the case was unsealed. Ultimately, the relators settled with the defendants in the amount of $1,250,000. The defendants did not admit liability. The Commonwealth approved the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following this settlement, the Commonwealth and the relators agreed that the relator's share was 28% of the proceeds. However, the relators and the Commonwealth could not agree on how to calculate the proceeds of the settlement. The relators argue that the \"proceeds of the settlement\" means 28% of the gross proceeds of $1,250,000. The Commonwealth maintains that because Medicaid is a jointly funded state and federal program, the relator's 28% must come from the Commonwealth's share after deducting the portion of the settlement that it must return to the United States government as an \"overpayment.\" Twenty-eight percent of the gross\n   proceeds of the settlement is $350,000, whereas 28% of the proceeds that remain after deducting the United States' share is $138,925.

In this context, the phrase \"proceeds of the award or settlement\" is most naturally read as encompassing the gross proceeds of the award or settlement. Code \u00a7 8.01-216.7(B) does not qualify or limit the term \"proceeds.\" The Commonwealth's argument is that \"proceeds of the award or settlement\" should be interpreted as \"proceeds of the award or settlement\n   <em>\n    after deduction of the United States' share of the settlement.\n   </em>\n   \" The statute, however, contains no such language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This conclusion, that the proceeds of settlement means the gross proceeds, is fortified by the fact that, on fifty-four occasions, the General Assembly has employed the limiting word \"net\" in conjunction with the term \"proceeds.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Code \u00a7\u00a7 3.2-3118, 8.01-499, 64.2-535. In this instance, the General Assembly did not specify in Code \u00a7 8.01-216.7(B) that the \"proceeds\" of the award or settlement are the \"net proceeds\" that remain after deducting certain expenses or costs. The fact that the General Assembly knows how to specify a limitation on the intended measure of proceeds in a statute by employing the phrase \"net proceeds,\" but did not employ that phrase in Code \u00a7 8.01-216.7(B), is \"an unambiguous manifestation of a contrary intention,\" indicating that the term \"proceeds\" was not intended to be limited in any way,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., that gross proceeds is the intended meaning.\n   <em>\n    Halifax Corp. v.

The General Assembly was surely aware that the VFATA would be used to recover fraudulent Medicaid expenditures because, long before Virginia's enactment of the VFATA, the federal statute on which VFATA is based had been employed for that purpose.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Cal. 1976). Yet the General Assembly did not treat Medicaid recoveries differently from any other recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Commonwealth does not make any arguments based on the statute's plain language. Instead, it asserts that the VFATA was enacted with the chief purpose of returning misappropriated public funds to the treasury. Extrapolating from this intent, the Commonwealth posits that the share of a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   recovery to which the United States government is entitled must be deducted from the overall proceeds. Once this deduction is made, the relator's share can be taken out of what remains. This procedure, it argues, will maximize the funds recovered by Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The first difficulty with this argument is that, as noted above, it finds no support in the plain language of the statute. The second difficulty is that the Commonwealth's argument is premised on a legal conclusion that draws no support from federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Commonwealth's argument is not especially compelling on its own terms. The Commonwealth maintains that we should construe the VFATA in a way that maximizes the recovery of funds and, to accomplish this objective, we should interpret Code \u00a7 8.01-216.7(B) to reduce the relator's share. But it is not obvious that, in the aggregate, the Commonwealth's proposed reduction in the relator's share will produce more revenue from\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions than construing \"proceeds\" to mean gross proceeds. A significant reduction in the relator's share will discourage relators from bringing these lawsuits. The Commonwealth receives nothing when a relator decides to stay home and foregoes the risk and expense associated with a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suit. Speculation about the potential for the Commonwealth to recover less from\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions constitutes an insufficient basis upon which to depart from what constitutes the most natural, plain language reading of Code \u00a7 8.01-216.7(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.

The parties, however, settled for an undifferentiated amount of $1,250,000. The Commonwealth approved this settlement.
