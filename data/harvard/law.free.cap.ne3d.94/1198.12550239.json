N.Z. is the mother of the student involved in this case. We shall refer to N.Z. and her child as \"Mother\" and \"Student\" in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Madison Local School District is located in Mansfield, Ohio. During the 2015-2016 school year, Student was a pupil at Madison Comprehensive High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On Tuesday, October 6, 2015, the Madison Comprehensive High School received a bomb threat, requiring an evacuation of the students from the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On Friday, October 9, 2015, around the lunch hour, a teacher was walking down the stairs of the high school and she noticed a three-ring binder laying at the bottom of the stairwell. The teacher looked at the binder and observed that \"Klebold Surprise\" was written on the cover. The names \"Dylan Klebold\" and \"Eric Harris\" were also written on the cover of the binder. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were the students responsible for the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. The teacher did not touch the binder, but immediately went to the library to contact\n   the Dean of Students about the presence of the binder in the hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Dean of Students was supervising the lunchroom when he received a radio message that he needed to report to the library. He came to the library and found the teacher and librarian in a state of panic. The two teachers took the Dean of Students to location of the binder. The Dean of Students picked up the binder and took it to his office. He then radioed the Principal, who was also on lunchroom duty, to come to the administrative offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Dean of Students opened the binder. He found academic papers inside the binder with the name of a student, G.E., written on the papers. The Dean of Students called G.E. to the office. Upon questioning by the Dean of Students, G.E. said he knew about the binder but he did not write \"Klebold Surprise\" on the cover. He said two other students, Student and B.C., were present when \"Klebold Surprise\" was written. Student and B.C. were called to the office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The school administrators interviewed the students to determine why the students wrote the names of the Columbine shooters on the binder and then left the binder in the school hallway. Student, G.E., and B.C. were interviewed individually. None of the students were forthcoming with information and the Dean of Students felt they were being evasive. G.E. said B.C. wrote the names of the Columbine shooters on the binder. B.C. said G.E. wrote the names. Student thought B.C. wrote the names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The school administrators confiscated the cell phones of B.C. and G.E. Student did not have a cell phone. When the Dean of Students picked up B.C.'s cell phone, the phone received a text message from C.C., another high school student. B.C. let the Dean of Students read the text message and it stated in part, \"We're fucked, they know about the Columbine shit, I'm going to get expelled.\" The Dean of Students felt the students were involved in more serious activity than just writing names on a three-ring binder. C.C. was called to the office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During C.C.'s interview, he told the Dean of Students that a group of students were part of a message group on Kik. Kik is a free mobile messaging app for smartphones. While he was speaking, C.C. showed the school administrators his cell phone and the Principal observed the wallpaper on C.C.'s cell phone was a photo of Adam Lanza, the man who committed the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. At this time, the Principal asked the Dean of Students to call law enforcement to continue the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The school administrators continued to speak with the students regarding the message group on Kik. One of the students gave the school administrators access to the message group on the Kik app. A password was required to access the message group. The message group was named \"Klebold Kuck Krew.\" The message group contained posts including hate speech specifically towards African-Americans, sexually aggressive language, discussions of school shootings, photos of students with access to firearms, photos of stabbing weapons, videos of students with firearms and comments about killing African-Americans. Student admitted to being an active participant on the Kik message group since September 2015. Law enforcement told the school administrators they felt the participants on the message group could be forming a hate group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After viewing the screen names in the message group, the school administrators called two more students down to the office. The Dean of Students, Principal, two other school administrators, and four\n   law enforcement officers were involved interviewing students, gathering information, and calling the student's parents. The investigation started in the late morning on October 9, 2015 and it was not until after 3:00 pm before the last student left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The school administration determined to emergency remove from school the students involved in the message group, including Student. The basis for the emergency removal was to allow the school to conduct a further investigation before the school considered suspension. Pursuant to the 2015-2016 Madison Comprehensive High School Student Handbook, \"emergency removal\" is \"the exclusion of a student who poses a continuing danger to District property or persons in the District or whose behavior presents an on-going threat of disrupting the educational process provided by the District.\" On October 9, 2015, the Principal spoke to each student with his or her parent representative and explained the process for emergency removal. The Principal told the student and parent representative the school intended to contact them within three days to tell them when their hearing would be scheduled and to hold the hearing within three days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} No school was held on Monday, October 12, 2015 because it was Columbus Day. The school administration intended to contact the students on Wednesday, October 14, 2015, to notify them the emergency removal hearing would be held on Friday, October 16, 2015. On Wednesday, October 14, 2015, however, the Madison Local School District received a district-wide bomb threat and all school buildings were evacuated. The school administration contacted Student on Thursday, October 15, 2015, to notify him of the emergency removal hearing on Friday, October 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Student and Mother attended the emergency removal hearing on Friday, October 16, 2015. The Dean of Students presented an explanation of the events of October 9, 2015 and why the school administration pursued an emergency removal. The Principal asked Student if the Dean of Students had presented any inaccurate information, but Student said everything was accurate. Student admitted to participating in the message group. He understood the activity on the message group was inappropriate but he chose not to remove himself from the group. The Principal asked Student if he had anything he wanted to share, expecting Student to offer an apology, but Student stated he did not have anything to say.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At the conclusion of the emergency removal hearing, the Dean of Students and Principal met separately and determined to suspend Student. The Dean of Students filled out a \"Notice of Intended Suspension From School\" form and it was given to Student and his mother at the emergency removal hearing. The reasons given for Student's suspension were for \"creating a disturbance of curricular activities\" and \"attempted to mislead school personnel\" in violation of Sections 5 and 18 of the Code of Student Conduct. On the form, the Principal checked the box that imposed a ten-day suspension with recommendation of expulsion. Student signed the form indicating he received a copy of the Notice of Intended Suspension on October 16, 2016. At the bottom of the form, it provided for the \"Notice of Suspension.\" The Principal concluded upon his review of the facts and circumstances that Student was to be suspended from school for ten days beginning on Monday, October 19, 2016 and ending Friday, October 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On October 16, 2015, the school administrators sent a letter to the Superintendent recommending that Student be expelled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On Tuesday, October 20, 2015, the Superintendent mailed by ordinary and certified mail a \"Notice of Intent to Consider Expulsion from School\" to Student and his mother at the mailing address listed in the school records. The notice informed Student and Mother that an expulsion hearing was scheduled on Friday, October 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On Thursday, October 22, 2015, there was a bomb threat for the Madison Local School District and a nearby local school district. On Monday, October 26, 2015, there was a shooter threat at Madison Local School District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On Friday, October 30, 2015, the expulsion hearing went forward before the Superintendent. Student, his grandmother, and Student's two attorneys were present at the hearing. On October 30, 2015, the Superintendent sent a \"Notice of Expulsion From School\" to Student and Mother at the mailing address listed in the school records. The notice informed Student and his mother that the Superintendent expelled Student from school beginning November 2, 2015 through January 8, 2016. It was also agreed Student would successfully complete a counseling program and enroll in an online school or alternative program at the end of his expulsion period. The notice informed Student and Mother of their right to appeal the expulsion decision to the Madison Local School District Board of Education. Student appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Student, his family, and his counsel appeared before the Madison Local School District Board of Education on Wednesday, November 18, 2015. The Dean of Students and the Principal testified at the hearing. After the hearing, the Board of Education affirmed the Superintendent's order of expulsion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Mother, on Student's behalf, filed an administrative appeal of the Board of Education's decision with the Richland County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506. Mother argued in her appeal that: (1) the emergency removal, suspension, and expulsion process violated Student's due process rights because the school administrators did not comply with R.C. 3313.66 and (2) Student's First Amendment right as to free speech were violated by the Board of Education's decision to affirm his expulsion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court issued its decision on September 15, 2016. The trial court reviewed the whole record to determine if Board of Education's decision to expel Student from school was supported by a preponderance of reliable, substantial, and probative evidence. As part of the record, the trial court considered the numerous bomb and shooting threats that Madison Local School District received during October 2015. The trial court first found while the school administration did not fully meet the timing requirements of R.C. 3313.66, Student's due process rights were not violated during the emergency removal, suspension, and expulsion proceedings. Student fully participated in all stages of the proceedings and was represented by counsel at the expulsion hearing and expulsion appeal. The trial court next found Student's First Amendment rights were not violated by Student's expulsion. The trial court found Student's private conversation outside of school in the \"Klebold Kuck Krew\" message group was brought into school when the three-ring binder labeled \"Klebold Surprise\" was found in the school hallway and the members of the message group warned other members on October 9, 2015 to not tell the school administration about the message group. The trial court found it relevant the message group glorified school violence and was discovered by school administrators during a time the Madison Local School District\n   was receiving multiple bomb and shooting threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} It is from this decision Mother now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Mother raises one Assignment of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"THE LOWER COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE MADISON BOARD OF EDUCATION TO EXPEL STUDENT FROM MADISON HIGH SCHOOL.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Mother argues the trial court abused its discretion when it affirmed the decision of the Madison Local School District Board of Education to expel Student from Madison Comprehensive High School.

On October 9, 2015, after interviewing the students and discussing the matter, the school administrators decided to remove Student from school. The Principal spoke with Student and Mother to explain Student was being emergency removed and that the school intended to contact them within three days to tell them when their hearing would be held. School was not in session on Monday, October 12, 2015 and Wednesday, October 14, 2015. The school notified Student and Mother of the hearing on October 15, 2016 to be held on October 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The Student Handbook states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   If a student's presence poses a continuous danger to persons or property, or an on-going threat of disrupting the academic process, then the Superintendent, principal or assistant principal may remove the student from the premises. * * * If a teacher makes an emergency removal, reasons will be submitted to the principal in writing as soon after the removal as practicable. * * * If the emergency removal exceeds twenty-four (24) hours, then a due process hearing will be held within seventy-two (72) hours after the removal is ordered. Written notice of the hearing and the reason for removal and any intended disciplinary action will be given to the student as soon as practical prior to the hearing. The student will have the opportunity to appear at an informal hearing before the principal, assistant principal, Superintendent or designee, and has the right to challenge the reasons for the intended suspension or otherwise explain his/her actions. The person or persons who ordered or requested the removal will be present at the hearing, and within twenty-four (24) hours of the decision to suspend, written notification will be given to the parent(s), guardian(s) or custodian(s) of the student, and Treasurer of the Board.

The trial court found on October 9, 2015, the Principal verbally informed Mother and Student of the reasons for Student's emergency removal. Because the emergency removal was going to exceed 24 hours,\n   the Principal told Mother and Student that they would be contacted within three days for a hearing. The school did not contact Mother and Student until October 15, 2016 for the hearing on October 16, 2015. There was no school on October 12, 2015 due to a school holiday and October 15, 2015 due to a bomb threat requiring an evacuation of all buildings in the school district. The hearing went forward on Friday, October 16, 2015.

The message group was password-protected and did not contain any direct references or threatening language about a specific person or school community. Mother does not dispute the binder and message group contained references to the Columbine shootings, sexual language, and racial epithets. The content of the message group, however, was private among the members and the members never intended to convey the content to the school community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The trial court found Student and the other participating students may not have intended the binder and the contents of the message group to reach the school community, but Student's private conversations reached the school community on October 9, 2015. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Student participants in the \"KKK\" chatroom extended their so-called \"private conversation,\" one that glorified school violence, into the school when they: 1) wrote \"The Klebold Surprise\" and \"Dylan Harris\" on the cover of a notebook at school and left it in the stairwell to be discovered; and 2) communicated with each other on their phones within the school and during school hours, warning the recipient(s) not to tell school officials about the chatroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (Judgment Entry, Sept. 15, 2016). The trial court found the student's text warnings were an attempt to obstruct discovery of the message group by school officials. Further relevant to the trial court's determination that the binder and the message group impacted the school community was that the school received a bomb threat three days before the binder was discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Under a circumstance-specific inquiry, nexus test, or reasonable foreseeability test, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the school had the authority to regulate Student's off-campus speech. Student was a participant in the creation of a binder that the students labeled \"Klebold Surprise,\" a direct reference to the Columbine shootings. A teacher found the binder in the stairwell of the school building while school was in session. The reference to the Columbine shootings, three days after a bomb threat, caused the teacher to feel\n   panic and instigated a school investigation to determine whether there was another threat of violence in the school. During the investigation, the Dean of Students discovered Student's participation in the \"Klebold Kuck Krew\" message group through text messages sent by a student during the school day. The text message warned the members that the school knew about the students' interest in the Columbine shootings. While the evidence does not show the content of the message group was specifically directed at a teacher, student, or school community, the Dean of Students testified as to the contents of the message group:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Officer Kotterman later said it was a year's worth of material of hate speech, particularly against black-the black race. He-it was sexual in nature, aggressive sexual in nature, talking about school shootings, kind of glorifying school shootings. A lot of hate speech, like I said. It showed students with access to firearms. It showed pictures of stabbing weapons. In particular there were two videos that were-that I saw that were disturbing. There was one of a student with a loaded rifle putting it up by his mouth and then unloading the rifle to where the ammunition was shooting out. There was a second video of a student pulling a-he was in downtown Mansfield and he was in a car by himself and he pulled a Glock handgun out of his pocket, and as the kids were going down and using the kick (sic) site, you know, comments like time to kill niggers or niggers are going to die.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (Tr. 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 67} We agree with the trial court's determination the school had the authority to regulate Student's off-campus speech. The binder was found at school and the discovery of the binder led to the discovery of the message group. The binder and the message group, of which Student was a participant, referenced the Columbine shootings and other violent acts. The message group demonstrated the students had access to weapons. It was not an abuse of discretion to find the off-campus speech in this case had a connection with the school to permit administrative discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    Student's Expulsion Was Permissible Under\n    <em>\n     Tinker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 68}\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   permits schools to restrict speech that \"might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities\" or collides with the rights of other students to be secure and let alone.\n   <em>\n    Tinker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">\n    393 U.S. at 513-514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">\n    89 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    C.R. v.

A teacher found the binder in the school stairwell, causing her panic. The teacher, with another teacher, showed the Dean of Students the binder, which resulted in an investigation. The investigation into the binder led to the discovery of the message group. The investigation into the message group further disrupted curricular activities. The Dean of Students, Principal, two other school administrators, and four law enforcement officers were involved interviewing multiple students, gathering information, and calling the student's parents. The investigation started in the late morning on October 9, 2015 and it was not until after 3:00 pm before the last student left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 70} The trial court further found the contents of the binder and the message group reasonably led the school administration to forecast substantial disruption or\n   material interference with school activities. The Principal testified he considered the speech to be \"a growing threat, a concern to our students. * * * [Student] admitted to being an active participant in a group that we felt threatened our students.\" (Tr. 63).
