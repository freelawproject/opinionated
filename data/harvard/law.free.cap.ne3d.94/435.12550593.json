The defendant later moved for forensic testing pursuant to G. L. c. 278A. After a hearing in May, 2016, a Superior Court judge allowed deoxyribonucleic acid testing of the victim's underwear but otherwise denied the defendant's motion. The defendant appeals, arguing that the judge should have ordered discovery and the testing of various blood stains. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Testing of blood stains\n   </em>\n   .

L. c. 278A, \u00a7 3(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   )(4), inserted by St. 2012, c. 38. The court did not reach the question whether the defendant had made the requisite showing as to the other evidence.\n   <em>\n    Donald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153649\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/37/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 42 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \"To determine whether a moving party meets this requirement, it is necessary to consider only whether the test results could be material to the question of the identity of the person who committed the criminal act of which the moving party was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317973\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/496/#p507\">\n    467 Mass. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507-508 (2014). At the onset of the crime here, the perpetrator \"rammed [the victim] to the ground, and smashed her face into the cement floor of the garage. [The victim's] nose broke, and she sustained abrasions across her forehead.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Donald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    56 Mass. App. Ct. 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). The victim thereafter was fully compliant with the perpetrator's demands. There is nothing in the record that suggests that the perpetrator injured himself or in any way contributed to the blood stains in the garage. Contrary to the defendant's suggestion, the mere fact that the perpetrator \"walk[ed] in a limp manner\" (to all appearances prior to the assault) provides no reason to believe that the perpetrator bled in the garage. In the absence of any reason to believe that the perpetrator contributed to the blood stains, the defendant failed to show that the requested \"analysis has the potential to result in evidence that is material to the moving party's identification as the perpetrator of the crime.\" G.
