Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} From 2004 until 2010, Mr. Gaydosh was an employee of the Trumbull County Sanitary Engineer. As such he was subject of a collective bargaining agreement (the \"CBA\") between the county, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers, Ohio Council 8, Local 2493, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\"). On or about April 28, 2010, Mr. Gaydosh was indicted by the Trumbull County Grand Jury for three drug related felonies, and three misdemeanor charges of workers' compensation fraud. Eventually, he pleaded guilty to these charges, and received intervention in lieu of conviction. It appears from the record he completed his program successfully, the charges being thereafter dismissed, and his record sealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As a result of his indictment, Mr. Gaydosh was terminated from his employment May 26, 2010. He received a letter dated June 2, 2010 to this effect shortly thereafter. June 8, 2010, Mr. Gaydosh filed a grievance; he filed an amended grievance the next day. On each form, he signed the section stating, \"I authorize [the Union] as my representative to act for me in the disposition of this grievance[.]\" By a letter dated July 7, 2010, the county denied the grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Pursuant to the CBA, the next step was to seek mediation, or arbitration, of the grievance. The Union prepared an arbitration package, which was presented in April 2012. April 13, 2012, the Union's first vice president denied the request to\n   appeal via arbitration. Mr. Gaydosh was informed of this by a letter dated April 16, 2012. By a letter dated April 24, 2012, the Union notified the county it was withdrawing the grievance. After receiving a letter from Mr. Gaydosh's counsel objecting to the Union's decision, the Union reiterated its position it would not pursue the grievance any further in a letter dated June 7, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} July 12, 2012, Mr. Gaydosh filed an unfair labor practice charge against the county and the Union with the Ohio State Employment Relations Board (\"SERB\"). SERB dismissed the charge September 13, 2012. Mr. Gaydosh did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} January 28, 2015, Mr. Gaydosh filed this action sounding in breach of contract. The county answered. The county moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court denied. May 14, 2015, Mr. Gaydosh moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration, pursuant to the CBA. The county opposed. Hearing was held before the trial court's magistrate on the motion to stay and compel arbitration. By a decision filed April 6, 2016, the magistrate denied the motion. Mr. Gaydosh filed timely objections. By a judgment entry filed June 10, 2016, the trial court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate's decision. Mr. Gaydosh did not appeal from this judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} July 13, 2016, the county moved for summary judgment. Mr. Gaydosh opposed the motion. By a judgment entry filed October 14, 2016, the trial court granted the county summary judgment. Mr. Gaydosh timely appealed, assigning two errors. The first reads: \"The trial court erred in failing to grant plaintiff-appellant's motion to compel arbitration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court's decision to deny the motion to stay and compel arbitration was premised on its determination Mr. Gaydosh lacked standing under the CBA to compel arbitration. The CBA contains a three-step process for grievances, set forth at Article 20, Section 4, with arbitration being the third step after other attempts to resolve the grievance have failed. Mr. Gaydosh points to Article 20, Section 10 of the CBA, to show he does have standing. That section provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"The [county] and the Union agree that employees covered by this Agreement have the right to present grievances and have them adjusted without the intervention of the Union representative(s) as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and as long as the Union representative(s) have the opportunity to be present at the meeting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} This language tracks that of R.C. 4117.03(A)(5), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"(A) Public employees have the right to:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"(5) Present grievances and have them adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement then in effect and as long as the bargaining representatives have the opportunity to be present at the adjustment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Based on both the CBA, and R.C. 4117.03(A)(5), Mr. Gaydosh contends he has the right to present a grievance without the Union's cooperation, and thus, has the right to compel arbitration, which is part of the grievance process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The County, on the other hand, contends this assignment of error is not properly before us. The Ohio courts of appeals only have jurisdiction of final appealable orders. R.C. 2501.02. The County points out that pursuant to R.C. 2711.02(C), orders granting or denying stays pending arbitration are final appealable\n   orders. The trial court adopted the magistrate's decision denying a stay to compel arbitration June 10, 2016. Mr. Gaydosh did not appeal until November 14, 2016. The County argues this notice of appeal was not timely regarding the judgment entry adopting the magistrate's decision, since it was not filed within the 30 day limit for prescribed by App.R. 4(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} We respectfully direct the County's attention to App.R. 4(B)(5), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"(5) Partial final judgment or order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \"If an appeal is permitted from a judgment or order entered in a case in which the trial court has not disposed of all claims as to all parties, other than a judgment or order entered under Civ.R. 54(B), a party may file a notice of appeal within thirty days of entry of the judgment or order appealed or the judgment or order that disposes of the remaining claims. Division (A) of this rule applies to a judgment or order entered under Civ.R. 54(B).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court granted the County summary judgment on Mr. Gaydosh's breach of contract claim October 14, 2016. Pursuant to App.R. 4(B)(5), Mr. Gaydosh had until November 14, 2016 to notice appeal of the denial of his motion to stay and compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Horen v. Summit Homes\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-04-001,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-2218\">\n    2004-Ohio-2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20937317\">\n    2004 WL 937317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23-32. That is the day he did notice appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The County also points out that Mr. Gaydosh's notice of appeal does not mention the June 10, 2016 judgment entry adopting the magistrate's decision denying the motion to stay and compel arbitration, and that a copy of that judgment entry is not attached to the notice of appeal. The County then cites this court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Burton Carol Management, LLC v. Ziegler\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Lake No. 2015-L-008,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4925\">\n    2015-Ohio-4925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207715498\">\n    2015 WL 7715498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4, holding:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \" App.R. 3(D) states in part that 'the notice of appeal (* * *) shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from (* * *).' 11th Dist. Loc.R. 3(D)(2) likewise requires an appellant to attach a copy of the judgment entry appealed from or be subject to possible sua sponte dismissal without notice. The trial court's decision denying appellant's motion for a new trial was not properly appealed in this appeal, and as such, we need not address the arguments arising from that decision here.\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

The Ohio courts of appeals considering this issue have found that, once an employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement authorizes his or her union to pursue a grievance, the cause of action belongs to the union, and the employee lacks standing to prosecute the case.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.
