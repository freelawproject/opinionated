For the reasons stated, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying appellants' counsel. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The underlying dispute involves the purchase of three wind turbines by appellants from appellees. Appellee Elecon, the manufacturer, is a company based in India. Appellee Reflecting Blue, the distributor, is an American company based in Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 21, 2011, Attorney Christopher Ernst with the law firm of Brickler and Eckler filed an action asserting a number of claims on behalf of appellants against appellees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants\n   claimed the turbines were defective and inoperable. Appellants alleged breach of warranties and contractual obligations, fraud, misrepresentation, and quality and performance of the products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The law firm of Brzytwa, Quick and McCrystal and Attorney Robert Cahill, a member of that firm and licensed to practice law in the state of Ohio, were hired to represent appellees. Attorney Matthew Girardi, licensed to practice law in the state of California, with an office in Los Angeles, had contacts with appellees and also acted as counsel for appellees. Attorney Girardi, however, was not licensed to practice law in the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After consulting with Attorney Girardi, Attorney Cahill filed an answer on their behalf. Attorney Cahill signed pleadings as counsel for appellees. The trial court deemed Attorney Cahill as lead counsel for appellees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney Cahill was privy to a substantial amount of confidential information from appellees as well as from Attorney Girardi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Attorney Cahill also appeared as counsel on additional pleadings for appellees including a third party complaint, a motion to dismiss appellee Elecon, an answer to appellants' amended complaint with counterclaim, and a motion for leave to plead on behalf of Elecon. Attorney Cahill used confidential information to prepare pleadings, attend a hearing, and address discovery issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Specifically, Attorney Cahill's representation included, inter alia: conferring with Attorney Girardi and the parties about the case; reviewing contract and specifications of NexGen's order; reviewing, revising, preparing, and drafting pleadings and discovery; researching case law; receiving documents; reviewing Attorney Girardi's notes and conferring with him regarding discovery and case strategy; reviewing and emailing appellee Brian Larson; reviewing and responding to emails from appellants' counsel; preparing for and attending a hearing; and traveling to Ashtabula County and Conneaut, Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Thereafter, in February 2012, Attorney Cahill filed a motion to withdraw. However, he continued to represent appellees as their counsel of record until the trial court granted his motion in April and Attorney David Bertsch, with the law firm of Stark &amp; Knoll Co., L.P.A., entered an appearance as new counsel. Attorney Cahill's representation of appellees lasted about ten-and-a-half months. At the time of his withdrawal, Attorney Cahill had billed appellees $33,916 for legal services rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In September 2015, the law firm of Brzytwa, Quick and McCrystal, of which Attorney Cahill was still a member, merged with Sutter O'Connell, which was\n   then and is now counsel of record for appellants. Thus, Attorney Cahill is now a member of Sutter O'Connell. Sutter O'Connell did not notify defense counsel before or after Attorney Cahill joined the firm. Rather, in October 2015, defense counsel independently learned of the information and after making inquiry, appellees received written notice of the merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 3, 2016, appellees filed a motion to disqualify Sutter O'Connell. Appellants opposed the motion arguing that Attorney Cahill did not have substantial responsibility in the matter and that he had been properly screened when he joined Sutter O'Connell. Appellants also argued that appellees' delay in raising this issue was unduly prejudicial to appellants because the parties were prepared to try the case with Sutter O'Connell as counsel in March 2016, two months prior to the filing of the motion to disqualify. An evidentiary hearing was held on June 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On July 28, 2016, the trial court granted appellees' motion to disqualify. The court found that Attorney Cahill had a substantial responsibility in the representation of appellees in this lawsuit and by later becoming a member of appellants' counsel's law firm, Sutter O'Connell, all members of Sutter O'Connell must be disqualified from further representation of appellants in this matter. Appellants filed a timely appeal and assert the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in Disqualifying Plaintiffs' Counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Under its sole assignment of error, appellants present five issues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"1. What is the proper standard of review on a Motion to Disqualify Counsel?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"2. Did the trial court arbitrarily fail to recognize and apply the second prong of Ohio's two part test for disqualification of counsel?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"3. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in determining that Attorney Cahill had substantial responsibility for the representation of Defendants?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"4. Did Defendants use the Motion to Disqualify Plaintiffs' counsel as a procedural weapon forbidden under the rules of professional conduct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \"5. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in determining Defendants' Motion to Disqualify was untimely?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellants' issues are interrelated as they all center around the allegation that the trial court abused its discretion in disqualifying Sutter O'Connell. For ease of discussion, we will address them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} A trial court has wide discretion in the consideration of a motion to disqualify counsel.\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.
