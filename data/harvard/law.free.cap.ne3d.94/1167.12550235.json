Cohen, in his capacity as the court-appointed receiver for the dissolved corporation, PEI Liquidation, Inc. (\"PEI\"), appeals the judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees, Lawrence J. Dulay, Thomas W. Edger, Robert Schneider, Kenneth S. Sekley, Frederick Van Reames, Craig Cox, Jeffery Rohrs, Robert Zelinski, Mary Lee Pilla, and Kevin Dow (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal arises out of the corporate dissolution proceeding for PEI and the related lawsuit that followed Cohen's investigation into the causes of the company's liquidation. PEI, formerly known as Patio Enclosures, Inc., was an Ohio for-profit corporation that was incorporated in 1966 and whose principal place of business was located in Macedonia, Ohio. PEI was in the business of manufacturing, distributing, and retailing sunrooms and other related products in both the residential and commercial markets. In 1967, Defendant Schneider, the son of one of the company's co-founders, entered the business and took over his father's interest. Schneider thereafter became PEI's longtime CEO and chairman of the board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 1996, PEI established an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") with the goal of making the company entirely employee-owned by 2006. As part of the initial ESOP transaction, PEI divided its common stock into two classes, Class A and Class B. These two classes of common stock were equal in all respects except that the Class A shares had preferential dividend rights. The ESOP owned all of the outstanding Class A common shares, while Schneider controlled all of the outstanding Class B common shares. Starting in 1997, the ESOP gradually began purchasing shares of Schneider's stock until the ESOP eventually controlled 100% of the outstanding shares of PEI common stock. The final transaction occurred in 2006, when the ESOP purchased the remaining 30% of the company's common stock from Schneider for $6,494,850.00. The ESOP funded this final transaction of Schneider's remaining stock with a multi-million dollar legal judgment that PEI was awarded in 2004.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patio Enclosures, Inc. v. Four Seasons Marketing Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 22458,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-4933\">\n    2005-Ohio-4933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202291916\">\n    2005 WL 2291916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After purchasing the company's remaining stock from Schneider, PEI used the balance of the legal judgment to satisfy the debt of all of the company's secured creditors. Cohen's subsequent investigation into PEI's financials revealed that from 1996 to 2006, while the ESOP was actively purchasing Schneider's shares of common stock, PEI \"consistently experienced declining operating profitability, ultimately\n   resulting in net operating losses of $3.9 million in 2005 and $4.3 million in 2006.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Schneider retired as CEO of PEI in late 2006 and resigned his position as chairman of the board of directors in May 2007. However, after successive years of net operating losses, PEI's board of directors entered into negotiations with Schneider to obtain financial assistance in an effort to provide the company with access to additional working capital. In 2009, Schneider proposed a loan guaranty to increase PEI's line of credit by up to six million dollars, but only if the board agreed to certain terms and conditions. The negotiations between Schneider and the board ultimately broke down and Schneider provided no additional funding or loan guarantees to PEI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Due to the company's inability to secure additional working capital, coupled with the collapse of the national housing market, PEI terminated all of its employees and its business operations on December 31, 2010. On January 20, 2011, PEI's board of directors adopted a resolution of dissolution to voluntarily dissolve the corporation under Ohio law. The corporation filed its complaint for judicial administration of its dissolution and the winding up of its corporate affairs on February 22, 2011. The trial court subsequently appointed Cohen as receiver to administer PEI's estate and its dissolution case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 2, 2014, following his investigation into PEI's affairs, Cohen filed suit against Defendants in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, pleading the following five claims against the Defendants: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) aiding, abetting, inducing, or participating in breach of fiduciary duty; (3) waste; (4) deepening insolvency and wrongful prolongation of corporate existence; and (5) breach of fiduciary duty owed to creditors. On March 14, 2014, all Defendants except Schneider filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss Cohen's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, arguing that Counts One and Five are time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations under R.C. 2305.09 and that Counts Two through Five are legally defective. On April 4, 2014, Schneider filed a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court denied Defendants' respective Civ.R. 12 motions. The trial court also denied Defendants' subsequent motions to reconsider the denial of their respective Civ.R. 12 motions. Defendants ultimately filed answers denying the allegations set forth in Cohen's complaint. The matter then proceeded through the discovery phase of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On September 10, 2015, Defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Cohen filed an omnibus brief in opposition to Defendants' motions for summary judgment, to which Defendants filed reply briefs in support of their respective summary judgment motions. On December 31, 2015, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants. In so doing, the trial court specifically determined that Count One and Count Five contained within Cohen's complaint were time-barred by the statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.09. The trial court also concluded that Count Two, Count Three, and Count Four contained in Cohen's complaint are not cognizable causes of action under Ohio Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Cohen filed this timely appeal and raises one assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Board\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Members by (a) finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact and (b), after viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the Receiver, concluding that the Board Members were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that: (i) the Receiver's claims for breach of fiduciary duty are subject to the four (4) year statute of limitations set forth in R.C.

Before making such a contrary finding, however, a court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve any doubt in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the party moving for summary judgment must first be able to point to evidentiary materials that demonstrate there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Dresher v.

Once a moving party satisfies its burden of supporting its motion for summary judgment with sufficient and acceptable evidence pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), Civ.R. 56(E) provides that the non-moving party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the moving party's pleadings. Rather, the non-moving party has a reciprocal burden of responding by setting forth specific facts, demonstrating that a \"genuine triable issue\" exists to be litigated for trial.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Cohen asserts that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on the basis that his claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of fiduciary duty owed to creditors (Counts One and Five, respectively) are time-barred by the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.09. Specifically, Cohen contends that since his breach of fiduciary duty claims are premised on allegations of fraud, the trial court erred by determining that the statute of limitations was not subject to \"the discovery rule.\" In the alternative, Cohen argues that even if R.C. 2305.09' s statute of limitations does apply to his breach of fiduciary duty claims, his claims are still not time-barred because the doctrines of equitable tolling and adverse domination apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Neither party disputes that the four-year statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.09 governs Cohen's breach of fiduciary duty claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caghan v.

Defendants, on the other hand, disagree and argue that the trial court correctly concluded that Cohen's breach of fiduciary duty claims did not properly plead claims for fraud and, as such, are not subject to the discovery rule. Accordingly, Defendants argue that the statute of limitations accrued when the alleged acts or omissions constituting the breach of fiduciary duties actually occurred. The resolution of this purely legal question necessarily dictates whether Cohen's claims are time-barred by R.C. 2305.09's four-year statute of limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"In determining the proper statute of limitations for a cause of action, the court must review the complaint to determine the essential character of the claim: '[I]n determining which limitation period will apply, courts must look to the actual nature or subject matter of the case, rather than to the form in which the action is pleaded.

Relevant to this portion of Cohen's argument, the trial court explicitly determined that counts 1 (breach of fiduciary duty) and 5 (breach of fiduciary duty owed to creditors) are not subject to the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After a careful review of Cohen's complaint, we agree that Cohen failed to plead a cause of action for fraud with particularity as required by Civ.R. 9(B). Crucial to this determination is the fact that, upon thorough review of Cohen's 105-paragraph complaint, this Court simply cannot discern which of the Defendants' acts or omissions Cohen is alleging to be fraudulent. Additionally, although Cohen utilized headings within his complaint for each claim, Cohen failed to caption his breach of fiduciary duty claims\n   with a heading indicating that those claims were based on fraudulent conduct. Lastly, although Cohen's complaint does assert that the Defendants' conduct constituting breaches of fiduciary duties \"were either knowing, willful, intentional or fraudulent, or were grossly negligent, reckless or in bad faith, and without justification or excuse,\" we conclude that this sort of \"catch-all\" language fails to meet the heightened pleading requirements that Civ.R. 9(B) mandates. Accordingly, we determine that Cohen has failed to properly plead a cause of action for fraud in this matter. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err by determining that the discovery rule was inapplicable to Cohen's breach of fiduciary duty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} However, our determination that the discovery rule does not apply to Cohen's breach of fiduciary duty claims does not end our analysis. Cohen argues on appeal that the trial court's decision that his claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.09 violates the law of the case doctrine where the trial court previously rejected this exact argument in its denial of Defendants' respective Civ.R. 12 motions and in its denial of the subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The law of the case doctrine provides that \"the decision of a\n   <em>\n    reviewing court\n   </em>\n   in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Nolan v.

The trial court concluded that the discovery rule did not apply to counts one and five because Cohen failed to comply with Civ.R. 9(B) as he did not plead fraud with particularity.

Cohen has not argued that the requirements of Civ.R. 9(B) do not apply to his claims and accordingly that issue is not before the Court.

As to the claims for waste and deepening insolvency/wrongful prolongation of corporate existence, I would conclude that the trial court's statement that they were not cognizable under Ohio law is insufficient to allow this Court to properly review the issue.

In other words, did the trial court find the causes of action were not sufficiently pled or that Ohio does not recognize these causes of action under any set of facts. Further, the trial court offered no analysis as to why Ohio should not recognize the causes of action as labeled.
