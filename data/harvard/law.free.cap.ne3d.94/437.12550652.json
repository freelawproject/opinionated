The victim knew the defendant as the boy friend of one of her mother's friends; after the defendant's girl friend had a baby, he \"started hanging out with [the victim and her family] a lot.\" They went to the lake because the defendant had a \"Jet-ski,\" and the families frequently went out to eat as a group. After a few months, the victim and the defendant began \"getting to know each other more\" when their families were not present; on one occasion the defendant's girl friend called the defendant from the victim's cellular telephone, and the victim saved the number so that she would have it \"for emergencies or anything.\" At some point thereafter, the defendant began calling the victim frequently (\"[a] couple times a day\") on her cellular telephone; he was the only person who answered his telephone when she called on the saved number she knew to be the defendant's. They began sending \"[a] lot\" of text messages and photographs to each other, with the victim always using the same telephone number to reach the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant soon began texting the victim that he loved her, and, when the victim responded that she loved him too, he messaged back, \"I love you my world,\" and \"if [she] loved him to call [him]\"; the defendant texted that \"he's never loved or talked to a woman, or he should say a little girl, so pretty like [the victim].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He told the victim that \"he's gonna die if he's not with [her]\" and \"my heart's yours and only yours.\" Over time, the victim began to believe that the defendant was her boy friend in addition to a father figure; she told him that she was eleven years old and he told her that he was \"twenty-something\" although, in fact, he was thirty-five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The victim and the defendant never went \"to stores or anything\" alone, but, on one occasion, she went on his Jet-ski and, while they were out on the lake, he tried to kiss her. She backed away because she \"didn't want to kiss him.\" At times when they were in the car together \"he would grab [her] leg but [she] wouldn't think of it in the wrong way.\" The defendant continuously told the victim that he loved her and he expressed to her his desire \"to take [her] over [to the Dominican Republic] so [they] could get married and [they] would be able to be together\"; he told her that \"in the Dominican Republic ... there [were] different laws and that [they] ... would be able to be together because ... the marriage thing was younger over there and they weren't so strict as they are over here in Lawrence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At some point, the victim's mother discovered the relationship between the defendant and the victim, and the mother confiscated the victim's cellular telephone for one week; the victim was unable to talk to the defendant during that time. The defendant later supplied the victim with a new purple cellular telephone with his telephone number preprogrammed into the contacts list.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Earlier, the defendant had instructed the victim to identify his telephone number by using a \"key word\" (the letter \"A\") so that, if the victim's mother saw the message she would not know that the victim was communicating with the defendant. In the telephone the defendant gave her, the victim saved his telephone number under the name \"Kiara\" \"so if [her] mom or anyone found the phone they wouldn't know that it was him.\" The victim also testified that she received a photograph of a penis attached to a text message sent from the defendant's telephone number. The victim's relationship with the defendant ended the day he was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim's mother testified that, when she checked her cellular telephone bill, she discovered multiple calls from her daughter to the defendant's telephone number; she was familiar with the defendant's telephone number because he had texted her from that same number on prior occasions. The mother was able to see from the itemized bill the dates and times of the calls between the victim and the defendant, with some of the calls occurring in the \"[m]iddle of the night\" and some as long as \"[a]n hour and a half.\" When she confronted the defendant, he denied any communication with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In support of his motion for a required finding of not guilty, the defendant argued that \"the only perceived tangible contact [with the victim] was of a kiss,\" and thus there was insufficient evidence of an indecent assault and battery. \"A touching is indecent when, judged by the 'normative standard' of societal mores, it is 'violative of social and behavioral expectations,' in a manner 'which [is] fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values ...

App. Ct. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (2004). \"We have held that an unwanted kiss on the mouth may constitute indecent conduct, where it involves forced insertion of the tongue. ... While a brief kiss not involving the insertion of the tongue is not generally criminally indecent, ... we do not 'requir[e] that there always be tongue involvement for an act that might be characterized as a kiss to be found indecent, [as the attendant circumstances] may allow the trier of fact rationally to determine that the kiss was an indecent act.' \"\n   <em>\n    Miozza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 572, quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658829\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/65/305/#p307\">\n    65 Mass. App. Ct. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (2005). In this case, the jury reasonably could have found that the kiss was an indecent act, due to the age disparity between the thirty-five year old defendant and the eleven year old victim; the conversations that the two were having, including his statement that he wished to marry her in the Dominican Republic; the texted photograph of a penis; and the fact that the victim was unwilling to kiss the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    Miozza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826913\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/567/#p571\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826913\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/567/#p571\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, even if the kiss itself was not an indecent assault and battery, the defendant was not charged with actually committing an indecent assault and battery. Rather, he was charged only with enticing the victim so that he would be able to commit the act. See\n   <em>\n    Disler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788806\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/216/#p222\">\n    451 Mass. at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"What the statute does require in addition to enticing words or gestures, and indeed what we conclude is needed to ensure that constitutionally protected communications are not criminalized by the statute, is that the person who entices does so with the intent to violate one or more of the enumerated criminal statutes; in other words, that the person who entices does so with a criminal mens rea. In sum, the crime of child enticement is complete when an individual, possessing the requisite criminal intent as set forth in [ G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26C(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ),] and discussed in greater detail below, employs words, gestures, or other means to entice [or lure, induce, persuade] someone who is under the age of sixteen, or whom the actor believes is under the age of sixteen, to enter or remain in a vehicle, dwelling, building, or outdoor space\" [emphasis omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Next, the defendant argues that there was no attempt at rape and nothing that would indicate a possible use of force. Again, we disagree. The sexual undertones of the text messages the defendant sent to the victim, together with the victim's age and the defendant's stated desire to bring her to the Dominican Republic to get married, provided the jurors with sufficient evidence for them to determine that the defendant had the requisite intent to have sexual intercourse with this underage child. See\n   <em>\n    LaPlante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831085\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/73/199/#p202\">\n    73 Mass. App. Ct. at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, given the more than twenty-year age difference between the parties, the circumstances of being alone with the child and the close relationship between their respective families, the jury would have been warranted in finding that the defendant intended to use at least constructive force to accomplish that goal. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835985\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/411/#p417\">\n    76 Mass.

App. Ct. 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913-914 (1997), and cases cited. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we are persuaded that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty.

The defendant next claims that the judge erred in admitting the text messages between the defendant and the victim because the text messages were not properly authenticated to establish that each was authored by the defendant; he also argues that the testimony regarding the texted photograph of a penis was inflammatory and more prejudicial than probative. Both arguments lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, the text messages were properly authenticated. \"To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gilman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456721\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/752/#p758\">\n    89 Mass.
