[\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] they wanna [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] go to jail?\" The defendant testified at trial that he responded to the demand because he \"would rather pay the money th[a]n go through all this,\" and that he did not want J.D. to \"[t]ell the police that we raped her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \"We recognize an exception to the hearsay rule whereby statements of joint venturers are admissible against each other if the statements are made both during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%2022\">\n    478 Mass. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (2017) (quotation omitted).

The text message conversation revealed a prevailing fear between the defendant and at least one codefendant that criminal charges could result if they did not pay. Moreover, the defendant testified that he wanted to pay J.D. so he would not be \"accused or be prosecuted\"; that he knew why the police arrived at his house after the rapes occurred; and that he knew that J.D. might go to the police if he did not pay her. The jury reasonably could infer that the defendant intended to pay J.D. in an attempt to conceal evidence of the crimes, an act suggestive of consciousness of guilt.
