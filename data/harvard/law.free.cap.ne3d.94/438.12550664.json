The evidence showed that the father had failed to visit or even contact the child since August of 2015-more than eight months prior to the trial.

Because of this history, the father's continued sobriety, treatment, and counselling were essential elements of his service plans. Accordingly, the judge properly considered evidence of the father's prior behavior in connection with the father's failure to maintain service plans or obtain counselling.\n   <em>\n    Talik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Erroneous findings\n   </em>\n   . The judge made over 150 detailed factual findings, based closely on the evidence, warranting the conclusion that the father was unfit to parent the child and likely would remain unfit in the future. The judge's findings were supported by the testimony of two closely-involved DCF social workers and thirty-two documentary exhibits.

Contrary to the father's argument, the judge did not base that decision solely on the father's lying to DCF and the mother's hospitalization. Rather, the judge based that decision on fourteen separate reasons, including the father's continued use of alcohol while caring for the child, leaving the child alone with the mentally ill mother despite promising not to do so, and his continued failure to maintain a safe living environment for the child. The judge's finding that \"[a] clearly dirty and malfunctioning kerosene furnace in a small, enclosed place, with no carbon monoxide detector presents a danger\" was well grounded in common sense, and the judge was not required to credit the testimony of the oil company representative who admitted that he was \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an expert in flammables or combustibles\" and had no working sense of smell.

DCF directed these services towards permanent reunification until the father's issues with alcohol consumption, service plan noncompliance, and failure to maintain a safe home environment led DCF to seek to terminate the parents' rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the father was not provided with visitation during his incarceration, he was incarcerated only for three weeks in April, 2015, and some weeks between late June and early July, 2015. The father was not denied child visitation or DCF services after his release but rather chose to cease cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DCF ceased its permanent reunification efforts only after the father again failed to engage and comply with his service plans-including being evicted from housing for being highly intoxicated. He remains in complete noncompliance with his latest plan, and has had no contact with DCF or the child since August, 2015.
