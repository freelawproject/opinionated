On the night of March 25, 2011, Officer Michael O'Connell of the Lynn police department and his partner responded to an apartment building in Lynn to investigate a \"hang-up\" 911 telephone call. While standing in the vestibule of the building, O'Connell saw, through a windowed but locked inner door, what he believed to be a drug transaction occurring in the common hallway inside. He shouldered the door open and announced that police were present. Hernandez then ran into the nearby apartment (apartment 1), while holding a knotted plastic baggie, or \"twist,\" containing a powdery substance and bringing his hand to his mouth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers pursued, and, after a struggle, subdued Hernandez and placed him under arrest. O'Connell then searched Hernandez and found five twists of a rock-like substance, four of a brown powdery substance, and one of a white powdery substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Hernandez was arraigned on March 29, 2011. The substances in the twists recovered from Hernandez were tested for the presence of narcotics at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute (Hinton drug lab) in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston on July 11, 2011. A little more than one year later, on August 30, 2012, the Hinton drug lab was closed due to revelations regarding the misconduct of chemist Annie Dookhan.

The Commonwealth concedes that 184 days are included in the rule 36 calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hernandez makes two arguments regarding additional time which, if charged to the Commonwealth, would bring the tally of included days above 366.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Hearing on motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . First, Hernandez argues that a delay in hearing his motion to suppress should be charged to the Commonwealth. We disagree. The motion to suppress was filed on June 23, 2011. The hearing on that motion commenced on November 22, 2011, and was completed on March 12, 2012, when the judge took the motion under advisement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 36(b)(2)(A)(v) states expressly that \"delay resulting from hearings on pretrial motions\" is \"excluded in computing the time within which the trial of any offense must commence.\" The Reporter's Notes state: \"The excludable period under this subdivision is intended to run from the date on which the request for hearing on the pretrial motion is filed, or, if no such request is filed, from the date the hearing is ordered, until the conclusion of the hearing.\" Reporter's Notes to Rule 36, Massachusetts Rules of Court, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 211 (Thompson Reuters 2017). See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987541\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/21/368/#p371\">\n    21 Mass. App. Ct. 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371 (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, the default rule is that the period between the date that the hearing on the motion was ordered and the date that the hearing was concluded is excluded from the rule 36 calculation. Hernandez argues for an exception to the rule because the Commonwealth was not ready to proceed with the hearing on the afternoon of November 22, 2011, or on other dates prior to March 12, 2012. The record, however, does not reflect this. Instead, it shows merely that, when the judge sought to continue the hearing after the lunch break on November 22, 2011, the prosecutor reported that he could not do so because he had a conflict. This is not a situation like that described in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Amidon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651294\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/1005/#p1009\">\n    428 Mass. 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1009 (1998), where one defendant repeatedly tried to schedule a hearing on a motion to suppress but was unable to do so because the Commonwealth failed to cooperate. Moreover, \"[o]ur precedent firmly establishes that a defendant must object to a continuance to include the resulting delay in a rule 36 calculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Denehy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223614\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/723/#p731\">\n    466 Mass. 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (2014). Accordingly, the time between November 22, 2011, and March 12, 2012, is excluded from the rule 36 calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Discovery delay\n   </em>\n   . Next, Hernandez argues that a lengthy delay while he sought discovery should be charged to the Commonwealth because the discovery was prompted by the unfolding Dookhan scandal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hernandez first sought the discovery by filing a motion for exculpatory evidence on December 10, 2012, asking whether either of the testing chemists had been suspended or had any sanctions imposed on them. The motion was allowed, and, after contacting Frasca during a court recess, the prosecutor reported that Frasca and Saunders had been placed on administrative leave with pay, but had not been sanctioned or suspended. Hernandez then filed a second request for exculpatory evidence that day, seeking the chemists' personnel files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A continuance followed, with no objection noted. When the parties were back in court on January 17, 2013, the Commonwealth took the position that additional information responsive to Hernandez's requests was not in its possession or control for purposes of Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(1)(A), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=444%20Mass.%201501\">\n    444 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), and that a subpoena issued pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 17(a)(2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20886\">\n    378 Mass. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), would be required to obtain the information. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wanis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369545\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/639/#p643\">\n    426 Mass. 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643-644 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 27, 2013, Hernandez filed a motion seeking issuance of subpoenas for: (i) Frasca's employment file; (ii) administrative guidelines, procedures, or protocols describing the handling and testing of evidence for controlled substances at the Hinton drug lab; and (iii) \"all such guidelines regarding the process, procedures, rights and appeals of employees during investigative procedures when misconduct is alleged.\" The motion was not allowed until July 1, 2013, when a special assistant attorney general appeared at the hearing and discussed compliance with the subpoenas and possible redaction of documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties made additional appearances in the case on August 12, October 21, and December 6, 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   without production of the responsive documents. No objections to delay are noted on the docket during this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 23, 2014, a judge in the Lynn District Court ordered the case transferred to the time standards session in the Peabody District Court, for an appearance on February 25, 2014. The transferring judge directed in his order that the thirty-two days between January 23 and February 25, 2014, would be charged to the Commonwealth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 25, 2014, a judge in the Peabody session dismissed the case due to lack of compliance with the motion for subpoenas. The next day, the prosecutor learned that the responsive documents had been received by the clerk's office on December 4, 2013, but had erroneously been placed in the file of another case being handled by Hernandez's attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 19, 2014, the Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration. That motion was allowed on April 29 and the case was restored to the court's docket, with a motion session scheduled for June 16 and trial scheduled for July 9, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant argues that all of the time between December 10, 2012, and the trial date of July 9, 2014, should be included in the rule 36 calculation. In the alternative, he argues that the time between the allowance of the rule 17 motion on July 1, 2013, and the trial date should be included.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hernandez does not argue that the discovery he sought in the motions filed on December 10, 2012, and March 28, 2013, was mandatory pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(1). Where a defendant seeks discretionary discovery pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20874\">\n    378 Mass. 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), it remains \"the established principle that discovery motions filed by a defendant automatically toll the speedy trial clock.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308042\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/516/#p527\">\n    469 Mass. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Even assuming that the discovery Hernandez sought was mandatory (because it was exculpatory and should have been considered within the control of the prosecutor), Hernandez never brought a motion to compel or a motion for sanctions until he filed his motion to dismiss on February 25, 2014.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, as in\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the defendant \"did not take adequate steps to preserve his rule 36 rights\" during the time his discovery requests were pending.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308042\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/516/#p527\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308042\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/516/#p527\">\n    . at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The motion judge found that O'Connell, the arresting officer, saw the defendant standing in front of the open door to apartment 1, face to face with another man who was standing in the doorway. O'Connell saw that man hand Hernandez some cash, and saw Hernandez hand him a plastic baggie containing a dark substance. The man then handed the object back to Hernandez, who held it up to the light to examine it. The judge found that O'Connell reasonably believed he had witnessed a drug transaction. These findings were sufficient to establish probable cause. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santaliz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902432\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/413/238/#p239\">\n    413 Mass. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-241 (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to exigency, the motion judge found that, after O'Connell shouldered open the lobby door and yelled \"Police,\" Hernandez ran into apartment 1 while putting the item he was holding into his mouth; O'Connell followed him into the apartment \"to prevent the destruction of evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"A reasonable belief as to the potential loss or destruction of evidence may create exigent circumstances permitting a warrantless search and seizure of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47216\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/616/#p619\">\n    439 Mass. at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, Hernandez argues that the trial judge improperly prevented his counsel from effectively cross-examining Frasca, the primary chemist, in order to impeach her credibility. \"A defendant has a constitutional right to examine a witness as to bias. Nevertheless, a judge may limit the scope of cross-examination as long as he or she does not completely bar inquiry into a relevant subject.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667987\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/857/#p873\">\n    456 Mass. 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 873 (2010) (citation omitted). Although the trial judge sustained numerous objections during cross-examination, he did not completely bar inquiry into any relevant subject. Instead, the judge sustained individual objections where, for example, the questioning was without proper foundation, sought to elicit hearsay, or assumed facts not in evidence.

On May 14, the hearing was continued again to July 1, and Hernandez claims that the transcript shows an objection to this continuance even though the docket does not (we note that the Commonwealth concedes in its brief that this continuance was over the objection of defendant's counsel). This is of no consequence, however, because the hearing on the motion for subpoenas was not concluded until July 1, 2013, and thus, the time is excluded.
