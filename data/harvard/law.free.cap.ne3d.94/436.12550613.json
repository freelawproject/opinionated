After a jury trial, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the judge's failure to include a specific requested jury instruction was error. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The plaintiff injured her back in an automobile accident in 2000 and took a medical leave of absence from work. Upon her return, she learned that her employment duties had been changed. In 2002, physically unable to perform her new duties, she was offered and accepted early retirement from the department. This lawsuit followed. In this appeal, she argues that she requested the judge give a jury instruction regarding \"her ability to perform the essential functions\" of her previous position specifically, and that the judge erred in not instructing the jury as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   To effectively preserve an asserted error in a jury instruction, it must be objected to.\n   <em>\n    Jarry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Corsaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035682\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/40/601/#p603\">\n    40 Mass.

In the event that an error is found, we will not set aside a verdict \"unless the error was prejudicial-that is, unless the result might have differed absent the error.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackstone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cashman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856108\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/255/#p270\">\n    448 Mass. 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270 (2007).

In fact, at side bar following the completion of the jury instructions, the judge inquired of counsel whether they considered the instructions complete and appropriate. In response, plaintiff's counsel responded with a request that the judge instruct \"the jury as to what the life expectancy was,\" a figure to which the parties had stipulated. The judge accommodated the request. At that time counsel had the opportunity to object further, and did not. As there is no evidence provided in the record to suggest the plaintiff's argument was preserved at trial, and since we find no error that would result in manifest injustice, we deem the issue waived.
