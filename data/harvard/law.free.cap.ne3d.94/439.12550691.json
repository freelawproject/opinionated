(father) filed a petition in the Suffolk Division of the Probate and Family Court for custody of his son, F.C. (child). The father simultaneously filed a motion for special findings, requesting that the court enter specific factual findings necessary to establish the child's eligibility to apply to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for special immigrant juvenile (SIJ) status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of the motion, the father and the child both submitted affidavits describing neglect that the child had suffered from the child's mother, M.T. (mother), while living in El Salvador, including but not limited to: the mother's inability to provide financially for the child, her inability to protect the child from repeated gang harassment and other violence, and her inability to intervene when he was threatened by local gang members who were recruiting him and threatening to harm the family if she refused to pay them. Her neglect in this regard caused him to suffer emotionally and eventually quit school. In the United States, the child is living with his father and brother in a stable environment and is attending high school without a constant fear of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The mother was served with the complaint, summons, and motion for special findings. She filed an affidavit, agreeing that the father should be awarded full custody of the child. She does not contest any of the aforementioned facts regarding her neglect of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After a nonevidentiary hearing, the judge issued a written order granting the child's custody to the father but denying the motion for special findings. Thereafter, a timely appeal was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Because there was no evidentiary hearing, and the motion judge based her decision entirely on the documentary record, \"we are in as good a position as the probate judge was to decide questions of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Bluhm\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peresada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731741\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/5/766/#p766\">\n    5 Mass.

The affidavits of the father and child are consistent with each other and the facts contained therein are undisputed. Here, the uncontested averments in the affidavits show that the mother is unable \"to take those actions necessary to provide a child with minimally adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, supervision, emotional stability and growth, or other essential care.\" 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2 (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As the facts are uncontested, and the relief requested by the petitioner is time-sensitive, we choose to address the merits and, in doing so, we make the following special findings and rulings based on the record before us:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. F.C. was born on November 3, 1998, in Reina Chalatenango, El Salvador and currently resides with his father, J.C., in the city of Chelsea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.

The order of the Probate and Family court denying the motion for special findings is reversed. The matter is remanded to that court where a decree is to enter forthwith incorporating the numbered findings recited in this memorandum and order. The First Justice of the Suffolk Division of the Probate and Family court shall direct the Register to also enter the decree forthwith.
