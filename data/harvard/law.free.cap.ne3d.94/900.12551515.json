An order of protection was issued, and appellant filed objections to it and a motion to vacate the civil protection order. In an entry dated April 21, 2017, the trial court overruled appellant's objections except as to the inclusion of appellee's mother and two daughters as protected persons under the stalking order. Appellant filed the instant appeal on June 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} App.R. 3(A) expressly states that the only jurisdictional requirement for the filing of a valid appeal is to file a notice of appeal within the time allowed by App.R. 4. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the failure to comply with the time requirements of App.R. 4(A) is a jurisdictional defect, which is fatal to an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    In re H.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/120/499/\">\n    120 Ohio St.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-6810\">\n    2008-Ohio-6810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20N.E.2d%20607\">\n    900 N.E.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

If the Civ.R. 58(B) service does not occur within three days, the time to appeal does not begin to run until service is made and noted in the appearance docket.\n   <em>\n    Coles v.

On that same date, the clerk of courts noted on the appearance docket that copies of that order were mailed by regular mail to the parties. Since service was made on appellant within the three day period required in Civ.R. 58(B), the thirty day time period began to run on the date of entry of judgment, i.e. April 21, 2017. Thus, the deadline for appellant to file her notice of appeal was May 22, 2017, which was not a holiday or a weekend. Accordingly, appellant's June 15, 2017 notice of appeal from the April 21, 2017 entry was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} This court is not empowered to extend the time deadline in civil cases.\n   <em>\n    Pendell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20N.E.2d%20713\">\n    531 N.E.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   App.R. 14(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Based upon the foregoing, this appeal is hereby dismissed, sua sponte, pursuant to App.R. 4(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appeal dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   THOMAS R.
