We hold that summary judgment should have been granted in defendant Perkins' favor on both issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action arose out of a construction project to build a forensic biology laboratory at 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street and First Avenue in Manhattan, adjacent to Bellevue Hospital, for use by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). The City (on behalf of OCME) and DASNY entered into a project management agreement, which provided that DASNY would finance and manage the design and construction of the laboratory (the project). DASNY was authorized to enter into contracts with the necessary contractors and consultants including, as relevant here, the architect, Perkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to the contract between DASNY and Perkins (the Perkins contract), Perkins was to provide design, architectural, and engineering services for the project and supervise its construction. Perkins was also responsible for providing a site plan for the location of the laboratory in relation to the hospital. The contract further provides that Perkins would \"indemnify and hold harmless\" DASNY and the \"Client\" (that\n   is, OCME, and the NYC Police and Fire Departments) from any claims arising out of Perkins' negligent acts or omissions and that extra costs or expenses incurred by DASNY and the Client as a result of Perkins' \"design errors or omissions shall be recoverable from [Perkins] and/or its Professional Liability Insurance carrier.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to a separate contract, DASNY retained Samson Construction Co., which is not a party to this appeal, as the contractor to provide excavation and foundation work for the Project. Significantly, the contract executed between DASNY and Samson provides that the client-i.e., the City-\"is an intended third party beneficiary of the Contract for the purposes of recovering any damages caused by [Samson].\" Although there are passing references to the client in the Perkins contract, no analogous language providing that the City is an intended third-party beneficiary appears there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Work began on the foundation in May 2002, but the failure to properly install an excavation support system led to substantial damage and delays. In particular, this failure caused the adjacent C &amp; D building on the Bellevue campus to \"settle\" by as much as eight inches, damaged other adjacent structures (including sidewalks, sewers and water mains), and required emergency repairs. These issues caused the project to be delayed by more than 18 months at an additional cost of $37 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action against Samson in August 2006. Perkins was added as a defendant in February 2007 through the filing of a supplemental summons and complaint, which contained two causes of action against Perkins-one alleging breach of contract and the other alleging negligence. The breach of contract claim alleges that Perkins breached the contract by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"failing to provide adequate designs for the Project, by failing to properly supervise the subcontractors and subconsultants that it retained with regard to the Project, by failing to monitor the progress of the Work to ensure that it was being completed properly and in substantial compliance with the design recommendations, specifications and their intent, by failing to ascertain the actual field conditions, including the subsurface\n   conditions at the Site and the foundations beneath [the C &amp;]D Building\n   and by failing to advise DASNY of the risks to the [C &amp;]D Building posed by the installation of the [excavation support system] and taking precautions against such risks.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The allegations set forth in the negligence cause of action are virtually identical in every respect, but with an introductory phrase that references Perkins' failure \"to comply with professional standards of care\" instead of breach of contract. The damages for both claims are described as the \"significant additional expenses\" necessary to complete the project. Although the complaint's ad damnum clause states a figure for Perkins' negligence that is $4 million higher than for its breach of contract, there is no basis given for the additional amount. During early discovery, plaintiffs produced a binder and provided testimony showing that the total cost of fixing the damage was approximately $37 million, including repairs to the project site and the adjacent structures, with no distinction drawn between the two claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Perkins moved for summary judgment to dismiss the City's breach of contract and negligence claims and to dismiss DASNY's negligence claim as duplicative of its breach of contract claim. Supreme Court granted the motion in part, dismissing the City's breach of contract and negligence claims (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20NY%20Slip%20Op%2034183\">\n    2013 NY Slip Op 34183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [U] [2013] ). The court held that the City was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the Perkins contract and that the City's claim for simple negligence was therefore time-barred. The court allowed both of DASNY's claims to proceed, finding that its negligence claim was not duplicative of its contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Appellate Division modified by denying Perkins' motion for summary judgment on the City's breach of contract claim and, as so modified, affirmed (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166756\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/433/\">\n    137 A.D.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166756\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/433/\">\n    27 N.Y.S.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ). The Court held that the City had raised an issue of fact whether it was an intended third-party beneficiary of the parties' contract. The Court also denied Perkins' motion for summary judgment to dismiss DASNY's negligence claim as duplicative of its breach of contract claim. The Court held there was an issue of fact whether Perkins assumed a duty of care to perform in accordance with professional standards that was independent of its contractual obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One Justice dissented in part, and would have dismissed DASNY's negligence claim as duplicative. The Appellate Division granted Perkins' motion for leave to appeal to this Court,\n   certifying the following question: \"Was the order of this Court, which modified the order of the Supreme Court, properly made?\" We answer the certified question in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Intended Third-Party Beneficiary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[A] third party may sue as a beneficiary on a contract made for [its] benefit.

We have previously sanctioned a third party's right to enforce a contract in two situations: when the third party is the only one who could recover for the breach of contract or when it is otherwise clear from the language of the contract that there was \"an intent to permit enforcement by the third party\" (\n   <em>\n    Fourth Ocean Putnam Corp. v.

In the absence of express language, \"[s]uch third parties are generally considered mere incidental beneficiaries\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2326345\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/40/652/#p655\">\n    40 N.Y.2d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.Y.S.2d%20327\">\n    389 N.Y.S.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20N.E.2d%20983\">\n    357 N.E.2d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). This rule reflects the particular nature of construction contracts and the fact that-as is the case here-there are often several contracts between various entities, with performance ultimately benefitting all of the entities involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, the parties were aware that the laboratory was being built for OCME's use. However, neither ground set out in\n   <em>\n    Fourth Ocean\n   </em>\n   exists for finding the City an intended third-party beneficiary (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4400687\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/66/38/#p45\">\n    66 N.Y.2d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20N.Y.S.2d%201\">\n    495 N.Y.S.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20N.E.2d%20208\">\n    485 N.E.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As to the first ground, the City is not the only entity that can recover under the Perkins contract; indeed, DASNY-the contracting party-has brought its own breach of contract claim. As to the second ground, the Perkins contract does not expressly name the City as an intended third-party beneficiary nor authorize the City to enforce any obligations thereunder; in contrast, the contract between DASNY and Samson expressly reserves third-party enforcement rights to the City. Notably, the Restatement uses a fact pattern that is nearly identical to this one to provide an illustration of an incidental (as opposed to intentional) third-party beneficiary-recognizing the fact that, although the performance\n   of a construction-related contract may benefit a third-party end-user, that does not in itself establish enforcement rights in that third party (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Restatement [Second] of Contracts \u00a7 302, Comment\n   <em>\n    e,\n   </em>\n   Illustration 19). The City fails to raise an issue of fact concerning its status as a third-party beneficiary and Perkins' motion for summary judgment on this issue should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Duplicative Negligence Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"It is a well-established principle that a simple breach of contract is not to be considered a tort unless a legal duty independent of the contract itself has been violated\" (\n   <em>\n    Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v.

Put another way, where the damages alleged \"were clearly within the contemplation of the written agreement ...

In certain circumstances, this independent duty has been imposed based on the nature of the services performed and the defendant's relationship with its customer-specifically, where the defendant \"perform[s] a service affected with a significant public interest [and where the] failure to perform the service carefully and competently can have catastrophic consequences\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423891\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/540/#p551\">\n    79 N.Y.2d at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.Y.S.2d%20957\">\n    583 N.Y.S.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.E.2d%201365\">\n    593 N.E.2d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Indeed, as noted above, in this case, the factual allegations set forth in each cause of action are\n   <em>\n    identical,\n   </em>\n   except\n   that the negligence claim is framed in terms of Perkins' failure to comply with professional standards of care. Moreover, despite the fact that the complaint seeks an additional unspecified $4 million in damages under the negligence cause of action, it fails to include a single allegation that contains any distinction between the damages applicable to either claim. The only damages alleged under either theory of recovery are the additional expenses required to complete the project, including the costs to repair the damage to adjacent structures. Significantly, in the contract itself, the parties contemplated Perkins' responsibility for additional costs or expenses incurred by DASNY or the client (in effect, the City) as a result of the architect's design errors or omissions, and addressed it in the contract terms. Likewise, during discovery, the total amount of damages was detailed by DASNY, with no distinction between the \"additional expenses\" incurred based on one claim or the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The cases relied upon by the dissent-\n   <em>\n    Santulli v.

We distinguished between the situation where the harm was an \"abrupt, cataclysmic occurrence\" not contemplated by the contracting parties and one where the plaintiff was essentially seeking enforcement of contract rights (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423891\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/540/#p551\">\n    79 N.Y.2d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.Y.S.2d%20957\">\n    583 N.Y.S.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.E.2d%201365\">\n    593 N.E.2d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Here, the C &amp; D building settled during the course of several months, damaging adjacent structures. However, even if any \"abrupt\" or \"catastrophic\" consequences either could have or did result from Perkins' alleged negligence, the fact remains that the only damages alleged appear to have been within the contemplation of the parties under the contract-and, indeed, as set forth above, are identical for both claims. Put another way, there was no injury alleged here that a separate negligence claim would include that is not already encompassed in DASNY's contract claim.

The sole issue in that case was whether damages should be measured at the time of breach or the time of trial. Moreover, the majority mischaracterizes the Appellate Division's decision in that case. The Appellate Division did not hold-or even suggest-that a party may not simultaneously pursue both a malpractice claim and a contract claim through the conclusion of trial. Instead, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Brushton-Moira\n   </em>\n   had pursued both such claims through trial. Supreme Court denied recovery to the plaintiff on both theories.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Brushton-Moira\n   </em>\n   supports DASNY's ability to pursue both theories through the completion of trial, and certainly contains no implication that a pretrial dismissal on the ground of duplication is appropriate. Today's decision cannot be squared with our prior precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The majority also misapplies\n   <em>\n    Sommer\n   </em>\n   by confusing the test that applies when a plaintiff seeks to maintain a claim for\n   ordinary negligence-not professional negligence-alongside a claim for breach of contract. Because no professional, and hence no special standard of care, is involved, we have refused to let a plaintiff proceed simultaneously with both when the gravamen is essentially for breach of contract, relegating the plaintiff to its contract claim alone, unless the alleged breach affects a significant public interest and failure to perform the service carefully could have catastrophic consequences (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sommer\n   </em>\n   at 552-553,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.Y.S.2d%20957\">\n    583 N.Y.S.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.E.2d%201365\">\n    593 N.E.2d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The \"public interest\" and \"catastrophic consequences\" analyses apply only to ordinary negligence claims that duplicate contract claims, not to professional malpractice claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In professional malpractice cases, the independent legal duty is established by law; there is no need to search further for one, and it exists independent of any contract. So long as that duty is asserted by the plaintiff, he or she can maintain both contract and professional malpractice causes of action. Here, DASNY asserts that Perkins failed to comply with professional standards of care. Because of its status as an architect, Perkins has an independent legal duty to comply with those professional standards, contract or no, and without any application of the public interest/catastrophic consequences test. DASNY's alleged damages on each claim are the same $37 million. It cannot recover $74 million even if successful on both the contract and malpractice claims, but under our prior caselaw, it is free to pursue both theories to judgment. Accordingly, I dissent from the dismissal of DASNY's malpractice claim against Perkins.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Here, the City and DASNY are highly sophisticated parties. As described in its brief, DASNY's raison d'etre is \"to help finance and construct public projects for New York's higher education, health care, and public institutions.\" In the contract between DASNY and the general contractor, Samson, DASNY and the City specifically provided that the City could sue for breach, but in the DASNY contract with Perkins, DASNY and the City omitted any such right. Those facts weigh very heavily here; I do not take our decision to suggest that, absent the sophistication of the parties or the clear difference in the City's right to sue under contracts concerning a single project, dismissal would nevertheless have been proper.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v.

Summary judgment disposition is inappropriate where varying inferences may be drawn, because in those cases it is for the factfinder to weigh the evidence and resolve any issues necessary to a final conclusion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20N.Y.S.2d%20584\">\n    550 N.Y.S.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20N.E.2d%201155\">\n    549 N.E.2d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With respect to the City's claim, the majority's standard is perilously close to requiring that a contract expressly name a nonparty as a third-party beneficiary. Yet this is not the law. A nonparty that \"is not a stranger to the contract,\" and whose relationship with the defendant is the \"functional equivalent of privity,\" may assert a breach (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Oyster Bay v. Lizza Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292660\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/1024/#p1030\">\n    22 N.Y.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292660\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/1024/#p1030\">\n    981 N.Y.S.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292660\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/1024/#p1030\">\n    4 N.E.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2013] [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting\n   <em>\n    City School Dist. of City of Newburgh v. Hugh Stubbins &amp; Associates, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4434566\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/535/#p538\">\n    85 N.Y.2d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538-539,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4434566\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/535/#p538\">\n    626 N.Y.S.2d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4434566\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/535/#p538\">\n    650 N.E.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1995] ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Glen Banks, New York Contract Law \u00a7 8:11 [2d ed 28 West's NY Prac Series 2017] [\"Enforcement of the contract-Third-party beneficiary\"]; 22 N.Y. Jur 2d Contracts \u00a7 303 ). Here, the Appellate Division properly concluded an issue of fact exists as to whether the City is an intended third-party beneficiary of the DASNY-Perkins contract, because \"[t]he contract expressly states that a city agency will operate the DNA laboratory, and the City retained control over various aspects of the project, including participation in and approval of the design of the building, the budget for the project, the selection of contractors, including Perkins, and the construction of the building\" (\n   <em>\n    Dormitory Auth. of State v. Samson Const. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166756\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/433/\">\n    137 A.D.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166756\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/433/\">\n    27 N.Y.S.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ). I would add that DASNY is a \"public benefit corporation,\" whose stated mission, helping finance and construct public projects, and established role, serving as project manager for government entities on projects similar to the City's DNA lab, suggest Perkins understood the real beneficiary was DASNY's named governmental client: the City. The contract also stipulated that the City was an insured on Perkins' general liability insurance policy, and that in the\n   case of litigation Perkins would \"indemnify and hold harmless [DASNY and] the Client ... against all claims arising out of the negligent acts, alleged negligent acts, or failure to act, by [Perkins].\" Given that these contractual provisions suggest Perkins knew the City was the project's intended beneficiary, questions of fact foreclose the drastic remedy of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to DASNY's professional malpractice claim, the majority misreads our case law. In\n   <em>\n    Sommer v. Federal Signal Corp.\n   </em>\n   , this Court stated that professionals \"may be subject to tort liability for failure to exercise reasonable care, irrespective of their contractual duties\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423891\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/540/#p551\">\n    79 N.Y.2d 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.Y.S.2d%20957\">\n    583 N.Y.S.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.E.2d%201365\">\n    593 N.E.2d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1992] [citations omitted] ). Thus, for the reasons thoroughly discussed in Judge Wilson's dissent, in which I join, summary judgment dismissing that cause of action should not have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Order reversed, with costs, and defendant Perkins Eastman Architects, P.C.'s motion, insofar as it sought summary judgment dismissing the fifth cause of action for breach of contract and dismissing the sixth cause of action for negligence, granted and certified question answered in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Judges Stein, Fahey, Garcia and Feinman concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Judge Wilson dissents in part in an opinion, in which Judge Rivera concurs in part in a separate dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
