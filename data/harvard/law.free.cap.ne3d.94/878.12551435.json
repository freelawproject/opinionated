Miranda, was convicted of operating under the influence of alcohol after being stopped when he appeared to try to evade a sobriety checkpoint by making an illegal turn. Rejecting his challenge to the seizure of his person and to the impanelment of his jury, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Suppression\n   </em>\n   . The defendant, upon approaching a sobriety checkpoint, stopped at a green light and then made an illegal left turn, causing oncoming traffic to slow or stop. Observing this, a State police sergeant promptly stopped the defendant's vehicle. Detecting numerous indications of the defendant's intoxication, the sergeant placed the defendant into his cruiser and drove him to the checkpoint for further investigation by officers conducting the checkpoint. At the checkpoint, the defendant made an incriminating statement, failed two field sobriety tests, and took a breathalyzer test. Ultimately, the motion judge allowed the defendant's motion to suppress the statement and the breathalyzer results, but denied his motion to suppress the field sobriety tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Having observed the motor vehicle infraction, the sergeant was entitled to stop the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163863\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/208/#p212\">\n    84 Mass. App. Ct. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (2013). Once the sergeant developed reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant was operating under the influence of alcohol, extending the seizure to allow for field sobriety tests was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eckert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286822\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/591/#p598\">\n    431 Mass. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 598 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant's citation to the law governing sobriety checkpoints is unavailing, as the defendant was stopped for an independent motor vehicle infraction prior to arriving at the checkpoint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even were we to apply that body of law, nothing in the record suggests any violation of the principle that \"a sobriety checkpoint must 'be governed by standard, neutral guidelines that clearly forbid the arbitrary selection of vehicles to be initially stopped.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224269\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/1012/#p1013\">\n    466 Mass. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013 (2013), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670424\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/318/#p322\">\n    454 Mass. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322-323 (2009).

The Supreme Judicial Court has left the decision whether to ask potential jurors about attitudes towards persons of Hispanic ancestry to the sound discretion of trial judges.

App. Ct. 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780-781 (1999). We reverse for an abuse of discretion only upon \"a demonstration that the judge 'made a clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20474\">\n    91 Mass.

We discern no such abuse of discretion in the trial judge's decision not to ask the potential jurors here about such attitudes, in a case without a victim and with no indication of racial or ethnic issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    The judge determined that the statements were the product of custodial interrogation without the benefit of Miranda warnings.

In any event, regardless of what the prosecutor argued at the suppression hearing, we may affirm on any ground supported by the findings and the record.\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Abdallah\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457190\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/47/#p51\">\n     475 Mass. 47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 51 (2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    After the defendant was introduced to the venire, the trial judge asked the jurors whether they were \"aware of any bias or prejudice\" for either side and whether there was \"any reason why [they] would not be impartial,\" receiving no positive responses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
