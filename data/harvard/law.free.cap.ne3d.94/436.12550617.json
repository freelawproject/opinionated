Krasnecky, pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen years of age or older. See G.L.c. 265, \u00a7 13H. He filed a motion to vacate his guilty pleas in which he asserted that the Commonwealth's recitation of facts did not support findings of an indecent touching. The plea judge denied his motion, and this appeal followed. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . At his plea colloquy, the defendant agreed to the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   \"Webster Police were dispatched to the area of Memorial Beach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"While interacting with Mr. Krasnecky they did have to place him under arrest. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"[I]t was made known to [the] [o]fficer ... that two individuals indicated that Mr. Krasnecky had touched them in a sexual way without any right, justification, excuse or consent. They were of the age of 14 or over at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"One individual alleges that Mr. Krasnecky had kissed her on the neck inappropriately. She did not want that to happen. The other individual had stated that he rubbed his lower back towards the top of his butt area, again with no right, justification, excuse or consent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

The defendant's hands went down the victim's back reaching towards his buttocks-a private area of the body.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 315-316. The defendant asserts that the touching was not indecent because his hand did not actually reach the buttocks. We disagree. The intimacy of any area of the body is contextual.
