R.G. and C.F.-M. were neighbors who had a tumultuous relationship. R.G. told C.F.-M. to stay away from her children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about June 18, 2016, C.F.-M. asked R.G.'s four year old son to come to her house with the promise of colored markers. R.G. became concerned when she could not find her son. She enlisted the other members of the household in a search. R.G. \"scream[ed]\" and \"yell[ed]\" for her son, but he did not answer. C.F.-M. and the boy were hiding behind a bush on C.F.-M.'s property. C.F.-M. did not respond, and told the boy to be quiet because they were playing hide and seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A month later, on or about July 16, 2016, C.F.-M. went to R.G.'s house uninvited and stated to R.G. that if R.G. did not make peace with her then she would \"take measures.\" R.G. told C.F.-M. to leave her family alone and stay away. Finally, at a time and date unspecified, C.F.-M. came to R.G.'s home \"in the middle of the night\" and pounded on the door, \"screaming [R.G.'s] name\" and asking R.G. to come outside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.G. sought a harassment prevention order on the basis that C.F.-M. had intimidated her and placed her in fear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In reviewing the three acts, we are mindful that fear is judged by a subjective standard.\n   <em>\n    Gassman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461184\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/1/#p7\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461184\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/1/#p7\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he question is only whether [the plaintiff] in fact was placed in fear, not whether the fear was reasonable\").

The judge was also aware of R.G.'s repeated requests that C.F.-M. leave R.G. and her children alone. The judge could also find that C.F.-M.'s statement that she would \"take measures\" to be a threat. Although the act of banging on the door in the middle of the night is more ambiguous, it must be viewed in context.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    A.T\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    C.R\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778967\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/532/#p535\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778967\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/532/#p535\">\n    at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The judge could permissibly find that the act of hiding the child, combined with C.F.-M.'s statement that she would \"take measures\" if R.G. did not make peace with her, and C.F.-M.'s loud and disruptive visit to the home in the middle of the night, were all intended and designed to intimidate R.G. and cause her fear. The judge could also find that R.G. found C.F.-M.'s conduct and statements to be threatening. These findings were based on the resolution of what was essentially a battle of credibility. We will not second guess the judge's credibility determination as to C.F.-M.'s intent and R.G.'s level of fear.

Three separate proceedings involving C.F.-M. were heard on the same day. C.F.-M. had first filed a request for an abuse prevention order against another individual, who lived with R.G., but who also had had a sexual relationship with C.F.-M. At that hearing, there was testimony regarding that sexual relationship; R.G. was present in the court room. R.G. then filed the instant request for a harassment prevention order against C.F.-M. A hearing was held later that afternoon, and the judge issued a six-month order. Once the judge issued his ruling, C.F.-M. asked for a reciprocal order against R.G., which was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   C.F.-M. maintains that she was denied procedural due process because she was denied the opportunity to appear with counsel and present evidence. For the first time on appeal, she also contends that she was denied procedural due process because she was not served with R.G.'s complaint and did not have an opportunity to read R.G.'s complaint and affidavit before the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In contested proceedings, each party must be given a meaningful opportunity to challenge the other party's evidence.

Both parties appeared at the hearing pro se. After R.G. testified, C.F.-M. was given an uninterrupted opportunity to testify. She did so, disputing the allegations. At the end of the proceeding, following the judge's announcement that he would grant the order, C.F.-M. asked, \"Does it-does it matter that I wasn't provided any notice or any opportunity to bring any evidence or put any thought or have counsel here?\" The judge responded, \"You can certainly explore your rights in terms of what-how you want to proceed.\" C.F.-M. did not file any subsequent motions, nor did she ask for a further hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In dealing with this complicated set of relationships, it was well within the judge's discretion to hold the hearing on the same day as the application was filed.

While this may have impeded the ability to call third-party witnesses that day, the judge afforded C.F.-M. the opportunity to return to do so. C.F.-M. was not prejudiced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C.F.-M. did not cross-examine R.G., and now claims error in the failure of the judge to tell her that she was permitted to do so. A judge has considerable discretion in conducting hearings of this type, including limitations on cross-examination. See\n   <em>\n    Frizado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826154\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/592/#p598\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826154\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/592/#p598\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ertainly a judge may limit cross-examination for good cause in an exercise of discretion\"). C.F.-M. heard R.G.'s testimony and rebutted it point by point. She had just concluded her own hearing in which she sought an abuse prevention order. During that hearing C.F.-M., herself an attorney, had been cross-examined, and was thus aware that cross-examination was permitted. Under these circumstances, there was no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, C.F.-M. contends on appeal that she was not provided a copy of the complaint and affidavit before or during the hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We note that there is no right to service of the affidavit in advance of a hearing with notice.

Guidelines \u00a7 5.01 commentary (2011).
