A single justice of this court suspended Ariel J. Strauss (respondent) from the practice of law for six months, and the board and bar counsel appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order of term suspension and, accepting the board's\n   recommendation, order an indefinite suspension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On August 25, 2014, bar counsel filed a two-count petition for discipline against the respondent. Count one alleged that between June 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, the respondent failed to properly maintain a check register for\n   his client trust account, and failed to perform a reconciliation of the account periodically. The respondent did not dispute the underlying facts as to count one, and a hearing committee of the board (committee) agreed that the conduct violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15 (f) (1) (B) and (E), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20Mass.%201338\">\n    440 Mass. 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The second count involved the respondent's conduct in connection with the settlement of a client's personal injury claim. The committee found that the respondent (1) failed to safeguard the client's funds in a trust account, in violation of Mass. R.

The board adopted the committee's findings and recommendation, and an information and record of proceedings was filed in the county court. After a hearing, the single justice issued an order imposing a six-month suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

The disciplinary proceedings therefore focused on the allegation that was in dispute\n   and carried the most substantial sanction: whether the respondent intentionally misused client funds, with temporary deprivation resulting.

According to the committee's findings, the respondent represented a client on a contingency fee basis in connection with a personal injury claim. With the client's authorization, the respondent settled the claim for $5,000, and the client signed a release in early December, 2012. At the time, the client asked the respondent for her share of the\n   settlement in cash because she would be traveling internationally, and believed cashing a check would be difficult at her destination. The respondent agreed. It was not until about December 20, 2012, after the client had left on her trip, that the respondent received two settlement checks from the defendant's insurer in the personal injury claim: one in the amount of $558.51, representing the amount of a claimed lien for medical expenses, payable to the lien claimant; and the other for the lien-free balance of $4,441.49. The respondent deposited the lien-free settlement check into his client trust account and, the next day, withdrew his fee of $ 1,666.67. Before the deposit, the respondent had a zero balance in that account, thus the entire balance was due to the client. The respondent failed to notify the client that he had withdrawn his fee. He also failed to provide her a statement of the amount of the withdrawal or the balance of her funds in the account, any explanatory statement, or the amount due to her.\n   Unrelated to the client, on December 28, 2012, the respondent deposited an additional $800 in cash into his client trust account, raising its balance to $3,574.82. On January 13, 2013, the respondent wrote a $3,400 check on the account for the benefit of his father. According to the respondent's bank records, the balance of the account fell to $175.82 at a time when the respondent was required to hold $2,774.82, for his client. After a check drawn on the account was dishonored for insufficient funds, bar counsel was notified. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.15 (h), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20Mass.%201338\">\n    440 Mass. 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After approximately two weeks abroad, the client returned to the United States in January, 2013. The committee found that, on her return, she \"wanted as much of her money as the respondent could give her lien-free as soon as he could give it; she did not insist on payment in cash and she did not authorize the respondent to hold the lien-free portion of the settlement until the lien was resolved.\" The committee did not credit the respondent's testimony that, after her return, the client wanted to delay receipt of the settlement funds until issues associated with the $558.51 were resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 6, 2013, the respondent paid the client the entire $2,774.82 due to her in cash, as well as the $558.51 medical expense lien, also in cash, and she signed a receipt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The respondent claimed that he neither misused his client's funds nor deprived her of their use. Despite the client trust account bank records to the contrary, he asserted that when he deposited the settlement check in his trust account\n   in December, 2012, he was holding cash in excess of that amount for the benefit\n   of another client, his father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that, after depositing the settlement check, he reserved an equivalent amount in cash in an envelope on his desk that he \"earmarked\" for his client based on her pre-trip request that she be paid in cash. He explained that he then held the funds in the trust account for his father's benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, he claimed that the client instructed him not to pay her any of the settlement proceeds, until the question whether the lien was proper had been resolved. Not only did the committee decline to credit the respondent's explanation, it also found that the respondent provided bar counsel with \"reconstructed records\" to conceal his misuse of the client's money for his father's benefit. There were also documents and other evidence that undermined the respondent's version.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The committee is \"the sole judge of the credibility of the testimony presented at the hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Saab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884473\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/315/#p328\">\n    406 Mass. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20N.E.2d%20919\">\n    547 N.E.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), quoting S.J.C.

This is not such a case. On the contrary, bank records established that the respondent deposited the settlement check into the trust account, and then promptly drew a check on those funds for the benefit of his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Even apart from the committee's credibility determinations, there is substantial evidence to support the hearing committee's findings that the respondent deposited settlement funds belonging to the client into his client trust account, and then intentionally misused them by writing a check on those funds for the benefit of his father. The delay in paying the client her settlement funds, at least after the client returned from her trip, supports the conclusion that she was temporarily deprived of her funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Conduct of the hearing\n   </em>\n   . Before the single justice, the respondent claimed that the committee improperly considered evidence of uncharged misconduct without according him a fair opportunity to defend against it. After reviewing the record, we reject the claim. Proceedings before the board and its hearing committee need not comply rigidly with the rules of evidence and procedure that are applicable in court. See\n   <em>\n    Matterof Dasent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783795\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/1010/#p1012\">\n    446 Mass. 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=845%20N.E.2d%201133\">\n    845 N.E.2d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Evidence introduced by bar counsel for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of the respondent and the respondent's witness, his father, and evidence of his father's business practices-including his alleged reliance on cash transactions-was relevant to the credibility of the respondent's claim that he substituted cash that he had held for his father for funds deposited in his client trust account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The committee properly could consider this evidence in making credibility determinations and in concluding that the respondent's explanation was\n   not credible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731608\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/453/#p460\">\n    447 Mass. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20N.E.2d%20660\">\n    852 N.E.2d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The respondent also claimed that bar counsel impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the respondent. Although bar counsel argued that the respondent and his father were not testifying truthfully, there is nothing to the respondent's claim that the assertions effectively shifted the burden to the respondent to disprove bar counsel's allegations of professional misconduct\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Matter of London\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310227\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/477/#p482\">\n    427 Mass. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20337\">\n    694 N.E.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Nor did the respondent object to bar counsel's opening statement, which directly addressed the respondent's defense. During closing argument, the respondent repeatedly pointed to bar counsel's burden of proof, and emphasized that mere disbelief of the respondent's testimony does not equate to evidence of misconduct. There was substantial and substantive evidence to support the board's conclusions as to each element of the charged misconduct. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Balliro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658351\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/75/#p84\">\n    453 Mass. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20N.E.2d%20794\">\n    899 N.E.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Sanction\n   </em>\n   .

This is not, however, such a case. The board's findings establish that the respondent intentionally-not negligently-misused client funds. They also establish that the client was deprived of the use of the funds for a relatively short period. But this is precisely the circumstance for which\n   <em>\n    Matter of Schoepfer\n   </em>\n   , 426 Mass. at 187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20N.E.2d%20391\">\n    687 N.E.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , adopted a presumptive sanction of disbarment or indefinite suspension. Although the evidence consisted of misuse of a single client's funds, and those funds were delivered to the client within weeks or months of the settlement, attorneys are obliged to safeguard client funds regardless of the amount. They may not treat client funds as fungible commodities, using funds belonging to one client for the benefit of another, or even for their own purposes.

The committee and the board weighed in aggravation that the respondent engaged in multiple violations of the rules of professional conduct, and that he used the disciplinary violations concerning record-keeping to \"conceal\" his misuse of client funds. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Saab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884473\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/315/#p328\">\n    406 Mass. at 326-327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20N.E.2d%20919\">\n    547 N.E.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There also was evidence on which the board could conclude that the respondent reconstructed records to hide his misuse of client funds to benefit his father. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rickles\n   </em>\n   , 30 Mass. Att'y Discipline Rep. 340, 345 (2014) (disbarment where billing records determined to have been altered to include additional time entries). Not only do we accept these factors in aggravation, but we consider as well that the respondent provided bar counsel with \"falsified evidence,\" and displayed a lack of candor by presenting false testimony and fabricated account documents. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hoicka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183061\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/1004/#p1006\">\n    442 Mass. 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=809%20N.E.2d%201013\">\n    809 N.E.2d 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

Considering all of the factors together, we conclude that the board's recommendation that the respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law is consistent with the disposition in similar cases. Accordingly, we reverse the order of term suspension and remand the matter to the county court for entry of an order of indefinite suspension. The judgment of reinstatement shall be vacated as of the effective date of the order of indefinite suspension. Recognizing that the respondent already has been suspended from the practice of law for almost seven months pursuant to the order of term suspension, the order of\n   indefinite suspension shall permit the respondent to petition for reinstatement no earlier than three months prior to four years and five months from the effective date of the order of indefinite suspension.

She did not insist on cash, which she previously requested because of her impending trip, and she did not authorize the respondent to retain all of the settlement funds until the medical lien was resolved. The client testified that she did not know why she had had to wait so long for the funds, and that she was impatient.
