We hold that the video evidence was admissible at trial because it was discovered pursuant to a lawful search warrant. We also conclude that the court properly denied suppression motions without an evidentiary hearing on the validity of the warrant. Finally, we hold that the court properly sentenced Pippin. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Police seized Pippin's cell phone and other evidence from his residence when they executed a search warrant issued on December 15, 2012. Police had obtained the warrant during their investigation into multiple rape and burglary offenses. After Pippin's phone was seized, it was secured in the property room of the Delhi Township Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 18, 2012, Delhi Township Police Detective Adam L. Cox sought a warrant from a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge to authorize the search of the data contained within Pippin's phone. Before driving from the Hamilton County courthouse back to Delhi, Cox delivered the phone to the forensics unit of the Cincinnati Police Division for extraction of the data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Cincinnati Police Officer Scott Radigan, a video and cell phone forensics analyst, began preparing Pippin's cell phone for data extraction. He removed the back of the phone to determine its model number, and then made adjustments to the phone settings to allow for the data transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After experiencing initial problems getting the data download to start with his standard equipment, Radigan further examined the phone and opened the photo gallery as part of his troubleshooting. He was eventually able to get the extraction process started by using a different digital forensics product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Before the extraction was completed, Radigan got a call from Cox, who told him to stop the extraction that was in progress. Radigan disconnected the phone from the forensics equipment and pulled the battery out of the phone. According to Cox, he had been about to fax a copy of the search warrant and affidavit to Pippin's attorney when he discovered that the judge had failed to sign the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Because it was late in the day, Cox believed that the issuing judge was unavailable, so he resubmitted the warrant to the judge the following morning. The judge signed and dated it that day (December 19), and marked it \"as of\" December 18, 2012. Cox called Radigan and told him to go ahead with the data extraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Data from the extraction indicated that the phone was next accessed on December 20, 2012, the day that the data extraction was completed. A digital disc containing the extracted data was delivered to Detective Cox. He reviewed the information on the disc and discovered several videos depicting sexual acts with an underage female. Using other data from the download, he was able to identify the 15-year-old victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Pippin was charged in a 21-count indictment with multiple sex offenses involving four different victims, as well as burglary, robbery, felonious assault, and receiving stolen property. The trial court severed ten of the charges, which related to the child victim depicted in the videos on Pippin's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his motions to suppress the videos on his cell phone, Pippin argued that the police had searched the contents of his phone on December 18 without a valid signed warrant. He asserted that the December 19 search warrant did not cure the warrantless search of the phone that had occurred on December 18. Following a hearing at which forensic experts testified, the trial court denied the motions. The court found that Radigan's aborted effort to download data from the phone on December 18 did not constitute a search because there was no evidence that the data partially extracted at the point of interruption was viewed or even viewable. Therefore, the court concluded, the search of the phone occurred no earlier than December 20, when the data was next accessed and the extraction was completed pursuant to the signed December 19 search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After the court denied his motions to suppress, Pippin entered pleas of no contest to the ten charges. The court sentenced Pippin for six offenses but did not dispose of four offenses, by merger or otherwise. We dismissed Pippin's direct appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the trial court's judgment was not a final order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Pippin\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150061,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-312\">\n    2016-Ohio-312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20524355\">\n    2016 WL 524355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Thereafter, the trial court issued a sentencing entry that disposed of the remaining four offenses. The court merged two offenses of sexual battery and two offenses of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor with two rape offenses. The court sentenced Pippin to consecutive eight-year prison terms for the rape offenses, and ordered the terms to run consecutively to concurrent eight-year prison terms for four counts of pandering sexually-oriented matter involving a minor, for a total of 24 years. Pippin now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Suppression of the Cell Phone Videos\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error, Pippin argues that the trial court erred by failing to suppress the contents of his cell phone. He contends that police conducted the search of his phone in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under Article I, Section 14, of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Pippin also asserts, for the first time, that the seizure of his cell phone from his residence pursuant to the December 15 search warrant was unlawful. However, in seeking to suppress the evidence against him, Pippin challenged the constitutionality of the search of the phone's contents, but not the seizure of the phone itself. He did not challenge the validity of the December 15 search warrant in the trial court, and cannot do so for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

After redaction of the challenged statements, the affidavit set forth that on September 1, 2012, a woman left a certain bar in White Oak, stopped for gas at a Speedway station, and then drove to her Delhi Township home. Once home, a man with a semiautomatic pistol attacked and raped her. Surveillance videos from the Speedway and other businesses showed an older style, white or light grey Jeep Cherokee that had pulled next to a pump at a BP station across the street. No one got out of the vehicle or pumped gas before the vehicle moved to another lot and remained there until the woman had finished at Speedway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 39} On September 8, 2012, while police were conducting surveillance near the same White Oak bar, a police officer stopped Pippin for a traffic violation. The officer believed that Pippin's Jeep Cherokee was similar to a photo of the Jeep Cherokee at the BP station on the night of the Delhi rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 40} On September 19, 2012, a GPS device was attached to Pippin's vehicle on the authority of search warrants, and police began tracking its movements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 41} On October 26, 2012, Pippin contacted police about being a confidential informant. He told them that he carried a simulator 9 mm gun. He \"Googled\" a picture of the simulator gun on his cell phone and officers noted that it looked like a real 9 mm semiautomatic firearm. Pippin initially told them that he drove a grey 1989 Jeep Cherokee, but admitted that he had painted it blue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 42} On November 21, 2012, a police officer took a burglary report on a home on Squirrel Creek Lane in Colerain Township. The property stolen in the burglary included a cell phone, credit cards, and a camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 43} On December 15, 2012, police conducted a search of Pippin's residence pursuant to a search warrant. The camera stolen during the Squirrel Creek Lane burglary was recovered in Pippin's bedroom. The police also recovered Pippin's cell phone and transported it to the property room of the Delhi Township Police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The affiant, Detective Cox, had experience and training in the investigation of burglary and rape offenses. Through his experience and training, Cox learned that suspects who engage in that type of criminal activity frequently used cell phones and other data storage devices to maintain records or to conduct communications related to their offenses. He expected that the search of the data in Pippin's phone would (1) establish that Pippin\n   had committed the burglary offense; (2) contain pictures or video that may have been taken during the offenses; and (3) reveal the identity of persons to whom Pippin may have sold property taken in the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Following our review of the redacted warrant affidavit, we conclude that it sufficiently supported the issuing magistrate's determination of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1419892\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/45/325/\">\n    45 Ohio St.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=544%20N.E.2d%20640\">\n    544 N.E.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    462 U.S. at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The remainder of the affidavit established a fair probability that evidence of the burglary or rape offenses would be found in the contents of Pippin's cell phone.
