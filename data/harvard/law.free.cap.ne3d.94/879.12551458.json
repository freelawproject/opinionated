L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M, as appearing in St. 2014, c. 260, \u00a7 23. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he and the victim (his former girlfriend) were in a \"substantive dating ... relationship\" as defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii), and that that part of the statute is unconstitutionally vague and violates the separation of powers. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </em>\n   . General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ), defines \"family or household member\" as \"persons who (i) are or were married to one another, (ii) have a child in common regardless of whether they have ever married or lived together or (iii) are or have been in a substantive dating or engagement relationship.\" In this case the Commonwealth tried the defendant on the theory that he and the victim were in a substantive dating relationship. We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether any \"rational trier of fact could have found ... [that] element[ ] of the crime[ ] beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462692\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/512/#p523\">\n    476 Mass. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 523 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The statute provides that, in determining whether a substantive dating relationship exists, the trier of fact shall consider \"the length of time of the relationship; the type of relationship; the frequency of interaction between the parties; whether the relationship was terminated by either person; and the length of time elapsed since the termination of the relationship.\" G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii). These factors are not elements of the crime, however, and \"[t]here does not need to be evidence as to each factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dustin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20Mass.%201003\">\n    476 Mass. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006 n.7 (2016). Rather, the pertinent inquiry is whether the evidence, \"taken as a whole, warrants a finding of a substantive dating relationship beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20Mass.%201003\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20Mass.%201003\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The evidence here was sufficient to warrant such a finding. The victim testified that the defendant was her \"ex-boyfriend\" and that they dated for \"almost two years.\" A reasonable juror could infer, consistent with the common meaning of \"boyfriend,\" that the defendant and victim had frequent interactions during their two-year relationship. See Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 148 (11th ed. 2005) (defining \"boyfriend\" as \"a frequent or regular male companion in a romantic or sexual relationship\"). Furthermore, the victim's friend, who had spent time with both her and the defendant, testified that he considered them to be \"boyfriend and girlfriend.\" Finally, at the time of the assault, only a couple of weeks had elapsed since the defendant and the victim had permanently terminated their relationship. Viewing this evidence in its totality, and in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a rational jury could have found the existence of a substantive dating relationship within the meaning of \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Dustin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20Mass.%201003\">\n    476 Mass. at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (evidence sufficient to prove substantive dating relationship where defendant and victim \"testified that they had been involved in the relationship for several months, and that it had developed into an exclusive 'boyfriend-girlfriend' relationship\").

L. c. 209A, where defendant referred to victim as his \"former girlfriend\" and admitted to having had sexual relationship with her for fourteen months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Constitutional challenges\n   </em>\n   . The defendant next argues that \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ) (iii) is unconstitutionally vague because it does not adequately define what constitutes a substantive dating relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For substantially the same reason, he says, \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii) violates the separation of powers. Because the defendant did not raise these issues below, we review only for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

L. c. 209A, and declined to \"add to [the statutory] language by [judicial] interpretation\" because the statutory \"factors to be considered in determining the existence of a 'substantive dating relationship' \" were sufficient \"to enable [fact finders] to make informed and consistent determinations.\" The \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii)\"factors are essentially identical to the factors set forth in G.

See\n   <em>\n    Gurry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Pub. Accountancy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385173\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/118/#p127\">\n    394 Mass. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (1985). But even so, \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii) passes constitutional muster. The Legislature's inclusion of the five factors provides standards for an ordinary person to understand what type of conduct is prohibited.

In this situation the void-for-vagueness doctrine allows the Legislature to employ \"a normative standard [that] informs a potential defendant that his common sense in most cases will define proscribed conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Orlando\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320446\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/371/732/#p734\">\n    371 Mass. at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We observe in closing that the inclusion of the five factors in \u00a7 13M(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iii) makes it at least as clear and definite as other criminal statutes that have withstood constitutional challenges on vagueness grounds.
