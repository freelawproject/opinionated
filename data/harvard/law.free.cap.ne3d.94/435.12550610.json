The crux of the plaintiffs' argument remains that the chaperones' failure to adequately supervise the children led to the complained-of injuries. Nevertheless, the affirmative act that originally caused Mr. Vandenberg's injuries was the child's negligent operation of the bicycle, which cannot be construed as an affirmative act of the defendants. \"Even if a public employer does not create a dangerous condition or situation by an affirmative act, its failure to prevent or mitigate harm from that dangerous condition or situation may cause an injury. A claim based on such an injury is barred.\"\n   <em>\n    Audette\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582838\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/727/#p733\">\n    63 Mass. App. Ct. 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (2005). The essence of the plaintiffs' claim is that the defendants negligently failed to prevent harm, a claim for which the defendants are immune from suit under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    j\n   </em>\n   ), as a matter of law. See\n   <em>\n    Jacome\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626949\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/486/#p489\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626949\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/486/#p489\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Remaining arguments\n   </em>\n   .
