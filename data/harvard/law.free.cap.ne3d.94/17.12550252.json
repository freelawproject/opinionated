GRENDELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Kevin Knoefel, appeals the Judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, granting the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment based on collateral estoppel with respect to Counts Nine through Fifteen of his malpractice Complaint. The issue before this court is whether collateral estoppel bars a plaintiff from raising malpractice claims arising out of representation in a criminal case where there has been a direct appeal from the convictions raising the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 14, 2015, Knoefel filed a Complaint alleging twenty-one counts of legal malpractice in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas against defendants-appellants, Michael J. Connick, Gary A. Vick, Jr., Dennis N. LoConti, and Connick &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In relevant part, the Complaint made the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   122. Defendants represented Kevin Knoefel in a number of legal proceedings in Lake County, Ohio, including criminal case no. 13CR000558 in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, establishing an attorney-client relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   123. As such, Defendants owed Kevin Knoefel a duty to competently represent him in the criminal matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   124. Defendants breached this duty by failing to use an investigator to assist * * * defendant Kevin Knoefel in the criminal proceeding. [Count Nine]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   129. Defendants breached this duty by failing to adequately investigate by failing to obtain the assistance of a cell phone expert. [Count Ten]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   134. Defendants breached this duty by failing to call proper witnesses in Kevin Knoefel's defense, including an exculpatory witness. [Count Eleven]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   139. Defendant Connick breached this duty by failing * * * to maintain a professional demeanor at trial in the criminal matter thereby angering the trial judge and diminishing the jury's confidence in his integrity. [Count Twelve]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   144. Defendant Connick breached this duty by objecting to his own question at trial thereby putting the competence of the defense into question. [Count Thirteen]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   149. Defendants breached this duty by pursuing the use of Dr. Neuhaus as an expert witness at the rate of $10,000 despite the fact that it was clear that Dr. Neuhaus would not be able to testify as an expert at trial. [Count Fourteen]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   154. Defendants breached this duty by failing to offer any mitigation on Kevin Knoefel's behalf at sentencing, including, but not limited to, failing to use a mitigation expert, despite the fact that Kevin Knoefel was facing a sentence of life in prison. [Count Fifteen]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   155. As a result of Defendants' negligent representation, Kevin Knoefel has suffered damages, including monetary loss, loss of freedom, and emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On November 30, 2015, the defendants filed an Answer and Counterclaim for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On December 4, 2015, Knoefel filed an Answer to the Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 4, 2016, the defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. The defendants argued, inter alia, that Knoefel was collaterally estopped from asserting legal malpractice claims arising out of the underlying criminal proceedings since the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel was raised and rejected in an appeal from those proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 2, 2016, Knoefel filed a Brief in Opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 18, 2016, the defendants filed a Reply Brief. On May 23, 2016, the defendants filed a Motion to Supplement Reply Brief\n   <em>\n    Instanter\n   </em>\n   which the trial court granted on July 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On November 30, 2016, the trial court granted the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Counts Nine through Fifteen of the Complaint. The court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he Court finds that the above-mentioned issues presented in the malpractice action are the exact same issues which have been \"actually and necessarily litigated and determined\" via the appeal(s) of the criminal case. That is, Plaintiff already had an opportunity to litigate the issue of Defendants' preparedness for trial and behavior at trial, including the decision to call witnesses and expert witnesses. Therefore, Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from bringing those same issues in this legal malpractice action. In making this determination, the Court notes that the judgment against Mr. Knoefel cannot be ignored when considering his claims that he is innocent and would not be incarcerated but for the actions/inactions of his counsel. A jury of his peers convicted him after a lengthy trial, the Eleventh District Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and the Supreme Court of Ohio refused jurisdiction. The matters brought by Mr. Knoefel now in this legal malpractice action relative to his counsels' [sic] preparedness at trial, decision to call witnesses and/or put on evidence have been fully litigated. Furthermore, all of the claims brought by Mr. Knoefel in this legal malpractice action relative to Defendants' representation of him in the criminal trial were or could have been litigated in the appeal. Plaintiff does not get an additional chance to re-litigate his criminal conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On December 12, 2016, Knoefel filed a Notice of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On December 15, 2016, the trial court stayed the proceedings with respect to the remaining claims raised in the Complaint and Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On appeal, Knoefel raises the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"[1.] Whether the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Collateral estoppel or issue preclusion \"precludes the relitigation, in a second action, of an issue that has been actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action that was based on a different cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Fort Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v.

Counsel wanted the State to identify the medical providers in the recording and, apparently, this information already existed in medical records previously turned over in discovery. As trial counsel had admittedly only recently received the recording, we find no deficiency in his failure to search prior discovery for additional records that would have explained the recording.

The other issues raised in the criminal appeal-a lack of familiarity with discovery and the decision not to call Zunich's treating psychologist as a witness-are not raised in the Complaint. Conversely, the Complaint raises the following instances of professional negligence which were not raised in the criminal appeal: the failure to use an independent investigator (Count Nine), the failure to retain a cell phone expert (Count Ten), the failure to call certain exculpatory witnesses (Count Eleven), the failure to maintain a professional demeanor (Count Twelve), the retention of an expert witness whose testimony would not be admissible at trial (Count Fourteen), and the failure to present mitigation testimony at sentencing (Count Fifteen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Accordingly, collateral estoppel was properly applied to Count Thirteen of the Complaint, but not to Counts Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Fourteen, and Fifteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We emphasize that this ruling is limited to the narrow issue of whether collateral estoppel bars Knoefel from further litigating the issues raised in those Counts of the Complaint. Knoefel must still prove the elements of \"a cause of action for legal malpractice arising from criminal representation * * *[:] (1) an attorney-client relationship giving rise to a duty, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) damages proximately caused by the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Krahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418263\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/43/103/\">\n    43 Ohio St.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at syllabus,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20N.E.2d%201058\">\n    538 N.E.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the Supreme court acknowledged that \"in most cases the failure to secure a reversal of the underlying criminal conviction may bear upon and even destroy the plaintiff's ability to establish the element of proximate cause,\" it rejected the notion that a jury's determination of the defendant's guilt was dispositive of his counsel's alleged malpractice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20N.E.2d%201058\">\n    538 N.E.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The sole assignment of error has merit to the extent indicated above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 28} For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, granting the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment based on collateral estoppel, is affirmed in part and reversed in part and this cause is remanded\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The issue of whether appellant can support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in post conviction proceedings has not yet been addressed or resolved. Thus, in addition to the fact that appellant is not collaterally estopped from litigating his civil malpractice claim, the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel may not be completely barred by res judicata within the context of his criminal conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   WRIGHT, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
