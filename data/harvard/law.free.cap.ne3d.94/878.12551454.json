L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Concluding that the department should be given the opportunity to present evidence to meet the legal framework set forth by the Supreme Judicial Court after the order here issued, and cognizant that affirming the preliminary injunction would moot the case, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . In November, 2013, a Boston Globe reporter submitted a request to the department under the public records law, G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. Among other records, the reporter requested a \"current list of state police, including their name and date of birth.\" The reporter sought this information so that he would be able to obtain registry of motor vehicles records for an investigative report on motor vehicle accidents and driving infractions involving State police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The department responded by providing the reporter with a list of its employees, but refused to produce any dates of birth. After some back and forth, the supervisor of public records ultimately ruled that the dates of birth were not protected as personal information pursuant to G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ) (exemption [\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ] ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but were properly withheld under the public safety exemption, G.

After a hearing held in January, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Superior Court judge granted the motion and ordered the requested disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge was not provided with evidence beyond the reporter's sworn declaration verifying the factual allegations in the Boston Globe's complaint. The parties agreed to delay compliance with the injunction while this appeal is pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

While this appeal was pending, however, the Supreme Judicial Court provided substantial guidance in\n   <em>\n    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Department of Agric.

A judge applying exemption (\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   ) must first \"probe[ ] whether, and to what degree, the record sought resembles the records listed as examples in the statute\" to determine \"whether, and to what degree, the record is one a terrorist would find useful to maximize damage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    . at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Then, the judge must determine \"whether the custodian has provided sufficient factual heft ... to conclude that a reasonable person would agree with the custodian's determination given the context of the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    . at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he more the record sought resembles the records enumerated in exemption (\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   ), the lower the custodian's burden in demonstrating 'reasonable judgment'-and vice versa.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addition to providing this guidance, the Supreme Judicial Court negated or cast doubt on an assumption each party held in the instant case. The department, relying on the Superior Court judge's decision later reviewed in\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   , had assumed that it was entitled to heightened deference under exemption (\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   ). The Supreme Judicial Court, by contrast, determined that the statutory language \"neither requires or even invites any heightened level of deference to the records custodian's initial determination whether to disclose or withhold a record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    . at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Boston Globe and the judge assumed that an inquiry into the identity and purpose of the requester was a relevant consideration. The Supreme Judicial Court cast considerable doubt on the validity of this theory, stating \"that nothing we have discovered in our review of the legislative history indicated an intent to depart radically from the typical public records procedure, which would not permit such an inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 290 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"We recognize that the Superior Court judge did not have the benefit of [the Supreme Judicial Court's] construction of exemption (\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   ).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    . at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As it is neither logically impossible nor intuitively obvious that the disclosure of dates of birth would jeopardize public safety, the Superior Court judge would benefit from factual showings beyond those presented at the preliminary injunction hearing. It is, therefore, appropriate to remand to allow each party to present its case under the newly-clarified law and to allow the judge to consider the case with the benefit of the Supreme Judicial Court's teachings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451906\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/280/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, affirmance of the preliminary injunction would frustrate this result, as the disclosure of the dates of birth-preliminarily or not-would moot this case.
