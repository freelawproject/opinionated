Appellee appeared before the trial court without counsel for initial appearance on September 15, 2016 and entered a plea of not guilty. Also on that date, appellee signed a \"Waiver of Time for Trial,\" stating in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The time within which a criminal trial must be held pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 2945.71 -73 is as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Trials for Minor Misdemeanors: 30 days * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The undersigned defendant, being fully advised of the time limitations as set forth above, does hereby voluntarily waive his right to trial within the time limitations as set forth in Ohio Revised Code Section 2945.71 -73 and requests the court set his trial in the ordinary course of the Court's business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellee was given a notice of court trial scheduled for October 20, 2016, \"or as soon thereafter as can be heard by the Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 7, 2016, defense trial counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a notice of appearance, time waiver, and \"motion for continuance for a pretrial.\" In pertinent part, the filing states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Further, Defendant hereby waives all constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial but hereby retains all other constitutional rights afforded him/her under the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Lastly, Counsel respectfully requests a continuance of this matter which was originally set for pretrial\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on October 20, 2016.

After the second continuance, no further continuances will be granted to either party except for extraordinary, emergency, or unforeseen circumstances\n   and where substitute counsel is unavailable.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On October 17, 2016, appellee filed a demand for discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 19, 2016, appellant filed a motion to continue the court trial date of November 28, 2016 because the aviation trooper was deployed and not scheduled to return until mid-December.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On November 1, 2016, the trial court granted appellant's motion and continued the court trial until December 5, 2016 at 1:00 p.m. The judgment entry contained the notice advising of the local rule regarding continuances. Accompanying the judgment entry is a notice of the date and time of the court trial with a notation \"Time Waived.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On November 4, 2016, appellant filed a reply to appellee's request for discovery and a reciprocal request for discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On November 9, 2016, appellant filed a motion to continue the December 5 court trial date because the aviation trooper's return date from deployment was December 22, 2016. Appellant also filed a supplement to its discovery response on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On November 16, 2016, the trial court granted appellant's motion to continue and set a new court trial date of January 9, 2017 at 1:00 p.m. The judgment entry notes no further continuances would be granted to appellant. The judgment entry of continuance is accompanied by a notice of court trial on January 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On December 8, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court appointed a visiting judge to preside over the court for the period from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The record of the hearing on January 9, 2017 indicates the trial court called the case and appellee's counsel made an oral motion to dismiss \"because the State has failed to set this for a trial within the 30 days required for the statutory time limit.\" The following arguments were made at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Appellee]-and we will stipulate to the fact that he did, indeed, sign a waiver at the time of trial back on September 15, 2016, and later hired me as his counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   We had a trial set for November 28. I realize the State's witness had something to do as far as his military, I believe, or that it had to be continued, so it was continued until December 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . We did not waive time after November 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . I told the assignment commissioner that on December 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: Did you file something withdrawing the waiver?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We did-we didn't file anything. I told, though, the assignment commissioner the waiver was just good until the date of the trial that we scheduled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * * [T]he time waiver as far as we are concerned is good until the date of the trial that we had scheduled-and which was November 28th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   On December 5th, I insisted with the assignment commissioner we are not waiving time. We are not waiving further time from this trial date and she indicated that [ ] document basically waived time indefinitely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I said, I disagree with that. She said, well, I would have to bring that before the Court. * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Is there something on here indicating that it was waived to a specific date?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I mean, it is normal protocol that once you waive time that you waive time until the date scheduled for a next hearing. Then if you are going to waive time, again, following that hearing, you will waive time. We had scheduled it for November 28th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, that waiver is a blanket waiver. There is nothing on there that says that it only waives it until the next hearing. I understand that in certain courts they do that as practice, but they have that in the entry. This is a blanket waiver and we are entitled to rely on that waiver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The waiver itself is waiving time until the next Court date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: It doesn't say that. It says, \"being fully advised by the time limitations set forth above,\" which just states the law about the number of days and it says, \"does hereby voluntarily waive his right to trial within the time limits as set forth in Revised Code 45- 2945.71 through 73 and requests the Court to set his trial in the ordinary course of the Court's business.\" Ordinary course of the Court's business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   T. 3-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On January 19, 2017, appellant filed a \"Response to Defendant's Oral Motion\" referencing the oral motion to dismiss by appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellee filed a \"Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Speedy Trial\" on January 23, 2017. In its statement of facts, the motion contains the following assertions which are at odds with, and not contained in, the trial court record before us:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Counsel scheduled November 28, 2016 as the trial date. The State filed a Motion to Continue due to officer unavailability. There was no journal entry approving the Motion but the assignment commissioner called Counsel and the trial was continued until December 5, 2016. Counsel informed the clerk she was not waiving time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The State then filed another continuance due to officer unavailability and the Assignment Commissioner called Counsel again to reschedule. Again, there was no entry on the record granting the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Counsel requested a date prior to December 28 so that the speedy trial requirements would be met. The clerk insisted the Defendant waived his right to speedy trial indefinitely when he signed the initial waiver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Counsel acknowledged waivers were signed but not indefinitely. Once the Trial was scheduled on November 28 and no other time waivers were filed, the time began tolling against the State. The Clerk indicated the issue would have to be addressed at Court but that's how they handled it in this jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A new Trial date was set for January 9, 2017. Defendant made an oral motion to dismiss the above captioned case due to a violation of Ohio's statutory speedy trial requirements of 30 days. The Court agreed that a continuance for the officer's absence was not a waiver due to the Court's general cause of business and asked both parties to have briefs filed within ten business days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The trial court scheduled a motion hearing for February 27, 2017. The record of any such hearing held is not before us and in advance of that date, the trial court filed a judgment entry dismissing\n   the case \"pursuant to R.C. 2945.71(A)\" on February 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant state of Ohio now appeals from the trial court's judgment entry of February 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant raises three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"I.

Appellant argues the trial court erred in dismissing the case for violation of appellee's right to a speedy trial because appellee effectively executed blanket time waivers. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Speedy trial provisions are mandatory and are encompassed within the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

It is evident from the record appellee and counsel did not effectively object until the oral motion to dismiss on January 9, 2016. We disagree with appellee's characterization of the time waivers in this case as \"ambiguous.\" Appellee failed to object to either of appellant's requests for continuance, failed to make any written attempt to revoke either time waiver, and made arguments before the trial court which are plainly contradicted by the record. Appellee claimed the continuances sought by appellant were not approved or granted by journal entry, but in fact the motions to continue were granted, and notifications of the rescheduled trials were entered, by separate journal entries in each instance. Furthermore, those trial notifications plainly state \"time waived\" and appellee failed to raise any objection thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellee's attempts to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, the defendant signed a knowing, voluntary, and express written time waiver of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, failed to file any formal written objection, and orally moved to dismiss the matter. We reversed the trial court's decision to dismiss on speedy-trial grounds because the defendant's time waiver was still in effect: the defendant did not follow the mandates of\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   by filing a formal written objection and demand for trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20873700\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant's three assignments of error are sustained and the judgment of the Morrow County Municipal Court is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <em>\n    Faust\n   </em>\n   , supra, 5th Dist.
