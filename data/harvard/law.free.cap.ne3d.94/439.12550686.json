Orlando submitted an affidavit detailing the neglect and abandonment he suffered from his mother in El Salvador, including failing to protect him from fatal gang threats, failing to seek police assistance to ensure his safety, refusing to relocate to a less dangerous neighborhood, and providing him with no support in removing himself from the dangers of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On June 24, 2015, a Probate and Family Court judge held a nonevidentiary hearing on Orlando's complaint. On September 29, 2015, the judge entered a written order dismissing the complaint after reasoning that Orlando's mother's limited resources were the cause of her failure to remedy his situation and expressed concerns about Orlando's willingness to abandon his mother and his younger siblings in El Salvador in the face of such dire circumstances. The judge did not find, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J), that \"reunification with one or both of [Orlando's] parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or similar basis found under State law.\" A timely notice of appeal was filed.
