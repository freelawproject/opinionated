Defendant maintains that the Board's interpretation of its authority under SORA conflicts with the Criminal Procedure\n   Law's youthful offender provisions. We disagree. The statutes do not prohibit the Board's consideration of YO adjudications for the limited public safety purpose of accurately assessing an offender's risk level. Nor does the Board's interpretation undermine the legislative policy of avoiding stigmatizing a young person with a criminal record. As the Board's consideration of a YO adjudication does not conflict with the CPL, its risk level recommendation could be relied upon by the SORA court. We therefore affirm the Appellate Division's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Relevant Statutory Frameworks\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal implicates the question of whether the Board acted ultra vires in issuing guidelines for determining sex offender risk of re-offense that automatically treat a YO adjudication as part of the offender's criminal history factors, notwithstanding that a YO adjudication is not a conviction. \"As our well-established rules of statutory construction direct, we begin our analysis with the language of the statute\" (\n   <em>\n    Beck Chevrolet Co. v.

Pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) article 720, when an \"eligible youth\" is convicted of a crime, the court determines whether the youth should be designated a \"youthful offender.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where such designation is not mandated by CPL 720.20 (1) (b), the court may, in its discretion, decide whether \"the interest of justice would be served by\n   relieving the eligible youth from the onus of a criminal record\" ( CPL 720.20 [1 ] [a] ). Once a young person is designated a youthful offender, the court \"must direct that the conviction be deemed vacated and replaced by a youthful offender finding\" and then \"sentence the defendant pursuant to section 60.02 of the penal law\" ( CPL 720.20 [3 ] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As stated in the CPL, a YO adjudication is \"not a judgment of conviction for a crime or any other offense\" ( CPL 720.35 [1 ] ). The statute thus codifies the \"legislative desire not to stigmatize [these]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   youths ... with criminal records triggered by hasty or thoughtless acts\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

As we have recognized, a YO adjudication is nothing short of \"the opportunity for a fresh start, without a criminal record\"; an opportunity that a \"judge would conclude ... is likely to turn the young offender into a law-abiding, productive member of society\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

More specifically, the statutory structure is intended to address \"the danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders\" and the investigatory and prosecutorial challenges faced by law enforcement agencies (L 1995, ch 192, \u00a7 1 [\"Legislative purpose or findings\"]; Correction Law \u00a7 168 et seq. ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To that end, a sex offender's risk of reoffense\n   is assessed, and that information is provided to law enforcement and the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The legislature charged the Board with recommending to the SORA court one of three statutorily-prescribed levels of notification-level one, two, and three in ascending order of risk-based on an offender's calculated risk to reoffend ( Correction Law \u00a7 168-l [6 ] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   SORA mandates that the Board, comprised of five DOCCS employees who are \"experts in the field of the behavior and treatment of sex offenders\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 168-l [1 ] ), \"shall develop guidelines and procedures to assess [a sex offender's] risk of a repeat offense\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 168-l [5 ] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While SORA contemplates the Board would exercise discretion in developing this assessment tool, SORA requires that the Guidelines be based, in part, on a non-exhaustive list of conditions related to the potential risk of reoffense, including \"criminal history factors\" such as \"the number, date and nature of\n   prior offenses\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 168-l [1 ]-[5], [5] [b] [iii] ). In 2006, the Board issued the current Sex Offender\n   Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary (the Guidelines), which, in tandem with the Board's risk assessment instrument (RAI), reflects the Board's choice \"to create an objective assessment instrument that would provide a risk level combining risk of reoffense and danger posed by a sex offender\" (Guidelines at 3). The Board adopted a point scale, \"assigning numerical values to each risk factor ... [and t]he presumptive risk level is then calculated by adding the points that the offender scores in each category\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). For each person subject to SORA registration, the Board provides the SORA court-which has the ultimate responsibility of designating the offender's risk level-with an RAI and a case summary along with the Board's recommended risk level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the SORA hearing to determine the offender's risk level classification, the offender and the People may each present evidence to the SORA court in support of their positions as to the point assessment and risk level determination, and both parties, as well as the Board, may request a departure from the presumptive risk level indicated by the offender's total score (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 168-n). The SORA court may consider a broad range of evidence to determine an offender's proper risk level designation. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Mingo\n   </em>\n   , admissible evidence includes case summaries and the Board's RAI, because such documents \"certainly meet the 'reliable hearsay' standard for admissibility at SORA proceedings\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    12 N.Y.3d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    883 N.Y.S.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    910 N.E.2d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The SORA court must apply the Guidelines, and either accepts the Board's recommendation or departs from it and assigns a different risk level classification ( Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [2 ];\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Pursuant to the Guidelines, the\n   Board's RAI gave defendant a score of 115 points, including 25 points for defendant's \"criminal history\" factors, based solely on his YO adjudication for third-degree criminal possession of stolen property, committed when he was 17 years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board's case summary stated that defendant's criminal history \"commenced in February 2001 when he was adjudicated a [YO] after pleading guilty to Criminal Possession of Stolen Property in the Third Degree.\" Based on the total risk factor score, the Board assessed defendant \"a Level III (High) risk to reoffend\" and did not recommend a departure from this risk assessment. Without the additional 25 points derived from his YO adjudication, however, defendant's score would have placed him in the \"Level II\" category.\n   Defense counsel challenged the 25 points, arguing that because a YO adjudication is not a conviction, it may not be considered as part of defendant's criminal history for the purposes of SORA.

Specifically, the Guidelines provide that \"[a]lthough an adjudication as a youthful offender is not a conviction,\" it is a \"reliable indicator[ ] of wrongdoing and, therefore, should be considered in assessing an offender's likelihood of reoffense and danger to public safety\" (Guidelines at 6-7 and n 6). The Guidelines further state that \"the [statutory] term 'crime' ... includes criminal convictions [and] youthful offender adjudications\" (Guidelines at 6). YO adjudications are therefore included as part of the \"offender's prior crimes\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   SORA expressly requires that the Board assess an offender's risk of reoffense, which in turn forms the basis for the Board's recommendation to the SORA court of the offender's proper\n   risk level designation ( Correction Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-h, 168-o ). To facilitate the Board's proper assessment, the Board has access to an offender's full criminal background: SORA requires that \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\" state and local entities, including the district attorney and correctional facility, \"shall forward relevant information pertaining to a sex offender to be discharged, paroled, released to post-release supervision or released to the board for review.... Information may include, but may not be limited to all or a portion of the arrest file, prosecutor's file,... court file, commitment file ... pertaining to such person\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 168-m). SORA thereby grants the Board access to the documents, which are available under the CPL if \"specifically required or permitted by statute\" ( CPL 720.35[2] ). Moreover, members of the Board, as DOCCS employees, have access to YO-related records \"for the purpose of carrying out duties specifically authorized by law\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPL 720.35[2] ). Thus, SORA's directives both provide the statutory \"require[ment] or permi [ssion]\" to release the YO records under one provision of the YO statute, and describe \"the duties specifically authorized by law\" to allow for their release under another. In fulfillment of those duties, the Board presents its recommendation to the SORA court, which also has access to the records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Correction Law \u00a7 168-m [\"in any subsequent proceedings in which the sex offender who is the subject of the sealed record is a party and which requires the board to provide a recommendation to the court pursuant to this article, such sealed record shall be available to the ... court\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Board's inclusion of defendant's YO adjudications in assessing the risk of reoffense was based on the Board's expertise and experience, which is entitled to judicial deference. The Board \"is charged with producing accurate case summaries as an integral part of its functions and it has expertise culling through records to produce a concise statement of the factual information relevant to [the] defendant's risk of reoffense\" (\n   <em>\n    Mingo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    12 N.Y.3d at 572-573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    883 N.Y.S.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    910 N.E.2d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Indeed, \"an accurate determination of the risk a sex offender poses to the public is the paramount concern\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    883 N.Y.S.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735902\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/563/\">\n    910 N.E.2d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Board has not unreasonably construed SORA as permitting it access to YO records for the limited purpose of assessing an offender's risk of reoffense and recommending a risk level designation to the SORA court; nor has the Board violated the CPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant challenges the Board's automatic assessment of points based on his YO adjudication on several grounds. First,\n   defendant posits that the Board may not count a YO adjudication as part of an offender's criminal history because the CPL decrees that a YO adjudication \"is not a judgment of conviction for a crime or\n   any other offense\" ( CPL 720.35 [1 ] ). Defendant is correct that the CPL 720.35 [1 ] prohibits treating a YO adjudication as a conviction. Nevertheless, he goes one step further and interprets the statute as saying a youthful offender has not committed an offense. We are unpersuaded by this reading of the statutory language, as defendant fails to account for the fact that a YO adjudication is premised on a youth's commission of a crime. A YO adjudication replaces the\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   , not the offense itself, as is clear from the reference in Penal Law \u00a7 60.02 (3) to \"offense of conviction for which the youthful offender finding was substituted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As we have explained, the YO framework \"shifts the determination of youthful offender status from the prepleading stage to the postconviction stage\" (\n   <em>\n    Drayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2324036\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/39/580/#p584\">\n    39 N.Y.2d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20N.Y.S.2d%201\">\n    385 N.Y.S.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=350%20N.E.2d%20377\">\n    350 N.E.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In other words, an eligible youth determination follows a conviction, which is replaced with the court's YO finding. This in turn subjects the young person to a unique, legislatively-created status under the Penal Law. A YO adjudication changes the eligible youth's status so that the young person avoids \"be[ing] sentenced like any other criminal\" (\n   <em>\n    Rudolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750986\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/497/#p501\">\n    21 N.Y.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750986\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/497/#p501\">\n    974 N.Y.S.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750986\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/497/#p501\">\n    997 N.E.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and the \"practical consequences which accompany a criminal conviction\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2319017\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/37/591/#p595\">\n    37 N.Y.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20N.Y.S.2d%20110\">\n    376 N.Y.S.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=338%20N.E.2d%20619\">\n    338 N.E.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1975] ). This relieves the youthful offender of the stigma of a public criminal record that would otherwise follow the young person into adulthood and limit future opportunities. In the CPL, the legislature provided the opportunity for a fresh start (\n   <em>\n    Rudolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750986\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/497/#p501\">\n    21 N.Y.3d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750986\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/497/#p501\">\n    974 N.Y.S.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750986\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/497/#p501\">\n    997 N.E.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Board acknowledges that YO adjudications are not criminal convictions, referring to them only as \"reliable indicators of wrongdoing\" that \"should be considered in assessing an offender's likelihood of reoffense and danger to public safety\" (Guidelines at 6-7). In providing a non-exhaustive list of factors and conditions-and not solely \"offenses\"-that shall serve as a basis for the Board's risk level assessment, the legislature demonstrated intent to allow the Board to consider the full spectrum of an offender's prior unlawful conduct (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Theroux v. Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249157\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/1/232/#p240\">\n    1 N.Y.3d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249157\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/1/232/#p240\">\n    771 N.Y.S.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249157\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/1/232/#p240\">\n    803 N.E.2d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2003] [if the legislature had intended to restrict applicability of statute, \"it easily could have and surely would have written the statute to say so\"; a court \"may not create a limitation that the Legislature did not enact\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant also asserts that because the CPL requires YO-related records be treated as confidential, the Board may not rely on the information contained in such records. This argument is undermined by defendant's concession that the Board may consider a YO adjudication as a reliable indicator of a risk of reoffense in some, albeit rare, cases. Defendant takes the position that the CPL prohibits the use of YO adjudications for the automatic assessment of points, but permits their use in individual cases as a basis to recommend an upward departure. There is nothing in the statute, however, that makes this distinction. Either the CPL permits consideration of YO adjudications or prohibits it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In any event, as we have discussed, CPL 720.35 (2) provides the Board with access to YO-related documents. Defendant's argument that access alone does not authorize use ignores that the CPL does not permit access for its own sake, but in furtherance of a statutory purpose. Here, that purpose is found in SORA, which requires the Board to establish guidelines and make risk level determinations based,\n   in part, on an offender's past actions ( Correction Law \u00a7 168-l [5 ] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant's other argument, that automatic assessment of points violates the purpose of CPL article 720-to spare youths the lifetime stigma of a criminal conviction-draws heavily from the legislative policy that animates the youthful offender statutory framework. Certainly, \"[t]he primary advantage of such treatment is the avoidance of the stigma and practical consequences which accompany a criminal conviction\" (\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2319017\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/37/591/#p595\">\n    37 N.Y.2d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20N.Y.S.2d%20110\">\n    376 N.Y.S.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=338%20N.E.2d%20619\">\n    338 N.E.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and any action by the Board or SORA court constraining this opportunity would run afoul of the legislature's intent. Yet, the legislature intended to prevent those who commit youthful transgressions from carrying the stigma accompanying a conviction, not against the consequences that flow from any subsequent acts committed as adults. Here, defendant's sex crime conviction, rather than the unlawful acts that led to his YO adjudication or the YO status itself, triggered SORA's registration requirements. Moreover, YO records are not made public in the SORA registry. SORA requires that the Board's recommendation to the SORA court remain \"confidential and shall not be available for public inspection\" ( Correction Law \u00a7 168-l [6 ] ), and that, upon application of the sex offender of the district attorney, the SORA court \"seal any portion of the [B]oard's file pertaining to the sex offender that contains material that is confidential under any state or federal\n   law\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 168-m ). Therefore, the Board's consideration of a YO adjudication does not violate the primary intent of article 720: to protect young people from the long-term, societal consequences of their early, misdirected actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant also controverts the Board's conclusion that a YO adjudication is a reliable indicator of recidivism. He points to copious scientific data supporting the argument that young people who commit crimes are unlikely to reoffend. His policy arguments are based on sociological research as well as judicial recognition of the psychological difference between children and adults. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, a young person's \" 'lack of maturity' and 'underdeveloped sense of responsibility' lead[s] to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking ... And ...[because] a child's character is not as 'well formed' as an adult's[,] [the child's] traits are 'less fixed' \" (\n   <em>\n    Miller v.
