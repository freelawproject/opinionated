On September 12, 2011, the defendant, Brenda Roush, was arraigned on four drug-related charges: possession of a class A substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34 ; possession of a class A substance with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) ; conspiracy to violate the drug laws, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40 ; and committing a drug violation near a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. On August 24, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of a speedy trial pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 36(b). The defendant's motion to dismiss was subsequently denied on November 2, 2015, with the motion judge determining that only 311 days were includable under the provisions of rule 36. On April 1, 2016, the defendant was found guilty of three of the charges at the conclusion of a two-day bench trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, this forty-six day span of delay lasting from the date of the defendant's default to the date that the missed pretrial hearing eventually took place is excludable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Pretrial hearing dates\n   </em>\n   . The defendant's default was removed on December 2, 2011, at which time the pretrial hearing previously scheduled for October 17 took place. That pretrial hearing was then continued to January 9, 2012. Further compliance and election dates were set three times between January 9, 2012, and May 14, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his rule 36 calculation, the motion judge noted that defense counsel did not object at any point to the continuances taking place during this span of time, and the docket sheet is consistent with this finding. Additionally, in the affidavit of counsel filed in conjunction with the defendant's rule 36 motion to dismiss, defense counsel did not assert that there was an objection to any of these continuances. \"A failure to object to a continuance or other delay constitutes acquiescence.\"\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482551\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/417/1/#p3\">\n    417 Mass. at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On May 14, 2012, the defendant requested a hearing date for a motion to suppress. The motion hearing was initially scheduled for July 16, 2012, but did not take place until September 28, 2012. The judge subsequently allowed the defendant's motion to suppress on November 2, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Any delay resulting from hearings on pretrial motions is excluded from the court's rule 36 computation. Mass.R.Crim.P. 36(b)(2)(A)(v). The excludable period begins when a party files a request for a hearing on a pretrial motion and runs until the conclusion of the requested hearing. See Reporters' Notes to Rule 36, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1842 (LexisNexis 2016-2017).

Additionally, up to thirty days are excludable where a pretrial motion is under advisement. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 36(b)(2)(A)(vii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the defendant's motion was heard 137 days after a hearing was requested. The entirety of this 137-day span is excludable under rule 36, as it was a delay resulting from a pretrial motion to suppress brought by the defendant. The motion was taken under advisement for thirty-six days, thirty days of which are excludable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In sum, the Commonwealth has justified as excludable 167 days from this period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Interlocutory appeal\n   </em>\n   . The Commonwealth filed its notice of appeal on January 25, 2013.

The excluded period begins to run \"from the date the notice of appeal is filed ... until the rescript is received by the clerk of the lower court.\" Reporters' Notes to Rule 36, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1841 (LexisNexis 2016-2017). The entire pendency of the Commonwealth's interlocutory appeal, totaling 645 days, is thus excludable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    From January 5, 2015, to filing of motion to compel discovery\n   </em>\n   . After the notice of rescript was received, an initial disposition and election hearing took place on January 5, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two subsequent disposition hearings occurred on March 13, 2015, and April 17, 2015, at which time the defendant filed a motion to compel discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant argues that this entire period of time is includable under rule 36 because the delay resulted from the Commonwealth's failure to provide the defendant with mandatory discovery. However, the record indicates that the defendant neither objected to these continuances, nor did she file a motion to compel discovery until April 17. See\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308042\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/516/#p524\">\n    469 Mass. at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A defendant yet to receive all mandatory discovery must accordingly take proactive steps to alert the court and the prosecution that certain items have not been timely produced, and the vehicle for doing so is a motion for sanctions or to compel pursuant to [ Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(1)(C), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20Mass.%201518\">\n    442 Mass. 1518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, the defendant was responsible for the delay between the March 13 hearing and the April 17 hearing. The record makes clear that the defendant requested that the March 13 hearing be continued to April 17 in order to give the Commonwealth time to consider dropping the defendant's \"school zone\" charge. Although the Commonwealth subsequently tried the defendant on that charge, the defendant nevertheless sought a continuance in order to give the Commonwealth time to consider a proposal that was beneficial to her. This period of 103 days is excludable. See\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20631\">\n    91 Mass.

As the Commonwealth was required to justify a minimum of 1,077 days of delay, there was no error in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Crim.P. 36(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Although the defendant asserts in a single sentence that her constitutional right to a speedy trial also was violated, \"it is the obligation of appellate counsel and not the court to structure an analysis, supported by citation to authorities, that will assist the court in reaching a decision.\"\n    <em>\n     Patel\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Amresco SBA Holdings, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3235902\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/69/192/#p197\">\n     69 Mass.
