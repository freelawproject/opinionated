On April 17, 2012, the defendant was charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and assault and battery arising out of the stabbing of his uncle. Attorney Paul K. Woods, Sr., was assigned to represent him. On July 18, 2012, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to both charges. Woods sought a continuation without a finding. The Commonwealth sought a suspended sentence with conditions. The judge sentenced the defendant to one year of probation with certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In or about September of 2015, the defendant filed his motion to vacate the convictions. On September 15, 2016, an evidentiary hearing was conducted on the defendant's motion. Three witnesses testified: Woods; the defendant; and the victim of the stabbing, who testified in support of the defendant's motion. The motion judge, who was also the plea judge, found that Woods had been unable to learn from the defendant at the time of the plea what his immigration status was, and that Woods therefore \"told [the defendant] that unless he was a legal United States citizen, he would, in fact, be deported if he ple[ade]d guilty to these charges.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge dictated his findings on the record and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

A conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude makes your client inadmissible, and I explained that to him.... And, in addition, if a person is convicted of assault and battery, domestic or not and receives a sentence of imprisonment, suspended or committed, for a year or more, the offense becomes an aggravated felony.
