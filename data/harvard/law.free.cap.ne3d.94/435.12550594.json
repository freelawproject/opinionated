We reserve for later reference the facts relevant to the defendant's argument that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain the conviction of distribution of heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the afternoon of the defendant's arrest, a New Bedford police narcotics investigator, Detective Jonathan Lagoa, was surveilling a high crime area known for illicit drug dealing. Detective Lagoa observed a male on a red and white motorized scooter engage in what appeared to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction with a female known to the detective as a drug user named Nicole Goetz. He described the male as light-skinned, wearing a T-shirt, khaki cargo shorts, and a full face helmet. Following the transaction, the man on the scooter drove away. Lagoa issued a \"be on the lookout\" bulletin (BOLO) with the driver's description. Shortly thereafter, he and another officer located and arrested Goetz. Goetz was taken to the police station and admitted that she had just purchased heroin from an individual known to her as \"J-Roc.\" A search of the recent call list on Goetz's cellular telephone (cell phone) showed that three calls were made to the contact listed as \"J-Roc\" immediately before the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   About thirty minutes later, Detective Shane Ramos of the New Bedford police narcotics unit, responding to the BOLO, observed a male driving a red, black, and white scooter about three-quarters of a mile from the location of the alleged drug transaction. Detective Ramos signaled for the driver to stop, but the driver did not comply and drove through a stop sign. Ramos saw the driver drop an object before briefly losing sight of him. Once he regained sight of the driver, Ramos saw him take \"a bunch of baggies\" from his pocket and toss them into the road. Ramos also observed the driver travel in the wrong lane before eventually losing sight of him again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon hearing Detective Ramos's radio broadcast of the chase, Detective Lagoa proceeded to the suspect's location. Once there, he saw a man hugging the side of a building, seemingly attempting to hide from sight. Lagoa immediately recognized this individual, the defendant, as the same person he had seen in the prior transaction with Goetz. Lagoa arrested the defendant and seized a cell phone from him. At the same time, Detective Ramos arrived at the scene and observed a red, white, and black scooter as well as a full face helmet behind the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Detective Lagoa contacted New Bedford police Detective Kevin Lawless, who was with Goetz at the station, and told him to use Goetz's cell phone to initiate a call to the number associated with \"J-Roc.\" Lagoa immediately observed the cell phone seized from the defendant begin to ring. He answered the call and confirmed the caller was Detective Lawless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   .

The defendant argues that the motion judge erred in finding that police had probable cause to arrest him. \"Probable cause to arrest exists when, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances known to the police officers were sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gullick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906609\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/386/278/#p283\">\n    386 Mass. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (1982). Here, as the motion judge stated in his well-supported findings and rulings of law, the facts known to the police at the moment Detective Lagoa arrested the defendant amounted to sufficient probable cause. They included Lagoa's determination that the defendant was the same person he had observed earlier in the transaction with Goetz about three-quarters of a mile away. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4009196\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/32/355/#p358\">\n    32 Mass. App. Ct. 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358-359 (1992) (important factor in determining probable cause was that experienced police officers observed what they reasonably believed was a drug transaction). Moreover, at the time of the arrest, Lagoa was aware of Detective Ramos's observations of the defendant. In his attempt to stop the defendant because he matched the description of the suspect in the earlier transaction, Ramos broadcast to Lagoa that the defendant had refused to stop, had violated several traffic laws, and had discarded what appeared to be \"a bunch of baggies.\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856497\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/711/#p715\">\n    448 Mass. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the totality of these circumstances, the motion judge did not err in concluding the defendant's arrest was supported by sufficient probable cause or in denying the motion on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The incoming call\n   </em>\n   .

Here, Lagoa did not search the digital contents of the phone in any way; instead, he merely answered an incoming phone call. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheridan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144664\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/752/#p763\">\n    470 Mass. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (2015) (search of text messages);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mauricio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451930\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/588/#p593\">\n    477 Mass. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (2017) (search of digital photographs);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dyette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074586\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/87/548/#p558\">\n    87 Mass. App. Ct. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558-589 (2015) (search of call log).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Detective Lagoa initiated the call and was the intended recipient, the risk of intrusion into the defendant's private life through his cell phone was minimal. Simply put, the defendant's privacy interest in this specific call is distinct from his privacy interest in his cell phone as a ubiquitous tool for everyday life. See\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2489\">\n    134 S. Ct. at 2489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The term 'cell phone' is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone\"). Without resolving the question whether answering the cell phone by the police constituted a search or was admissible, we conclude that, even if inadmissible, allowing testimony of the call constituted harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time Detective Lagoa arrested the defendant and seized the cell phone he was carrying,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lagoa had probable cause to believe the defendant was the same individual involved in the hand-to-hand transaction with Goetz. Lagoa also knew from Goetz that the individual was known to her as \"J-Roc.\" From this information, Lagoa justifiably believed that initiating a call to the phone number associated with \"J-Roc\" on Goetz's cell phone would result in an incoming call to the cell phone seized from the defendant. After Lagoa directed Detective Lawless to make the call to the \"J-Roc\" contact, the defendant's seized phone immediately rang. The mere answering of it to confirm that the call was from the Goetz phone added little to the prosecutor's case. Therefore, based on the totality of the record before us, even if the call was inadmissible, \"we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury's verdicts.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tyree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665125\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/676/#p701\">\n    455 Mass. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance of counsel\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also claims, in this direct appeal, that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to a portion of the jury instructions and in failing to request an instruction on good faith misidentification pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pressley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916709\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/390/617/#p619\">\n    390 Mass. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619-620 (1983).

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial judge's instruction on identification was a proper statement of the law and did not excuse the Commonwealth from proving that the defendant was the person police had previously observed engaging in criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The instruction merely highlighted that the Commonwealth was allowed to prove the defendant's identity through circumstantial evidence. While it may have been prudent for counsel to object to the reference to \"statements by the defendant to others about his participation\" as there was no evidence of any such statements, the failure to object did not deprive the defendant of \"an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Similarly, defense counsel's failure to request a\n   <em>\n    Pressley\n   </em>\n   instruction did not result in ineffective assistance.

Through cross-examination and summation at closing, defense counsel thoroughly advanced a misidentification theory. Thus, there is \"no doubt that the defense of misidentification was squarely before the jury, and ... the failure of defense counsel to request a\n   <em>\n    Pressley\n   </em>\n   instruction did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1168067\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/53/650/#p661\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1168067\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/53/650/#p661\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence supporting distribution of heroin conviction\n   </em>\n   .
