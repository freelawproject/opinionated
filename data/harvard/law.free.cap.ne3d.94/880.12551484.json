We affirm the single justice's order, which we review for abuse of discretion.

See\n   <em>\n    Tisei\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Building Inspector of Marlborough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949423\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/3/377/#p379\">\n    3 Mass.

App. Ct. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (2006). The single justice was within his discretion to conclude that the plaintiff had shown neither. First, the plaintiff's misunderstanding regarding the deadline to file a notice of appeal was not excusable neglect under rule 14(b). See\n   <em>\n    Feltch\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    General Rental Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813479\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/383/603/#p613\">\n    383 Mass. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613-614 (1981).

See\n   <em>\n    Tisei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949423\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/3/377/#p379\">\n    3 Mass. App. Ct. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The motion judge dismissed the plaintiff's complaint as barred by the statute of limitations because the documentary evidence showed that she was on notice of her claims more than three years before she filed suit. Although the plaintiff asserted that the motion judge mistakenly used a September, 2015, filing date (rather than July, 2015), the complaint would still be untimely because the plaintiff was on notice at the latest in January, 2012. Next, citing the affidavit of counsel, the plaintiff asserted that there are factual disputes regarding whether she had notice. However, the affidavit did not address that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying renewed motion for enlargement of time to file notice of appeal affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    The defendant's request for appellate attorney's fees is denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
