BURNS.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  17-P-20\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Appeals Court of Massachusetts.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Entered: November 17, 2017.\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  <em>\n   MEMORANDUM AND ORDER PURSUANT TO RULE 1:28\n  </em>\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The defendant appeals from his convictions after a jury trial of three counts of violation of an abuse prevention order obtained by his former girl friend, Ellen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7. The sole issue on appeal is the propriety of the judge's decision to exclude testimony by Ellen's husband that she had used numerous names and Social Security numbers. The judge ruled that the evidence was irrelevant and improper character evidence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Absent some showing that the evidence was relevant to a proffered defense, testimony by Ellen's husband could have been offered only for the prohibited purpose of impeaching her credibility and character by showing she had many names and identities. Generally, evidence of prior bad acts may not be used to impeach a witness's credibility. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaVelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902806\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/146/#p151\">\n    414 Mass. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151 (1993) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bregoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286742\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/265/#p275\">\n    431 Mass. 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (2000).
