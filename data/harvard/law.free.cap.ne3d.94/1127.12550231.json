(\"CSX\"), (collectively \"appellants\") appeal the trial court's denial of their motion for administrative dismissal of the complaint of plaintiff-appellee Kevin E. Howell (\"Howell\") for failure to meet the prima facie requirements of the Ohio Asbestos Reform Act, promulgated under H.B. 292 and codified at R.C. 2307.91 through 2307.98 (\"Ohio Act\") for a smoker raising an asbestos-related lung cancer claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Howell was employed by Consolidated in 1975, in the railroad signal maintenance\n   department repairing and maintaining railroad signals and signal houses (\"signals\") located on railroad tracks throughout Northern and Central Ohio. Signals often contained asbestos boards, and Howell's duties included handling and drilling holes in the boards, creating asbestos dust. Howell had also been a heavy smoker for approximately 45 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Howell retired in 2013, after 38 years of employment. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and lung disease in April 2015. On June 4, 2015, Howell filed suit against appellants, alleging that his condition is due to his exposure to asbestos, asbestos dust, and toxic dusts and fumes (silica and diesel)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   during his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Howell asserts employment-related causes of action for exposure to asbestos and other toxic substances based on federal, state and local statutes, regulations and policies, as well as under common law, including negligence, failure to provide a safe workplace and failure to warn. Pertinent to this appeal, Howell complains that appellants violated the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\"), 45 U.S.C. 51, et seq. Railroad workers are not covered by the Ohio workers' compensation plan. FELA provides an avenue for recovery to railroad employees suffering death or injury due to the rail company's negligence, including the failure to provide a safe working environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellants counter that Howell's claims must meet the prima facie filing requirements of the Ohio Asbestos Reform Act, appellants moved the trial court for an administrative dismissal under R.C. 2307.92 and 2307.93, on the grounds that Howell failed to \"submit admissible and sufficient evidence\" that: (1) he experienced \"substantial occupational exposure to asbestos,\" and (2) the exposure to asbestos was a \"substantial contributing factor\" for his primary lung cancer. R.C. 2307.92(C) ;\n   <em>\n    Hoover v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

The doctor took those facts into consideration, recognized the synergistic effect of combining asbestos with cigarette smoking, and he opined that they were both substantial contributing factors in Mr. Howell's disease process. That is all that the statute requires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The instant appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A trial court applies a summary judgment standard in assessing the sufficiency of R.C. 2307.92 prima facie evidence showing under R.C. 2307.93 : Upon a challenge to the adequacy of the prima facie evidence of the exposed person's physical impairment, R.C. 2307.93(B) directs a court to resolve the issue whether a plaintiff has made a prima facie showing required by R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), or (D) by applying the standard for resolving a motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to R.C. 2307.93(C), a court \"shall administratively dismiss\" the plaintiff's claim without prejudice upon a finding of failure to make the prima facie showing required by R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), or (D). However, R.C. 2307.93(C) requires a court to maintain its jurisdiction over any case that is administratively dismissed and permits the plaintiff to reinstate the case if the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that meets the minimum requirements specified in R.C. 2307.92(B), (C) or (D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Renfrow v.
