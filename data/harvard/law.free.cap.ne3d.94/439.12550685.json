That motion was denied, and the defendant's appeal therefrom was considered by the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) on direct appellate review. The SJC remanded, concluding that its adoption of the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (2010), was retroactive to the time of the defendant's guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172892\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/80/#p83\">\n    474 Mass. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83-84 (2016).

The defendant was arrested at Logan Airport in 1990 after consenting to a search of his jacket by an undercover police officer that yielded a paper bag containing 300 bags of heroin. He was released on personal recognizance and failed to appear before the court again until 1996. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of possession of a class A substance in 1997 and received a suspended sentence in the house of correction. His probation period was ultimately terminated in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant, a legal permanent resident of the United States born in the Dominican Republic, filed his motion to withdraw his guilty plea in 2015 on the grounds that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to properly advise him that he was likely to be deported as a result of his guilty plea. The judge denied the motion without making factual findings. The defendant's appeal was heard by the SJC, which determined that its decisions in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272268\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/30/\">\n    460 Mass. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sylvain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224774\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/422/#p423\">\n    466 Mass. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423-424 (2013),\n   <em>\n    S\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    C\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802768\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/832/\">\n    473 Mass. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) -which applied\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   retroactively to April 1, 1997-applied to convictions stemming back to April 24, 1996.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172892\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/80/#p83\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172892\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/80/#p83\">\n    at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the defendant's guilty plea fell within that period, the SJC remanded the case for written findings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172892\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/80/#p83\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172892\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/80/#p83\">\n    . at 83-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On remand, the judge considered the substance of the earlier evidentiary hearing, at which the defendant and his plea counsel from 1997 each testified. The only issue raised in the motion to withdraw the guilty plea was whether plea counsel provided effective assistance of counsel under the\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his findings, the judge explicitly credited plea counsel's testimony that she recalled having some conversation with the defendant about possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea. She further testified that she \"recommended that [the defendant] consult with an immigration attorney\" because that was not her area of expertise. The judge noted that plea counsel appeared in court four times with the defendant, provided sound legal advice, and negotiated a positive outcome for the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The judge also heard testimony from the defendant, whose testimony included statements that he did not recognize his plea counsel and that he never discussed immigration consequences with her. His testimony was discredited, termed by the judge to be \"misleading, evasive, untruthful and self-serving.\" In denying the defendant's motion, the judge emphasized that plea counsel had many conversations with the defendant about possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea and suggested that the defendant consult an immigration attorney. Under the\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   standard, the judge determined that plea counsel's advice \"comported with that of an ordinary fallible lawyer.\" The judge further noted that, even if plea counsel's representation was ineffective, the defendant did not prove any form of prejudice as laid out in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n    468 Mass. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182-184 (2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"A motion to withdraw a guilty plea is treated as a motion for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n    . at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We review the denial of a motion for new trial to determine whether there is \"a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Forte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308988\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/469/#p488\">\n    469 Mass. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (2014), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874767\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/303/#p307\">\n    397 Mass. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (1986). On appeal, the defendant argues that the denial of his motion to withdraw the guilty plea was erroneous because plea counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him that he would likely be deported due to his guilty plea and because he demonstrated \"special circumstances\" under\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   that resulted in prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ineffective assistance of counsel is found upon a showing that \"there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel-behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974). If that is found, we then determine \"whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , we employ a two-pronged analysis. First, a defendant must establish that counsel was ineffective, which exists if counsel does not \"inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A defendant must then prove that counsel's deficiencies prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n    at 182-183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the only form of prejudice argued by the defendant is that there existed \"special circumstances that support the conclusion that he placed, or would have placed, particular emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding to plead guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p182\">\n    . at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In arguing that special circumstances existed, the defendant cites his own testimony that he had been in the United States since he was fourteen years old and that much of his family lived in the United States, as well as plea counsel's testimony that she sought dispositions that would avoid immigration consequences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it may be true that the defendant had ties to the United States and a desire to stay in the country where he had resided for nearly ten years, his argument does not rise to the level of special circumstances as to warrant a new trial. Here, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   , the defendant continued to maintain familial ties in the Dominican Republic as his father remained there. Additionally, the defendant's other contentions are nonspecific statements that, while expressing a desire to remain in the United States, do not establish that immigration consequences would have pushed him to \"roll the dice\" and proceed to trial despite his favorable plea bargain.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Balthazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238751\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/438/#p444\">\n    86 Mass.
