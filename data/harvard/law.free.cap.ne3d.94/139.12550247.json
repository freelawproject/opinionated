For the reasons that follow, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 1, 2015, at approximately 6:58 p.m., Sergeant DeWitt of the Ohio State Highway Patrol observed Nastick operating a silver Nissan above the posted speed limit. Sergeant DeWitt followed the vehicle for a short time before activating the overhead lights on his cruiser and initiating a traffic stop. At the beginning of the stop, a dispatcher informed Sergeant DeWitt that Nastick had an active concealed carry permit. Upon establishing contact with Nastick, Sergeant DeWitt informed him why he had stopped his vehicle and detected an odor of alcohol emanating from inside the vehicle. After about two minutes, Sergeant DeWitt asked Nastick if he had a weapon in his vehicle, to which Nastick replied he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sergeant DeWitt then asked Nastick to exit the vehicle and perform standardized field sobriety testing. Sergeant DeWitt stated he observed six out of the six possible clues on the horizontal gaze nystagmus test (HGN), four out of eight possible clues on the walk-and-turn test, and one out of four clues on the one leg stand test. Following the administration of the field sobriety tests, Sergeant DeWitt placed Nastick under arrest for OVI. Consequently, Sergeant DeWitt conducted an inventory search of Nastick's vehicle before it was towed. Sergeant DeWitt located Nastick's firearm within the center console of his vehicle during an inventory search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Summit County Grand Jury indicted Nastick on the following charges: (I) improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(D)(1), a felony of the fifth degree; (II) carrying concealed weapons in violation of R.C. 2923.12(B)(1), a misdemeanor of the first degree; and (III) operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OVI) in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), a misdemeanor of the first degree. Nastick pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded through the pretrial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Nastick later filed a motion to suppress. After a hearing was held, Nastick also filed a motion to dismiss and a supplemental motion to suppress. The trial court subsequently denied Nastick's motions. Pursuant to a Crim.R. 11 plea agreement, the State dismissed the charge of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle and in exchange, Nastick pleaded no contest to the charges of carrying concealed weapons and OVI. The trial court accepted Nastick's no contest plea and found him guilty of both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Nastick filed this timely appeal, raising two assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in failing to grant Mr. Nastick's motion to dismiss after the state lost materially exculpatory evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Nastick contends that the trial court erred when it failed to grant his motion to\n   dismiss after the state failed to preserve materially exculpatory evidence.

Evidence is materially exculpatory when: (1) the evidence possesses an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and (2) is of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonable means.\n   <em>\n    Trombetta\n   </em>\n   at 489,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p489\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that, if \"missing evidence would not 'challenge the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of the allegations [,]' it 'could not have been materially exculpatory evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Franchi\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6, quoting\n   <em>\n    Geeslin\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In this case, Sergeant DeWitt testified that it appeared the recording system in his cruiser was working properly at the time of the stop since it recorded a video of Nastick's transport from the police station to the jail. Sergeant DeWitt stated that although the stop and field sobriety tests were recorded on his cruiser's dash-cam, the copy that was provided to the State was \"not readable\" or \"corrupted.\" However, he also stated that he had no knowledge of when the damage to the recording occurred and that he had not viewed the video. Sergeant DeWitt attempted to produce another copy of the dash-cam video, but found the video was not available in the highway patrol's main database. As a result, the State was not able to provide the dash-cam video to Nastick. On cross-examination, Sergeant DeWitt agreed that \"whatever happened [to\n   the video] happened in the state's database.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Although no one ever viewed the video in this case, there is no dispute that the dash-cam video captured the traffic stop at issue and subsequent field sobriety tests. \"[S]uch direct evidence is by its very nature either inculpatory or exculpatory, or some combination of the two, and there is likely no 'test' of that footage that would be necessary to yield a result that would exonerate the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He then initiated a traffic stop of Nastick's vehicle. A dispatcher informed Sergeant DeWitt at the beginning of the stop that the Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS) indicated that Nastick had an active concealed carry permit. Upon establishing contact with Nastick, Sergeant DeWitt informed him why he had stopped his vehicle and asked Nastick if he was aware that he had been speeding. Nastick replied he was not. At that time, the Sergeant detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from inside the vehicle and observed Nastick's eyes to be red, bloodshot, and glassy and his speech to be slow. Sergeant DeWitt asked Nastick for his driver's license and insurance and observed that Nastick had tactile difficulties when searching for his documentation. Sergeant DeWitt then asked Nastick if he had been consuming any alcoholic beverage, to which Nastick responded he had a couple of drinks. After about two minutes, Sergeant DeWitt asked Nastick if he had a\n   weapon in his vehicle. Initially, the Sergeant testified that Nastick stated that \"he didn't think that he had one in the car.\" However, upon cross-examination, the Sergeant was allowed to refresh his recollection by reading his report. Sergeant DeWitt subsequently changed his testimony, testifying that Nastick stated \"he did have one in the center console\" of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Sergeant DeWitt then asked Nastick to exit the vehicle and asked him to perform standardized field sobriety testing.

Sergeant DeWitt stated he observed six out of the six possible clues on the HGN test, four out of eight possible clues on the walk-and-turn test, and one out of four clues on the one leg stand test. On the walk-and-turn test, the Sergeant stated that Nastick did not touch heel to toe, stepped off of the line while walking, and turned the wrong way. However, he could not recall how far apart Nastick's feet were when they did not touch heel to toe or how far \"off line\" Nastick stepped. On the one leg stand test, Sergeant DeWitt observed Nastick to sway while balancing. Although the Sergeant could not recall \"exactly what [Nastick's] swaying was,\" he stated that the clue was \"evident and noticeable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Following the administration of the field sobriety tests, Sergeant DeWitt placed Nastick under arrest for OVI.

Unfortunately, even though he followed standard operating procedure by activating his lights and sirens, the copy of the recording that was provided to the State was \"not readable\" or \"corrupted.\" He further stated that it appeared the recording system was working properly at the time of the stop since it recorded a subsequent video of Nastick's transport from the police station to the jail. The Sergeant stated he did not watch the video before attempting to make a copy for the State. When Sergeant DeWitt then attempted to produce another copy of the dash-cam video, the video did not exist in the highway patrol's main database. On cross-examination, Sergeant DeWitt agreed that \"whatever happened [to the video] happened in the state's database.\" As a result, the State was not able to provide the dash-cam video to Nastick. Again, Nastick did not offer any testimony or evidence at the hearing to contradict the Sergeant's testimony. Therefore, we conclude that based on the above circumstances, Nastick has failed to demonstrate bad faith by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Accordingly, Nastick's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred when it found the trooper had probable cause to effectuate a warrantless arrest for OVI.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his second assignment of error, Nastick contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. Specifically, Nastick argues that the State failed to present competent credible evidence from which the trial court could have determined that Sergeant DeWitt had probable cause to arrest him for OVI because the Sergeant (1) did not observe him driving erratically; (2) did not observe him \"pull over incorrectly;\" (3) had \"little independent recollection of the indicators of impairment he allegedly observed;\" and (4) could not testify \"to any level of specificity\" with regard to the alleged indicators of impairment.
