Giordano, appeals his conviction in the Girard Municipal Court, following his no contest plea to cruelty to animals. Due to the trial court's failure to obtain the required explanation of circumstances to support appellant's plea before finding him guilty, we reverse his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 17, 2016, Captain John Norman of the Girard Police Department filed a verified complaint in the trial court charging appellant with cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 959.13(A)(1). Along with the complaint, Captain Norman filed various exhibits in support, including his police report, the report of the Animal Welfare League of Trumbull County, witness statements, photographs, and a video depicting appellant beating his dog, a Rottweiler named \"Hazard.\" Appellant pled not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On the same date, February 17, 2016, the court entered a judgment ordering Hazard to be turned over to the Animal Welfare League pending final disposition of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The case came on for trial on May 26, 2016. On that date, the parties entered a plea bargain, pursuant to which they agreed that appellant would plead no contest to the complaint and the state would not make a sentencing recommendation. The judgment entry confirming the change of plea provides that appellant withdrew his previously-entered not guilty plea and pled no contest, \"stipulating to the underlying facts contained in [the] complaint * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The court accepted appellant's no contest plea; found him guilty; and referred the matter for a presentence report. The court did not, however, obtain an explanation of circumstances from the prosecutor before finding appellant guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The case came on for sentencing on June 16, 2016. At sentencing, the court said that during the presentence investigation, appellant made comments about the video that led the court to believe appellant has an anger-management problem. The court told appellant that just because a Rottweiler is a big dog does not mean he can beat the dog. The court said that, based on the police report, appellant's beating of the dog went \"beyond a smacking of the dog.\" The court said, \"[t]he police report indicates you did knee the Rottweiler to the ground and hit him with a closed fist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant interrupted the judge and said he was just engaging in \"roughhousing\" with the dog. However, the court said, \"the report from the Learning Dog\n   Center says, based upon the video, Hazard's behaviors are indicative of a dog that is habituated to abuse. He does not defend himself [and] calmly prepares himself for the attack * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The court sentenced appellant to 90 days in jail, but suspended all days; fined appellant $750, but suspended $500; put appellant on probation for one year; and ordered Hazard to be forfeited to the Animal Welfare League pursuant to R.C. 959.99(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant appeals his conviction, asserting the following as his sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"The appellant's conviction is not supported by sufficient evience\" (Sic.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant argues that because the trial court was not presented with an explanation of circumstances at the plea hearing, his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and, therefore, his conviction must be vacated. In support, he cites\n   <em>\n    Berea v. Moorer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3452\">\n    2016-Ohio-3452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20N.E.3d%201186\">\n    55 N.E.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} While the state concedes the trial court erred in failing to obtain an explanation of circumstances for appellant's plea before finding him guilty, the state argues this court should reverse and remand for a new plea hearing pursuant to this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ms. Spicer e-mailed the video to Captain Norman later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The captain said the video showed a male, who Captain Norman recognized from prior encounters as appellant, knee the dog to the ground and then with a closed fist strike the dog five times and then choke him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} While the record thus contained evidence of appellant's guilt, the trial court did not say it considered the evidence before finding him guilty.

This court's position has consistently been to allow the error to be remedied, regardless of the standard of review, thereby restoring the defendant's right to have an explanation of the charges given prior to the court's finding of guilt.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v.

Double jeopardy has no application to the present case since the foregoing concerns are not implicated: Giordano chose not to object to the lack of an explanation of circumstances, filed a direct appeal of the judgment accepting his own entry of a no contest plea, and seeks to have that plea invalidated. There is no additional risk that he will be found guilty of a crime for which he is innocent. Extra time will be expended only to have the explanation of the crime discussed in open court, which should have occurred when Giordano originally entered his plea. This will lead to no embarrassment or anxiety beyond that experienced by every defendant who enters a plea accepting responsibility for committing a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Although this court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , recently noted that the \" 'explanation of circumstances' appears to be akin to a sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis,\" this statement was made in dicta and, thus, has no impact on the law of this district.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-6987\">\n    2016-Ohio-6987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%2063\">\n    72 N.E.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33 (11th Dist.).\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   did not address the double jeopardy issue and this court ultimately was not required to determine any issues relating to the \"explanation of circumstances,\" since such an explanation is not required when a guilty plea is entered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. The existing precedent of this court should not be ignored in order to apply dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 36} While other appellate districts have held that double jeopardy should apply to bar the conviction of a defendant if an explanation of circumstances is not given, this court is not bound by decisions of other appellate districts, and it is necessary to follow the well-established precedent of this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Trumbull Cty. Child Support Enforcement Agency\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2000-T-0025,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20114971\">\n    2001 WL 114971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (Feb. 9, 2001) (authority of other appellate districts is \"merely persuasive authority and, as such, is not binding upon us\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Further, these cases do not provide a compelling justification to allow a defendant to avoid a serious charge and a crime he voluntarily chose to enter a plea of no contest to, which \"constitute[s] an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint.\" R.C. 2937.07. Requiring a new plea hearing will serve to remedy the error made by the court in failing to follow the appropriate procedure for accepting the plea and protects Giordano's rights under R.C. 2937.07. There is no need to make a finding that insufficient evidence exists when the true concern is that the explanation of circumstances requirement was not met, rather than that evidence to prove the charge did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 38} For the foregoing reasons, the failure of the trial court to require an explanation of circumstances, in the interest of justice, warrants reversal for a new plea hearing rather than dismissal of the charge against the defendant outright. For this reason, I concur in part and dissent in part and would remand for the trial court to conduct additional proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
