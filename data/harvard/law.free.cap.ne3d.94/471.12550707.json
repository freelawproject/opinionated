Because defendants have not met their threshold burden of demonstrating that the action was governmental in the context of these pre-answer, pre-discovery CPLR 3211(a)(7) motions, we cannot say that the complaints fail to state causes of action as a matter of law. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   LIPA is a public authority that was created by the legislature in 1986 to provide a \"safer, more efficient, reliable and economical supply of electric energy\" in the service area of LILCO, which includes the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens County (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1020-a ). Due to rising costs of electricity and a lack of confidence in the ability of LILCO-an \"investor owned utility\" at the time-the legislature determined that \"[s]uch matters of state concern best can be dealt with by replacing [LILCO] with a publicly owned power authority\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). To effectuate these purposes, the legislature created\n   LIPA as a \"corporate municipal instrumentality of the state ... which shall be a body corporate and politic and a political subdivision of the state, exercising essential governmental and public powers,\" and authorized it to operate in LILCO's service area ( Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1020-c [1 ], [2] ).\n   At the direction of the legislature, LIPA acquired LILCO including, among other things, its electric transmission and distribution facilities (T &amp; D System) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1020-h [1 ][b];\n   <em>\n    Matter of Suffolk County v.

The T &amp; D System consists of the equipment necessary to bring power onto Long Island from high-load power lines, towers, and substations, and to deliver power to individual customers. As a result of the acquisition, LILCO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of LIPA, entitled by statute to \"all the privileges [and] immunities ... of [LIPA]\" ( Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1020-i[2] ). Meanwhile, in preparation for the acquisition, LIPA entered into a Management Services Agreement (MSA) with LILCO, which was eventually assigned to the entity now known as National Grid. The MSA governed all aspects of the relationship between LIPA and National Grid at the relevant time, including National Grid's main function of operating and maintaining the T &amp; D System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In each of the actions presently before us, plaintiffs allege that their real and personal property was destroyed by fire as a result of defendants' negligent failure to preemptively de-energize the Rockaway Peninsula prior to or after Hurricane Sandy made landfall in October 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As alleged in plaintiffs' complaints, the Governor declared a state of emergency in all counties across New York State in preparation for the potential impact of the storm, and the National Hurricane Center warned of a \"life-threatening storm surge\" that could cause \"repeated and extended periods of coastal and bayside flooding.\" Further, the Mayor of the City of New York issued Executive Order [Bloomberg] No. 163 ordering the evacuation of Zone A, which included the Rockaway Peninsula. Nevertheless, LIPA did not shut down power to the area, even though Consolidated Edison-the utility supplying most of the electricity to the five boroughs of New York City-preemptively did so in its service area in order to avoid salt water from the surge coming into contact with its electrical systems. According to plaintiffs, when the Rockaway Peninsula flooded due to storm surges from Hurricane Sandy, flood water came into contact with components of the T &amp; D System, causing short circuits, fires and, ultimately, the destruction of plaintiffs' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs also alleged in their amended complaints that LIPA persisted in failing to shut down power despite having received actual notice of downed, live power lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaints pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) insofar as asserted against them on the ground that LIPA was immune from liability based on the doctrine of governmental function immunity, and that LILCO and National Grid were entitled to the same defense. Specifically, LIPA argued, among other things, that the actions challenged were taken in the exercise of its governmental capacity and were discretionary, and, even if they were not discretionary, plaintiffs' failure to allege a special duty in the complaints amounted to a failure\n   to state viable claims. Plaintiffs opposed the motions on the ground that defendants' actions were proprietary, not governmental, and that special duty rules did not apply. Supreme Court denied the motions to dismiss in three substantially similar orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On defendants' appeals, the Appellate Division, Second Department, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed each order denying defendants' motions to dismiss (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790236\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/555/\">\n    141 A.D.3d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790236\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/555/\">\n    34 N.Y.S.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2016] ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790220,6790199\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/554/\">\n    141 A.D.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790220\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/554/6790220/\">\n    34 N.Y.S.3d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2016] ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790303\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/561/\">\n    141 A.D.3d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790303\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/561/\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2016] ). The Court held that LIPA was not entitled to governmental immunity because the provision of electricity is properly categorized as a proprietary function and, in the Court's view, the functions of both providing electricity in the ordinary course and in responding to a hurricane are part of the proprietary core functions of electric utilities. The Court also rejected National Grid's claim of immunity on the basis that it presupposed that LIPA was entitled to governmental immunity. The dissenting Justice agreed that defendants were engaged in a generally proprietary activity as providers of electricity, but would have held that the specific acts or omissions alleged in the complaints were related, not to defendants' general operations but, instead, to the governmental function of preparing for, and responding to, a natural disaster ( 141 A.D.3d at 571-573,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790303\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/561/\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Miller, J., dissenting] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Appellate Division granted defendants leave to appeal to this Court, in each case, certifying the question of whether its order was properly made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is well settled that, \"[d]espite the sovereign's own statutory surrender of common-law tort immunity for the misfeasance\n   of its employees, governmental entities somewhat incongruously claim-and unquestionably continue to enjoy-a significant measure of immunity fashioned for their protection by the courts\" (\n   <em>\n    Haddock v.

The doctrine of governmental function immunity \"reflects separation of powers principles and is intended to ensure that public servants are free to exercise their decision-making authority without interference from the courts\" (\n   <em>\n    Valdez v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716677\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/69/#p76\">\n    18 N.Y.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716677\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/69/#p76\">\n    936 N.Y.S.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716677\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/69/#p76\">\n    960 N.E.2d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2011] ).

At the same time, defendants bear the burden of establishing that the complaint fails to state a viable cause of action.

Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that defendants failed to take action despite repeated warnings that Hurricane Sandy would create a massive surge, inundating the locality with salt water that was likely to come into contact with components of defendants' T &amp; D System, which defendants knew created a risk of fire and which, in fact, caused such fires. Plaintiffs further alleged that, notwithstanding defendants' actual knowledge of downed live electrical lines, they persisted in their failure to de-energize the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Viewing these allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as we must given the procedural posture, plaintiffs' allegations concern the provision of electrical power by defendants, a service that traditionally has been provided by private entities in the State of New York. In fact, LIPA itself was created to replace LILCO which, at the time, was an \"investor owned utility\" ( Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1020-a ). This takeover was anomalous and, when the legislation creating LIPA was enacted, the New York State Public Service Commission-the agency charged with ensuring safe and reliable utility service throughout the State-observed that, \"[i]n New York State we have generally adopted a system of private ownership subject to close regulation\" (NY St Dept of Pub Serv Mem at 1, Bill Jacket, L 1986, ch 517 at 21). In that vein, during a debate concerning the bill, the Senate acknowledged that passage of the bill marked an \"extraordinary event in the history of New York State\" (N.Y. Senate Debate on L 1986, ch 517 at 7060-7061). Moreover, the record demonstrates that LILCO itself observed that \"[t]he draft bill breaks new ... ground on several scores[;] ... there is no precedent whatsoever for a utility takeover of this magnitude by any means anywhere in this country\" (LILCO Mem, July 2, 1986 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Indeed, LIPA does not dispute that the provision of electricity traditionally has been a private enterprise which, in the normal course of operations, would be a proprietary function. However, LIPA argues that its alleged decision to refrain from shutting down electrical power to, or failure to de-energize, the Rockaway Peninsula-the specific act or omission alleged in the amended complaints-was a governmental function under the circumstances here because it related more broadly to the protection of the public from a natural disaster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Given the procedural posture, we cannot say, as a matter of law based only on the allegations in the amended complaints,\n   as amplified, that LIPA was acting in a governmental, rather than a proprietary, capacity when engaged in the conduct claimed to have caused plaintiffs' injuries. We reject defendants' claim that the magnitude of the disaster, without any reference to the circumstances and nature of the specific act or omission alleged-i.e., the failure to de-energize-renders LIPA's conduct governmental as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inasmuch as defendants have failed to meet their burden to establish that plaintiffs' amended complaints failed to state viable claims, we hold that the courts below properly denied LIPA's motions to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, in each appeal, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    LILCO was not named as a defendant in one of the actions (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Heeran v.

Plaintiffs sued defendants for property damage allegedly caused by defendants' failure to de-energize part of its customer service area during Superstorm Sandy. Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that LIPA, and as a consequence the codefendants, are immune from suit for acting in LIPA's governmental, as opposed to proprietary, capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I agree with the majority that defendants failed to carry their burden on the motion because the amended complaints state cognizable claims for relief based on defendants' alleged negligence (majority op. at 728-730, 70 N.Y.S.3d at 914-16, 94 N.E.3d at 476-77). However, I disagree with the majority's suggestion that defendants may be able to establish an affirmative defense of immunity at some later stage in this litigation (majority op. at 730 n. 2, 70 N.Y.S.3d at 916 n. 2, 94 N.E.3d at 477-78 n. 2). The majority essentially invites the parties to engage in further motion practice on defendants' purported entitlement to immunity. In doing so, it encourages the parties to incur unwarranted litigation costs and needlessly expend judicial resources on an argument that has no possibility of success. A governmental entity that replaced a private entity to supply a service that historically has been provided by private entities, in a manner indistinguishable from those private entities, simply cannot be said to be acting in a governmental capacity. LIPA's decision not to de-energize is decidedly proprietary\n   because its \"activities essentially substitute for or supplement 'traditionally private enterprises' \" (\n   <em>\n    Sebastian v.

If not, the entity is understood to be acting as its private sector counterpart, without the need for immunity to ensure the proper deployment of limited governmental resources. Examples of governmental functions attributed to the general police powers include police and fire protections, oversight of juvenile delinquents, issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy, certifying compliance with fire safety codes, teacher supervision of a public school playground, boat inspections, garbage collection, and traffic regulations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n    at 425-426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n    972 N.Y.S.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n    995 N.E.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Each of these examples manifest policy choices based on social norms and political considerations that at their core require balancing society's interests in protecting the public welfare, health, and safety against the interests of the individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LIPA's challenged action here does not involve the exercise of the police power. Its decision not to de-energize is no different than those historically made by private actors. In fact, its private sector counterpart, Con Edison, faced this very same decision in the days and hours before the storm. We need only compare this decision with a true exercise of the police power under the circumstances of a storm emergency to understand why LIPA's actions were proprietary. As the storm approached, the deployment of law enforcement personnel, fire fighters, emergency medical providers, and other first responders, was a clear governmental act (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n    at 425, 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n    972 N.Y.S.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752538\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/21/420/#p425\">\n    995 N.E.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"Police and fire protection are examples of long-recognized, quintessential governmental functions,\" and EMT and other first responders fulfill a government function] ). Similarly, the decision to evacuate parts of New York City could only be accomplished by means of the government exercising its police powers in the course of an emergency. In contrast, LIPA's actions did not involve decisions about these limited governmental resources, which are at the core of those governmental actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I agree with the majority that the fact that LIPA was responding to a severe storm does not itself mean that its\n   behavior constituted governmental action (majority op. at 730, 70 N.Y.S.3d at 916, 94 N.E.3d at 477-78). Nor would the fact that LIPA took into consideration the choices of other governmental actors, such as various entities' decisions about evacuating particular areas and deploying first responders, make its decision \"governmental.\" Con Edison did the same. Additionally, to the extent that LIPA's actions were taken at the behest of some governmental command, this may bear upon LIPA's eventual liability under traditional negligence principles, not whether LIPA acted in a governmental capacity. Again, a private utility would respond to governmental directives in the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is not disputed that the provision of electricity has traditionally been a proprietary enterprise undertaken by private entities (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 131 at 1053 [5th ed 1984] [\"(I)f the city operates a local electric or water company for which fees are charged, this looks very much like private enterprise and is usually considered proprietary.\"] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   LIPA replaced a\n   private entity-LILCO-and as such its \"activities essentially substitute for or supplement traditionally private enterprises\" (\n   <em>\n    Sebastian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188571\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/790/#p793\">\n    93 N.Y.2d at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188571\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/790/#p793\">\n    698 N.Y.S.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"188571\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/93/790/#p793\">\n    720 N.E.2d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ).

First, nothing suggests that LIPA faces different public safety concerns than the private companies in the region, including those providing power to customers directly across\n   Jamaica Bay, as well as different parts of New York City (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heeran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790303\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/561/\">\n    141 A.D.3d at 565-566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790303\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/561/\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). While, as the Moreland Commission on Utility Storm Preparation and Response observed, the purpose of the de-energization process, broadly speaking, \"is to protect the public from fire and electrical hazards posed by wiring and circuits that may have come into contact with flood water,\" LIPA was required to protect its customers from the commodity it supplies, in the same way, and with the same considerations, as a private utility company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, there is nothing to suggest that the decision not to de-energize implicated the general police powers of the state.

Indeed, crime prevention is \"a classic example of a governmental function\" and that this function \"has traditionally been assumed by police rather than by private actors is a tell-tale sign that the conduct is not proprietary in nature\" (\n   <em>\n    Balsam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165641\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/966/#p968\">\n    90 N.Y.2d at 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165641\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/966/#p968\">\n    665 N.Y.S.2d 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165641\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/966/#p968\">\n    688 N.E.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). While we have acknowledged that government entities conduct may fall on a continuum between purely proprietary and purely governmental functions, and that a governmental entity may have a \"dual role\" in performing both (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2348452\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/62/506/#p511\">\n    62 N.Y.2d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20N.Y.S.2d%20829\">\n    478 N.Y.S.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=467%20N.E.2d%20493\">\n    467 N.E.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), unlike WTC, nothing moves LIPA's actions off the proprietary end of the continuum. Its sole role is proprietary in nature: the efficient delivery of electrical services to its customers.\n   LIPA and codefendant National Grid were aware that a major storm capable of flooding the Rockaway Peninsula was about to hit the region, and that this could create a fire hazard if certain areas vulnerable to flooding were not de-energized. They were also aware that de-energizing could potentially bring its own risks, as it could affect those unable to evacuate and those responding to the storm. Had LIPA never taken over from LILCO, however, a private utility company would have been faced with this precise dilemma, as were other private utility providers in the region on that day. The magnitude of the storm did not in any way generate a situation in which defendants' activities did more than substitute for or supplement a traditional private enterprise. Utility companies provide power not only when the sky is blue, but also during intense blizzards, thunderstorms, hurricanes, and other treacherous weather events. Superstorm Sandy may have been one of the more severe storms to hit New York, but preparing for it and reacting to it was a proprietary function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The fact that electrical services have traditionally been delivered through private enterprises and that the legislature supplanted privately-owned LILCO with publicly-owned LIPA for the sole purpose of ensuring the efficient delivery of electricity to LILCO's customer base leads to the conclusion that LIPA's decision not to withhold delivery of that commodity was unquestionably a proprietary act. The majority's suggestion that some as-yet-unknown fact may come to light at some future point in this litigation that might illuminate defendants' conduct, and transform LIPA's decision not to de-energize into a governmental action, has no grounding in law or the reality of public utility services. LIPA's decision to keep the lights on was not an exercise of the police power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Connolly v Long Is.
