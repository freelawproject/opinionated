This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} A few weeks after M.H., an adult, homosexual male, engaged in consensual, unprotected anal and oral intercourse with Boatright, M.H. developed persistent flu-like symptoms and went to an emergency room for treatment. Based upon his constellation of symptoms, M.H. was tested for, and ultimately diagnosed with, HIV. Boatright was also HIV positive; however, Boatright told M.H., prior to engaging in sexual conduct with M.H., that Boatright was negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Boatright was indicted on one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). Thereafter, a supplemental indictment was filed adding a charge of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(B)(1). That count alleged that Boatright knowingly engaged in sexual conduct with M.H. without disclosing to him, prior to engaging in sexual conduct, that Boatright had tested positive for HIV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Upon motion of the State, the first count, based upon R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), was dismissed. The matter proceeded to a jury trial on count two, at which the primary issue was whether Boatright knew, at the time he engaged in sexual conduct with M.H., that Boatright had tested positive for HIV. The jury found Boatright guilty, and the trial court sentenced Boatright to five years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Boatright has appealed, raising seven assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   R.C. 2903.11(B)(1) IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE AND/OR AS APPLIED TO MR.

In his third assignment of error, he asserts that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. Specifically, in both arguments, he asserts that the State presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate that, prior to engaging in sexual conduct with M.H., Boatright knew that he had tested positive for HIV.

A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\" Former R.C. 2901.22(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The record reflects that, prior to November 13, 2014, M.H. and Boatright were just friends and would text each other often. Because M.H. was having problems with his boyfriend and wanted to have \"fun,\" he contacted Boatright and went over to his house around 11 p.m. on November 13, 2014. The two had a few alcoholic drinks and watched TV. Boatright then asked M.H. to give him a massage. M.H. declined because he knew Boatright had a boyfriend. However, M.H. came to discover that Boatright and his boyfriend were having problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Shortly thereafter, M.H. left and went downtown, but, before long, returned to Boatright's house. Boatright began to make sexual advances and M.H. began to ask Boatright about his sexual history. Boatright indicated that he last had sex with someone in September 2014, was tested for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, shortly thereafter, and that the result \"was negative.\" After that discussion, the two engaged in unprotected, consensual anal and oral intercourse; Boatright penetrated M.H. orally and anally. Afterwards, M.H. went home and the two never engaged in sex again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} M.H. testified that, prior to that night, M.H.'s last HIV test was the summer of 2013, and it was negative. Approximately a week and a half after M.H. and Boatright had sex, M.H. began to develop flu-like symptoms. About a week after that, M.H. presented to an emergency room as he was still suffering from flu-like symptoms. Based upon his history and symptoms, doctors ordered an HIV test. Both the preliminary and confirmatory tests came back positive for HIV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} M.H. contacted Boatright while M.H. was waiting for his test results and told Boatright there was a possibility he gave M.H. HIV. Boatright again stated he was HIV negative and said he was sorry M.H. had to go through the situation. After M.H. got his results, he again spoke to Boatright. Boatright kept saying how sorry he was but never stated that he had been deceptive about his HIV status. However, at the end of their conversation, M.H. testified that Boatright stated, \"I'm sorry, man. I lied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After M.H. received his test results, he kept stating that he did not want to live life having HIV. In light of those statements, as a precaution, M.H. was admitted to a psychiatric unit for observation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 18} With respect to when Boatright had knowledge that he was infected with HIV, the State presented witnesses who worked at CSL Plasma and Summit County Public Health (\"Health Department\"). The testimony indicated that Boatright had been a plasma donor at CSL Plasma since 2008. The center manager of CSL Plasma, Joseph Jacko, testified that the company screens blood for HIV, hepatitis, other sexually transmitted diseases, and drugs of abuse. The initial testing is performed in Knoxville, Tennessee, and if the sample tests positive, it is sent for a confirmatory test at a different laboratory in North Carolina. If the sample tests positive for HIV, the donation associated with the sample would be destroyed and the state health department would be notified. He indicated that donors were paid between $20 and $50 for donating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} He further testified that, prior to donation, donors have to complete a questionnaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Some of those questions are designed to identify donors who engage in \"high risk activities.\" Donors who are determined to engage in high-risk activities are not allowed to donate. For example, if a male donor indicates that he has had sex with other men, he is disqualified from donating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Boatright donated plasma on August 22, 2011, and August 25, 2011. As part of the August 22, 2011 donation, Boatright indicated on the questionnaire that he was not in an increased risk group, and that he had not had sex with another man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The August 22, 2011 donation tested positive for HIV in the preliminary test on August 30, 2011, and that result was confirmed on September 2, 2011. CSL Plasma sent out a certified letter to Boatright on September 2, 2011, but it was returned. Additionally, Boatright was called on October 13, 2011, but there was no response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Leanne Beavers, the Assistant Director of Community Health with the Health Department, testified that Boatright's positive results were first entered into the Ohio Disease Reporting System on September 15, 2011. She testified that any positive HIV test is reported to the appropriate local health department. The Health Department's records indicate that, with respect to Boatright's positive HIV results, one of the Health Department's employees called Boatright on September 2, 2011, but there was no response, and a letter was mailed to him September 6, 2011. The letter, however, was returned indicating that there was no such address on that street. The records further indicate that Boatright was twice scheduled to come into the Health Department for an appointment, the purpose of which was to inform him of his HIV diagnosis and link him to care, but he did not show up for either appointment. When the employee attempted to reschedule again, the phone was not answered. After that, the case was closed. Ms. Beavers indicated that the policy of the Health Department was that employees were not allowed to give test results over the phone; instead, results had to be given to the individual at a face-to-face meeting. She also indicated that, prior to the in-person visit, the patient would only \"know that there's a problem\" and the patient needs to be seen \"face to face.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On December 12, 2012, Boatright returned to CSL Plasma and was counseled about his test results. Bonnie Chapman, who at the time was a registered nurse who worked for CSL Plasma, testified that she counseled Boatright. Specifically, she testified that CSL Plasma's policy for counseling donors who tested positive for HIV was that the donor would be brought into a room, the donor would be told about the positive HIV test, the person's address would be confirmed, he or she would be asked if the donor had engaged in sexual activity with any other donors, he or she would be informed that the donor can no longer donate, and the person would be told to go immediately to his or her health care provider for follow-up testing and care. Further, the donor would be given a form that states that the person tested positive for HIV and provides other relevant information; that form does not include personal identifying information for privacy reasons. That counseling session would be documented in an electronic record. Ms. Chapman then testified about her counseling session with Boatright on December 12, 2012, and the supporting electronic documentation. She confirmed that she told Boatright on December 12, 2012, that he was positive for HIV and gave him the appropriate form. Ms. Chapman testified that, from her recollection, when\n   she told Boatright he had tested positive for HIV, she was expecting a reaction but did not get one. Instead, he said, \"Okay; and he left.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Based on the evidence discussed above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Boatright's Crim.R. 29 motion, and also conclude that, when the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to the State, sufficient evidence was presented whereby a jury could reasonably conclude that Boatright knew that he had tested positive for HIV prior to engaging in sexual conduct with M.H. If believed, Ms. Chapman's testimony evidences that Boatright was told that he tested positive for HIV on December 12, 2012. Boatright engaged in sexual conduct with M.H. in November 2014. Prior to engaging in sexual conduct with M.H., Boatright did not inform M.H. that Boatright had tested positive for HIV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Boatright's second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IV\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR.

Specifically, he maintains that, with respect to the issue of his knowledge of the HIV test results, the defense testimony was more credible than the testimony presented by the State.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

He stated that he was an outreach worker. His responsibilities included counseling young people about the prevention and detection of HIV and also assisting newly diagnosed HIV patients with receiving treatment and care. The organization would also host community events to educate teenagers. Boatright testified that, once he started working there, he was regularly tested for HIV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Boatright testified that he began donating plasma in 2007 or 2008. He denied doing it for the money, and instead testified that he did it because the plasma was used to make medications. Boatright admitted to lying on the CSL Plasma questionnaire about his sexual history. He said he did so because he wanted to help people and did not think that his sexual orientation should prevent him from donating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Following his donations in August 2011, Boatright averred that he never received a letter or any phone call from the Health Department. When he returned to CSL Plasma on December 12, 2012, to donate again, he admits he was informed that he was unable to donate because of unsuitable test results. However, he maintained, that he was never told what the results were or why they were unsuitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   He believed that the unsuitable results could have been for any number of reasons, including too much protein in his blood. He indicated that he was never told by Ms. Chapman or anyone else at CSL Plasma that he was HIV positive, and he never received a form or a copy of a test result stating he was HIV positive. Boatright also testified that he never exhibited any symptoms typically associated with HIV since 2011. If he had been informed that he was HIV positive in 2011 or 2012, Boatright stated that he would have begun treatment at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Boatright admitted during his testimony that his partner, whom he was dating at the time he engaged in sexual conduct with M.H., tested positive for HIV in March 2013. The parties also entered into a stipulation with respect to this fact. Boatright stated that, after he learned of the diagnosis, the two men waited to have sex until after his boyfriend's viral load was undetectable and also used condoms. Boatright acknowledged that he lied to Mr. Osco when Boatright told Mr. Osco that his partner was negative for HIV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Boatright testified that he engaged in oral and anal intercourse with M.H. on November 13, 2014. He stated that he did not use a condom because he thought he was HIV negative. He acknowledged that he and M.H. discussed their respective HIV statuses that night. A couple of weeks later, M.H. contacted Boatright and told him that he needed to see a doctor as there was a possibility that he had HIV. After Boatright's at-home HIV test came back positive, he then went to the Health Department for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Mr. Osco, a registered nurse with the Health Department, testified that in December 2014, Boatright came to the Health Department and requested HIV testing because he was informed that one of his sexual contacts was hospitalized with an HIV diagnosis, and because the home test Boatright took thereafter was positive. Mr. Osco indicated that both Boatright's preliminary and confirmatory HIV tests were positive. Mr. Osco also discovered the prior 2011 positive result while researching Boatright in the Ohio Disease Reporting System. When Mr. Osco informed Boatright of the results in early 2015, Boatright became emotional and seemed very sincere. Boatright told Mr. Osco that he had been in a relationship for two years and the only other person he had sexual contact with was M.H. Boatright declined to name his partner, but indicated that he had told the partner about the possibility Boatright had HIV and his partner had thereafter tested negative. Mr. Osco testified that he informed Boatright of the prior positive result, and Boatright maintained that he was never contacted by anyone about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 34} After a thorough, independent review of the record, we conclude that the jury did not lose its way in finding Boatright guilty of felonious assault. The jury was presented with two competing views of the evidence. Ms. Chapman clearly testified that she informed Boatright in 2012 that he had tested positive for HIV. Boatright denied that he ever received that information and averred that he had no knowledge he had tested positive for HIV prior to engaging in sexual conduct with M.H. Boatright testified about his work in the community to prevent and educate people about HIV and AIDS and about his knowledge of the importance of testing and receiving prompt treatment. He also presented Mr. Osco's testimony, which, if believed, could evidence that Boatright was surprised by the HIV diagnosis in 2015. However, the jury also heard about the multiple instances in which Boatright lied. He lied on the CSL Plasma questionnaires and to Mr. Osco about Boatright's\n   partner's HIV status. Additionally, M.H. testified that, following his diagnosis, Boatright apologized for lying. \"This Court has consistently held that the trier of fact is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and resolve factual disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While the dictionary definition of the term was discussed, it did not appear that, after hearing that definition, defense counsel supported giving that definition either. After reading the dictionary definition, the trial court remarked that it was unsure\n   what that definition meant, and defense counsel commented that it \"[m]eans that the dictionary is written about as good as the law.\" Then near the end of the discussion, defense counsel stated that he didn't think the term needed to be defined. Thus, while the record is clear that defense counsel objected to the trial court's proposed version, it does not appear that defense counsel preserved an argument that the dictionary definition should have been given. Moreover, we cannot say that the dictionary definition advocated by Boatright on appeal and considered by the trial court at trial is clear given that it repeatedly uses the word knowledge in defining knowledge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Instead, the trial court instructed the jury on knowledge as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Since you cannot look into the mind of another, knowledge is determined from all the facts and circumstances in evidence.
