For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2000, authorities investigated Greathouse for sexually abusing A.D., a nine-year-old foster child who was residing with Greathouse's mother at the time. The investigation began when A.D. told her school counselor that Greathouse was sexually abusing her. Matthew Hudak of the Barberton Police Department was the primary detective assigned to the case. Following an investigation into the matter, the State elected not to file criminal charges against Greathouse at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In March 2013, M.S., a 13-year-old girl, disclosed to her mother that she was being sexually abused by Greathouse, who was her mother's boyfriend at the time. M.S.'s mother simultaneously learned that M.S. had been cutting herself due to the trauma caused by the abuse. M.S.'s mother ultimately took M.S. to the Akron Children's Hospital emergency room to treat her lacerations. While M.S. was being treated for her wounds, M.S.'s mother informed Deputy Matthew Petroc of the Summit County Sheriff's Office that her daughter was cutting herself because Greathouse had been sexually abusing her since she was eight years old. Deputy Petroc filed a report and referred the matter to the detective bureau for further investigation. The hospital staff also referred the matter to Summit County Children Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The detective bureau referred M.S.'s case to Detective Joseph Storad, who subsequently interviewed Greathouse about M.S.'s accusations. Greathouse denied ever sexually abusing M.S., but acknowledged that M.S. was an honest individual who did not lie. During the course of the interview, Greathouse informed Detective Storad that he was previously accused of sexually abusing another child, A.D., approximately 13 years prior. Following his interview with Greathouse, Detective Storad retrieved the old police report concerning A.D.'s allegations against Greathouse. Detective Storad then met with A.D., who is now an adult, and listened as she described being sexually abused by Greathouse when she was a child. Detective Storad and A.D. later met with an assistant prosecutor with the Summit County Prosecutor's Office to discuss this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 9, 2013, the Summit County Grand Jury returned a no bill, refusing to indict Greathouse on one count of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition. However, the State resubmitted the case to the Grand Jury with additional charges. Consequently, on May 30, 2013, the Summit County Grand Jury returned a secret indictment charging Greathouse with seven counts of rape,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of sexual battery, five counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of illegal use of a minor in\n   nudity-oriented material or performance. Greathouse pleaded not guilty to the charges and the matter proceeded through the pretrial phase. The State ultimately dismissed the one count of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance charge prior to trial. On July 31, 2013, Greathouse filed a motion sever Count One of the indictment from Counts Two through Fourteen, to which the State responded in opposition. The trial court held a hearing on Greathouse's motion to sever before ultimately denying it. On August 7, 2013, Greathouse signed a waiver of his speedy trial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 17, 2015, the first day of trial, Greathouse filed a \"motion dismiss indictment or severe [sic] Count One from trial.\" The trial court addressed and denied Greathouse's motion in a pretrial conference. The matter then proceeded to a jury trial, wherein the State called 12 witnesses to testify on its behalf and Greathouse called six witnesses on his behalf. At the close of evidence, the jury found Greathouse guilty of all counts. The trial court subsequently sentenced Greathouse according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Greathouse filed this timely appeal and raises three assignments of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The Appellant's due process rights were violated where the State of Ohio engaged in behavior that caused a prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Greathouse argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss Count One of the indictment. Specifically, Greathouse argues that the State violated his due process rights by waiting approximately 13 years to charge him for raping A.D. Greathouse contends that the 13-year delay prejudiced him because \"the memories of the parties involved in the investigation became diminished,\" his mother, who possessed key information, had passed away, and the doctor who examined A.D. in 2000 could not be located for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We note at the outset that Greathouse neither raised the issue of pre-indictment delay, nor asserted a violation of his due process rights in the trial court. Thus, as Greathouse raises the issue of pre-indictment delay for the first time on appeal, he has forfeited all arguments with respect to this issue but for that of plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For an error to be a \"plain error\" under Crim.R. 52(B), it must satisfy three prongs: (1) there must be an error, meaning a deviation from a legal rule; (2) the error must be \"plain,\" meaning an \"obvious\" defect in the trial proceedings; and (3) the error must have affected \"substantial rights,\" meaning the error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A review of the record indicates that Greathouse questioned in his motion to dismiss whether the State, in securing an indictment against him following an initial \"no bill,\" either misled the Grand Jury about the\n   evidence or failed to disclose exculpatory evidence during the grand jury proceedings in violation of his due process rights. The transcript from the hearing on Greathouse's motion to dismiss reveals that the hearing was strictly limited to the issue raised in Greathouse's motion. As such, because Greathouse failed to create a record in the trial court addressing the issue of pre-indictment delay, we cannot say, based on the face of the record, that any action taken below amounted to an obvious defect in the proceedings. Thus, we conclude based upon the record before us that the pre-indictment delay in this matter does not rise to the level of plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, Greathouse argues that the State violated his due process rights by failing to preserve a prescription dated September 30, 2000, that is purportedly signed by the doctor who examined A.D. following her allegations against him. The prescription states that there was no evidence of physical genital abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects a criminal defendant from being convicted when the State either fails to preserve materially exculpatory evidence or destroys, in bad faith, potentially useful evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There is no question that the doctor's prescription was preserved, as the original script was discovered amongst Greathouse's mother's personal effects and a copy of the script was located within the case file stored with the Barberton Police Department. Rather, the crux of Greathouse's argument concerns the fact that the investigating detectives never forwarded the prescription to the prosecutor's office and that it was never disclosed to the defense prior to trial. The prescription only came to light when Greathouse discovered the original by chance while sifting through his deceased mother's journal just six weeks before trial. Thus, we conclude the facts of this case implicate suppression or disclosure of potentially useful evidence rather than preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, this Court does not review this assignment of error under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), because Greathouse has failed to make that argument on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} To the extent that Greathouse argues that the State failed to preserve the doctor's prescription in violation of his due process rights, we disagree. It is undisputed that the prosecution was unaware of the existence of the doctor's prescription until defense counsel brought it to their attention on the first day of trial. In his appellate brief, Greathouse contends that certain law enforcement personnel acted in bad faith in this matter. Namely, Greathouse asserts that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   either Detective Hudak removed the copy of the prescription sheet with [the doctor's] diagnosis before faxing [the contents of the case file] to Detective Storad or that Detective Storad removed [the prescription] before turning the report over to the prosecutor's office. In any event, it is evident that one of those two police officers engaged in behavior that was designed to prevent [Greathouse] from gaining access to very useful information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, when the parties addressed this issue below, Greathouse's trial counsel emphasized that the defense was not accusing Detective Storad, Detective Hudak, or the prosecuting attorneys of \"anything improper.\" Rather, the defense was only questioning Detective Hudak's \"thoroughness in submitting the entire file to Detective Storad.\" Thus, on this basis alone, we reject Greathouse's argument on appeal that Detective Storad and/or Detective Hudak acted in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, Greathouse argued that rather than considering the merits of each individual case, the jury would feel compelled to convict him on all counts merely because two young victims were accusing him of similar crimes. Thus, Greathouse contested his indictment pursuant to Crim.R. 14 and he was therefore required to renew his motion to sever at the close of evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
