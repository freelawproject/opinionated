The vehicle was stopped at an early morning hour after traveling at a high rate of speed and disregarding a stop sign and traffic light in a high crime area known for \"arrests for drugs and violence.\" The defendant, who was the front-seat passenger, and the individual who was behind the defendant in the back (back-seat passenger) both failed to raise their hands when initially asked to do so, and an officer had to make a second command before the defendant and the back-seat passenger complied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Critically, the defendant's leg movements suggested that he was moving some unknown object underneath his seat.

Here, the totality of the circumstances described above provided adequate specific and articulable facts to warrant a protective search of the vehicle, where, in anticipation of allowing the occupants to return to the vehicle, there was a concern about what was inside it based on the defendant's movements.

The search also was proportional. The officer looked in the vehicle and shined his flashlight, whereupon he saw the backpack with an open pocket and ammunition visible. He then removed the backpack and located the firearm. In these circumstances, the motion to suppress was correctly denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </em>\n   .

The defendant's movements as described and demonstrated by officers at trial tip the scale. Although the firearm was in a closed pocket of the bag, the jury could have inferred that the defendant was aware of the backpack's contents and attempted to conceal the items, based on his failure to place his hands in the air upon instruction and his attempt to kick the backpack out of view.
