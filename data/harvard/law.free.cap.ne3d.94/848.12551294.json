L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, from an order of the Board of Registration in Nursing (board) indefinitely suspending her nursing license. The grounds for the suspension were that Vilbon had not satisfied the educational requirements for licensure in Massachusetts and that she had engaged in deceptive conduct to obtain a license. While the matter was pending before the single justice, the board reconsidered and withdrew its finding that Vilbon had engaged in deceptive conduct, acknowledging that it had erred in making this finding. In addition, Vilbon remedied the deficiencies in her education. The board therefore reinstated her license. Vilbon now argues that, despite the reinstatement of her license, she has suffered further harm for which the board should\n     compensate her and that sanctions should be imposed on the executive director of the board. However, under the \"plain and unambiguous language of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64,\"\n     <em>\n      Hoffer\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Board of Reg. in Medicine\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273048\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/451/#p456\">\n      461 Mass. 451\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 456,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20N.E.2d%20575\">\n      961 N.E.2d 575\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2012), our authority is limited to \"revising or reversing the decision of the board\" suspending her license. The statute does not provide for any further relief. As Vilbon has received all the relief that is available under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, the single justice properly dismissed the matter as moot.
