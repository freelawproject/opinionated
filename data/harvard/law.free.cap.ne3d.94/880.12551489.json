See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (heroin); G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (cocaine).

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . The police obtained a warrant to search \"the premises\" of the defendant's grandparents' home on General Patton Drive in Hyannis. The defendant argues that the search of two vehicles parked on a second driveway on the property, leading to the discovery of cocaine and heroin, was outside of the scope of the search warrant and therefore improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   When considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, we must accept the motion judge's subsidiary findings of fact, absent clear error. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269539\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/295/#p298\">\n    458 Mass. 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (2010).

The driveway where the vehicles were parked was adjacent to the home, with a visible path leading to a screened in gazebo between the house and the driveway. The driveway extended from General Patton Drive back to a storage shed also on the property. There was no fence within the property separating the house from the driveway, although a fence and shrubbery separated the entire property from the next residence.

Additionally, the vehicles on the driveway were close to the house; the truck was located approximately twenty-five to thirty feet from the side door of the house, and the Marquis was no more than forty feet from the door.

Officers extensively surveilled the defendant between January and April, 2013, and routinely observed him stopping at his grandparents' house on General Patton Drive, usually multiple times per day during the three-month surveillance period, often staying for just minutes at a time and sometimes standing in the yard or walking behind the truck and the shed and porch area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this alone would be insufficient to find that he possessed the cocaine and heroin on the property, several plus factors tip the analysis in the Commonwealth's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The fact finder would be warranted in finding that the defendant was engaged in a sophisticated drug operation involving residences on both West Main Street and General Patton Drive, where the defendant returned to the General Patton address to regenerate his supply, and that the contraband located during the execution of the search warrant was within the defendant's possession.

Upon the execution of the search warrant at the defendant's West Main Street apartment, police discovered a narcotic cutting agent, two digital scales, two c-clamps, a homemade press for cocaine, and a cellular telephone (cell phone). The defendant was searched outside of the apartment, and officers uncovered $1,300 in cash and two additional cell phones on his person.

Also in the same room was mail addressed to the defendant. It was during the search of the vehicles parked on the second driveway at the General Patton address that police found the heroin and cocaine that are the bases for the defendant's convictions. Officers discovered in the wheel base of a truck a plastic bag containing other small bags containing heroin, and in the trunk of a car discovered a white tied bag of cocaine inside of a plastic bag inside of a shoebox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The evidence, taken as a whole, permits the inference that the defendant had constructive possession of the cocaine and heroin; \"while each additional incriminatory or 'plus' factor taken alone may vary in terms of persuasive force, 'when combined ...
