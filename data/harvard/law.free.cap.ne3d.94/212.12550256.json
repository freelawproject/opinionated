Murray, appeals his convictions of first-degree murder ( 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 2012) ) and unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member ( 720 ILCS 5/24-1.8(a)(1) (West 2012) ), following a jury trial in the circuit court of Boone County. We affirm as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On July 19, 2013, a Boone County grand jury returned a three-count amended indictment charging defendant with first-degree murder in connection with the April 21, 2013, shooting death of Richard J. Herman in Belvidere, Illinois (count I), aggravated unlawful use of a weapon ( 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A), (d) (West 2012) ) (count II), and unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member (count III). The jury convicted defendant of all three offenses. The jury also found that defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offenses. The court merged count II into count III and sentenced defendant to an aggregate of 60 years' incarceration in the Illinois Department of Corrections. The following evidence relevant to the issues in this appeal was adduced at trial. We will augment our discussion of the evidence where necessary in the analysis portion of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 A. Defendant's Gang Affiliation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State introduced defendant's gang affiliation to show the motive for Herman's murder. The State argued that defendant facilitated the shooting when he handed the murder weapon to Marco \"Wacko\" Hernandez, who shot Herman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Officer David Dammon of the Belvidere police department testified for the State as an expert on gang activity. He testified that defendant was a member of the Latin Kings street gang. He based his opinion on his personal experience with defendant, information in the police department's gang database, defendant's association with other known Latin Kings, defendant's use of gang signs, and defendant's mode of dress. According to Dammon, Hernandez was also a member of the Latin Kings but was so low in the hierarchy that he would not be permitted by the gang to carry a gun. Dammon detailed the criminal nature of street gangs in general and the Latin Kings in particular. Dammon further testified, without objection, that the Latin Kings are an organized street gang as defined by statute. See 740 ILCS 147/10 (West 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 B. The Shooting of Richard Herman\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 On April 21, 2013, defendant attended a birthday party at the home of Mallek Sanchez in Belvidere. Sanchez was a \"higher-up\" in the Latin Kings. Hernandez was also at the party. Defendant and Hernandez left the party and walked to a nearby Shell gas station to buy beer and a cigar. Max Cox, who was a member of the rival gang the Surenos 13, and Herman, Cox's companion, were at the Shell station. Cox was prepaying for gas, and Herman was at the coolers buying beer. Cox and defendant knew each other, as Cox had previously sold cannabis to defendant. Hernandez had a recent confrontation with Cox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 1. Cox's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 At approximately 6:30 p.m. on April 21, 2013, Cox parked his car next to pump No. 5 at the Shell station, and he and Herman went inside the store. Defendant and Hernandez were in the store. Herman waved Cox to his location by the coolers and told Cox something about Hernandez. Then Cox prepaid for gas, Herman paid for a case of beer, and they left the store. Herman placed the beer in the back passenger seat of Cox's car, taking out a can for himself. Cox was on the driver's side of the car, pumping gas, when he saw defendant and Hernandez walking toward him. Defendant stopped at his front bumper, and Hernandez stopped 10 or 15 feet from the front bumper. Hernandez was yelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 Defendant asked Cox if he was \"gang banging,\" meaning was Cox \"hanging out\" with the Surenos 13. Cox said no. Defendant accused Cox of lying. Then defendant lifted his shirt and exposed a gun on his left side. Cox described the gun as \"black, square, decent size.\" Defendant then covered the gun with his shirt again. Hernandez stepped in front of defendant, stepped away, and put a \"pistol\" behind his back. Then Hernandez began arguing with Herman. Cox told Herman to shut up, that Hernandez had a gun. Then Hernandez pulled out the pistol, ran up to Herman, and shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 On cross-examination, Cox testified that defendant was at least 10 feet away from him during the incident. Cox testified\n   that he did not see the exchange of the gun from defendant to Hernandez. Cox agreed that he did not know whether defendant handed the gun to Hernandez or whether Hernandez grabbed it. According to Cox, the entire incident took approximately a minute and a half.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 2. Dan Arevalo's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 Dan Arevalo was the cashier at the Shell station on the evening of April 21, 2013. He looked out the window and saw Cox pumping gas. He also saw Herman and defendant arguing. He did not see Hernandez. Arevalo attended to some customers, and when he looked outside again a few seconds later, he saw Hernandez at the passenger side of Cox's car. Arevalo testified that Hernandez was running toward Herman, reaching for a gun from behind his back. He saw Hernandez point the gun at Herman, at which time Arevalo \"backed away.\" Arevalo heard a shot. He immediately called 911. When Arevalo next looked outside, he saw defendant and Hernandez running away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 3. Gerald Keeney's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 On the evening of April 21, 2013, Keeney stopped at the Shell station to buy lottery tickets. He sat in his pickup, scratching his tickets on the center console, when he heard people arguing. He saw two white men (presumably Cox and Herman) at a gas pump. The next thing Keeney heard was a gunshot. He ducked down. When he looked out again, he saw a black man waving a gun. Keeney ducked down again. The next time he looked out, he saw the black man and a Hispanic man running toward the back of the station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 C. The Crime Scene and Investigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 A woman flagged down police officer Jeremy Bell and told him that she saw two people running through an alley. Bell searched the area, but he did not locate anyone. Sergeant Shane Woody responded to the scene and saw Herman lying face-up on the pavement near pump No. 5. He noted a bullet hole in Herman's chest. Herman was transported to a Rockford hospital, where he died at approximately 7 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 19 Illinois State Police investigator Rebecca Hooks processed the scene for evidence. Arevalo turned over a Shell station surveillance video to Dammon. Dammon recognized defendant on the video, but he did not recognize Hernandez. Cox and Arevalo each identified defendant from a photo lineup, and they later identified Hernandez as the shooter, from a second photo lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 20 Dr. Larry Blum, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on Herman. Dr. Blum testified that the bullet caused Herman's left lung to collapse and then exited his back. Herman died of hemorrhagic shock due to a gunshot wound to the chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 21 After the murder, defendant moved among various addresses in Harvard, Rockford, and Freeport, and he was considered by the police to be a fugitive. Defendant's wandering was aided by another Latin King, Anthony Perez. In late April 2013, the Belvidere police enlisted the help of the United States Marshals to apprehend defendant. On May 9, 2013, the police and the marshals executed a search warrant at Perez's mother's apartment in Winnebago County. The police recovered a state-issued ID card for defendant, mail belonging to Perez, drug paraphernalia, cannabis, two firearms, and ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 22 On the top shelf of the bedroom closet, the police found a Glock gun case. Inside the gun case were a black Glock Model 30 pistol, two magazines, and a magazine motor. Later, a forensic test determined that the Glock was used to kill Herman. Perez's fingerprints were found\n   on the gun's slide, but there was no DNA on the gun that was suitable for analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 23 On May 10, 2013, police officers searched a residence at 925 11th Street in Rockford. They observed a woman trying to get into the house. She was placed in custody and identified as Heather Swanson, defendant's girlfriend. While placing Swanson in custody, the officers heard a \"crash\" in some bushes north of the property. The officers jumped over a chain link fence and arrested defendant, who was lying in the bushes. Defendant stated: \"Yeah, I know I'm wanted. I was going to turn myself in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 24 The police seized defendant's cell phone. Two videos recorded approximately two hours before the shooting showed (1) Perez urinating on a building in Belvidere that bore Surenos 13 gang graffiti and (2) defendant \"throwing up\" a Latin Kings sign while Perez \"threw down\" a Surenos 13 sign and said \"13 killer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 25 D. Additional Trial Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 26 1. Swanson's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 27 The State called Swanson in its case-in-chief. Swanson testified that she was in jail on the evening of the murder. She spoke on the phone with defendant that night, and she later saw him in early May 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 28 The prosecutor asked Swanson what defendant told her about what happened at the Shell station. Swanson testified: \"There was an argument and * * * his friend shot somebody.\" Swanson testified that she knew that Cox was also at the Shell station. The prosecutor then asked her the following question: \"So what, if anything, did [defendant] tell you about what [Cox] was doing at the Shell station?\" Swanson replied that she did not know \"specifically.\" The prosecutor then asked what defendant told her about \"the gun.\" She answered: \"He didn't tell me anything.\" The prosecutor asked the same question again, and Swanson testified: \"[Defendant told me that] [Hernandez] shot the guy that was at the gas station.\" The prosecutor then asked: \"What, if anything, did [defendant] tell you about where that gun came from-about where he got it from?\" Swanson testified: \"He didn't.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 29 The prosecutor then asked if Swanson recalled telling the police that defendant \"said he pulled the gun out of his belt and gave it to [Hernandez].\" She admitted that she told that to the police. The prosecutor next asked Swanson whether she told the police that defendant said that Hernandez shot Herman after defendant gave Hernandez the gun. Swanson said, \"I think so, yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 30 Swanson testified that defendant told her that he was with Hernandez after the shooting. Defendant also told her that Perez was arrested with a \"bunch of guns,\" so she assumed that Perez had the murder weapon. Swanson then agreed that she told the police that defendant told her that the gun was at Perez's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 31 On cross-examination, Swanson testified that she had felt \"threatened\" by the police when they questioned her after she and defendant were arrested. She testified that she specifically was \"scared\" of Dammon and that this caused her to tell the police untruths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 32 2. Richard Hobson's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 33 Richard Hobson testified as an expert on armed gunmen's characteristics. A former Washington D.C. police officer, he was professionally trained, and taught courses, on the detection and recovery of firearms. Hobson viewed the surveillance video from the Shell station from the evening of the murder. He had been informed that the gun in question was a Glock Model 30 .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. Based upon certain characteristics that defendant\n   displayed inside the store that evening, Hobson opined that defendant was carrying a firearm concealed on his left side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 34 3. Defendant's Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 35 Following the court's denial of his motion for a directed verdict, defendant testified on his own behalf. Prior to trial, the court had ruled that the State could use defendant's prior conviction of felony obstruction of justice to impeach him if he testified. The court barred the State from using defendant's prior conviction of aggravated battery for impeachment purposes, ruling that it was too prejudicial. Nonetheless, under defense counsel's questioning, defendant testified that he had previously been convicted of obstruction of justice, aggravated battery, and attempted obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor. Defendant testified that he was no longer a member of the Latin Kings. He also testified that members of the Belvidere Latin Kings did not carry firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 36 Defendant testified that Hernandez pointed at Cox's car at the Shell station. Defendant knew that Hernandez and Cox had a recent confrontation. Then, Hernandez showed defendant a pistol. Defendant took the pistol, thinking that he did not want \"anything bad\" to happen to Cox and that, because there were probably cameras \"everywhere,\" it would be \"stupid\" to display a gun. Defendant put the gun in his pocket, and he told Hernandez that he would \"handle it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 37 Defendant testified that Cox and Herman came out of the store. Defendant walked toward Cox and \"confronted him.\" Defendant asked Cox if he was \"gang banging to try to chase [Hernandez].\" Cox said \"no.\" At that time, Hernandez and Herman were arguing and yelling. Thirty seconds into defendant's conversation with Cox, he felt the gun being \"yanked\" from his pocket. Then defendant saw Hernandez put the gun behind his back. Hernandez ran toward Herman and shot him. Defendant panicked and fled the scene. He did not go to the police, because he was afraid of reprisals from the Latin Kings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 38 After defendant testified, he rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 39 4. The State's Rebuttal and Closing Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 40 In rebuttal, Maria Ledesma testified that she bought a Glock Model 30 .45-caliber pistol in Belvidere in 2012, while she was dating Perez. She did not know Hernandez. The State also introduced photos depicting defendant with various firearms, including a Glock pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 41 In his rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor argued that Swanson told the truth when she admitted that she told the police that defendant told her that he gave the gun to Hernandez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 42 E. Sentencing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 43 The trial court denied defendant's posttrial motion and proceeded to sentencing. Herman's mother read a victim impact statement, and the prosecutor read statements from Herman's children. In allocution, defendant remarked only that there were no African Americans on the jury. The court found that defendant displayed \"no remorse over what [is] an otherwise senseless act.\" The court sentenced defendant to 50 years' incarceration for first degree murder, merged the weapons charges, and sentenced defendant to 10 years' incarceration for unlawful possession of a firearm by a gang member. The court denied defendant's motion to reconsider the sentence, and he filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 44 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 45 Defendant raises the following eight issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 46 A. Reasonable Doubt of Murder\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 47 Defendant first argues that the State did not prove that he was accountable for Herman's murder. In assessing whether the evidence was sufficient to prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the reviewing court must determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    People v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"243906\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/186/439/#p445\">\n    186 Ill. 2d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Ill.%20Dec.%20604\">\n    238 Ill.Dec. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=712%20N.E.2d%20326\">\n    712 N.E.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). A conviction should not be reversed unless the proof is so improbable or unsatisfactory that a reasonable doubt exists about the defendant's guilt.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"243906\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/186/439/#p445\">\n    186 Ill. 2d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Ill.%20Dec.%20604\">\n    238 Ill.Dec. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=712%20N.E.2d%20326\">\n    712 N.E.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A defendant commits first-degree murder when, in performing the acts that cause the death of an individual, he knows that such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual or another. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 2012). A defendant is legally accountable for the actions of another when, either before or during the commission of an offense, and with the intent to promote or facilitate such commission, he or she \"solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid that other person in the planning or commission of the offense.\" 720 ILCS 5/5-2(c) (West 2012); see\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"243906\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/186/439/#p445\">\n    186 Ill. 2d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20Ill.%20Dec.%20604\">\n    238 Ill.Dec. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=712%20N.E.2d%20326\">\n    712 N.E.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To prove intent to promote or facilitate the commission of an offense, the State must establish that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal or that there was a common criminal design.\n   <em>\n    People v.

Defendant asserts that their \"largely consistent\" versions do not establish that he gave Hernandez the gun knowing that Hernandez was going to kill Herman. Defendant also maintains that the accounts do not establish that he and Hernandez shared a common design to kill Herman. By focusing solely on his and Cox's accounts, while ignoring the totality of the State's evidence, defendant distorts the picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 49 Defendant and Hernandez, who were Latin Kings, were rivals of Cox, who belonged to the Surenos 13. Approximately two hours before the shooting, defendant and Perez, another Latin King, were recorded displaying gang signs and doing other acts that were disrespectful of the Surenos 13. On the video, Perez intoned \"13 killer.\" Inside the Shell station's store, Hernandez called defendant's attention to Cox's presence. Defendant knew that Hernandez and Cox had a recent confrontation. In Hobson's expert opinion, defendant was armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 50 Outside the store, both defendant and Hernandez initiated a gang fight with Cox and Herman. After defendant and Hernandez left the store, defendant approached Cox and demanded to know if Cox was \"gang banging.\" Defendant lifted up his shirt to display a gun. Hernandez and Herman were arguing. Earlier, Arevalo witnessed defendant arguing with Herman. Hernandez obtained the gun from defendant, without a struggle or a word, and shot Herman. Keeney immediately saw a black man waving the gun. The only black man at the scene was defendant. Defendant and Hernandez fled together, and the police recovered the murder weapon from Perez's apartment, where they also discovered defendant's photo\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20501\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Supporting the State's theory that defendant, rather than Hernandez, brought the gun to the scene was Ledesma's rebuttal testimony that she bought a Glock Model 30 .45-caliber handgun while she was dating Perez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant hid out in a series of locations until the police arrested him lying in some bushes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 51 Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not itself make a person accountable, but it is a factor that can be considered, together with other circumstances, to determine accountability.\n   <em>\n    Jaimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20121368\">\n    2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20Ill.%20Dec.%20738\">\n    386 Ill.Dec. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%20501\">\n    21 N.E.3d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In essence, the State theorized that when Hernandez shot Herman, defendant was equally responsible, because the shooting was done in furtherance of the common criminal design to\n   inflict violence. In closing argument, the prosecutor argued the common-criminal-design rule when he highlighted that defendant was \"looking to start a gang fight on the day of the murder.\" The prosecutor stated that defendant went to the Shell station armed with the Glock because he intended \"unlawfully to use it.\" The prosecutor emphasized that defendant was \"hanging out\" with other members of the Latin Kings that day and that he filmed Perez saying \"13 killers.\" The prosecutor argued that when defendant and Hernandez encountered Cox, a member of the Surenos 13, at the Shell station, defendant \"promoted\" the gang fight that led to Herman's murder. The prosecutor reminded the jury that Arevalo saw defendant and Herman arguing and that defendant accused Cox of gang banging before he displayed the gun to Cox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 62 Under this theory, which was overwhelmingly substantiated by the totality of the evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   it would not matter whether Hernandez grabbed the gun from defendant or defendant gave him the gun. When Hernandez saw Cox's car parked at pump No. 5, he pointed it out to defendant. Defendant knew that Cox and Hernandez had a recent gang-related encounter. Inside the Shell station's store, Herman told Cox \"something\" about Hernandez. Defendant testified that Hernandez looked a certain way at Herman and Cox while they were all inside the store. Then, outside, defendant engaged Herman and then Cox in a verbal gang quarrel, displaying his gun to Cox, while Hernandez joined by arguing with Herman. At that point, Hernandez and defendant were jointly engaged in provoking gang violence. Defendant displayed his gun to Cox, sending the message that he was prepared to use it. Cox understood this, because after Hernandez got the gun, Cox told Herman to shut up. Hernandez stepped next to defendant, and the gun passed between them without a fight or a protest from defendant. Then Hernandez shot Herman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 63 Where one aids another in the planning or commission of an offense, he is legally accountable for the conduct of the person he aids, and the word \"conduct\" encompasses any criminal act done in furtherance of the planned and intended act.\n   <em>\n    People v.

Defendant was convicted of felony obstruction of justice in 2011 and aggravated battery in 2012.

Nevertheless, we need not decide whether counsel's performance was deficient, because defendant cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced. As noted, the totality of the evidence overwhelmingly proved defendant's guilt. When defendant took the witness stand, the jury already knew that he was a member of the Latin Kings and that the Latin Kings organization financed itself through crime. The jury had already heard from Hobson that defendant came to the Shell station armed. Through Cox's testimony, the jury knew that defendant picked the fight and displayed the gun. Keeney told the jury that defendant was waving the gun immediately after the shooting. The jury also knew that defendant and Hernandez fled the scene in tandem and that defendant hid from the police with the assistance of other members of the Latin Kings. The jury heard defendant's testimony and could reasonably have rejected it. Consequently, we determine that there is no reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the jury not been exposed to defendant's prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 73 D.

As discussed above, the evidence was not closely balanced. Further, the prosecutor's improper comments were not repeated, and the jury was instructed to consider prior inconsistent statements only as affecting the weight of the witness's testimony. Consequently, the comments did not render the trial unfair under the second prong of the plain-error analysis.

Defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member in violation of section 24-1.8(a)(1) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (Code) ( 720 ILCS 5/24-1.8(a)(1) (West 2012) ).

Dammon explained the Latin Kings' and Surenos 13's histories, hierarchies, structures, symbols, signs, dress, and tattoos. Dammon testified that \"gang banging\" occurs when members are doing actual gang work, such as committing crimes for the prosperity or benefit of the gang, rather than \"hanging out.\" According to Dammon, guns are very important to gangs, as gangs' primary income is from drug sales. He testified that gangs need weapons to protect their drugs, cash, and members from rival gangs. Dammon explained that \"gang banging\" also means fighting rival gangs, \"as well as intimidation of people. Anything to benefit the gang itself.\" Dammon opined, without objection, that the Latin Kings are a street gang as defined by Illinois law.

Here, Dammon testified to the organizational structure of street gangs in general, and the Latin Kings in particular, and he opined that the Latin Kings are a street gang within the meaning of Illinois law. That opinion alone was sufficient to establish the element that the Latin Kings are a street gang. Further, Dammon testified in the present tense that gangs use guns to protect their drugs, cash, and members from rival gangs and that members do whatever is needed to benefit the gang, including intimidation of people. We believe that the jury could have reasonably inferred from Dammon's testimony that the Latin Kings historically and currently commit felonies.

An abuse of discretion occurs when a sentence is greatly at variance with the spirit and purpose of the law or manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offense.\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20101132\">\n    2012 IL App (2d) 101132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20Ill.%20Dec.%20383\">\n    361 Ill.Dec. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20N.E.2d%2038\">\n    971 N.E.2d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 91 The sentencing range for first-degree murder is 20 to 60 years' incarceration. 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-20(a) (West 2012). Because the jury found that defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense, a mandatory 15-year enhancement applied. 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(i) (West 2012). A conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member carries a range of incarceration from 3 to 10 years. 720 ILCS 5/24-1.8(b) (West 2012). Here, the court sentenced defendant to 35 years' imprisonment for first-degree murder, and then added the mandatory 15-year enhancement. As noted, the court merged the conviction of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon into the conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member, and sentenced defendant to a consecutive 10 years' incarceration on that charge. Thus, the aggregate sentence was within statutory limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 92 Nevertheless, defendant maintains that the sentence was an abuse of discretion because of his youth and rehabilitative potential. Defendant was 21 years old at the time of the murder. He had been adjudicated delinquent for residential burglary and sentenced to the Illinois Department of Corrections, juvenile division. As an adult, defendant had convictions of driving under the influence, felony obstruction of justice (for which he was sentenced to one year of incarceration), misdemeanor attempted obstruction of justice, and aggravated battery. Defendant was unemployed and was a member of a street gang. At sentencing, he expressed no remorse or regret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 93 Although defendant downplays his participation in Herman's murder, the jury rejected his version of the event. The evidence showed that defendant went to the Shell station armed and then instigated the confrontation with Cox. Defendant intimidated Cox by accusing him of gang banging and by displaying the gun in his belt. Immediately after the shooting, defendant was waving the gun, and then he and Hernandez fled. For the next three weeks, defendant was a fugitive. Killing Herman was no act of youthful derring-do. It was, as the court noted, a senseless killing. As the videos taken from defendant's phone depict, defendant was a dedicated\n   street gang member. The act, defendant's criminal history, and his lack of remorse show little, if any, rehabilitative potential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 94 Defendant also argues that his sentence was excessive as compared to Hernandez's sentence, because (1) Hernandez was eligible for a greater sentence than defendant, as he was subject to a mandatory 25-year enhancement for his first-degree murder conviction, and, (2) as a mere accomplice, defendant should receive a lesser sentence than the shooter. Hernandez was sentenced to a 55-year term of incarceration for first-degree murder with a consecutive 5-year term for unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20141104-U\">\n    2017 IL App (2d) 141104-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16. Defendant asserts that Hernandez grabbed the gun from defendant, who was acting as a peacemaker. As noted, the jury reasonably rejected that scenario. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that defendant was the only one who was initially armed and that he was the prime aggressor. Accordingly, for all of the above reasons, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to an aggregate term of 60 years' incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 95 H. Additional Credit Against the Sentence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 96 Finally, defendant contends that he is entitled to an additional two days of credit against his sentence. The mittimus reflects a credit of 731 days. According to defendant, that figure was a miscalculation, as he spent 733 days in custody awaiting trial. The State concedes this argument. Accordingly, we correct the mittimus to reflect a credit of 733 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 97 III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 98 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Boone County is affirmed as modified.
