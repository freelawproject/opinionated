The husband also appeals from the denial of several postjudgment motions. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The parties were married on February 1, 2013. Five days later, on February 6, 2013, the parties' daughter was born. The wife also had two children from a prior marriage, while the husband had four children from a prior marriage. On June 19, 2015, the wife and the parties' child moved out of the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On June 23, 2015, the husband, acting pro se, initiated custody proceedings in the Probate and Family Court and moved for emergency custody of the parties' child. In his emergency motion for custody, the husband alleged that he was \"very concerned\" about the child's well-being, because the wife was acting \"unstable,\" was not \"thinking clearly,\" and was not \"of sound mind.\" Following an ex parte hearing on June 23, 2015, a judge (motion judge) allowed the husband's emergency motion, granting him temporary sole legal and physical custody of the child and scheduling a second hearing for July 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the following day, June 24, 2015, the Probate and Family Court docketed the wife's pro se complaint for divorce, which was dated June 22, 2015. In the complaint for divorce, the wife requested custody of the parties' child, and alleged that the husband \"ha[d] been mentally and verbally abusive\" to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 2, 2015, the husband, now represented by counsel, appeared before a different judge (divorce judge) for a second hearing on his emergency motion for custody. The wife was not present at the July 2, 2015, hearing. On the same day, the divorce judge issued a temporary order leaving the June 23, 2015, order in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 6, 2015, the wife filed a pro se motion seeking temporary custody of the parties' child. On July 27, 2015, now represented by counsel as well, the wife filed a motion seeking to vacate the temporary orders entered on June 23 and July 2, 2015. The wife stated that she was not aware of the hearing scheduled for July 2, 2015, as the notice was sent to the marital home where the husband was residing, and the husband had failed to inform her of the hearing. On August 6, 2015, following a hearing attended by both parties and their respective attorneys, the divorce judge entered a further temporary order approving a stipulation of the parties that granted the wife parenting time with the child every other weekend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 3, 2015, the wife filed a motion for temporary orders, requesting a \"more equitable parenting schedule.\" On January 11, 2016, a different judge (second motion judge) entered a temporary order leaving the stipulated parenting schedule intact, while granting the wife shared legal custody of the child and ordering her to pay weekly child support to the husband of $150.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 20, 2016, a trial was held before the divorce judge, at which both parties were present and represented by counsel. Both parties and the wife's first husband testified at the trial. On July 12, 2016, the Probate and Family Court entered a judgment of divorce nisi,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   granting the wife sole legal and physical custody of the parties' child, and ordering the husband to pay weekly child support to the wife of $178. The judgment of divorce further required the husband to transfer to the wife twenty percent of the balance of his Fidelity individual retirement account (IRA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 22, 2016, the husband filed a five-page motion for new trial pursuant to Mass.Dom.Rel.P. 59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion was accompanied by several exhibits containing affidavits and letters from various individuals, including the husband's first wife, several of the husband's immediate family members, and the husband's attorney, along with a letter from a psychotherapist who had provided couple's counseling to the parties, and individual counseling to the husband. The Probate and Family Court returned the exhibits to the husband's counsel, along with a notice indicating that the motion for new trial had been submitted to the divorce judge for consideration. The notice explained that the exhibits were being returned as they contained \"confidential information of one or both parties which the Court is required to protect\" and further directed the husband's counsel to \"refer to Standing Order 2-99 regarding the procedure for filing a post-judgment motion and the limitation of five (5) pages.\" On August 24, 2016, the divorce judge denied the husband's motion for new trial. On September 7, 2016, the husband filed a motion for reconsideration, and on September 15, 2016, a motion to restore the exhibits removed from the file. Following a hearing on September 15, 2016, the divorce judge denied both motions. The present appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

The judge found that the husband's emergency motion for custody \"was advanced in bad faith ... in an attempt to gain unfair advantage in this legal proceeding,\" \"to exclude the [w]ife from [the child's] life,\" and to \"interfere[ ] in [the wife's] relationship with [the child].\" See\n   <em>\n    Schechter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schechter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776996\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/239/#p248\">\n    88 Mass.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A. The judge further found that the husband had demonstrated an inability \"to appropriately provide for [the child's] day-to-day care or personal hygiene,\" whereas the wife was \"more capable\" of \"primarily provid[ing] for [the child's] day-to-day needs.\" See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. Finally, the judge found that the husband's \"actions demonstrate that he does not have the present ability and/or willingness to co-parent with the [w]ife,\" and that the wife \"is more capable\" than the husband of \"includ[ing] the other parent in [the child's] life despite their difficult history, conflict and abuse.\" Compare\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685794\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/488/#p494\">\n    463 Mass. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The husband contends that there \"was no basis in the record\" for the judge's findings regarding custody. The marriage was a short-term, two-year marriage. The judge permissibly found that the wife had been the primary caretaker of the parties' child as well as the husband's and wife's other children by previous marriages for much of that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge's remaining findings were based largely on her assessment of each party's credibility. She made detailed findings regarding the husband's physical and emotional abuse of the wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   She further found that the husband sought and obtained the initial emergency custody order as a result of intentional misrepresentations to the court, and credited the wife's testimony that he failed to take adequate steps to ensure the physical hygiene of the child. As there is nothing in the record which would leave us \"convinced\" that the judge's credibility determinations were \"plainly wrong,\" we decline to disturb them.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p237\">\n    469 Mass. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (2014), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Felton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Felton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813430\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/383/232/#p239\">\n    383 Mass. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239 (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The husband next contends that the judge overlooked the potential harm to the child resulting from a substantial change in the existing custody arrangement.

We disagree. Where, as here, \"[t]he temporary custody order entered at the beginning of this action significantly altered [the child's] living arrangements and the parties' parental responsibilities, ... the benefits of stability and continuity that should have been a major focus of the judge's analysis were eviscerated\" by the temporary custody order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47263\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/834/#p840\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47263\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/834/#p840\">\n    . at 845-846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The wife was the child's primary caretaker during the marriage, a role that was effectively destroyed by the husband's \"bad faith\" commencement of custody proceedings. Moreover, the judge was cognizant of the need to avoid further disruption in the child's life, as she specifically noted that the husband's \"parenting time will allow him to maintain his relationship with [the child] ... as the Court finds this would be in [the child's] best interests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We are similarly unpersuaded by the husband's claim that he was prejudiced by the abuse allegations raised at trial. The husband was sufficiently on notice of the abuse allegations prior to the trial on June 20, 2016, as they were raised by the wife in her complaint for divorce filed on June 24, 2015, and during a hearing held on December 10, 2015. Moreover, the wife's counsel indicated in his opening statement that the wife would testify as to incidents of abuse. At no time did the husband's counsel object and request a continuance, despite having an opportunity to do so. See\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Suran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4014876\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/35/7/#p10\">\n    35 Mass.

The affidavits were returned to the husband for two reasons-they exceeded the five-page limit on a motion under Probate and Family Court Standing Order 2-99, and one of the affidavits contained confidential information. The husband's motion, which was five pages in length and was accepted for filing, was a motion to alter or amend the judgment, or order a new trial pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 59(e). Rule 59(c) provides that the moving party may file affidavits with the motion. The two affidavits that did not contain confidential information were properly filed, and it was error to refuse to restore them to the docket. However, because the motion summarized the affidavits, and the judge considered the information in deciding whether to grant a further evidentiary hearing, the error was not prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Fees\n   </em>\n   .

As a result, the wife was, for the most part, \"solely responsible for the care of seven ... children\" (the husband's four children from his previous marriage, the wife's two children from her previous marriage, and the parties' child).

The judge made detailed subsidiary findings regarding the abuse. The judge specifically found that \"[t]he [w]ife testified credibly that the [h]usband had been verbally abusive and controlling of her actions throughout most of the marriage. On one occasion, when [the child] was approximately one (1) year old, the [w]ife locked herself in the bathroom with [the child] to avoid the [h]usband's verbal abuse and the [h]usband kicked the bathroom door in.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A. However, the judge did not base her custody award on the impact of domestic violence on the child. Rather, she found that the husband's disrespect for and abusive treatment of the wife rendered him unable to coparent the child.
