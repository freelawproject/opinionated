Kalin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736905\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/225/#p228\">\n    12 N.Y.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736905\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/225/#p228\">\n    878 N.Y.S.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736905\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/225/#p228\">\n    906 N.E.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2009] ). Reasonable cause \"exists when evidence or information which appears reliable discloses facts or circumstances which are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a person of ordinary intelligence, judgment and experience that it is reasonably likely that such offense was committed and that such person committed it\" ( CPL 70.10 [2 ] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, the factual allegations of each misdemeanor complaint establish reasonable cause to believe that each defendant possessed a \"dangerous knife\" ( Penal Law \u00a7 265.01 [2 ] ), triggering the statutory presumption of unlawful intent arising from such possession ( Penal Law \u00a7 265.15 [4 ] ). Accordingly, each accusatory instrument was sufficient to support a charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. Therefore, we need not address the People's alternative jurisdictional argument in\n   <em>\n    People v. Edward.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-15\">\n   STEIN, J. (concurring):\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I concur on constraint of our prior precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   WILSON, J. (concurring in People v. McCain, dissenting in People v. Edward):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I concur in the result in\n   <em>\n    People v. McCain\n   </em>\n   because the officer's sworn statement attached to the complaint specifies that the \"knife was activated by deponent to an open and locked position through the force of gravity,\" which meets the statutory\n   definition of \"gravity knife\" in Penal Law \u00a7 265.00 (5), and therefore\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   is a \"dangerous knife\" under Penal Law \u00a7 265.01, when subsections (1) and (2) thereof are read together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I dissent from the result in\n   <em>\n    People v. Edward\n   </em>\n   for the reasons set out in Judge Simons' dissent in\n   <em>\n    Matter ofJamie D.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4390545\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/59/589/\">\n    59 N.Y.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=466%20N.Y.S.2d%20286\">\n    466 N.Y.S.2d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=453%20N.E.2d%20515\">\n    453 N.E.2d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    People v McCain\n   </em>\n   : Order affirmed, in a memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    People v Edward\n   </em>\n   : Order affirmed, in a memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In People v McCain: Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Fahey, Garcia and Feinman concur, Judge Stein in a concurring memorandum.
