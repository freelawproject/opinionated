The defendant contends that the trial judge improperly limited the cross-examination of a prosecution witness. He also contends that he was deprived of a fair trial because of various errors in the prosecutor's closing argument. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The defendant was arrested months after the shooting when an acquaintance came forward to implicate him. He was charged with murder in the first degree. The Commonwealth's theory of the case was that the defendant \"assassinat[ed]\" Shavies after a falling out between them. The defendant claimed that Shavies attacked him and that the killing, which no one witnessed other than the defendant and Shavies, was in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   During the investigation, the defendant gave conflicting stories to the police; at first he denied but ultimately admitted to the shooting. He also testified at trial. Other witnesses (many of whom knew both Shavies and the defendant) were also less than candid with the police during their investigation, but testified at trial. The judge instructed the jury regarding both degrees of murder, self-defense, and the reduction of murder to voluntary manslaughter based on the excessive use of force in self-defense or due to heat of passion upon reasonable provocation or upon sudden combat. The jury returned a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Cross-examination\n   </em>\n   .

Here, it appears that the prosecutor corrected his error regarding the medical examiner's testimony. Even if there was error, the error was not prejudicial because (1) the trial judge had previously instructed the jury that closing arguments are not evidence and that \"if [their] memory of the evidence differs from the version stated in the closing arguments, [they] should follow [their] own recollections\"; and (2) after a sidebar following the objection, the judge also gave a general curative instruction that although \"the attorneys are allowed to argue to you what they suggest the evidence was ...

Of greater concern is the prosecutor's reference to excluded testimony during closing argument. At trial the prosecutor sought to introduce expert testimony that the first gunshot struck Shavies in the mouth, that Shavies fell to the ground, and that the defendant then fired the fatal shot to the head. This evidence went to the Commonwealth's theory of the case, namely that the defendant had \"assassinat[ed]\" the victim, and was also offered to disprove self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judge excluded the evidence on the basis that the prosecutor had failed to provide adequate expert disclosures or expert reports as to the sequence of shots and Shavies's body position. Nonetheless, the prosecutor argued in his closing that the first shot was to the mouth, and that Shavies was then shot in the head after he fell to the ground. \"Look at the blood flow from those wounds,\" the prosecutor said; \"[w]hile Kevin Shavies is on the ground, what happens? The defendant shoots him in the head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Commonwealth argues that it was permissible for the jury to draw an inference that Shavies was shot in the head after falling to the ground by examining photographic exhibits depicting the direction of blood flow from his wounds, and that the argument was, therefore, grounded in the evidence. The prosecutor's argument was improper. The evidence concerning blood flow came from the Commonwealth's expert, who testified that the sideways flow of the blood meant that Shavies bled while he was on the ground. But the same expert stated, \"That doesn't mean anything beyond that, just that-sometimes injuries do take a second or two to start bleeding.\" Thus, the record evidence, propounded by the Commonwealth's own witness, expressly disclaimed the theory espoused in the closing argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties agree that the error is unpreserved. We review for a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993894\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/675/#p685\">\n    435 Mass. 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685, 687 (2002). The jury were instructed, immediately after the arguments and before general jury instructions were given, to rely on their memory of the evidence and not the arguments of counsel. The jury's acquittal on the murder charge demonstrates a clear rejection of the assassination theory of the case. Although the reference to excluded evidence should not have been made, the acquittal of the murder charge and \"the good sense of the jurors saved [the] prosecutor from the consequences of his own folly.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grimshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3900711\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/412/505/#p515\">\n    412 Mass. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515 (1992) (Tauro, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nor has the defendant clearly articulated how the absence of the offending reference would have resulted in a full acquittal. The shots were fired at close range-a few inches to a few feet. There was a great deal of conflicting evidence from both sides regarding the relationship between the two men, who had been friends but were also affiliated with rival gangs. The jury had this information in hand when they considered whether the shooting was the product of heat of passion or the excessive use of force in self-defense. Accordingly, we cannot say that \"we have a serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error not been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Proulx\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511587\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/454/#p461\">\n    61 Mass.

In the final moments of closing argument, the prosecutor made an emotional appeal to the jury's sympathy by referring to Shavies's age, his loss of \"everything he could have been,\" and his relationship with his family. \"The prosecutor is entitled to 'tell the jury something of the person whose life [has] been lost in order to humanize the proceedings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734960\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/554/#p566\">\n    437 Mass. 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566 (2002), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Degro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285239\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/319/#p323\">\n    432 Mass. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323 (2000).
