Liberally construing the complaint, presuming the facts alleged to be true and affording plaintiff the benefit of all favorable inferences, the complaint states a cause of action and defendants' documentary evidence does not establish, as a matter of law, that the work site where plaintiff's injury occurred was not a construction area in accordance with Labor Law \u00a7 241(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals ( 22 NYCRR 500.11 ), order affirmed, with costs, and certified question answered in the affirmative, in a memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Fahey, Garcia and Wilson concur. Judge Feinman took no part.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
