BOYLE, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 1} The central question we are called upon to answer is whether, under R.C. 2735.01, a trial court may grant an ex parte emergency motion to appoint a receiver to manage and operate an Ohio limited liability company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In this case, plaintiffs-appellants, Troy Leight and John Nail (collectively \"appellants\"), appeal from the trial court's\n   judgment granting the emergency motion of defendant-appellee Susan Zull, administrator of the estate of Cynthia Brogan, to appoint a receiver to manage and operate the business of Osteosymbionics, L.L.C. (\"Osteo\"). On appeal, appellants raise the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. An ex parte receivership is improper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. An ex parte receivership is unconstitutional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. The receivership was invalid because the executrix is not an owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. [The] estate had no damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   5. The trial court has acted inconsistently with this appellate jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. [The] bond is inadequate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Because we find that Ohio law permits the granting of an emergency ex parte motion to appoint a receiver and the facts of this case justified the trial court's judgment without providing notice and holding an evidentiary hearing, we affirm and remand to the lower court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In October 2006, appellants and Cynthia Brogan entered into an Operating Agreement to form Osteo-an Ohio limited liability company in the business of manufacturing medical devices, primarily cranial implants. Osteo's implants benefit patients in need of brain surgeries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In March 2014, \"Brogan, acting alone, signed an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement,\" which amended the Operating Agreement in several ways.\n   <em>\n    Leight v. Osteosymbionics,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102869,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-110\">\n    2016-Ohio-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20193511\">\n    2016 WL 193511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11. Specifically, the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement eliminated \"the Board of Managers, making Brogan the sole Manager, vesting the Manager with 'full, exclusive, and complete discretion, power, and authority * * * to manage, control, administer, and operate the business and affairs of the Company,' and giving the Manager irrevocable power of attorney over all members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. In addition, the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement added an arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 14, 2014, appellants filed their complaint against Osteo and Brogan for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, civil conspiracy, freeze out, accounting, and injunctive relief. Appellants alleged that \"Brogan mismanaged and improperly exercised control over the L.L.C., including 'attempt[ing] to unilaterally change the operating agreement and governing documents of the Company to benefit herself.' \"\n   <em>\n    Leight\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In response to the complaint, Brogan filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to compel arbitration. The trial court denied Brogan's motion, and she appealed to this court. On January 14, 2016, we affirmed the trial court's denial of Brogan's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See Leight\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Prior to our decision, however, Brogan died on August 31, 2015. At the request of appellants, the trial court substituted Zull as a party for Brogan because Zull had been appointed the administrator of Brogan's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 17, 2016, appellants and Zull, on behalf of Brogan's estate, entered into a settlement agreement that allowed Leight to \"operate and have full authority to operate the business\" of Osteo for a period of 120 days (the \"Standstill Period\"). During the Standstill Period, Zull agreed to \"cooperate and use best efforts to aid Leight in the transfer of operations of the business, including, without limitation, finances, banking, orders, access,\n   computer access, customer service, production, IP and IT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In addition, during the Standstill Period, Leight agreed to provide to Zull, as administrator of Brogan's estate, \"monthly reports as to the operations of [Osteo], * * * including sales efforts, orders, revenue, expenses and liabilities of [Osteo].\" Leight also agreed to provide \"all information reasonably requested from Leight concerning the operations of [Osteo] during the standstill period\" and to \"make best efforts to operate [Osteo] as a going concern to preserve the value of [Osteo] and its assets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Leight further agreed to use his \"best efforts during said 120 day standstill to investigate the allegations of the Lawsuit and any misconduct by [Brogan].\" According to the settlement agreement, if Leight \"[wa]s satisfied at its sole choice, determination and election as to its investigation that there was no misconduct, then Leight shall pay the [sic] Brogan $20,000.00 for all units owned or previously owned by [Brogan] and her Estate and the parties shall then be released in accordance with Section 3, below.\" If, however, Leight determined \"that there was misconduct or improprieties with the business, then Leight shall provide written notice of that determination to Brogan, no payment shall be made, the Lawsuit shall become active and there shall be no release by or between the parties under this Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The parties also agreed that \"[n]othing in this [Settlement] Agreement shall be construed as an agreement by Brogan that Leight is authorized to operate [Osteo] beyond the standstill period or to give greater rights to Leight to operate [Osteo] beyond the standstill period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Effective June 17, 2016, Leight began to operate Osteo during the Standstill Period. According to a memorandum from Zull's attorney, however, Leight failed to deliver Osteo's financial reports until August 9, 2016. Although these financial reports were not made a part of the trial court record, Zull claimed that they showed that Osteo had a balance of $79,111.83 in its checking account as of the end of July 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Zull also believed that Leight provided incomplete financial reports for Osteo. Therefore, on August 16, 2016, Zull's attorney emailed Leight's attorney and attached a memorandum with nine initial questions regarding the financial reports. The email stated that \"we tried to remain focused on the primary issues. My client does not waive her right to ask for any more information or any other rights she has.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Within hours of this email on August 16, 2016, Leight's attorney responded, \"We are terminating the settlement and returning the case to active litigation. Additionally, due to the manner the company was run prior to my client's recent involvement, there is a massive negative balance. My client is making a capital call of $150,000. Please let me know who I should be contacting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In response, on September 1, 2016, Zull's attorney sent correspondence to Leight's attorney reminding him that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Brogan] is still the majority owner of [Osteo]. As your clients were exercising management of [Osteo] solely under authority granted by the [Settlement] Agreement, your clients are no longer authorized to take any actions on behalf of [Osteo] without my client's approval. Nonetheless, your clients currently have exclusive control over [Osteo's] records, bank accounts, and other assets and they are under a duty to maintain and manage those records and assets for the benefit of the company and its members\n   until such time as control of those records and assets are properly transferred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this same letter, Zull requested that the members select \"a new person to run\" Osteo's business. Although Zull suggested two candidates, he also requested appellants to \"propose candidates that they would accept.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On September 1, 2016, Zull's attorney wrote another letter to Leight's attorney informing him that Osteo's customer, Longeviti Neuro Solutions (Longeviti), wanted to explore \"a merger with or purchase of\" Osteo. In the letter, Zull's attorney explained that Longeviti's founder and chief executive officer, Jesse Christopher, had recently told him \"that [Jesse Christopher] had previously expressed his interest to Troy Leight, but Mr. Leight declined to discuss the opportunity.\" Zull's attorney then wrote, \"Not only does Mr. Leight lack authority to make such decisions, he never informed my client of Mr. Christopher's interest.\" Zull requested consent from appellants to move forward with exploring the opportunity with Longeviti.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} After receiving no response to his letters, on September 8, 2016, Zull's counsel emailed Leight's counsel asking whether to expect a response. On September 9, 2016, Leight's counsel replied that he had \"been buried on other matters and in court. I hope to get back to you next week.\" On September 14, 2016, Leight's counsel again emailed, \"I am following up my guy on your letters.\" Nothing in the record suggests that Leight substantively responded to Zull's letters or questions about the financial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Although Leight terminated the Settlement Agreement, he continued to operate and manage Osteo. During this time, Longeviti had a pending order that Osteo needed to deliver by October 6, 2016, for a patient's brain surgery scheduled on October 19, 2016. In support of these facts, Jesse Christopher, the chief executive officer of Longeviti, provided an affidavit that averred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Longeviti recently submitted another order for a cranial implant to Osteosymbionics (the \"Current Order\") for the same price as the Initial Order. The patient to receive that implant is scheduled to have brain surgery on October 19, 2016. That implant must be delivered by October 6, 2016 for that surgery to proceed as scheduled. I know of at least two other patients who are scheduled to have brain surgery and other patients who are waiting to have their brain surgeries scheduled with the expectation that Osteosymbionics' implant will be used in those surgeries. Some of those patients are in pain. Surgeons are developing a new technique that reduces complications for brain surgery patients. That technique depends on the use of Osteosymbionics' implants. If Osteosymbionics does not provide those implants, the scheduled and pending surgeries will be delayed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   On September 26, 2016, Leight informed me that Osteosymbionics does not intend to fill the Current Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on demand, I expect that Longeviti will be providing at least an average of two orders for cranial implants to Osteosymbionics per week over the next six months if Osteosymbionics continues to fill orders for cranial implants. It is likely that the number of orders submitted by Longeviti will increase above two per week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Christopher's affidavit included emails between Leight and himself about the upcoming October 6 order and future orders. On September 22, 2016, Christopher emailed Leight, \"Our next order's surgery date is 10/6, and we'd like to make\n   an arrangement for 75 more over the next 12 months for a collective expense of around $300,000.\" The next day, Leight emailed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Appears that Mark Jacobs is not interested in my offer. Your proposed unit price would not even cover my basic costs such as rent and liability insurance. I have no interest in keeping a company alive to continue to lose money. Bankruptcy is a better financial option.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Christopher responded, \"We are open to discussion on covering operational costs, please let us know what those may be,\" and Leight answered, \"I entertained your ideas and quite obviously Mark Jacobs has no desire in resolving the issues. Go someplace else.\" After another email from Christopher trying to maintain the business, Leight replied, \"What part of no do you not understand?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Cameron Fordyce, a consultant hired by Leight during the Standstill Period, also provided an affidavit in support of Zull's emergency motion to appoint a receiver that averred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Longeviti placed an order for another cranial implant last week for the same price that it paid for its previous cranial implant. I expected that Osteosymbionics would fill that order. Osteosymbionics is capable of filling that order, once Osteosymbionics pays Brian [Greene, a former Osteosymbionics employee] the $500 he is owed for work performed in filling prior orders. The cranial implant that Longeviti ordered must be delivered by October 6, 2016. To deliver that implant on time, Osteosymbionics must begin working on the implant no later than first thing in the morning on October 3, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Longeviti was willing to commit to placing 75 orders for cranial implants in the next 12 months generating at least $300,000 in revenue for Osteosymbionics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   On September 26, 2016, Leight informed Longeviti that Osteosymbionics would not fill Longeviti's order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   When Leight engaged me as a consultant for Osteosymbionics, he agreed that Osteosymbionics would pay me $2,000 per week for my services. Osteosymbionics paid me $4,000 for my first two weeks and has not paid me since. When I asked Leight for Osteosymbionics to pay amounts owed to me and to Brian $500 that was owed to him, so that Brian will be available to continue filling orders, he told me that Osteosymbionics was bankrupt and that we would have to file a claim with the bankruptcy court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Based upon these facts and evidence, on September 30, 2016, Zull filed her emergency motion to appoint a receiver to manage and operate Osteo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zull's motion relied upon R.C. 2735.01(A)(1), (A)(6), and (A)(7) and argued that Osteo \"[was] in imminent danger of suffering significant harm\" because: (1) Leight refused to complete a pending order for a cranial implant that needed to be delivered to Longeviti by October 6, 2016-six days from the filing of the emergency motion to appoint a receiver-for a patient's brain surgery, (2) Leight's refusal to complete the order could result in the loss of Longeviti as a customer thereby causing Osteo to suffer approximately $300,000 of revenue in the next year, (3) Osteo's failure to complete future cranial implants would prevent other patients from having brain surgeries, (4) Leight's representations that\n   Osteo \"[was] bankrupt\" necessitated a receiver to preserve its assets from insolvency or bankruptcy, and (5) Leight continued to control Osteo even though he unilaterally terminated the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On the same day Zull filed her emergency motion to appoint a receiver, the trial court granted the motion ex parte. In granting the motion, the trial court held that, \"[a]fter considering the pleadings and other documents presented in connection with the matter, as well as arguments presented to the court\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Zull has met the requirements of Ohio Revised Code Section 2735.01 and the appointment of a Receiver is an appropriate remedy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Zull has shown by clear and convincing evidence that (a) Osteosymbionics, LLC (\"Osteosymbionics\") has been and is being financially and operationally mismanaged; (b) Osteosymbionics is in imminent danger of becoming insolvent; and (c) the appointment of a Receiver is necessary to preserve the assets of Osteo and protect the interests of the parties during the pendency of this litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court is convinced that Osteosymbionics and its assets are in danger and the immediate appointment of a Receiver is necessary and appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 25} It is from this judgment that appellants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellants argue that this court should apply a de novo standard of review with respect to their second assignment of error only. Specifically, appellants claim that the trial court's failure to give notice or hold a hearing prior to granting Zull's emergency motion violated their constitutional due process rights, and therefore, a de novo review should apply. Appellants, however, fail to cite to a single legal authority in support of their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Zull argues that an abuse of discretion standard of review applies in this case. She further states that appellants \"provide no support\" for the argument that a de novo standard of review applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The trial court is vested with sound discretion to appoint a receiver.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants and the company alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty and contractual agreement by failing to distribute and allocate net profits, refusing reasonable requests to inspect the company's books, misappropriating and co-mingling business profits with personal funds, wrongfully disposing of partnership property, and violating the terms of the partnership agreement. Along with the complaint, the plaintiff requested the immediate appointment of a receiver. Without the defendants being served or otherwise receiving notice, the trial court appointed a receiver at an ex parte hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 34} On appeal, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Saferin\n   </em>\n   argued that the trial court erred when it appointed a receiver without notice to them. The Sixth District found that the complaint with exhibits supported the allegations that the defendants breached their contractual obligations, failed to adequately maintain the property, and fraudulently retained company profits.\n   <em>\n    Saferin\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Because the evidence proved that the defendants' conduct caused irreparable damage, the Sixth District held that the trial court did not err when it appointed a receiver in an ex parte hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985%20WL%208204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In addition, R.C. 2735.01 does not mandate an evidentiary hearing before ruling on a motion to appoint a receiver.

By the time Zull filed her emergency motion for the appointment of a receiver, the trial court had been involved in the case for almost two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Moreover, appellants' complaint against Brogan centered on a theory that she mismanaged and embezzled money from Osteo and appellants. The parties entered into the Settlement Agreement whereby Leight obtained access over Osteo in order to investigate whether evidence existed to support appellants' claims against Brogan. Once Leight began operating Osteo, he had to provide financial reports during the Standstill Period, but according to the email from Zull's counsel, he failed to do so timely. Then, after being asked questions about the financial reports that he did provide, instead of responding to the questions, Leight, via email, terminated the Settlement Agreement without providing \"written notice\" of a determination that Brogan committed misconduct with Osteo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Even then, Leight continued to control Osteo, but there is no evidence that he reached out to the other members of the company, including Zull on behalf of Brogan, in making decisions. Rather, the affidavits of Christopher and Fordyce proved that Osteo had customers, including Longeviti, that had pending orders that Leight refused to fill. For one order, Osteo had three days to \"begin working\" on a cranial implant (and six days to deliver it to Longeviti) so that a patient could have a scheduled brain surgery. Leight's own email told Longeviti to \"go someplace else,\" and \"what part of no do you not understand?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In addition, Leight's email to Christopher showed that he believed that \"Bankruptcy [was] a better financial option\" than to continue to do business with Longeviti. And according to Fordyce's affidavit, Leight told her that Osteo \"was bankrupt.\" Yet, Leight refused to permit Osteo to complete the cranial implant order for Longeviti. Had the order not been timely completed, Osteo could have lost Longeviti's business-which Christopher anticipated the amount to be $300,000 in revenue in the next 12 months. Likewise, the affidavit of Christopher proved that other patients expected Osteo's cranial implants for future brain surgeries. These facts support that Leight's actions posed an immediate and significant threat of imminent danger to Osteo and its assets, including its financial viability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellants rely on\n   <em>\n    Ry. Co. v. Jewett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910797\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/37/649/\">\n    37 Ohio St. 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1882%20WL%2025\">\n    1882 WL 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1882), for the argument that the trial court erred in granting the motion to appoint a receiver without notice to them. After a review of\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   , we do not find that the Ohio Supreme Court forbids a granting of a motion for a receiver without notice. In\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court found that the trial court had no obstacle to provide notice to the defendant before acting on the appointment of a receiver because the allegations in the case did not include fraud, insolvency, or danger of harm to the company property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 659. The\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   court held, however, that a motion for appointment of a receiver can be lawfully made without notice if the delay required to give such notice will result in irreparable loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The facts of this case are distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   . Here, the affidavits of Christopher and Fordyce, along with the emails between Christopher and Leight proved that imminent danger to Osteo would have occurred had the trial court not immediately appointed a receiver because the Longeviti order would not have been filled; the patient would not have had the scheduled brain surgery ; other patients would not have received\n   their cranial implants; and Longeviti would likely have stopped doing business with Osteo, thereby preventing Osteo from receiving revenues of approximately $300,000 over the next 12 months. Therefore, had the trial court delayed the granting of the emergency motion in order to provide notice to appellants and a hearing, Osteo would have suffered irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting Zull's emergency motion for the appointment of a receiver without notice or a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellants' first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellants' third assignment of error argues that the trial court erred when it granted the emergency motion to appoint a receiver because Zull, as administrator of Brogan's estate, \"is not an owner of\" Osteo. Relying on R.C. 1705.15 and the 2006 Osteo Operating Agreement, appellants claim that because Brogan died in August 2015, so too did her membership interest in Osteo. Thus, according to appellants, Zull has no \"right to or interest in\" Osteo property and, therefore, Zull did not have standing to obtain a receiver under R.C. 2735.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 45} In response, Zull claims that the language contained in R.C. 2735.01(A)(1), (A)(6) and (A)(7) does not require her to have an ownership interest in Osteo to have standing to obtain the appointment of a receiver. Regardless, Zull asserts she has an interest in Osteo as the administrator of Brogan's estate, and therefore, she properly obtained the appointment of the receiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 46} R.C. 2735.01(A)(1) provides that the appointment of a receiver is proper \"between * * * others * * * interested in any property or fund, on the application * * * of a party whose right to or interest in the property or fund, or the proceeds of the property or fund, is probable, and when it is shown that the property or fund is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Applying the plain language of the statute, we find that Zull had standing to seek the appointment of the receiver. The trial court substituted Zull for Brogan after Brogan died. As the administrator of Brogan's estate, Zull had the obligation to protect Brogan's assets, including her interest in Osteo. Thus, Zull had a \"probable\" \"right to or interest\" in the Osteo property in order to protect Brogan's estate's interests and claims to Osteo and its assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Because we find that Zull had standing to seek the appointment of a receiver for Osteo under R.C. 2735.01(A)(1), we need not render an opinion as to the extent of Zull's rights and interest in Osteo because those will be determined at the trial of the underlying matter. Appellants' third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Appellants' fourth assignment of error claims that the trial court erred in appointing the receiver because Zull failed to allege or show any probable damage because \"none had occurred or could occur.\" Because Brogan died on August 31, 2015, according to appellants, the amount owed by or to Brogan \"could not increase or decrease based upon anything [Osteo] does now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In response, Zull argues that the basis for the appointment of a receiver is to \"prevent the damage caused by the loss of property and to preserve the property so that interested parties may recover on their underlying rights and claims.\" Zull\n   claims that it is the damage caused by loss to Osteo that is addressed by the appointment of a receiver, not the damages sought in the underlying claims in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 51} We agree with Zull. R.C. 2735.01(A)(1) states that the appointment of a receiver is proper when \"it is shown that the property or fund is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured.\" Likewise, R.C. 2735.01(A)(6) states that a receiver may be appointed if the limited liability company \"is insolvent, [or] is in imminent danger of insolvency.\" Thus, the issue is not whether Zull proved damages. The issue is whether the evidence proved that Osteo's assets \"were in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured\" or whether Osteo \"is insolvent [or] is in imminent danger of insolvency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 52} We have determined that the trial court properly granted the emergency motion to appoint a receiver because of the imminent danger to Osteo, its assets, and its financial viability. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting Zull's emergency motion for the appointment of a receiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Appellants' fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Trial Court's Conduct After Granting Zull's Emergency Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Appellants' fifth assignment of error argues that the trial court has acted inconsistently with appellate jurisdiction. Specifically, appellants claim that the trial court \"has been taking actions post appeal\" despite the fact that all actions should be stayed because the trial court is divested of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 55} This assignment of error is unrelated to the trial court's judgment granting Zull's emergency motion for the appointment of a receiver, which is the only issue on appeal. Rather, this assignment of error seeks review of actions by the trial court after the September 30, 2016 judgment granting Zull's motion. It is well established that this court need not address an assignment of error pertaining to issues outside the scope of an appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Briscoe\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.
