The trial court found Daryl Wheatley, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of five offenses: (1) endangering children, in violation of R.C. 2912.22(B)(6); (2) having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) ; (3) illegal cultivation of marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A) ; (4) possessing criminal tools, in violation of R.C. 2923.24(A) ; and (5) receiving stolen property, in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A). The trial court sentenced appellant to serve five years of community control. Appellant assigns the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY EXPRESSING THE POTENTIAL SENTENCE FOR A COMMUNITY CONTROL VIOLATION AS A PACKAGE, RATHER THAN EXPRESSING A POTENTIAL SENTENCE FOR EACH SEPARATE, INDIVIDUAL OFFENSE.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FINDING MR. WHEATLEY GUILTY ON COUNT II-WEAPONS UNDER DISABILITY, AND BY OVERRULING MR. WHEATLEY'S MOTION TO DISMISS, BASED ON THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF R.C. 2923.1[3](A)(4).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO MERGE COUNT III: ILLEGAL CULTIVATION OF MARIJUANA,\n   WITH COUNT IV: POSSESSING CRIMINAL TOOLS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After a Hocking County grand jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with five offenses, appellant entered a not guilty plea. He later filed a motion to dismiss the possessing a weapon while under a disability count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant argued that R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) is unconstitutional because it deprives him of his fundamental right to possess a firearm without notice and an opportunity to be heard. Appellant claimed that before the state may charge an individual under R.C. 2923.13(A)(4), the individual must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard concerning whether the person is drug dependent or in danger of drug dependence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court overruled appellant's motion to dismiss and appellant subsequently agreed to enter a no contest plea to the five counts of the indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court later sentenced appellant to serve five years of community control. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} For ease of discussion, we first address appellant's second assignment of error wherein appellant asserts that the trial court erred by overruling his motion to dismiss the weapons under disability count. In particular, appellant contends that R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) is unconstitutional because, appellant reasons, the statute violates his procedural due process rights and his constitutional right to bear arms. Appellant argues that (1) due process mandates that the state provide him with notice and a hearing regarding the drug-dependence issue before the state can criminalize his possession of a weapon under R.C. 2923.13(A)(4), and (2) R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) violates his constitutional right to bear arms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Generally, appellate courts conduct a de novo review of a trial court's decision concerning a defendant's motion to dismiss all or part of an indictment based upon a constitutional challenge to the statute under which the defendant stands indicted.\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) thus helps further the state's interest by keeping weapons out of the hands of those involved with drugs.

White\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the court determined that the same statute involved in the case at bar- R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) -is constitutional. While we recognize that\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   predated\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and thus did not apply the same legal standards espoused in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , but instead, applied more of a rational-basis analysis, we believe that the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court's reasons supporting the constitutionality of the law remain valid and appear consistent with\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court recognized, for example, that \"the legislative policy is to allow firearm access to responsible [or law-abiding] citizens in responsible circumstances, while limiting such access to persons and situations wherein substantial harm to the public's safety and welfare will likely result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Likewise, the\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   court recognized the right of law-abiding citizens to possess weapons, and noted that certain categories of individuals, such as felons and the mentally ill, may be excluded from the Second Amendment's protections. The\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court observed that R.C. 2923.13(A)(4) manifests the General Assembly's recognition that \"firearms in the possession of those who are drug dependent, or in danger of becoming such, [creates] a circumstance where substantial harm could result to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court pointed out, like the federal courts several years later, that \"the limitation on the right to possess a firearm is only temporary and for a reason consistent with the state's interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court explained: \" '[t]he disability is stated in the presence tense. In other words, the disability only exists during the time in which the person is [drug dependent or in danger of drug dependency].' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Rothacker v.

He asserts that the statute deprives him of his constitutional right to possess a weapon without affording him notice and a hearing. Appellant claims that before the state can criminalize his possession of a weapon, it must afford him notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the drug-dependency issue. Appellant proposes that he should be entitled to receive \"a 'notice of weapons disability' by virtue of his drug dependence, with that notice providing notice of the right to appeal (an appropriate post-deprivation remedy). If that individual subsequently possesses weapons, he could then be charged with weapons under disability.\" He essentially alleges that he is entitled to a predetermination whether he is under a disability before the state may charge him with weapons under a disability. We do not agree with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Due Process Clause contained in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states: \"No State shall * * * deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law * * *.\" The Due Course of Law Clause in Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution provides: \"All courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\" The two clauses provide equivalent due process protections.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n    <em>\n     Lester\n    </em>\n    , the Ohio Supreme Court held that \"a judgment of conviction is a final order * * * when the judgment entry sets forth (1) the fact of the conviction, (2) the sentence, (3) the judge's signature, and (4) the time stamp indicating the entry upon the journal by the clerk.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 14. Additionally, \"a valid judgment of conviction requires a full resolution of any counts for which there were convictions.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

We note that the trial court's judgment of conviction attempted to entirely dispose of each count, but it did so in an incorrect manner.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
