On November 19, 2013, the parties separated and the mother obtained an abuse prevention order against the father pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, which was later extended to November 16, 2017, following an evidentiary hearing attended by both parties and their respective counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On May 6, 2014, a judge of the Probate and Family Court granted the mother temporary sole legal and physical custody of the children during the pendency of the divorce proceedings. A two-day divorce trial was held before a different judge of the Probate and Family Court on October 5 and October 6, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On February 9, 2016, the trial judge issued a judgment of divorce nisi, providing, in relevant part, that the mother shall have sole legal custody of the children, and shall keep the \"[f]ather informed as to the children's health, education and welfare on a regular basis.\" The mother also shall contact the father and seek his input for activities for the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The father timely appealed from the judgment of divorce, challenging only the award of sole legal custody to the mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Shared legal custody\" is defined as \"continued mutual responsibility and involvement by both parents in major decisions regarding the child's welfare including matters of education, medical care and emotional, moral and religious development.\" G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31, as appearing in St. 1989, c. 689. Shared custody is generally not appropriate where the judge's findings demonstrate \"that the relationship of the parties has been dysfunctional, virtually nonexistent, and one of continuous conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772076\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/924/#p925\">\n    44 Mass. App. Ct. 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 925 (1998). Here the judge's findings clearly demonstrate that the parties' relationship has been \"dysfunctional\" and \"one of continuous conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772076\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/924/#p925\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772076\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/924/#p925\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The judge found that the \"[f]ather often denigrated [the] [m]other, called her names, physically grabbed her on a number of occasions, made sexual comments [the] [m]other found insulting, sometimes in front of the children, sent unwelcome sexually explicit text messages and emails, and forced himself upon her sexually.\" The judge also found that the father twice took naked pictures of the mother and disseminated those pictures without her knowledge or consent. The judge acknowledged the \"difficulties in the relationship between the parties\" and found that the father made a number of unilateral decisions regarding the children without consulting the mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of these findings, we conclude that the judge neither abused her discretion nor applied an improper analysis in awarding sole legal custody to the mother.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772076\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/924/#p925\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772076\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/924/#p925\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Moreover, to the extent that the judge considered \"evidence of past or present abuse toward a parent or child as a factor contrary to the best interest of the child,\" G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A, inserted by St. 1998, c. 179, \u00a7 3, we discern no error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The father claims that the judge erroneously applied the rebuttable presumption under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A, that joint legal custody is contrary to the children's best interests where there has been a finding of a \"pattern or serious incident of abuse.\" While we agree that it would have been preferable for the judge to state expressly that she found \"a pattern or serious incident of abuse has occurred,\" we think the judge's findings that the father had a \"history of violence\" toward the mother, that the father's abuse of the mother \"had been escalating throughout 2013,\" and that the father had \"admitted to sufficient facts on a charge of domestic assault and battery against [the] [m]other\" in a separate criminal proceeding are sufficient to convey the judge's view that a \"pattern\" of abuse had occurred, thereby triggering the presumption against shared custody under \u00a7 31A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, even if the presumption under \u00a7 31A did not apply here, the judge's findings regarding the parties' troubled, conflict-ridden relationship support the award of sole legal custody to the mother.

App. Ct. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405 (1981) (shared custody \"requires two capable parents with some degree of respect for one another's abilities as parents, together with a willingness and ability to work together\" [quotation omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We likewise reject the father's claim that the judge's findings do not have adequate evidentiary support. The judge's findings were based largely on her assessment of each party's credibility at the trial. As there is nothing in the record that would leave us \"convinced\" that the judge's credibility determinations were \"plainly wrong,\" we decline to disturb them.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zaleski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308885\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/230/#p237\">\n    469 Mass. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (2014), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Felton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Felton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813430\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/383/232/#p239\">\n    383 Mass. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239 (1981). Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion in the judge's decision to grant sole legal custody to the mother.

However, the father was not served with the complaint until December 3, 2013. The father filed his own complaint for divorce in November, 2013, but that complaint was dismissed after service of the mother's complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Due to the mother's pending bankruptcy action, the judge bifurcated and reserved for later adjudication the financial issues, including support and equitable distribution of the marital estate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The judgment of divorce also granted the mother primary physical custody of the children, with parenting time for the father on Wednesdays and alternating weekends.

See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A (\"Such presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that [a shared] custody award is in the best interests of the child\"). Moreover, the judge considered the effects of the abuse on the children, as she found that some of the abuse had been witnessed by the children and the children had been \"negatively impacted\" by the father's \"temper and anger issues.\" See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144900\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/169/\">\n      ibid\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144900\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/169/\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"If the court finds that a pattern or serious incident of abuse has occurred and issues a temporary or permanent custody order, the court shall within 90 days enter written findings of fact as to the effects of the abuse on the child\").
