On appeal, the juvenile claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the adjudication of delinquency relative to the dangerous weapon charge and that the prosecutor erred in her closing argument. Because we agree with the first point and disagree with the second, we affirm the adjudication of delinquency as to the assault charge and reverse the adjudication of delinquency as to the unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found the following facts. The juvenile was a student at a high school. In class, a teacher walked past the juvenile and noticed that he had taped pins to three of his fingers and that there were a few pins on top of his backpack, which he had on his lap. The pins were described as \"old fashion drapery pins without the hook part on them.\" They were also described as \"safety pins without the hooks\" and having \"jagged\" edges. When the teacher inquired what was on his fingers, the juvenile replied, \"Edward Scissorhands.\" After the teacher requested that the juvenile give her the pins, the juvenile reluctantly complied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In pertinent part, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    j\n   </em>\n   ), as appearing in St. 1974, c. 649, \u00a7 2, states, \"Whoever ... carries on his person a firearm ... or other dangerous weapon in ... any ... school ... shall be punished.\" Passing the other elements of \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    j\n   </em>\n   ), the juvenile claims there was insufficient evidence that the pins taped to his fingers constituted a dangerous weapon. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Because \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    j\n   </em>\n   ) does not define \"dangerous weapon,\" the Supreme Judicial Court imported the common-law definition into the statute. That is, \"dangerous weapons include those objects that are dangerous per se-'designed and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm' and 'for the purpose of bodily assault or defense,'\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Appleby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478899\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/296/#p303\">\n    380 Mass. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (1980) -as well as those objects that are dangerous as used-items that are not dangerous per se but 'become dangerous weapons because they 'are used in a dangerous fashion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wynton W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271023\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/745/#p749\">\n    459 Mass. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749 (2011), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tevlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343512\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/305/#p310\">\n    433 Mass. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310 (2001). Here, there is no dispute that the pins taped to the juvenile's fingers are not dangerous per se. Thus, to sustain the adjudication of delinquency, we must determine whether the pins were dangerous as used. They were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"The essential question, when an object which is not dangerous per se is alleged to be a dangerous weapon, is whether the object, as used by the defendant, is capable of producing serious bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1508579\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/59/825/#p828\">\n    59 Mass.

App. Ct. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 922 (1984). Because the pins were not employed in an assault, we need to evaluate whether the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that the juvenile used or handled the pins in a manner that made them a dangerous weapon.

It did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, the teacher interrupted the juvenile, who had taped some of the pins to his fingers. Whatever the pins' potential for harm, the juvenile did not use them in a manner that was capable of causing serious harm or even apprehension of serious harm.

Moreover, the evidence demonstrated that his only apparent motivation was to mimic a character in a movie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commonwealth likens this case not to\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , but more to\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Bradshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239039\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/74/#p81\">\n    86 Mass.

This would be a much different case if the Commonwealth had presented any evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, suggesting that the juvenile intended to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   the pins as a weapon at any point in the future. But merely having the potential to be dangerous, without more, is insufficient in light of our common-law definition that an item, which is not dangerous per se, is deemed a dangerous weapon only when it is \"used in a dangerous fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Appleby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478899\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/296/#p303\">\n    380 Mass. at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such circumstances were not presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The juvenile's sole challenge to the assault count, on the other hand, has no merit. The prosecutor's argument that it was possible, had the juvenile refrained from further misbehavior after relinquishing the pins, that he would not have been charged was well supported by the teacher's testimony that she considered things \"good\" at the point that he turned over the pins. The teacher did not decide that even a discussion with the assistant principal was necessary until discussing the matter with another teacher, suggesting that she had no intention at that time of proffering charges.
