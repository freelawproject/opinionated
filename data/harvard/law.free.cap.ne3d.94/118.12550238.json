This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal involves a dispute over whether a sanitary sewer surcharge imposed by Defendant-Appellee the City of Norton (\"Norton\"), and collected by the City of Barberton (\"Barberton\"), applies to the Homeowners based upon the language of the authorizing ordinance. Norton has nine geographic areas within its boundaries that are connected to sanitary sewers. There is no treatment facility for wastewater within Norton limits. Because of this, four of the areas are connected to individual self-contained sewers and receive treatment services from package plants owned by Summit County, which are described as being similar to large septic tanks. The remaining five areas ultimately discharge into sewers owned by Barberton and receive sanitary sewage treatment from the Barberton Wastewater Treatment Plant (\"Barberton plant\"). Four of those five areas contain sewers owned by Norton. The remaining area, known as Spring Avenue Outfall, consists almost entirely of sewers owned by Summit County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the sewers in the Spring Avenue Outfall area also discharge into the Barberton sanitary sewer system. The Homeowners reside within the Spring Avenue Outfall area and their sewers are owned by Summit County. Residents within the Spring Avenue Outfall area receive bills for sanitary sewer service from Barberton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to 1997, Barberton billed sanitary sewer customers in Norton at a rate double the rate charged to sanitary sewer customers within Barberton. In 1997, Barberton and Norton entered into a 75-year Water and Sewer Agreement (\"1997 Agreement\"), which states in part that \"Barberton shall provide sanitary sewage transportation and treatment services to Norton by allowing sanitary sewer extensions within Norton to be connected to the sanitary sewer system or supplied sanitary sewer service of Barberton. The service area for this sanitary sewer service shall be the corporate limits of Norton as the same may change from time to time, exclusive of areas which receive sanitary sewer service from the County of Summit.\" The agreement specified rates that Barberton would charge customers in the \"Norton sanitary sewer service area.\" For\n   the first five years, all Norton customers were charged a rate equal to the rate charged Barberton customers plus 50%. Five years following entry into the agreement, Barberton began charging all of its Norton customers a rate equal to the rate charged Barberton customers plus 22.5%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2003, at the behest of Norton, Finkbeiner, Pettis &amp; Strout, Inc., a group of consulting engineers, completed a study addressing potential water and sanitary sewer charges. That study found that there was \"a need for [Norton] to assess charges for the continual use of the water and sanitary sewer systems to help pay for capital improvement projects for the water and sanitary sewer systems. This charge would be in the form of a surcharge added to the monthly water/sewer bill that customers received from [Barberton].\" It stated that the \"surcharge should be established by ordinance with the customers being billed in accordance with the standard billing practices of [Barberton].\" The study further provided that the monthly surcharge would \"be billed to customers who [we]re connected to water mains and sanitary sewers owned by Norton and to sanitary sewers owned by Summit County that eventually discharge into the Barberton sanitary sewer system.\" However, \"[n]o charges w[ould] be billed to customers who [we]re connected to sanitary sewers owned by Summit County that discharge to the County's package [plants] because the flow from these plants is not part of the flow from Norton going into Barberton's sanitary sewer system.\" With respect to the sanitary sewer surcharge, the study recommended that Norton impose a surcharge that equaled 27.5% the rate charged to Barberton customers. The study included a proposed version of the ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In 2003, Norton passed an ordinance imposing a sanitary sewer surcharge in the amount recommended by the study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norton Codified Ordinances (\"Loc.Ord.\") 1042.06. The uncodified preamble of the ordinance noted that Norton City Council determined the surcharge was reasonable and proper based in part upon information provided by the study. This surcharge was imposed upon all Norton residents whose sanitary sewers discharged into the Barberton sanitary sewer system, including the Homeowners and the other residents of the Spring Avenue Outlet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Homeowners initiated this action in 2013, seeking \"declaratory and injunctive relief together with the return of the sewer surcharges. The Homeowners' claims included constitutional challenges to the surcharge, and they alleged that imposing the surcharge on them violated Loc.Ord. 1042.06. Thereafter, the parties filed competing motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted Norton's motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Adair v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3444\">\n    2015-Ohio-3444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20N.E.3d%20179\">\n    41 N.E.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4. The Homeowners appealed but did not raise their constitutional claims on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Instead this Court only addressed the following issues: \"the trial court's interpretation of Loc.Ord. 1042.06, the trial court's determination that the Homeowners failed to show a valid cause of action against Norton on this claim, and the statute of limitations relative to this claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"Based upon the wording of the ordinance, the Homeowners claimed that the ordinance applies only to Norton residents whose homes connect to sewer lines that\n   <em>\n    are owned\n   </em>\n   by Norton. Because the\n   sewer lines in the Spring Avenue Outfall are owned by Summit County, the Homeowners maintain[ed] that Loc.Ord. 1042.06 does not allow Norton to impose on them a surcharge.\" (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. As the trial court failed to find the ordinance ambiguous before interpreting it, we sustained the Homeowners' assignment of error and remanded the matter for the trial court to consider in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. We also ordered the trial court to clarify its basis for concluding that the Homeowners did not state a valid cause of action, and concluded that a review of the statute of limitations issue was premature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Upon remand, the trial court allowed additional briefing and held an oral hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the trial court again granted summary judgment to Norton. It concluded that the ordinance was not ambiguous and that the surcharge applied to the Homeowners. Additionally, it found that, even if the ordinance was ambiguous, it would still find in favor of Norton. Thereafter, the trial court essentially found the remaining issues were moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Homeowners have appealed, raising three assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE CITY OF NORTON FINDING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS ARE PART OF THE CITY OF NORTON'S SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM ACCORDING TO THE UNAMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE OF THE SUBJECT ORDINANCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE SUBJECT ORDINANCE WHEN IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THE TERM SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM ACCORDING TO PARTICULAR MEANING BUT ADOPTED ITS OWN MEANING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE CITY OF NORTON WHEN IT HELD THAT THE PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS ARE PART OF NORTON'S SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM BASED UPON AN AGREEMENT WHICH BY ITS VERY TERMS EXCLUDE THE PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In the first assignment of error, the Homeowners allege that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment by finding that the ordinance was unambiguous and that the Homeowners were part of Norton's sanitary sewer system. The Homeowners argue in their second assignment of error that the trial court erred in failing to adopt the definition\n   of \"sewerage system\" contained in the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative Code. In their third assignment of error, the Homeowners assert that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment by determining that the Homeowners are part of the Norton sanitary sewer system based upon the 1997 Agreement. Essentially, the assignments of error assert that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the ordinance did not apply to the Homeowners. Because of that, we will address them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} This Court reviews an award of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Once a moving party satisfies its burden of supporting its motion for summary judgment with sufficient and acceptable evidence pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), Civ.R. 56(E) provides that the non-moving party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the moving party's pleadings.

There appears to be no dispute that, if this Court concludes that the Homeowners are \"users connected to the City's sanitary sewer system[,]\" then the Homeowners would be subject to the surcharge in Loc.Ord. 1042.06(b) because it is undisputed that their sewers ultimately discharge into the Barberton sanitary sewer system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Loc.Ord. 1042.06(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Both parties argued that the ordinance was not ambiguous and that the text supported their respective position. The trial court found that the ordinance was unambiguous and concluded that the Homeowners were subject to the surcharges in the ordinance. However, while the trial court found the ordinance to be unambiguous, it also appears to have interpreted it; the trial court found for Norton because it concluded that the Homeowners were part of Norton's sanitary sewer system based upon the 1997 Agreement and the practices of Barberton and Norton, not based upon the plain language of the ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"When the language of the ordinance is unambiguous, the courts apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the words.

Thus, we agree that the trial court erred to the extent it concluded otherwise. We also determine that it is appropriate to proceed to analyze the merits of this appeal because the trial court conducted an alternate analysis; it found that, even if the ordinance was ambiguous, it would still find in favor of Norton, based upon the reasoning of the dissent in the prior appeal. We conclude, albeit for different reasons than those of the trial court, that, after considering the factors in R.C. 1.49, Norton City Council intended the Homeowners to be subject to the surcharge in Loc.Ord. 1042.06; thus, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Norton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 20} While the phrase \"the City's sanitary sewer system\" could refer to those sewers in some way owned by Norton, we cannot say that the plain language requires that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   968 (11th Ed. 2004) (defining a possessive as \"of, relating to or constituting a word, a word group, or a grammatical case that denotes ownership\n   <em>\n    or a relation analogous to ownership\n   </em>\n   ) (Emphasis added). Norton argued below that the phrase \"the City's sanitary sewer system\" should be read to encompass more than just the sewers owned by Norton and should include \"the entire sanitary sewer system that the City of Norton has established, by contract or otherwise, for the benefit of its citizens.\" Thus, Norton appears to have argued that \"the City's sanitary sewer system\" refers to the sewers within the territorial limits of Norton irrespective of ownership. Further, Norton pointed out that the evidence established that the Spring Avenue Outfall sewers were connected, directly or indirectly, to Norton owned sewers. Thus, the Homeowners could be considered \"users connected to the City's sanitary sewer system.\" We note that the ordinance did not specify in the opening sentence whether the users must be directly connected to Norton's sanitary sewer system. Given the foregoing, we conclude that the phrase \"users connected to the City's sanitary sewer system\" is ambiguous as it is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Thus, we turn to examining R.C. 1.49 to determine the legislative intent of Loc.Ord. 1042.06. Considering the uncodified portion of the ordinance and the study conducted by Finkbeiner, Pettis &amp; Strout,\n   Inc., we determine that Norton City Council clearly intended to include the Homeowners as \"users connected to the City's sanitary sewer system.\" The uncodified portion of the ordinance specified that Norton City Council \"determined the surcharges established [in the ordinance] are reasonable and proper, based upon all relevant circumstances and conditions and the information and analysis\" contained in the study. City of Norton Ordinance No. 68-2003. The study, as discussed above, provided that the monthly surcharge would \"be billed to customers who [we]re connected to water mains and sanitary sewers owned by Norton and to sanitary sewers owned by Summit County that eventually discharge into the Barberton sanitary sewer system.\" Additionally, the uncodified preamble stated that \"as an essential part of providing funds for reinvestment in the equity that the City has in the existing sanitary sewer system, this Council has determined that it is necessary to impose surcharges for lots and lands\n   <em>\n    connected directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer service system that ultimately discharges to the Barberton sewer system\n   </em>\n   with such surcharges to be determined, as set forth in this Ordinance,\n   <em>\n    so as to distribute anticipated maintenance, replacement and improvement costs as equitably as possible among customers\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Emphasis added.) City of Norton Ordinance No. 68-2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Given the foregoing, we conclude that Norton City Council intended for the Homeowners to be considered \"users connected to the City's sanitary sewer system[.]\" Loc.Ord. 1042.06. We see no need to rely on or interpret the 1997 Agreement to determine the legislative intent behind Loc.Ord. 1042.06, as we conclude it is clear from the uncodified portions of the ordinance and the study discussed above.
