Because petitioners did not demonstrate that their injuries were caused by sudden, unexpected events that were not risks inherent in their ordinary job duties, we conclude that neither petitioner established entitlement to the benefits sought. Therefore, we affirm in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Kelly v. DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   and reverse in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Sica v. DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of Kelly\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   James J. Kelly was a Town of Orangetown police officer who was on duty when Hurricane Sandy struck the area. After he was directed by his supervisor to take\n   cover and respond only to life-threatening calls, Kelly and another officer were dispatched to a residence on which a tree had fallen, trapping the residents inside. Upon arriving at the residence, Kelly observed that a tree had knocked down half of the roof, a rear wall and a side wall, that rain was pouring into the residence, that there were downed wires, and that the structure appeared to be \"very unstable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kelly called the fire department-to request that the department's technical response unit perform the actual rescue-and sought ambulances and additional police personnel. Given the extreme conditions created by the hurricane, Kelly estimated that it would take approximately two hours for the technical response unit to arrive, and other officers were instructed not to respond. Therefore, he entered the unstable building in response to \"blood-curdling screams\" for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon entering the structure, Kelly saw that a resident \"had been impaled and put through the floor into the basement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kelly climbed on top of a pile of debris and started throwing debris out of the back of the house in order to rescue the people who were underneath the pile. He felt a pain in his shoulder, but ignored it in an attempt to free the residents. Shortly thereafter, a rafter that was dangling from the portion of the roof that was still intact began to fall, and Kelly reached up to brace the rafter, further injuring his shoulder and neck. Kelly explained that, if he had not braced the falling rafter, debris would have landed on the other officer who was assisting in digging out the family. Kelly and the other officer were able to rescue one of the residents and partially extricate another during the time that they were in the structure before the fire department arrived. Kelly then exited the residence and the fire department extricated the remaining resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following a hearing on Kelly's application for accidental disability retirement benefits based upon the injuries he sustained during the rescue, a Hearing Officer determined that the injury-causing incident was an \"accident\" within the meaning of Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363 because \"[e]ntering that unstable structure was not within [petitioner's] regular and usual duties.\" Respondent Comptroller overruled the Hearing Officer's determination, concluding that Kelly failed to meet his burden of proving that his injury resulted from an \"accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kelly then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, challenging respondent's determination. Upon transfer, the Appellate Division confirmed the determination and dismissed the proceeding, with two Justices dissenting (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168665\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/1470/\">\n    137 A.D.3d 1470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168665\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/1470/\">\n    28 N.Y.S.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [3d Dept. 2016] ). The Court held that Kelly's injury resulted from a risk inherent in his employment as a police officer, whose duty it was to assist injured persons, and rejected any argument that Kelly's response was outside the scope of his job duties, noting that his supervisors had instructed him to respond to emergency calls involving life and limb (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168665\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/1470/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168665\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/1470/\">\n    at 1471-1472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168665\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/137/1470/\">\n    28 N.Y.S.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner appealed to this Court as of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of Sica\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pat Sica, a firefighter with the City of Yonkers, was injured when responding to a medical emergency-a 911 call indicating that an individual was having difficulty breathing at a local supermarket. Sica and his other crew members found two unconscious individuals, one inside and one outside a walk-in freezer. Sica performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation for approximately\n   25 to 30 minutes on the individual inside the freezer and then assisted the other unconscious individual.\n   Sica did not smell any odors or chemicals; nor did he see or hear anything indicating that chemicals might be involved in the incident. However, shortly after assisting the unconscious individuals, Sica began to feel nauseous and light-headed and was taken to the emergency room. It was later determined that he had been exposed to toxic gases, which were present in both the supermarket and the walk-in freezer as a result of the individuals cleaning the freezer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sica applied for accidental disability retirement benefits, claiming that he had suffered permanent injuries as a result of the incident. At the ensuing hearing, Sica acknowledged that his duties as a firefighter included responding to calls requesting emergency medical assistance, and that he had received training in handling chemical spills or leaks, as well as hazardous materials. The Hearing Officer concluded that the incident constituted an \"accident,\" because \"the injury resulted from an unexpected and unforeseeable event, which arose during the performance of [Sica's] routine employment duties.\" Respondent Comptroller overruled the Hearing Officer's determination, concluding that Sica failed to meet his burden of proving that his injury resulted from an accident sustained in service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After Sica commenced the instant CPLR article 78 proceeding, upon transfer, the Appellate Division annulled respondent's determination and remitted the matter to respondent to consider the issues raised by Sica regarding the application of the \"Heart Presumption\" contained in Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363-a (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793281\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/799/#p801\">\n    141 A.D.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793281\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/799/#p801\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [3d Dept. 2016] ). The Court concluded that Sica \"was not responding to a fire that presented the inherent and foreseeable risk of inhaling toxic gases or smoke,\" and that he \"was neither aware that the air within the supermarket contained toxic chemical gases, nor did he have any information that could reasonably have led him to anticipate, expect[,] or foresee the precise hazard when responding to the medical emergency at the supermarket\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793281\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/799/#p801\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793281\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/799/#p801\">\n    at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793281\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/799/#p801\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [citations omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court granted respondent leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363 (a) (1) provides that a member of the police and firefighters' retirement system\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"shall be entitled to an accidental disability retirement allowance if, at the time application therefor is filed, [the member] is ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [p]hysically or mentally incapacitated for performance of duty as the natural and proximate result of an accident not caused by [the member's] own willful negligence sustained in such service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court first defined \"accident\" in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lichtenstein v.

In\n   <em>\n    Matter of Kelly\n   </em>\n   , the claimed accidental event was the rafter falling toward Kelly's colleague as he attempted\n   to extricate the trapped family members. Respondent concluded that, as a police officer, Kelly was expected to assist injured persons, and that responding to emergencies is among the ordinary duties of police officers. Respondent found that, on the night in question, Kelly was instructed to respond to life-threatening emergencies, including the directive to assist injured persons at \"a house that had been caved in by a falling tree.\" It is not disputed that Kelly was acting within the scope of his job duties\n   when he responded to that emergency call. In light of the foregoing, while a different result would not have been unreasonable, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the determination that Kelly's actions in assisting the injured residents of the house during life-threatening conditions fell within his job duties, and that his injuries did not result from a sudden, unexpected event that was not a risk inherent in his duties as a police officer (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lenci v. DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4047869\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/92/1078/\">\n    92 A.D.3d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4047869\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/92/1078/\">\n    937 N.Y.S.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [3d Dept. 2012] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Matter of Sica\n   </em>\n   , the alleged accident was exposure to toxic fumes in the supermarket, leading to a disabling heart condition. Respondent noted that, as a participant in an emergency medical response team, Sica was fulfilling his regular duties as a firefighter in responding to the 911 call. Respondent further found that exposure to toxic chemicals was a risk for which Sica had been trained, that he had responded to a gas leak in the past, and that his job duties specifically required \"working with exposure to ... fumes, explosives, toxic materials, chemicals and corrosives,\" the particular risk that caused Sica's injury. Inasmuch as it is not unexpected that a firefighter whose job duties required him to respond to emergency medical calls would be exposed to toxic fumes in responding to a call for difficulty breathing, respondent rationally concluded that Sica's injuries were the result of a risk inherent in his ordinary duties as a firefighter (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Huether v.

Kelly's remaining arguments lack merit and Sica's alternative arguments are not properly before us. Accordingly, the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   should be affirmed, with costs, and the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Sica\n   </em>\n   should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   WILSON, J. (dissenting in Matter of Kelly, concurring in Matter of Sica).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I concur with the majority in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Sica v. DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   . Because the Comptroller's determination there was a reasonable exercise of his discretion, Mr. Sica is not entitled to accidental disability benefits. However, I dissent from the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Kelly v. DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   ; under any standard, his injury should be deemed accidental. Moreover, the entire statutory scheme concerning accidental and performance of duty disability desperately needs legislative attention. Even a cursory survey of case law reveals gross, inexplicable inconsistencies, largely derived from the law itself. The legislative scheme is difficult to apply in the context of inherently hazardous employment, and the legislative history offers no guidance. The courts have added to the confusion, to the point that it is almost a guessing game when trying to decide how cases will be resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While awaiting legislative action, courts should focus on: (i) whether the nature of the hazard is part of the bargained-for risks of the job and (ii) whether it is truly unexpected and out of the ordinary, or rather is part of the ordinary risks of daily life. If the hazard is outside both of those realms, accidental disability applies. In that regard, it is important to remember\n   that performance of duty injuries are compensable, but at a rate that is generally less favorable than accidental injuries. Although grey cases will always exist, the above taxonomy is straightforward and consistent with the policy objectives behind providing disability payments to injured employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sica\n   </em>\n   , I agree with the majority that the Comptroller's decision should be reinstated. The case turns on whether Mr. Sica-whose job involves both fighting fires and responding to medical emergencies-was acting as a firefighter or EMS worker, or whether the jobs are, in his case, inseparable. As a firefighter, job-related exposure to toxic fumes is to be expected, and firefighters receive relevant training (Mr. Sica testified as much) and are provided protective gear to don when appropriate. The same may not be true for an EMS worker who is not also a firefighter. The Comptroller's determination here-that Mr. Sica's training and experience as both a firefighter and EMS worker rendered his injury within the scope of his job, rather than an accident-is a factual determination that requires deference if supported by the record, which it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   I disagree, however, with the majority's decision as to Officer Kelly. While on duty during a hurricane when the police force generally was instructed to shelter in place, Officer Kelly was dispatched to a house partially collapsed by a tree. The tree had killed the father and trapped three family members, including young children, under debris. Consistent with protocol, Officer Kelly called for the fire department, EMS, and ambulances; however, the fire department and ambulances were reported to be two hours distant due to the hurricane. When Officers Kelly and Atchinson arrived, they heard screaming and saw that the house was partially collapsed, with water streaming through the roof. Although rescue in that situation is a job for firefighters, not police, fearing further injury to or death of the family because of the unavailability of the fire department, the officers attempted a rescue. During the rescue, a rafter suddenly gave way. To block it from falling on Officer Atchinson and the trapped girl, Officer Kelly blocked it with his forearm, saving them but permanently disabling himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although the hearing officer recommended approving his accidental disability request, the Comptroller denied it on the\n   ground that responding to emergencies is an ordinary duty of police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Comptroller's rationale is unsupportable as a matter of law, because it rests on the proposition that, because police officers have emergency response as part of their jobs, anything that happens to them as part of responding to an emergency is not an \"accident.\" Instead, to determine whether an occurrence is an accident we ask whether, in the totality of the circumstances and in light of the employee's regular job duties, it was \"a sudden, fortuitous mischance, unexpected, out of the ordinary, and injurious in impact\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lichtenstein v. Board of Trustees of Police Pension Fund of Police Dep't of City of N.Y., Art. II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4387504\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/57/1010/#p1012\">\n    57 N.Y.2d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=457%20N.Y.S.2d%20472\">\n    457 N.Y.S.2d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20N.E.2d%20946\">\n    443 N.E.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1982] ). Here, the confluence of factors (hurricane, family trapped in damaged house, unavailability of fire and EMS, beam falling directly on Officer Atchinson and trapped girl) is well within that definition-certainly more so than a police detective getting up from a desk chair and twisting his knee, which we held to be accidental in\n   <em>\n    McCambridge v.

In 1984, the legislature created performance of duty disability retirement benefits, and simultaneously eliminated accidental disability retirement benefits for persons hired after January 1, 1985 (L 1984, ch 661, \u00a7 1, codified at Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363-c ). Subsequently, the legislature re-enacted accidental disability retirement benefits for police officers and firefighters, without explaining how the two tiers should interact or why those injured by means of an \"accident\"-particularly ones of the sort that occur in everyday life, such as\n   slipping, tripping and falling-should receive greater benefits than officers or firefighters injured when engaged in heroic efforts (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1998 NY Laws ch 489, codified at R.S.S.L. \u00a7 444[c] ). Currently, Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363 awards greater disability benefits to officers who are injured due to \"accidents\" than to those injured in the performance of duty, absent any accident. The results often defy common sense: Officer Kelly would have received greater compensation if he had slipped when getting up from his chair, tripped over VCR cables in the police station, or backed into a spectator during a police-sponsored boxing match, than the majority now gives him for risking his life to save a family and his fellow officer during an unprecedented hurricane when no other help was available. Our case law consistently documents this absurd unfairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    IV.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Ideally, the legislature would act to provide some clear rules. Given the legislative scheme as it exists, we ask two questions. First, whether persons in the employee's line of work should reasonably expect to face the sort of hazard that injured the petitioner-i.e., was it part of the bargained-for risks of the job? Police officers and firefighters have inherently dangerous jobs, and certain risks are to be expected. A police officer shot by a suspect is not the victim of an accident, nor is one who is injured by a crash in a high-speed car chase, even though we conventionally call the latter an \"accident.\" Those are risks expected in the nature of the work, and officers contemplate and are compensated for such risks, by way of salary, benefits and performance-of-duty disability. In those cases, accidental disability should not apply. However, some risks\n   <em>\n    must be\n   </em>\n   outside the realm of the ordinary duties of police officers and firefighters, else first\n   responders could never suffer an accident while responding to an emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, if the risk is outside the bargained-for risks of the job, we ask whether it is sufficiently out of the ordinary risks of everyday life to constitute an accident. In this regard, the existing case law holds that \"[a]n injury occurring as the result of the petitioner's own misstep or inattention does not constitute an accident so as to qualify for benefits in accord with the provisions of this law\" (\n   <em>\n    Meyer v. New York State Comptroller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053177\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/92/1122/#p1122\">\n    92 A.D.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1122-1123,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053177\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/92/1122/#p1122\">\n    938 N.Y.S.2d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [3d Dept. 2012] ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Dilello v.

Again the case law is full of oddities. In\n   <em>\n    Starnella\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that an on-duty police officer's fall down a flight of stairs \"as a result of [his] own misstep,\" was \"not so out-of-the-ordinary or unexpected as to constitute an accidental injury\" (\n   <em>\n    Starnella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"725129,725093,725047\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/92/836/\">\n    92 N.Y.2d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"725129\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/92/836/725129/\">\n    677 N.Y.S.2d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"725129\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/92/836/725129/\">\n    699 N.E.2d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), while it has been held that a firefighter whose foot gave way on a slippery substance that blended in with the roadway was injured in an accident, despite the commonplace nature of the incident (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sammon v. DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475926\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/97/952/#p953\">\n    97 A.D.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475926\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/97/952/#p953\">\n    948 N.Y.S.2d 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [3d Dept. 2012] ). If these cases are reconcilable, no explanation grounded in policy has been offered for the choices that courts have made. Until the legislature acts to address the standard, the test is whether the event precipitating the injury was so \"unexpected, out of the ordinary\" (\n   <em>\n    Lichtenstein\n   </em>\n   at 1012,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=457%20N.Y.S.2d%20472\">\n    457 N.Y.S.2d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20N.E.2d%20946\">\n    443 N.E.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) as to constitute an accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Taken together, if the hazard falls outside of both the bargained-for risks of the job and everyday risks, the petitioner should be entitled to enhanced accidental benefits. Under this framework, Officer Kelly would receive accidental disability benefits. Applying step one, the hazard was outside of the bargained-for risks of his job. Officer Kelly is not a firefighter (if he were, the result would be different). Although police officers' duties include assisting injured persons and requesting medical assistance, entering collapsing buildings and fending off falling rafters during a hurricane when fire and EMS workers are not available is not an ordinary part of their jobs. Indeed, the uncontroverted record evidence is that Officer Kelly would not have been disciplined had he remained outside the house, leaving the family to whatever fate lay ahead. When other help is unavailable, officers may have no choice but to try to rescue people and I, for one, hope that they will feel and act as Officer Kelly did. But that is an extraordinary job hazard, not an ordinary one. As Officer Kelly testified, the protocol was to call for the fire department and maintain the perimeter until technical support arrived. He had no training in entering collapsing buildings, but he felt he \"had no choice\" but to try to save the family. On that day, Officer Kelly\n   <em>\n    took the place of\n   </em>\n   a firefighter, bearing risks of a job that was not his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning to step two, the hazard was certainly \"out of the ordinary.\" In the ordinary course of our lives, we bend over; we rise from chairs; we walk down steps, some of which were previously visited by dogs; but we do not save lives by deflecting\n   burning beams in collapsing homes during a hurricane-we imagine that for superheroes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly v DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   : Judgment affirmed, with costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sica v DiNapoli\n   </em>\n   : Judgment reversed, with costs, and petition dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Matter of Kelly v DiNapoli: Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Garcia and Feinman concur.
