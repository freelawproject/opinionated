O'Neill, appeals after her conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence (OUI) of intoxicating liquor, second offense, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   )(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She contends there was insufficient evidence of impairment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </em>\n   . The only claim on appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence that the defendant \"was impaired by the influence of intoxicating liquor,\"-an element that the Commonwealth establishes with proof of diminished capacity to operate safely.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AdonSoto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457221\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/497/#p509\">\n    475 Mass. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zeininger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270633\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/775/#p778\">\n    459 Mass. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 778, cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12443968,12443969,12443970,12443923,12443966,12443967\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/462/\">\n    132 S. Ct. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Taking the evidence of impairment, as we must, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we are persuaded that \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   rational trier of fact could have found th[is] essential[ ] element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Penn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362275\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/610/#p618\">\n    472 Mass. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618 (2015), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596742,12596743,12596744,12596745,12596746\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1656/\">\n    136 S. Ct. 1656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    St. Hilaire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145058\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/338/#p343\">\n    470 Mass. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Here, Milford police Officer Antonio Dinis opined that the defendant was intoxicated. He based this opinion upon several factors, including the nature of the accident (two-car accident in which defendant's car rear-ended parked vehicle and then continued off road onto grass of residence), the defendant's red and bloodshot eyes, the odor of alcohol emanating from the defendant's breath, her slurred speech, her unsteadiness on her feet (losing her balance while walking, including during a field sobriety test), her inability to follow simple instructions when performing the nine-step walk and turn field sobriety test, and her admission to having consumed alcohol. This evidence alone is sufficient to meet the Commonwealth's burden on impairment. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lavendier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842274\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/501/#p506\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506-507 (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   However, the Commonwealth's evidence went further. Officer Dinis also testified that the defendant was acting belligerently, and the Commonwealth introduced videotape evidence that corroborated his testimony. In addition, the defendant's admission to drinking, and the evidence of the defendant's breath test results, which showed a blood alcohol level bordering on the statutory legal limit, see generally G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ), tied the defendant's impairment specifically to alcohol. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moreira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"900762\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/385/792/#p795\">\n    385 Mass. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (1982) (\"A jury may infer that a defendant was under the influence of liquor if [she] scored a reading\" over the legal limit);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20385\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (2017) (physical symptoms and admission to consuming beers tied impairment to alcohol). In our view, this evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn from it sufficiently support the defendant's conviction. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dostie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274495\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/372/#p375\">\n    425 Mass. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375-376 (1997) (fact finder may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence).

L. c. 89, \u00a7 4A, and, after the Commonwealth rested, allowed the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty on a charge of operating while under the influence of drugs, G.
