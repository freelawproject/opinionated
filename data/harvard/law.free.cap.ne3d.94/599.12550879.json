This Court affirms in part, reverses in part, and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 7, 2015, House filed a complaint against Iacovelli and Windward Enterprises alleging claims of wrongful termination, conversion, and violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Iacovelli promptly filed an answer generally denying the claims in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} With leave of court, House filed an amended complaint alleging a sole count of wrongful termination in violation of public policy. House alleged that Iacovelli had refused to comply with multiple provisions in R.C. Chapter 4141 by failing to accurately report House's income and make the requisite contributions to Ohio's unemployment compensation insurance program. The allegations centered on House's tenure as a server at the Riverstone Tavern, a restaurant that is operated by Iacovelli and his business, Windward Enterprises. House worked 35 to 50 hours per\n   week and was paid at a variable hourly rate that accounted for her ability to collect tips depending on the time of the shift. House alleged that she approached Iacovelli to address concerns about the payroll not accurately reflecting the amount of pay and tips that she had earned. Iacovelli admitted that he had failed to pay for all of House's unemployment compensation insurance under Ohio law. The amended complaint specified that Iacovelli admitted to underreporting her income by $11,000. House further alleged that instead of addressing the issue, Iacovelli accused House of creating \"too much drama\" and terminated her employment. After she was fired, Iacovelli urged House to mislead the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services (\"ODJFS\") by stating that she was terminated for \"lack of work\" in order to qualify for unemployment benefits. In exchange for her cooperation in this ploy, Iacovelli offered to pay House $150 every two weeks to offset her refused unemployment compensation due to Iacovelli's failure to make adequate payments under the unemployment compensation insurance program. House stressed in her amended complaint that she did not agree to participate in Iacovelli's \"joint schemes to defraud the government and cheat her out of employment benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Iacovelli initially filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). House filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The trial court issued a journal entry denying the motion to dismiss on August 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} When Iacovelli did not file an answer to the amended complaint within fourteen days of the denial of the motion to dismiss, House filed a motion for default judgment. Iacovelli promptly filed a motion for leave to file an answer instanter and objection to the motion for default judgment. The trial court issued a journal entry granting Iacovelli's motion and recognizing the filing of the answer to the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Thereafter, Iacovelli filed a second \"motion to dismiss\" wherein he argued that he should be dismissed from the lawsuit because the nature of House's claim implicated only Windward Enterprises as a corporate entity and not Iacovelli in his individual capacity. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that it was untimely and Iacovelli had failed to obtain leave of court. In so doing, the trial court noted that the matter was set for trial on October 17, 2016, and that Iacovelli had not filed his motion until September 23, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 3, 2016, Iacovelli filed a motion for a pretrial determination regarding the first two elements of House's wrongful termination claim. Iacovelli stressed that the trial court should hold a pretrial hearing because the clarity and jeopardy elements of House's claim involved questions of law. In the alternative, Iacovelli requested that the trial court reopen summary judgment proceedings. House filed multiple briefs in opposition to Iacovelli's motion for a pretrial determination. The trial court subsequently issued a journal entry wherein it scheduled the matter for a non-oral hearing and set a deadline for the filing of briefs and memoranda. Thereafter, House filed a \"position statement on public policy at issue[.]\" Iacovelli filed a responsive brief in support of his motion for a pretrial determination. On November 21, 2016, the trial court issued a journal entry concluding that while House satisfied the clarity element in support of her public policy wrongful termination claim, she had failed to satisfy the jeopardy as a matter of law. The trial court dismissed the sole claim in the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On appeal, House raises three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE APPELLANT BY DISMISSING THE PUBLIC TORT CLAIM UNDER THE THEORY THE APPELLANT COULD NOT PROVE THE JEOPARDY ELEMENT OF THE CLAIM WAS SATISFIED BECAUSE OF THE ADEQUACY OF THE STATUTORY REMEDIES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In her first assignment of error, House contends that the trial court erred by dismissing this matter on the grounds that she could not satisfy the jeopardy element of her wrongful termination claim. House argues that the statutory remedies set forth in R.C. 4141.27 fail to adequately protect society's public policy interest in establishing and maintaining an unemployment compensation program. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In\n   <em>\n    Greeley v. Miami Valley Maint.

With respect to the jeopardy element, however, the trial court determined that House failed to satisfy that element of her claim for wrongful termination as a matter of law. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reasoned that \"there already exists a statutory remedy that adequately protects society's interests[ ] [as] R.C. 4141.27 provides that the Attorney General may bring such actions for violations of R.C. 4141.01 to R.C. 4141.46.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} At the outset, we note that Iacovelli's \"motion for a pretrial determination\" was not a valid motion under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.

R.C. 4141.27 does not contain any provision that would provide House with a \"meaningful opportunity\" to return to the position she occupied prior to the adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coon\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26, citing\n   <em>\n    Wiles\n   </em>\n   at 245,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-3994\">\n    2002-Ohio-3994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20N.E.2d%20526\">\n    773 N.E.2d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Iacovelli suggests that the statute sets forth a private remedy in R.C. 4141.281(A), which allows an employee to file an administrative appeal of the determination of unemployment compensation \"benefit rights\" by the director of the ODJFS. It stands to reason that the first step an employee would take upon noticing a payroll discrepancy is to raise that issue with their employer. While the administrative appeal process provides a viable mechanism to challenge a determination of benefits, it fails to set forth a remedial scheme for a situation such as this where an employee is terminated merely for inquiring about why her pay did not reflect the amount she had earned. Under these circumstances, we cannot accept Iacovelli's contention that the administrative appeal process provides House with a meaningful opportunity to return to the position she was in prior to the time she approached Iacovelli with her concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Moreover, the particular circumstances of this case illustrate why disallowing\n   House to proceed with her claim could have a chilling effect on the willingness of employees to report violations. House alleged in the amended complaint that when she approached Iacovelli to address discrepancies with her pay, Iacovelli admitted to underreporting her income and failing to make payments to the unemployment compensation insurance fund. Instead of rectifying the issue, Iacovelli not only terminated House on account of the fact that she was creating \"too much drama,\" but also attempted to leverage House into participating in a scheme where she would be compensated for intentionally misleading the ODJFS. Absent adequate statutory remedies, House must be allowed to pursue a public policy wrongful termination claim in order to avoid fostering an environment where employees face the prospect of losing their jobs when they seek to obtain the benefits they have earned under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} House's first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE APPELLANT BY NOT GRANTING A MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT GIVEN [THAT] THE APPELLEE FAILED TO FILE AN ANSWER ON TIME AFTER ITS MOTION TO DISMISS WAS OVERRULED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In her third assignment of error, House contends that the trial court erred when it denied her motion for default judgment.

The trial court issued an order denying the motion on August 18, 2016. Shortly thereafter, on September 8, 2016, House filed a motion for default judgment wherein she argued that judgment should be rendered in her favor because Iacovelli failed to file an answer to the amended complaint with 14 days of the denial of the motion to dismiss as required by Civ.R. 12(A)(2). The next day, Iacovelli filed a motion for leave to file an answer instanter as well as a brief in opposition to the motion for default judgment. The trial court granted Iacovelli's motion and deemed the answer admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On appeal, House contends that the trial court should have granted the motion for default judgment given the \"lop sided unfairness allowed to [Iacovelli]\" during the course of the trial court proceedings. House's argument is not well taken. This case does not involve a scenario where the defendant \"failed to plead or otherwise defend\" as contemplated by Civ.R. 55(A). Prior to the filing of House's motion for default judgment, Iacovelli had keenly litigated the dispute by filing an answer to the original complaint, as well as a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Moreover, though Iacovelli did not immediately file an answer to the amended complaint subsequent to the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss, Iacovelli\n   promptly responded to the motion for default judgment by filing his answer the following day. Under these circumstances, where Iacovelli showed a commitment to vigorously defending the lawsuit, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Iacovelli to file an answer to the amended complaint and rejecting the motion for default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE APPELLANT BY GRANTING A MOTION TO QUASH A SUBPOENA SEEKING UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION RECORDS RELATING TO THE APPELLEE'S EMPLOYMENT OF THE APPELLANT AND BY FINDING IN EFFECT OHIO R.C. 4141.21 IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} House withdrew her second assignment of error at oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 27} House's first assignment of error is sustained.
