Though the motion judge did not address the question of staleness, after concluding that the CI did not satisfy the veracity prong, we discern no merit in the claim. The affidavit recites both that the CI had made his observations of an illegal firearm within the prior thirty days, and that the possession of the firearm was likely a product of gang activity. Accordingly, it bespeaks the sort of continuous conduct that has diminished concerns over staleness in other settings. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Cruz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157395\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/838/#p843\">\n     430 Mass. 838\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 843 (2000) ;\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     DiStefano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3989887\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/22/535/#p541\">\n     22 Mass. App. Ct. 535\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 541 (1986). Moreover, the affiant explained the absence of precision in the stated time frame by reference to the same concern for preserving the confidentiality of the CI as we have discussed previously.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
