Barsell, guilty of two counts of aggravated assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant subsequently filed a motion for a new trial in which he claimed that the Commonwealth had withheld exculpatory evidence-a video recording (video) of an interview of one of the victims-despite the defendant's specific discovery request. The same judge denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. Essentially for the reasons given by judge in his memorandum of decision denying the new trial motion, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . During pretrial discovery, the defendant requested \"[t]he substance of any oral statements made by any witness, including the alleged victim(s) that have not been reduced to writing\" and copies of \"all drawings of the alleged crime scene.\" At trial, the arresting officer, Detective Kristopher Dees, testified on cross-examination that he had taken a statement from one of the victims, Davin Gordon, and that the statement had been video-recorded. Neither defense counsel nor the prosecutor was aware that this video existed. The judge, noting that a jury-waived trial is \"a little different in the sense that I can give you a little extra time to try to determine, both of you, where this recording is,\" suspended Dees's testimony. The prosecutor proposed to bring the video to court the next day for defense counsel to view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The following morning defense counsel watched the video, which was of extremely poor quality, but noted several elements of the interview that appeared to be \"fodder for cross-examination\" of Gordon. Defense counsel stated that if the Commonwealth had produced the video earlier, \"I would have taken it to a forensic expert that I use on a regular basis\" to see if it could be enhanced and transcribed. He also noted that during the interview Gordon drew a diagram, which the Commonwealth had failed to preserve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defense counsel \"ask[ed] that the case be dismissed with prejudice\" because of the Commonwealth's discovery violation. The judge denied defense counsel's request, finding no \"egregious prosecutorial misconduct\" warranting dismissal, but offered to \"entertain a motion for costs at this stage [and] to suspend the trial, if you'd like, and let you have the opportunity to have [the recording] enhanced.\" Defense counsel declined the judge's offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In preparing for this appeal, appellate counsel placed a compact disc of the recording in \"an ordinary Dell computer\" and \"was able to see and hear the video without difficulty.\" She obtained a transcript, which was included in the defendant's new trial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .
