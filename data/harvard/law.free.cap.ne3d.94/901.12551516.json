Boyer's, Motion for Judicial Release. The determinative issue before this court is whether the State may appeal the granting of a motion for judicial release for a third-degree felony pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(B)(2). For the\n   following reasons, we hold that it may not and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 12, 2015, Keith A. Boyer entered a plea of guilty to Aggravated Vehicular Assault, a felony of the third degree in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a), in the Portage County Court of Common Pleas. In the Written Plea of Guilty, Boyer was advised that he was subject to a \"MANDATORY PRISON TERM OF EITHER 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 YEARS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Following a sentencing hearing on May 15, 2015, Boyer was sentenced to \"a term of imprisonment of Two (2) years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 21, 2016, Boyer filed a Motion for Judicial Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 26, 2016, a hearing was held on Boyer's Motion, at which the State opposed release on the grounds that Boyer's sentence was mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 28, 2016, the trial court granted the Motion for Judicial Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 6, 2016, the State of Ohio filed its Notice of Appeal, raising the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"[1.] The trial court erred in granting Boyer's motion for judicial release under the authority of\n   <em>\n    State v.

The fact that this court may have inherent power to vacate a void judgment does not obviate the need to properly invoke this court's jurisdiction prior to the exercise of such power. If a court does not have jurisdiction, how does the court have the ability to exercise its inherent authority? A lower court may have inherent authority to vacate a void judgment, but an appellate court still has to have jurisdiction to take any action with respect to the lower court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The dissent's\n   expansive claim that void judgments may be vacated at any time and under any circumstances provides litigants with an alluring \"nuclear option\" by which legal technicalities, such as a timely filed notice of appeal or final order, may be circumvented. It is no exaggeration to say that the number of appeals challenging purportedly \"void\" judgments, particularly sentencing judgments, has increased and will continue to do so given the obvious advantages of claiming that the challenged judgment was void ab initio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Moreover, the doctrine is not properly invoked under the circumstances of this case. The void judgment doctrine, as conceived of in this \"modern era\" with its \"more sophisticated understanding of individual rights,\" holds that \"[t]he only sentence which a trial court may impose is that provided for by statute,\" and that the failure to impose a statutorily mandated sentence is more than a mere error in the exercise of jurisdiction, but, rather, \"an act that lacks both statutory and constitutional authority.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

I do not disagree with the majority's general analysis on this substantive point. I dissent because the trial court transcended its authority in releasing appellee, an ineligible offender serving a mandatory term of imprisonment. Because the trial court's action of granting an ineligible offender judicial release was not authorized by R.C. 2929.20, the governing statute, the trial court's judgment is void. I would accordingly hold that, notwithstanding the state's failure to properly move this court pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), we should exercise our inherent authority to vacate the trial court's void judgment. Thus, under these unique circumstances, the trial court's judgment should be reversed and remanded for further proceedings with instructions to the trial court to deny appellee's motion for judicial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.20(A)(1), judicial release is available\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to \"eligible offenders.\" An \"eligible offender\" is one who is serving one or more non-mandatory prison terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=942%20N.E.2d%20332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Appellee was serving a two-year, mandatory term.

Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , appellee was subject to a mandatory, two-year term of imprisonment and, as a matter of law, was not an \"eligible offender\" under R.C. 2929.20(A)(1).

No. 94APE10-1490,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20250810\">\n    1995 WL 250810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (Apr. 27, 1995) (concluding that if an entry is void ab initio, \"[w]hether or not the * * * entry constitutes a final appealable order does not affect appellant's ability to appeal the matter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Because the court possesses the inherent and independent authority to vacate a void judgment, irrespective of jurisdictional barriers that would otherwise preclude action, the state's failure to invoke this court's jurisdiction by statute or via motion, per R.C. 2945.67(A), is without consequence. The trial court's judgment, granting appellee, an ineligible offender, judicial release is void. As a result, I would vacate that judgment and reverse and remand the case for further proceedings, pursuant to our inherent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} I recognize this disposition stands in conflict with several of our sister districts that have dismissed similar cases based upon a prosecuting attorney's inability to appeal under R.C. 2953.08(B), notwithstanding a trial court's lack of authority to award judicial release to an ineligible offender serving a mandatory prison term for felonies of the third, fourth, or fifth degree.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
