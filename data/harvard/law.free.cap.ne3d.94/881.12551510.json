A judge denied that motion and a subsequent motion for reconsideration, recognizing that, although \"dismissal of a complaint is a severe sanction, and [is] not usually employed by this judge ..., the plaintiff has failed to this date to establish excusable neglect for the failure to provide answers to interrogatories.\" The plaintiff appeals; discerning no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The defendant served interrogatories on April 7, 2016. Although plaintiff's counsel was out of the office at that time, due to a fall suffered in late March, another attorney in her office was sufficiently involved in the case that, on April 27, he signed (or authorized defense counsel to sign on his behalf) a joint motion to extend the tracking order deadlines. Defense counsel was not informed of the expected duration of plaintiff's counsel's medical leave, that it would delay discovery responses, or that the plaintiff sought an extension for serving those responses. Plaintiff's counsel later acknowledged that no one in her office sent the interrogatories to the plaintiff himself during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On June 10, having received no interrogatory answers, the defendant served a final request for answers pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 33(a)(3). Plaintiff's counsel, having recovered from her fall, returned to the office on June 13. In a July 7 telephone conversation, plaintiff's counsel asked, and defense counsel agreed, to postpone the plaintiff's previously scheduled deposition from July 20 to August 2, as the plaintiff would be on vacation on July 20. Defense counsel later asserted that, in this conversation, plaintiff's counsel (1) acknowledged receipt of the final request for answers, (2) stated that the plaintiff had not yet signed the answers, and (3) did not request any extension. Plaintiff's counsel did not contradict this account of the conversation, although she asserted, without specifying any time period, that \"[t]here had been some discussion with [d]efendant's counsel about the interrogatories and [p]laintiff's counsel was under the impression that as long as the interrogatory answers were received prior to the deposition, that would be sufficient.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   July 20-the fortieth and thus last day for receipt of answers pursuant to the defendant's rule 33(a)(3) final request-came and went without the defendant receiving any answers or other response. Defense counsel began drafting his rule 33(a)(4) application for final judgment. One week later, on July 27, plaintiff's counsel sent defense counsel an electronic mail message (e-mail) stating that she had the interrogatory answers completed, but was waiting for the plaintiff to sign them; she provided no date by which they would be signed, nor did she request any extension. Defense counsel received the e-mail but proceeded to file the rule 33(a)(4) application that day. The next day, plaintiff's counsel sent by facsimile signed interrogatory answers to defense counsel, followed by mailed originals, which defense counsel received on August 5. In the meantime, on August 3, the clerk entered a final judgment of dismissal, as required by Mass.R.Civ.P. 33(a)(6), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20Mass.%201404\">\n    454 Mass. 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The plaintiff promptly filed a rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from judgment, asserting excusable neglect; this was denied, as was his motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"[T]he majority of cases decided under rule 60(b) since its adoption in the Commonwealth have shown a marked deference to the decision reached by lower court judges[,] reflecting, in our opinion, a policy that the judges in the motion and assignment sessions are in the best position to assess the merits of requests for this type of relief under the requirements of balancing efficient case flow with the litigants' rights to a trial on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Berube\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3953984\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/7/426/#p434\">\n    7 Mass.
