We recite the basic facts as the jury could have found them, reserving other facts for later discussion. On June 2, 2014, the defendant stood in the driveway of his residence in Taunton, arguing with his former girl friend. Three of the defendant's friends, including Bessley Vasquez, looked on. Ann Haelsen, the defendant's neighbor, was gardening from the back steps of her residence. She lived on the second floor of the building and Vasquez lived on the first. Haelsen and Vasquez's building is set \"[ten] or [twenty] yards\" behind the defendant's home; from the back steps Haelsen had a clear view of the defendant's driveway and the events that transpired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Haelsen observed a sports utility vehicle (SUV) slow down in front of the defendant's house and then speed away. Vasquez ran in and back out of his residence, tucking something into his pants and returning to the defendant's driveway. Haelsen then saw two men at the back gate of the park located directly across the street from the defendant's home. One of the men at the gate made a motion like he was going to fire a gun, and Haelsen simultaneously heard \"two or three pops.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Vasquez made a motion of tossing something to the defendant. The defendant made a catching motion, walked into the middle of the street, held his arms straight out in front of him with his hands clasped together, and fired \"a few\" shots toward the men at the gate. The defendant then moved closer to the park and fired \"a couple more\" shots. The men at the park ran away, and the defendant ran back into his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The police recovered six nine millimeter cartridge casings and two spent projectiles near the defendant's residence; at least four of the six casings were fired from the same gun. Haelsen never saw a gun in the defendant's hand, and the police never recovered the gun used in the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of evidence\n   </em>\n   . \" 'Firearm' is defined in [G. L.] c. 140, \u00a7 121, to mean a 'pistol, revolver or other weapon of any description loaded or unloaded, from which a shot or bullet can be discharged and of which the length of barrel is less than sixteen inches.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813512\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/383/750/#p753\">\n    383 Mass. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (1981). The defendant argues that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the barrel length of the gun fired by the defendant was less than sixteen inches, and the judge should have prevented his firearm related charges from reaching the jury. \"We review a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there is sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bruneau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361414\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/510/#p518\">\n    472 Mass. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 (2015), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676-677 (1979). \"The burden on the Commonwealth in proving that the weapon is a firearm in the statutory sense is not a heavy one.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nieves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"382227\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/43/1/#p2\">\n    43 Mass.

Six nine millimeter casings were recovered from the crime scene, and Detective Michael Bonenfant stated, based on his experience with nine millimeter guns, that their barrels tend to be four and one-half inches in length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the Commonwealth did not present the jury with the gun the defendant used, the Commonwealth presented sufficient circumstantial evidence for a rational trier of fact to \"conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun in question was not a weapon with a barrel sixteen inches long or longer.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sperrazza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029614\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/372/667/#p670\">\n    372 Mass. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Expert opinion from lay witness\n   </em>\n   . As noted, Bonenfant testified that the typical barrel length of a nine millimeter firearm is four and one-half inches. The Commonwealth did not move to qualify Bonenfant as an expert before eliciting this opinion. Although the defendant raised no objection to this testimony at trial, he now contends as an independent ground for reversal that the judge should not have allowed Bonenfant to testify about the barrel lengths of nine millimeter guns without qualifying him as an expert. We address this argument under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alphas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157268\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/8/#p13\">\n    430 Mass. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13 (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We conclude there was no error. The judge did not make an express ruling on Bonenfant's qualifications; \"[h]owever, the fact that the officer's qualifications had previously been laid out, and the judge's allowance of his testimony, clearly imply a prior determination by the judge that the witness was qualified, through his experience and training, to offer an opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Leibovich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Antonnellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895679\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/410/568/#p571\">\n    410 Mass. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571-572 (1991). \"It was not necessary for the judge expressly to qualify [Bonenfant] as an expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183112\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/826/#p834\">\n    442 Mass. 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834 (2004). Moreover, had the defendant timely objected, the Commonwealth likely could have laid the foundation for Bonenfant to offer his opinion, and it would have been within the judge's discretion to admit it. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817137\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/1/#p5\">\n    449 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (2007) (\"A judge has broad discretion regarding the admission of expert testimony, and we review that decision only for abuse of discretion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Prosecution's opening statement\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly undermined the jury's function during his opening statement by invoking \"the collective common sense of the public,\" and that the judge compounded the error when he stated in his preliminary instructions that the jury should \"determine the facts as a group.\" \"Because there was no objection to the prosecutor's opening statement, we review the defendant's claim only to ascertain whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oliveira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833244\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/74/49/#p56\">\n    74 Mass.

Indeed, the judge inquired whether the defendant wanted an instruction on self-defense and defense of another, but defense counsel, after consulting with the defendant, specifically declined, explaining that these affirmative defenses would be inconsistent his trial strategy: \"No one saw a gun. No one put a gun in my client's hands. I think we'd go along with that. You have to keep the instruction out.\" The defendant \"did not, as he might have, argue that: I didn't do it [namely, possess or fire a gun]; but if I did do it, it was self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hakkila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1606130\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/42/129/#p130\">\n    42 Mass.
