Due to the trial court's failure to obtain an explanation of circumstances to support appellant's plea before finding him guilty, we reverse his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 23, 2016, a complaint was filed, charging appellant with resisting arrest, a misdemeanor of the second degree. The matter was set for trial on June 23, 2016. However, on that date, pursuant to a plea bargain, appellant pled no contest to resisting arrest as charged in the complaint. At the plea hearing, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Court: And Mr. Cochrane, on the Rule 11 Agreement, is that your signature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Cochrane: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Court: That indicates upon a plea of no contest, recommendation of $750.00 fine, $500.00 suspended, 90 days in jail, 60 suspended, credit for 30 days he served and probation for one year, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Defense Counsel: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Court: All right.

On appeal, appellant states for his sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"The appellant's conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant argues that because he entered a no contest plea, the trial court was required, pursuant to R.C. 2937.07, to obtain an explanation of circumstances before finding him guilty. He argues that the court's failure to do so required dismissal of the charges against him. In contrast, while the state concedes the court erred in not obtaining an explanation of circumstances, the state argues this court should remand for a new hearing on the no contest plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} R.C. 2937.07 provides in part: \"A plea to a misdemeanor offense of \"no contest\" * * * shall constitute an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint and * * * the judge * * * may make a finding of guilty or not guilty from the explanation of the circumstances of the offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"[A] no contest plea may not be the basis for a finding of guilty without an explanation of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Cuyahoga Falls v.

Double jeopardy has no application to the present case since the foregoing concerns are not implicated: Cochrane chose not to object to the lack of an explanation of circumstances, filed a direct appeal of the judgment accepting his own entry of a no contest plea, and seeks to have that plea invalidated. There is no additional risk that he will be found guilty of a crime for which he is innocent. Extra time will be expended only to have the explanation of the crime discussed in open court, which should have occurred when Cochrane originally entered his plea. This will lead to no embarrassment or anxiety beyond that experienced by every defendant who enters a plea accepting responsibility for committing a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Although this court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , recently noted that the \" 'explanation of circumstances' appears to be akin to a sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis,\" this statement was made in dicta and, thus, has no impact on the law of this district.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-6987\">\n    2016-Ohio-6987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%2063\">\n    72 N.E.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33 (11th Dist.).\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   did not address the double jeopardy issue and this court ultimately was not required to determine any issues relating to the \"explanation of circumstances,\" since such an explanation is not required when a guilty plea is entered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. The existing precedent of this court should not be ignored in order to apply dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 34} While other appellate districts have held that double jeopardy should apply to bar the conviction of a defendant if an explanation of circumstances is not given, this court is not bound by decisions of other appellate districts, and it is necessary to follow the well-established precedent of this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Trumbull Cty. Child Support Enforcement Agency\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2000-T-0025,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20114971\">\n    2001 WL 114971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (Feb. 9, 2001) (authority of other appellate districts is \"merely persuasive authority and, as such, is not binding upon us\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Further, these cases do not provide a compelling justification to allow a defendant to avoid a serious charge and a crime he voluntarily chose to enter a plea of no contest to, which \"constitute[s] an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint.\" R.C. 2937.07. Requiring a new plea hearing will serve to remedy the error made by the court in failing to follow the appropriate procedure for accepting the plea and protects Cochrane's rights under R.C. 2937.07. There is no need to make a finding that insufficient evidence exists when the true concern is that the explanation of circumstances requirement was not met, rather than that evidence to prove the charge did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 36} For the foregoing reasons, the failure of the trial court to require an explanation of circumstances, in the interest of justice, warrants reversal for a new plea hearing rather than dismissal of the charge against the defendant outright. For this reason, I concur in part and dissent in part and would remand for the trial court to conduct additional proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
