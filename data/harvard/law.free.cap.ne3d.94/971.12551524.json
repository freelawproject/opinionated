Jones in the underlying case. Jones appealed the same day the November 21, 2016 final judgment was entered. The State filed its motion for leave and notice of cross-appeal 30 days thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The State seeks to raise four issues with respect to the trial court's legal determinations as to merger, allied offenses, and the propriety of \"residual doubt\" argument to the jury. The trial court's determinations on merger and allied offenses were journalized in two written decisions, both entered prior to the final judgment entry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. a September 29, 2016 \"Order Granting in Part and Overruling in Part Defendant's Rule 29 Motion at the End of the State's Case-in-Chief and at the End of Defendant's Case,\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. an October 6, 2016 \"Decision and Order Regarding Merger of Aggravated Murder Counts and Related Aggravating Circumstances Specifications.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The final judgment entry was issued thereafter, on November 21, 2016. The State's December 21 motion for leave and notice of cross-appeal were filed more than 30 days after the September 29 and October 6 orders, but within 30 days of the November 21 final judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} It appeared to this court that the State's motion for leave and notice of cross-appeal may be untimely as to the September 29 and October 6 orders.

Neither R.C. 2945.67(A) nor App.R. 5(C) specifically states whether the 30 days to appeal begins to run at the time the interlocutory \"other decision\" is issued, or whether the State must wait until the case is resolved by final appealable order to appeal. The timing issue identified by this court thus turns on the resolution of a related finality question: does a State's appeal by leave of court require that there be a final appealable order entered in the case, or can the State take an immediate appeal from a non-final order? If the State can take an immediate appeal, and the 30 days begins to run at the time of the \"other decision,\" then the State's motion for leave to cross-appeal here would be untimely. If the State must wait for a final appealable order, and the 30 days begins to run only upon the issuance of that order, then the State's motion for leave to cross-appeal here would be timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The State argues that it could not appeal the September 29 and October 6 orders when issued because they were interlocutory and could not be appealed until the trial court issued a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   App.R. 4(A)(2) (\"a party who wishes to appeal from an order that is not final upon its entry but subsequently becomes final-such as an order that merges into a final order entered by the clerk or that becomes final upon dismissal of the action-shall file the notice of appeal required by App.R. 3 within 30 days of the date on which the order becomes final\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jones argues that the time to appeal began to run when the orders \"sought to be appealed\" were journalized, not when the final appealable order was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"Neither [ R.C. 2945.67(A) ] nor the case law explains clearly whether a party invoking the statute must separately establish appellate jurisdiction (by invoking one of the categories of 'final order' under R.C. 2505.02, for example), or whether instead the statute itself * * * serves as an independent basis for asserting appellate jurisdiction.\" Painter &amp; Pollis,\n   <em>\n    Ohio Appellate Practice\n   </em>\n   , Section 2:28 (2016). The narrower question of whether the State must seek leave to appeal an interlocutory order when it is issued or wait until a final order is entered has likewise not been directly or consistently answered. In 1984, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a state's appeal (with leave or as of right) must satisfy R.C. 2945.67 and also be from a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Leis v.

See, also, 27 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1981) 764, Criminal Law, Section 1433. In recognition of the importance of allowing appellate review of certain trial court decisions which are adverse to the position of the prosecution, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2945.67 as an exception to the general rule. Our task therefore is to determine what trial court rulings may be reviewed under this legislative grant and the appropriate time for the state to appeal decisions alleged to be erroneous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Practical considerations, necessitated by the vital constitutional provision against double jeopardy, lead to a conclusion that appellate review of trial court decisions following a judgment of acquittal are useless, or, at best, suspect because the cause is moot. The apparent purpose behind the enactment of R.C. 2945.67 is to authorize appeals by the state in a manner which does not defeat double jeopardy principles and which also preserves the longstanding judicial policy prohibiting advisory opinions. Both goals can be achieved if R.C. 2945.67 is construed to authorize the state to seek leave to appeal from interlocutory rulings at the time they occur and before a judgment of acquittal has been entered which may render the question moot, as occurred in the case at bar.

This conclusion is consistent with our constitutional grant of jurisdiction and the Staff Notes to the Rules of Appellate Procedure, and will help facilitate the prompt resolution of criminal cases without interruption by piecemeal appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Because this question implicates our jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Such jurisdiction is \"provided by law\" in R.C. 2501.02 (among other places), which grants this court jurisdiction \"to review, affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse\n   <em>\n    judgments or final orders\n   </em>\n   of courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) \"Both grants of jurisdiction to the courts [of appeals] require that a trial court's order be a final order.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3135771\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/115/86/\">\n    115 Ohio St.3d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-4840\">\n    2007-Ohio-4840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=873%20N.E.2d%20886\">\n    873 N.E.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26 (internal citations and quotations omitted). R.C. 2945.67(A) does not speak in terms of granting jurisdiction to courts of appeal, but in terms of granting limited appellate rights to the State, suggesting that the constitutional grant of jurisdiction over final orders remains in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 22} App.R. 5(C) requires that the State seek leave to appeal within 30 days \"from the entry of the judgment and order sought to be appealed.\" The phrase \"judgment or order\" is significant, as the 2014 Staff Note to App.R. 4 indicates the phrase has a particular meaning: \"The amendments to App.R. 4(A) also remove the references to 'judgment or order'; this change is not substantive but merely recognizes that there is no need to use both terms, since every judgment is also a final order.\" As noted above, the time requirements for a State's motion for leave to appeal originated in App.R. 4 before moving to App.R. 5(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1988 Staff Note, App.R. 5 (rule amended to \"track the language suggested in [\n   <em>\n    State v. Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1796076\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/43/1/\">\n    43 Ohio St.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=330%20N.E.2d%20697\">\n    330 N.E.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) ] and further incorporate its reasoning that the reasonable period of time in which the prosecution may appeal be limited to thirty days as set forth in App. R. 4(B)\"). The phrase was not amended in App.R. 5(C), but we find the 2014 Staff Note's discussion insightful. And, although App.R. 5(C) could benefit from greater clarity, we hold that the time period for a State's appeal by leave of court begins to run when the trial court enters a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 23} This conclusion is in accord with other practical and policy concerns. For example, some interlocutory decisions may be subject to modification by the trial court as a case proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

(\"When an order of a trial court is interlocutory, the order remains subject to revision or modification by the trial court\"). Bringing such an issue to this court before the trial court has had the opportunity to fully resolve it bypasses a step necessary to this court's review. It could also generate a body of mid-case, quasi-advisory opinions on virtually any subject. Similarly, the record of an appeal taken mid-case may be insufficient to fully analyze the matter. Some assignments of error require a discussion of prejudice or harmless error, or other facts or defenses, which would require this court to speculate about the outcome and content of a trial that has not yet occurred. We do not believe the statute's drafters intended these results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Finally, a finding that the State can immediately seek leave to appeal at any stage of the case risks major delays in criminal proceedings, even if this court ultimately rejects the State's requests for leave and dismisses its appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 5(C) (requiring a concurrently-filed notice\n   of appeal);\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

We decline to read R.C. 2945.67(A) and App.R. 5(C) to permit immediate appeals of \"any other decision\" in a criminal case before the ultimate decision has been reached. Although some caselaw suggests or holds that such appeals are permitted, we do not think the General Assembly intended to grant the State appellate rights that far exceed those afforded to defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the State filed its notice of cross-appeal and motion for leave to cross-appeal on December 21, 2016, which was within 30 days of the November 21, 2016 final appealable order. The motion and notice of cross-appeal were therefore timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Separate from the timeliness inquiry, we have reviewed the substance of the State's motion for leave to cross-appeal.
