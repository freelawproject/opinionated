First, they must adequately inform probationers of what conduct will return them to jail; second, they must reasonably relate to the purposes of probation-rehabilitating the probationer and protecting the public. Here, Kristopher Weida challenges the propriety of two special sex offender probation conditions, arguing that they are\n   both unreasonable and unconstitutional. Because we agree that one probation condition proves unreasonable as applied to Weida, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 28, 2015, thirty-four-year-old Kristopher Weida had sexual intercourse with his sixteen-year-old niece, K.M. Although Weida and K.M. offered police differing versions of the encounter, they agreed on some details.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both told police that before having sex they looked at pictures of K.M. on her cell phone, they viewed other explicit photos on Weida's phone, and K.M. showed Weida a website she found about incest. Weida also admitted using his phone to google explicit pictures and showing them to K.M. The State accordingly charged Weida with Level 5 felony incest (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-1-3\">\n    Ind.

The court imposed probation conditions, including Indiana's Special Probation Conditions for Adult Sex Offenders. Some conditions limited Weida's internet use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, Condition 8 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   You are prohibited from accessing or using certain web sites, chat rooms, or instant messaging programs frequented by children. You are prohibited from deleting, erasing, or tampering with information on your personal computer with intent to conceal an activity prohibited by this condition.\n   <strong>\n    *Required as a condition of probation by IC 35-38-2-2.2(4).\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 48 (emphasis in original). Condition 9 elaborated upon Condition 8, instructing Weida that he could not use a social networking website, instant messaging program, or chat room to communicate with children.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-1-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Condition 26 imposed a broader internet prohibition. It read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   You shall not access the Internet or any other on-line service through use of a computer, cell phone, iPod, Xbox, Blackberry, personal digital assistant (PDA), pagers, Palm Pilots, televisions, or any other electronic device at any location (including your place of employment) without prior approval of your probation officer.

The court discussed these provisions during sentencing. Referencing Conditions 8 and 9, the court said, \"[T]o the extent that you need to speak with, or contact your own children, you are able to use a networking site or the instant messaging for your children. I'm not going to take that away from you.\" Tr. at 51, \u00b6\u00b6 8-12.

He first argued his three-year sentence proved inappropriate considering his character and the nature of the offense. He then challenged Conditions 8 and 26 as\n   unreasonable and unconstitutional as applied to him because they created sweeping prohibitions on internet usage. Finally, Weida challenged Condition 8's prohibition on \"certain web sites ... frequented by children\" as unconstitutionally vague. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting all three arguments.\n   <em>\n    Weida v.

The internet, cyberspace, the World Wide Web, whatever moniker you choose, pervades our daily lives. For many, we even carry the internet around in our pockets or purses. Our cell phones provide the gateway into cyberspace's vast domains. Hoosiers accomplish life's most meaningful and mundane everyday tasks with cyberspace at our fingertips. We apply for jobs, we file tax returns, we pay bills, we attend college, we read the news, we navigate, we communicate, we shop-all online. To be sure, most Hoosiers don't think twice about googling the answer to a vexing question, or checking the weather online, or updating their status on social media. And that's all right-for most Hoosiers.

When defendants are sex offenders, those probation conditions often include internet restrictions like those imposed here.

He initially argues that Condition 8's language prohibiting him from \"accessing or using certain web sites ... frequented by children\" is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to inform him what specific websites are forbidden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next Weida contends that Condition 8 and Condition 26 \"create a sweeping Internet ban\"-one that is both unreasonable and unconstitutional. Specifically, he posits the conditions fail to reasonably relate to his rehabilitation or public safety. He then claims the conditions' de facto internet ban unduly intrudes on his First Amendment right to free speech and is therefore unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Addressing each argument in turn, we affirm in part, reverse in part and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I.

For example, Condition 7 requires Weida to consent to searches of his computer at any time. Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 48. Condition 8 then prohibits him from accessing or using the internet to venture into any type of website that children regularly use to communicate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6939266\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/8/668/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After all, Condition 8 groups \"certain web sites, chat rooms, or instant messaging programs\" all together. Reading these terms in context leads us to understand that Condition 8 prohibits accessing or using internet websites that open the door to contact and communication with children. Condition 9 confirms that understanding by ultimately imposing the more specific restriction-no contact or communication with children\n   over the internet, absent a written court order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6939266\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/8/668/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other probation conditions prohibit Weida from contacting or communicating with children through any medium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Condition 20, for example, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   You shall have no contact with any person under the age of 16 unless you receive court approval or successfully complete a court-approved sex offender treatment program, pursuant to IC 35-38-2-2.4.

Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"562086\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/676/406/#p407\">\n    676 F.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407 (9th Cir. 1982) (\"In addition to the bare words of the probation condition, the probationer may be guided by the further definition, explanations, or instructions of the ... court and the probation officer.\"). Here Weida was not left alone to understand these probation conditions on his own. The trial court instructed Weida regarding the conditions restricting his internet use. The court told Weida he could use the internet for the purpose of contacting and communicating with his own children. Tr. at 51, \u00b6\u00b6 8-11, 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find that a person of ordinary intelligence, reading all the probation conditions in context and receiving instructions from the court, would understand that Condition 8 forbids him from visiting websites that allow him to contact or communicate with children. Because Condition 8 provides sufficient clarity and particularity to give a person with ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct is generally proscribed, we hold the condition is not unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   II. Condition 8 is neither unreasonable nor unduly intrusive on Weida's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Weida next argues that Condition 8 creates a sweeping ban on the internet and is both unreasonable and unduly intrusive upon his First Amendment right to free speech. Evaluating Weida's argument entails a two-part analysis. First, using the abuse of discretion standard, we must determine whether Condition 8 is reasonably related to rehabilitating the probationer and protecting the public. If we find the provisions reasonable, we must address Weida's constitutional argument: that Condition 8 unduly intrudes upon his First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Condition 8's internet restrictions reasonably relate to Weida's rehabilitation and protecting the public\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We find that Condition 8 is reasonably related to Weida's rehabilitation and protecting the public. When a defendant commits a sex crime against a child, as happened here, it is reasonable to restrict that defendant's access to children through any medium. Restricted access to\n   children simultaneously helps the defendant avoid temptation and protects the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7099982\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/990/511/#p516\">\n    990 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   516 ;\n   <em>\n    Bratcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271475\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/999/864/#p873\">\n    999 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   879 (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381144\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/779/111/#p117\">\n    779 N.E.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) ). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Condition 8 upon Weida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Condition 8's internet restrictions are not unduly intrusive upon Weida's right to free speech under the First Amendment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Likewise, we find that Condition 8 does not unduly intrude on Weida's First Amendment rights. When faced with a challenge that a probation condition proves unduly intrusive upon a constitutional right we balance three factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   1. [T]he purpose to be served by probation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   2. [T]he extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be enjoyed by probationers; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   3. [T]he legitimate needs of law enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7099982\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/990/511/#p516\">\n    990 N.E.2d at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We take each factor in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, as we have already noted there are two purposes for Weida's probation: rehabilitation and public safety. As we explained above, both purposes are served by preventing Weida from using the internet to contact and communicate with children because Weida committed his offense against a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, it is well-established that probation conditions \"may impinge upon a probationer's right to exercise an otherwise constitutionally protected right because 'probationers simply do not enjoy the freedoms to which ordinary citizens are entitled.' \"\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7099982\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/990/511/#p516\">\n    990 N.E.2d at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Purdy v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11615022\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/708/20/#p22\">\n    708 N.E.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) ). We note Condition 8 does not ban internet access altogether, but only access to websites children use to communicate. In our view, this limitation does not severely curtail Weida's First Amendment internet activity vis-\u00e0 -vis the average law-abiding citizen. Like normal Hoosiers, he can still use the internet to communicate with adults and complete the myriad everyday online tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Third, although the internet played a small role in this crime, we acknowledge that Weida did not find or prey upon his victim using the internet. Unlike other sexual predators who locate and then lure their victims online, he did not carry out the crime using the internet. Accordingly, the law enforcement need for Condition 8 in this situation lessens compared to other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On balance, we find Condition 8 does not unduly intrude upon Weida's First Amendment rights. Consequently, we hold that Condition 8 is constitutional as applied to Weida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   III. Condition 26 is not reasonably related to Weida's rehabilitation and maintaining public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Weida levels the same multilayered attack against Condition 26-that it creates a blanket internet ban that is both unreasonable and unconstitutional as applied to him. We therefore employ the same analysis we previously applied: first deciding whether Condition 26 reasonably relates to rehabilitating Weida or protecting the public; and second, if necessary, deciding whether it unduly intrudes upon a constitutional right. Condition 26 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   You shall not access the Internet or any other on-line service ... without prior approval of your probation officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To begin, we note that we do not anticipate receiving future challenges to Condition\n   26 like Weida's present challenge. Since Weida's sentencing and our hearing this case, the standard Condition 26 underwent significant changes. It no longer imposes an expansive internet ban. The new Condition 26 now provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   You are prohibited from accessing, viewing, or using internet websites and computer applications that depict obscene matter as defined by IC 35-49-2-1 or child pornography as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). You shall not possess or use any data encryption technique or program to conceal your internet activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Sex Offender Special Conditions (Adult)\n   </em>\n   , INDIANA OFFICE OF COURT SERVICES ,\n   <em>\n    http://www.in.gov/judiciary/probation/files/prob-sex-offender-conditionsadult.pdf\n   </em>\n   (last visited April 12, 2018). Although we see prudence in Condition 26's new, narrower internet restriction, we must still address Weida's arguments as to the old Condition 26 since the court imposed that version during his sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Weida labels the old Condition 26 a \"blanket Internet ban\" that \"requires [him] to contact his probation officer\n   <strong>\n    every time\n   </strong>\n   he wishes to access the Internet.\" We feel compelled to explain that Weida is mistaken on both points. There is no blanket ban on all internet access for Weida here because in the sentencing hearing the trial court expressly granted him permission to access the internet at any time for the purposes of communicating with his children. Tr. at 51, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (\"Item ... 26 again, you can have access for the purpose of contact with your children at any time\"). What's more, we don't read Condition 26 to demand that Weida receive prior approval\n   <strong>\n    every time\n   </strong>\n   he accesses the internet. \"Prior approval\" does not translate to \"single-instance-approval.\" For example, in the initial meeting the probation officer could grant Weida ongoing permission to access the internet to search for jobs, pay bills, or read the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   . Weida's argument reads an onerous requirement into old Condition 26 that was simply not there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although we disagree with Weida's characterization of the old Condition 26, we agree its restriction on internet access in his case reaches beyond reasonableness into unreasonableness. In other words, Condition 26's prior broad prohibition on internet access but for the court's or the probation officer's permission, is not reasonably related to Weida's rehabilitation or maintaining public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As we said, we live in an internet-saturated society. Cyberspace presents the primary conduit for information and communication. Given the importance and prevalence of the internet in today's world, we must decide when it is reasonable to curtail a probationer's internet access. Put differently, when is an internet restriction reasonably related to the probationer's rehabilitation and reintegration into society, and when does it protect the public from future harm?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Our Court of Appeals addressed these questions in several cases in the last decade, generally holding that the imposed internet restriction reasonably related to the purposes of probation or parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Waters received a twenty-one and one-half-years sentence, with sixteen years executed and five-and-one-half years suspended to probation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court imposed similar probation conditions to those Weida received here, including an identical Condition 26 that broadly prohibited internet access or use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 619. Waters challenged 26's internet restriction, arguing that since he did not victimize a child the condition proved unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In determining whether Condition 26 reasonably related to Waters' rehabilitation and protection of public safety, the Court of Appeals considered whether Waters previously used the internet illegally and whether he used the internet during his current crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   619-20. Since Waters had not misused the internet in his past or present crimes, the court determined that the standard broad internet restriction was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 620. The court opined a reasonable internet restriction would prevent Waters from meeting women or viewing sexually explicit materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court remanded, instructing the trial court to \"impose a narrower internet restriction that is more in line with Waters' conviction and 'issues with women.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   At first blush, it may appear that\n   <em>\n    Waters\n   </em>\n   charted a new path in evaluating whether probation conditions restricting internet use reasonably relate to rehabilitating the probationer or protecting the public. But it did no such thing. The\n   <em>\n    Waters\n   </em>\n   court applied the well-established reasonably-related analysis, but considered new questions based on the unique facts presented. We appreciate\n   <em>\n    Waters\n   </em>\n   ' nuanced, fact-specific approach and apply it now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Here, the record reveals Weida has no history of misusing the internet or using the internet to perpetrate a crime. However, the record does show that Weida used the internet shortly before committing incest with K.M. He admitted googling explicit photos and showing them to K.M. He likewise admitted viewing an incest website before having sex with K.M. We cannot ignore that when Weida enjoyed unfettered internet access he committed incest. Whether or not he intentionally groomed K.M. for sex, there is no doubt the two went from talking, to looking at sexually explicit material online, to having sex. But Weida's troubles recognizing sexual boundaries in person and online should not result in a far-reaching, broad internet ban. A more appropriate internet restriction-one that reasonably relates to his rehabilitation and protecting the public-will restrict his access to obscene or sexually explicit material. Such a restriction will assist him in rehabilitating and avoiding enticement to re-offend yet allow him to remain a productive member of our internet-dependent society. He can still look for jobs, attend classes online, pay bills, read news, and otherwise lead a rehabilitated life. We finally note that a narrower internet restriction does not sacrifice public safety since Weida will still be prohibited from accessing material that related to his offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We, therefore, find the trial court abused its discretion by imposing an unreasonable probation condition that did not reasonably relate to rehabilitating Weida and protecting the public. We remand this matter with instructions to impose a reasonable internet restriction in place of the old Condition 26. Since we decide this matter on Weida's unreasonableness claim, we need not address his constitutional argument that the condition unduly intrudes upon his free speech rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jean-Baptiste v.

Believing two probation conditions (namely, Conditions 8 and 26) limiting his internet use did not meet these criteria, Weida brought this appeal. We now hold that Condition 8 is not vague, unreasonable, or unduly intrusive on Weida's constitutional rights. But Condition 26, as previously written and applied to Weida, is unreasonable since it does not reasonably relate to his rehabilitation and protecting the public. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David, Massa, and Slaughter, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In deciding this matter, we noticed the growing trend to lowercase \"internet\" and write \"website\" and \"online\" as single words.\n    <em>\n     The Chicago Manual of Style\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 7.80, 7.83, 7.89 (17th ed. 2017);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Philip B.
