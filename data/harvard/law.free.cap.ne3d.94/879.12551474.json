In 2015, he filed a motion for a new trial seeking to withdraw his guilty pleas, which was denied without a hearing. He now appeals the denial of that motion. On appeal, Allen argues that (1) plea counsel had an actual conflict of interest; (2) plea counsel had a potential conflict of interest; (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and (4) his plea was not intelligent and voluntary. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"Once accepted, [a] plea of guilty ... is itself a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeMarco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"908809\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/387/481/#p481\">\n    387 Mass. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481 (1982) (quotation omitted).

The defendant contends that his plea attorney, Frank Marchetti, was engaged in a scheme with then-Middlesex County Superior Court Clerk-Magistrate Joseph Marshall and private investigator James Mills, where the clerk-magistrate would appoint Marchetti or one of three other attorneys, each of whom would move for investigative funds and hire Mills. Mills would then bill the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) for work not performed. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Milley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826944\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/685/#p686\">\n    67 Mass.

Allen contends that plea counsel's alleged involvement with Marshall and Mills amounted to an actual conflict of interest, where his attorney's priority was a criminal conspiracy and not Allen's case.

In\n   <em>\n    Milley\n   </em>\n   , no actual conflict existed where \"[t]here [was] nothing to show that the tainted conduct of Marshall and Mills was in conflict with [the attorney's] duty to represent the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826944\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/685/#p686\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826944\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/685/#p686\">\n    . at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As evidence of a conflict, Allen provides the trial transcript from the investigator's trial on charges related to his billing of CPCS.

However, despite Allen's argument that \"[t]here can be no question that defense counsel Marchetti, an officer of the court, knew what was going on,\" he fails to provide evidence that Marchetti was engaged in the conspiracy or that it affected Marchetti's representation of him. Although Allen contends that his case was handled during the same period that the scheme was ongoing, the motion judge noted that Marchetti was not indicted for his alleged participation, and that there is no evidence that Mills participated in Allen's case.

In other words, the defendant must show that his attorney's conduct fell 'measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer' and that, as a result, the defendant 'likely [was] deprived ... of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.'\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    .\"\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Agbanyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3234824\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/69/841/#p849\">\n    69 Mass.

As support, he provided affidavits from himself and an individual who was present the night of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[T]he [motion] judge may decide a rule 30(b) motion based solely on affidavits [and] may discredit untrustworthy affidavits.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369548\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/657/#p663\">\n    426 Mass. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663 (1998). The only support for the defendant's motion was the two self-serving affidavits, one by the defendant and one by a friend. Allen's contentions contradict his sworn statements at the plea colloquy. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hiskin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497410\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/68/633/#p643\">\n    68 Mass. App. Ct. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (2007). The friend's affidavit is of limited relevance because he was not in the room at the time of the incidents in question. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pingaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772152\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/41/#p48\">\n    44 Mass.

We discern no abuse of discretion where the record falls short of demonstrating prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Intelligence and voluntariness of the plea\n   </em>\n   . Allen contends that his plea was not intelligent and voluntary because the judge declaratively told him that he had the opportunity to discuss his case and the possible consequences with counsel, rather than inquiring if he did. He also contends that the totality of the colloquy indicates that the plea was not voluntary as the judge conducted the colloquy in an erroneous manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Due process requires that 'a guilty plea should not be accepted, and if accepted must later be set aside,' unless the contemporaneous record contains an affirmative showing that the defendant's plea was intelligently and voluntarily made.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Furr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670390\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/101/#p106\">\n    454 Mass. 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (2009), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"307054\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/368/100/#p102\">\n    368 Mass. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During Allen's plea colloquy, the plea judge began to ask Allen about his attorney, stating, \"And have you had a full opportunity to go over your case with Mr. Cachiotti, prior counsel?\" After stating the wrong attorney's name, an exchange followed between the plea judge and Marchetti, ending with the judge stating, \"Mr. Marchetti. I'm sorry. You've had an opportunity to go over with Mr. Marchetti your case, and what the consequences be to you of pleading guilty under these circumstances. Do you understand, sir?\" Allen contends that this exchange amounts to a failure by the court to properly inquire into the voluntariness of his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As the motion judge explained in a well-reasoned decision, taking the plea colloquy as a whole, the plea judge's inquiry was adequate. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Quinones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903293\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/423/#p434\">\n    414 Mass. 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434 (1993) (\"No particular form of words need be used in the required inquiry of a defendant\"). The initial question prior to the misstatement of Marchetti's name was clear, and the plea judge immediately followed the rephrasing with a question. Allen affirmatively indicated that he understood and agreed with the question. Allen raised no issues during the entirety of the colloquy. Furthermore, the record as a whole indicates that the plea judge questioned Allen about whether he agreed with the summary of the facts, believed that his attorney acted in his best interest, and was pleading guilty because he was guilty and for no other reason. In probing the defendant's mind, the plea judge was entitled to \"rely heavily on the defendant's sworn responses; '[a] judge is not expected to read the defendant's mind or the multiplicity of unspoken thoughts and emotions that underlie the decision to plead guilty.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725238\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/71/348/#p354\">\n    71 Mass.
