(father) and S.P. (mother). The father challenges the portions of the judgment dated March 22, 2016, granting the mother sole legal and physical custody of the parties' two children, and providing the father with six hours of supervised visitation per week. Because we conclude that the judge did not make findings sufficient to satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ), we vacate the March 22, 2016, judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ), as amended by St. 1998, c. 179, \u00a7 6, requires the judge to \"consider evidence of past or present abuse toward a parent or child as a factor contrary to the best interest of the child\" when issuing a custody order. If the judge finds, \"by a preponderance of the evidence, that a pattern or serious incident of abuse has occurred,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   she must then employ \"a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interests of the child to be placed in sole custody, shared legal custody, or shared physical custody with the abusive parent.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, if the judge issues a custody order after finding a pattern or serious incident of abuse, she must \"within 90 days enter written findings of fact as to the effects of the abuse on the child, which findings demonstrate that such order is in the furtherance of the child's best interests and provides for the safety and well-being of the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . \"The requirements of the statute apply even in cases where the judge does not award custody to the abusive partner.\"\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saliba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n    54 Mass. App. Ct. 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550 (2002).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Here, the judge credited the mother's testimony regarding an incident in which the father \"pinned\" one of the children on the floor (making it difficult for the child to breathe), smacked the child under the chin causing her head to snap backward, and threw the child on the bed. The judge also credited the mother's testimony that the child was crying throughout the interaction. The judge noted that the father, despite later pleading guilty to assault and battery, did \"not believe that his behavior was abusive\" and \"has not acknowledged the effect of domestic violence on [the] children.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   While it is apparent that the judge considered evidence of \"past abuse,\" it is unclear whether she found the father's conduct to constitute a \"serious incident of abuse\" within the meaning of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ). See\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saliba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n    at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, \"[e]ven were we to assume that the incident[ ] of abuse found by the judge constituted a [serious incident] of abuse, and we do not, there is no finding regarding the effect of the abuse ... on the children.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"[T]his is not a case in which we may conclude that the judge made implicit findings sufficient to satisfy the statute,\" because \"domestic violence is an issue too fundamental and frequently recurring to be dealt with only by implication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987535\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/547/#p550\">\n    . at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Custody of Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890226\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/590/#p599\">\n    422 Mass. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"[O]ur duty as a reviewing court is to ensure that the record reflects that all relevant factors have been considered by the judge, and that the decision is based on a fair weighing of the factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Schechter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schechter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776996\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/239/#p248\">\n    88 Mass. App. Ct. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (2015). We are unable to determine whether the judge in this case considered \"all relevant factors\" because she did not make the explicit findings required by G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   . We therefore vacate the March 22, 2016, judgment, and remand the case to the Probate and Family Court for the entry of findings and a new judgment consistent with this memorandum and order. The decision whether to take additional evidence is within the judge's discretion. The judgment dated May 5, 2014, granting the mother sole legal and physical custody of the children is to remain in effect. The parties may seek a temporary order of visitation, and the judge is authorized to enter such an order, also to remain in effect during the pendency of the remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    \"For the purposes of this section, 'abuse' shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following acts between a parent and the other parent or between a parent and child: (a) attempting to cause or causing bodily injury; or (b) placing another in reasonable fear of imminent bodily injury.
