L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    m\n   </em>\n   ). Following the entry of the guilty verdicts, the defendant was arraigned on the portions of the indictments alleging that he was a habitual offender, see G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25. After a bench trial, the judge found the defendant guilty of being a habitual offender. On appeal the defendant contends that (1) the judge abused his discretion by admitting in evidence Google searches conducted on his cellular telephone (cell phone); (2) there was insufficient evidence to establish that he illegally possessed the firearms seized; (3) the judge gave an erroneous jury instruction on the elements of constructive possession; (4) the burden of proving firearms licensure was improperly shifted to the defendant; and (5) the defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to a jury trial on the habitual offender charge. We affirm the underlying possession convictions but vacate the findings that the defendant is a habitual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Google searches\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that the judge's admission of expert testimony concerning the defendant's Google searches for a \"P19 handgun, 9 millimeter\" and \"MAC-11\" on his cell phone was error. Because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for error, and if there is error, for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

The searches demonstrated a contemporaneous interest in and familiarity with firearms similar to the firearms seized from the apartment. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.

See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2017). Nor was the evidence so inflammatory as to be unfairly prejudicial. Rather, the evidence of familiarity with firearms of the same caliber as the weapons found was relevant to the defendant's knowledge of and control over the weapons found in the girl friend's bedroom.

The defendant maintains that the judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty because the evidence at trial was insufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth's burden of proving constructive possession of the firearms. To establish constructive possession, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant had \"knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control\" over the firearms.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sann Than\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183035\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/748/#p751\">\n    442 Mass. 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751 (2004), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sespedes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183087\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/95/#p99\">\n    442 Mass. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (2004).

Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was sufficient evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to infer that elements of knowledge of, and the intention and ability to exercise control over, the firearms, were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, there was evidence that the defendant lived in the apartment.

The jury were permitted to infer that the defendant slept in the room with his girl friend, with whom he had a three month old child.

The girl friend denied having any knowledge of the firearms. The defendant had an interest in similar firearms, as evidenced by the Google searches. The jury were permitted to credit the girl friend's denial, to infer that the defendant stayed in the bedroom where the firearms were discovered, and to infer that he therefore knew of the guns and had the intention and ability to exercise control over them.

The defendant maintains that the judge gave an erroneous jury instruction regarding constructive possession. The defendant did not object to the instruction at trial.

Thus, constructive possession means knowledge of the location of an object combined with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant takes issue with the use of the word \"power\" instead of \"ability\" in the first sentence of the instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[W]hen reviewing a judge's instructions to a jury, we do not consider phrases in isolation, but rather '[w]e evaluate the instruction as a whole, looking for the interpretation a reasonable juror would place on the judge's words.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glacken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788760\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/163/#p168\">\n    451 Mass. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168-169 (2008), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Niemic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310296\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/718/#p720\">\n    427 Mass. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 720 (1998). The second sentence of the instruction here tracked the language of the standard set out in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sespedes\n   </em>\n   , with near exactitude. 442 Mass. at 99.

The defendant further maintains that the evidence of unlawful possession was insufficient because the Commonwealth failed to present evidence that he was not licensed to own firearms. The Supreme Judicial Court has repeatedly held that licensure is an affirmative defense as to which the defendant bears the burden of proof.
