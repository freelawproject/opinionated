Several persons present at that meeting, including Village Clerk Margaret Lloyd, were subpoenaed by the prosecutor to testify at the trial in Town of Shandaken Justice Court. Defendant is alleged to have told Lloyd to pretend that she had heard nothing at the meeting and to have threatened to fire her if she testified. Count three of the five-count indictment charged defendant with the crime of official misconduct (Penal Law \u00a7 195.00) by attempting to influence Lloyd\u2019s testimony through the use of his official capacity as Mayor of the Village.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Lloyd appeared but did not testify at the trial of defendant\u2019s wife and was subsequently removed from her position as Village Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\">Defendant first contends that the alleged threat was not an exercise of an official function within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 195.00. We disagree. Verbal expressions constitute acts just as do physical movements. Defendant spoke in his capacity as Mayor to a subordinate, expressing the threat of loss of her job if she testified against his wife. In addition, he solicited support from other Board members. These expressions constituted an unauthorized exercise of his official functions as Mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Defendant further urges that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. A fair reading of the record belies this argument. The conflicts and contradicting testimony merely presented an issue of credibility which the jury resolved against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Kane, Weiss, Yesawich, Jr., and Levine, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\"> County Court dismissed count one (third degree perjury) upon motion. The jury acquitted defendant of count two (official misconduct) and counts four and five (tampering with a witness).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
