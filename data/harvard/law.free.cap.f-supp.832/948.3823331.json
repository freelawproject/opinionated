BROOKS SMITH, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">I. <em>INTRODUCTION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Westinghouse Credit Corporation (WCC) is a subsidiary of Westinghouse Financial Services, Inc. (WFSI), itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Westinghouse). WCC was formed in 1954 to finance consumer sales of Westinghouse products; however, it eventually expanded into new credit markets, including industrial and commercial finance and sophisticated corporate lending. In the early 1980s, WCC hit its stride when it tapped into the booming commercial and residential real estate markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Such success, however, was short-lived. WCC\u2019s fortunes collapsed along with the real estate market in the late-1980s, and the price of Westinghouse stock tumbled during the class period from a high of $39.375/share to a low of $15.875/share. Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (Docket No. 84) \u00b6\u00b6 185, 186. Now, like so many lending institutions battered by the late-1980s real estate bust, <em>see </em>Michael Quint, <em>Investors Challenging Banks on Bad Loans, </em>N.Y. Times, January 28, 1991, at D1, Westinghouse, along with its outside accountant and investment bankers, is defending against shareholders who allege that the company made false and misleading statements regarding the health of its financial services units, thereby artificially inflating the price of Westinghouse stock and damaging plaintiffs who purchased that stock at what they claim to have been an artificially high price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">The Purchaser Class Action plaintiffs filed their action on February 28, 1991. Over the course of the next year, the parties skirmished over several discovery motions, until March 18,1992, when Magistrate Judge Lancaster ordered Westinghouse to make available to plaintiffs, on a continuous basis from April 1, 1992 to April 29, 1992, at WCC\u2019s offices, documents relating to 536 accounts designated as \u201cAssets Held for Sale or Restructuring\u201d for inspection and copying. On June 15, 1992, after having reviewed some 3.5 million pages of active investment file documents, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Complaint) and an Amended and Supplemental Complaint relating to the derivative action against Westinghouse, Civil Action No. 91-624 (Derivative Complaint) (Docket No. 85). This action is currently before the Court on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss (Docket No. 90, 91, 101, 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">II. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">As noted above, WCC sharply increased its lending activity in the 1980s, expanding into highly leveraged corporate transactions, high-yield securities, and especially, commercial real estate markets. WCC\u2019s primary source of funds for these investments was short-term commercial paper debt. When the real estate market softened during the late-1980s and into the early-1990s, many of WCC\u2019s real estate receivables began under-performing, and the underlying investment properties lost value. Therefore, on May 8, 1990, in order to protect WCC\u2019s standing with the commercial paper ratings agencies, Westinghouse entered into a support agreement with WCC, pursuant to which Westinghouse agreed to maintain for three years, by regular capital infusions if necessary, WCC\u2019s total debt-to-equity ratio at a maximum of 6.5 to 1. \u00b6 97; Exhibit O to Defendant Westinghouse\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (Westinghouse Memo) at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">By September 21, 1990, the Corporate Finance Section of Westinghouse\u2019s Treasury Department had prepared a report entitled \u201cStrategic Considerations \u2014 WFSI, Discussion Points,\u201d Exhibit Y to Westinghouse Memo, which assessed the diminished value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>of WFSI assets and offered direction for WFSI\u2019s future plans. \u00b6 111. The report, the contents of which were not released to the public, \u00b6 112, discussed the various strategies available to WFSI as it faced increasing problems in its real estate portfolio. The alternatives under consideration were stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-4\">A \u2014 maintain size and likely growth, modest change in mix \u2014 acquire Enterprise and United, but stop there</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkO\">B \u2014 maintain size, improve growth outlook by aggressive change in mix \u2014 fund aggressive growth in thrifts and mortgage banking by liquidating WCC\u2019s current business</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aid\">C \u2014 contract size, maintain mix \u2014 accept write down, apply proceeds for sale of written down assets to debt repayment, pursue thrifts and mortgage banking on modest scale</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-5\">D \u2014 pay dividend, contract size and growth \u2014 aggressively liquidate assets, distribute cash to parent \u2014 abandon thrifts and mortgage banking</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Exhibit Y at 15. The report speculated that alternatives B and D were unlikely, and raised the possibility of a fifth alternative, the \u201cmissing alternative \u2014 focus on selling leasehold residuals and other \u2018hidden\u2019 assets to produce gains for write offs, reduce cost structure (internally generated gains used to write off non-earning assets).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The report suggested that Westinghouse continue to \u201cmodify and complete the Strategic Plan\u201d and \u201ccomplete the Lazard study\u2014 evaluate exit vs. hold alternatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. The report concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that WFSI would continue to operate as a long-term, core business, and that it would eventually exit the real estate markets. The report recommended that WFSI hold its portfolios for exit when the markets recovered, and stated that there was \u201cno need for [a] self-inflicted writedown\u2014 unless assets can be liberated.\u201d Finally, the report recommended \u201cengaging] Lazard to [evaluate the costs and benefits of a] near-term exit vs. hold for later exit,\u201d and \u201cto assist in internal restructuring effort, and validate Corporate views \u2014 also, to assist in communications message.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">Westinghouse did retain Lazard Freres &amp; Co. (Lazard), an investment banking firm, on September 28,1990. \u00b6 115. After interviewing key WCC personnel about WCC\u2019s real estate portfolios, Lazard allegedly began preparing Westinghouse\u2019s CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Paul Lego, for a meeting with securities analysts scheduled for October 24,1990. \u00b6 125. At the October 24, 1990 meeting, Lego allegedly told the analysts: \u201cWe believe our reserves are adequate. We see no major problems there,\u201d and, \u201cWe do not believe we will have to take any kind of major hit in financial services. We believe our reserves are adequate.\u201d \u00b6 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Lazard subsequently informed Westinghouse that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-12\">Markets do not currently expect any major write-off. They rely on a statement by Westinghouse\u2019s management, at the October 24, meeting, that there are no prospects of such write-offs. Several reports quote the statement as the source of their belief____ Because it would come as a relative surprise and in contradiction to previous announcements, a large write-off might put the credibility of Westinghouse\u2019s management at risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">\u00b6 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">On February 27, 1991, Westinghouse and WCC announced that they were taking a $975 million pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter 1990 earnings as part of a restructuring plan adopted by Westinghouse for its WFSI and WCC subsidiaries. \u00b6 150. Westinghouse also made a cash contribution of $525 million to WFSI during the first quarter of 1991 and extended its 1991 support agreement with WCC to June 1994. Exhibit O to Westinghouse Memo at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">Also on February 27, 1991, Lego stated in a letter to shareholders: \u201cWe believe the loss provision and related actions decisively address the problems at WFSI.\u201d Lego concluded that, \u201cBy taking this special charge, we have strengthened the financial position of the corporation. The short-term problems we are experiencing in no way detract from the long-term opportunities we see in-our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>markets. We remain fully confident of our ability to create outstanding returns to our shareholders over the long term.\u201d \u00b6 153; Exhibit K to Westinghouse Memo at 6, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Concurrent with the February 27, 1991 press release, Westinghouse and WCC filed with the SEC Forms 8-K, pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, which require the periodic filing of reports necessary to keep reasonably current the information and documents contained in a registration statement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m, 78o (d) (1988). In its February 27, 1991 Form 8-K, WCC disclosed its identification of \u201c$139 million in real estate properties owned, $653 million in marketable securities, $538 million in non-earning receivables and $1.3 billion in reduced earning receivables<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> restructured to earn less than their original contractual rate.\u201d Exhibit L to Westinghouse Memo at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">On or about March 11,1991, Westinghouse and WCC filed annual reports, Form 10-K, for the 1990 fiscal year. Exhibits M and N to Westinghouse Memo. On or about April 18, 1991, and again on or about May 6, 1991, Westinghouse filed with the SEC a registration statement, Form S-3, and Prospectus in conjunction with a May 9, 1991 public offering of 19,000 shares of Westinghouse common stock at $26.50 per share. Exhibits O, P, and Q to Westinghouse Memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">On October 7, 1991, Westinghouse filed a Form 8-K that announced that net income was down over the first three quarters of 1991 compared to the same period in 1990, and issued another press release announcing \u201ca major change in strategy to accelerate a broader disposition of assets in its financial services subsidiary, resulting in the recording of a $1.68 billion valuation provision during the third quarter.\u201d \u00b6 179; Exhibit V to Westinghouse Memo at 4. Addressing this second substantial charge against earnings within 9 months, Lego explained: \u201cBecause of the prolonged recession, the lack of credit in real estate markets and the nation\u2019s oversupply of commercial properties, which have diminished the current value of real estate assets, we have determined to take these decisive actions.\u201d \u00b6 181; Exhibit V at 10. Lego also stated: \u201cWhile disappointing, this performance is the result of the comprehensive plan we announced today that is intended to accelerate the recovery of our Financial Services unit and to put the corporation back on the track toward improved operating and financial performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Finally, on or about November 14, 1991, Westinghouse and WCC filed with the SEC their quarterly reports, Form 10-Q, for the third quarter of 1991. Exhibits W and X to Westinghouse Memo.\u2019 WCC cited \u201climited progress ... in liquidating or restructuring real estate and corporate financing assets,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exhibit X at 9; Westinghouse disclosed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-10\">Operating profit for the third quarter and first nine months was down significantly compared with the same periods of 1990. Third quarter operating profit included a $1.68 billion valuation provision established to facilitate the previously announced plans to downsize Financial Services. Excluding the $1.68 billion valuation provision, operating profit for the quarter and first nine months was sharply lower than the same periods of 1990. The decline in operating profit was due to significant increases in loan loss provisions from continuing business operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">Exhibit W at 11. Westinghouse also announced that it would enter into a new support agreement with WCC, \u201cstipulat[ing] the same financial support with respect to [WCC\u2019s 6.5 to 1] debt-to-equity ratio,\u201d and providing financial support necessary to guarantee WCC\u2019s commercial paper borrowings, and to maintain WCC\u2019s debt ratings. Exhibit X at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>III. <em>DISCUSSION OF THE COMPLAINT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">A. <em>Westinghouse Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action against Westinghouse include claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78t (1988), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (1992)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; Sections 11, 12(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k(a), <em>111 </em>(2), <em>llo </em>(1988)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; and for negligent misrepresentation under principles of Pennsylvania common law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that as early as 1988, defendants were aware of the serious deterioration of WCC\u2019s real estate and highly-leveraged transactions portfolios, but as set forth in more detail in Part V, <em>infra, </em>failed to: (1) fully disclose the extent of the losses in the receivables, attempting to hide those losses; (2) make appropriate valuation provisions to the loan loss reserves established to cover the nonperforming or under-performing receivables; and (3) disclose the effect of the losses upon Westinghouse\u2019s and WCC\u2019s commercial paper ratings and on Westinghouse in light of Westinghouse\u2019s financial obligations to WCC under the support agreement. \u00b646.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">B. <em>The Secondary Defendant Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Plaintiffs also allege causes of action under Section 10(b), Section 11, Section 12(2), and common law negligent misrepresentation against Price Waterhouse, Westinghouse\u2019s independent accountant, Lazard, an investment banking firm retained in September 1990 to advise Westinghouse, and several securities underwriters (including Lazard) who underwrote Westinghouse\u2019s May 1991 public offering of common stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">The first substantive mention of the secondary defendants appears at \u00b648. Price</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">Waterhouse and Lazard are alleged generally to have \u201caided\u201d Westinghouse, WCC, and the individual defendants in concealing the deteriorating condition of WCC\u2019s real estate loans during the March 28, 1989 through October 22, 1991 period. The factual specifics concerning this aid are distributed among \u00b6\u00b6 53, 56 and 64: Price Waterhouse and Lazard are alleged to be responsible for WCC\u2019s publication of artificially reduced levels of nonearning real estate receivables in WCC\u2019s Forms SEC 10-Q and Forms 10-K. Price Waterhouse and Lazard also aided the Westinghouse defendants in some undescribed way in reclassifying nonearning real estate as reduced earning receivables. Price Water-house is additionally alleged to have failed to disclose WCC\u2019s portfolio of underperforming real estate receivables after auditing WCC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 financial statements, and to have authorized Westinghouse\u2019s announcement of its 1990 unaudited financial results on January 17, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\">Next, in \u00b6 77 through \u00b6 90, Price Water-house is alleged to have audited Westinghouse\u2019s and WCC\u2019s year-end statements in 1989, 1990 and 1991 and received fees from Westinghouse for doing so. Price Water-house is alleged to have assisted Westinghouse and WCC at unspecified times to conceal WCC\u2019s losses and risky loans in three ways: (1) by agreeing that WCC\u2019s reserve for loan losses would not exceed 2.5% of receivables; (2) by failing to disclose WCC\u2019s reclassification of nonearning receivables as reduced earnings receivables, WCC\u2019s growing volume of reduced earning receivables, and WCC\u2019s in-substance foreclosures; and (3) by misrepresenting that Price Water-house\u2019s audits were consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAS) and that Westinghouse and WCC\u2019s financial statements were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In 1990, Price Waterhouse is alleged to have informed WCC management of its reluctance to remain at a 2.5% level of reserves, and approved an increase to a 2.8% level of reserves. Plaintiff alleges that Price Waterhouse misrepresented this level of reserves as adequate, despite knowing at year-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>end 1990, facts demonstrating that the level of reserves was deficient by $1 billion or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations then turn, in \u00b6 103 et seq., to Lazard. Lazard is alleged to have been retained by Westinghouse as a financial adviser in August or September 1990; to have conducted a study of WFSI and WCC; and to have produced a document entitled Westinghouse Credit Corporation \u2014 Discussion Outline. Exhibit B to Underwriter Defendants\u2019 Compendium of Exhibits (Compendium).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Lazard partners Felix Rohatyn and Ken-rick Wilson allegedly prepared Lego and Warren H. Hollinshead, Westinghouse\u2019s Treasurer and CFO, for an October 24, 1990 meeting with securities analysts. Lazard executive Steve Niemczyk is alleged to have written a script containing proposed answers to questions expected from the securities analysts, which script included two statements actually made by Lego at the October 24, 1990 analysts\u2019 meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-7\">We believe our reserves are adequate. We see no major problems there.... We do not believe we will have to take any kind of major hit in financial services. We believe our reserves are adequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">Compendium, Exhibit A at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">Plaintiffs allege that these statements were false and that the Lazard personnel responsible knew or recklessly disregarded facts which demonstrated that the statements were false. \u00b6 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">Lazard allegedly continued to analyze WCC\u2019s status in December 1990 and January 1991, and learned of WCC\u2019s deteriorated asset values, high levels of nonearning receivables, and the inadequacy of WCC\u2019s reserves. Construing an ambiguity in the complaint most favorably to the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> plaintiffs also allege that at the time of the January 16, 1991 earnings report Westinghouse had already planned the charges it later took against 1990 income, \u00b6 138, and that Lazard learned of this plan by January 9, 1991. \u00b6 136. On January 9, 1991 Lazard allegedly recommended that Westinghouse release fourth-quarter and year-end 1990 earnings results on January 16, 1991 without disclosing any of these facts. Lazard also allegedly recommended a board meeting to discuss a restructuring of WFSI and WCC, a meeting which took place on January 30, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">Plaintiffs allege that Westinghouse personnel met with personnel from Lazard and Shearson Lehman Brothers on February 7, 1991 to discuss the effect on the ratings of Westinghouse commercial paper of an \u201cexpected charge to earnings.\u201d \u00b6 143. In response to Westinghouse\u2019s request, Lazard completed a document on February 11, 1991 entitled Model Restructuring and Financial Plan which proposed, <em>inter alia, </em>a $1.0 \u2014 $1.2 billion charge to increase loan loss reserves. \u00b6 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">Westinghouse and Lazard allegedly determined to seek the rating agencies\u2019 reaction to the proposed charge, \u00b6 147, and on February 20, 1991, Lego and other Westinghouse personnel met with Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s. The plan submitted by Westinghouse differed in several respects from the Model Plan prepared by Lazard. \u00b6 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-16\">On February 27, 1991, Westinghouse announced its $975 million charge against 1990 earnings. Allegedly Lazard and Price Waterhouse knew this \u201cdid not provide for adequate reserves,\u201d and \u201cchose to conceal the losses\u201d with a \u201ccrash effort to sell off the losing real estate loans and properties.\u201d \u00b6 155. Lazard allegedly also prepared a document for use at the February 27, 1991 board meeting entitled Westinghouse Electric \u2014 Board Meeting Q &amp; A, and which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-17\">Q: Are the reserves adequate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-18\">A: Given the results of each of these review processes, the charge taken today is clearly reasonable but was at the low end of the range identified by management in conjunction with the strategic review performed by Lazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>The charge taken is clearly based on economic conditions today. Given the unstable environment in which we are currently operating, further economic deterioration could lead to future charges and further capital calls on the parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-4\">Furthermore, the level of charge taken today is also highly contingent on the implementation of disposition strategies, which continue to be developed, and on market conditions. It is based on an understanding of how management will deal with underperforming assets: An orderly but aggressive liquidation plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-5\">In this regard, a timely and active monitoring of the ongoing restructuring/disposition plan is crucial. Not a monthly process, but weekly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-6\">Q: When do we need to see \u201creal\u201d results?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-7\">A: By the end of the second quarter following the charge, meaningful results should be evident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-8\">A timely reduction in commercial paper through application of cash proceeds raised via asset dispositions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-9\">A progressive reduction in the level of underperforming assets; and Stable to increasing core earnings and ROE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-10\">Q: What happens in the event there is further deterioration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-11\">A: More draconian steps would be required to preserve credit ratings at a cost to current earnings. But to the extent that WCC\u2019s asset disposition strategy, or its ability to term out additional debt, can reduce commercial paper in the near term, there will be less of a risk due to further economic deterioration an/or [sic] a drop in credit ratings. The key is clearly what can be done in the near-term prior to any further deterioration. \u00b6 157.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">In April and May of 1991, Westinghouse proceeded with another facet of its restructuring plan, a public offering of 19 million shares of common stock. Westinghouse filed a prospectus and registration statement with the SEC in connection with the offering which took place on May 9, 1991. The prospectus stated that the financial statements incorporated by reference in the prospectus were incorporated \u201cin reliance on the report of Price Waterhouse.\u201d \u00b6 168; Exhibit Q to Westinghouse Memo at 18. The public offering was apparently completed before the fall of 1991. On September 6,1991, Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s downgraded Westinghouse\u2019s commercial paper. \u00b6 178. In response, Westinghouse took an additional $1.68 billion charge to add to its reserve for loan losses. \u00b6 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">Plaintiffs allege that as early as October, 1990, Lazard and Price Waterhouse knew that the conditions which Westinghouse gave in October 1991 as reasons for its additional charge existed. \u00b6 182. Plaintiffs allege that Lazard and Price Waterhouse also knew facts in February 1991 that should have caused them to conclude that the first charge was grossly inadequate. <em>Id. </em>Lazard and Price Waterhouse nonetheless allegedly aided Westinghouse in taking the $975 million charge by representing that it was adequate to cover losses inherent in WCC\u2019s portfolio, which resulted in the share prices of the May, 1991 offering not reflecting the true financial weakness of the company. \u00b6 183, \u00b6 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">Plaintiffs also allege that in connection with public documents and SEC filings Price Waterhouse made knowing or reckless misrepresentations by falsely stating that Westinghouse and WCC\u2019s internal controls were adequate, \u00b6 351, \u00b6371*, when in fact Price Waterhouse knew, \u00b6 355, that they were not. Allegedly, WCC lacked standards for reporting, <em>inter alia, </em>in-substance foreclosures, \u00b6 356, cash-flow projections, \u00b6 357, internal valuations, \u00b6 358-60, and lending policies. \u00b6\u00b6 369-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-17\">Plaintiffs contend that Price Waterhouse also falsely stated that the financial statements accompanying the Annual Reports accurately represented WCC\u2019s financial position, \u00b6 192, \u00b6 347*, and that Price Water-house\u2019s audits of those statements were conducted in accordance with GAAS. \u00b6 192, \u00b6 351*, \u00b6 365*.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">According to plaintiffs, Price Waterhouse on January 23, 1991 also was aware that WFSI had identified $2.6 billion in underperforming assets, but nonetheless stated that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>believed WFSI\u2019s loss reserves for 1990 were adequate. \u00b6 360*, \u00b6 361*.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Additionally, Price Waterhouse was retained by Westinghouse in August, 1990 to act as CFO for Brad Cable. WCC provided $10 million to effect a leveraged buyout of Brad Cable in September, 1990. Allegedly, Price Waterhouse\u2019s inventory of Brad Cable revealed shortfalls which were covered by WCC. \u00b6\u00b6 297-99. Acting as CFO of Brad Cable at the same time Price Waterhouse was auditing Westinghouse\u2019s financial statements allegedly rendered Price Waterhouse unable to conduct an independent audit of Westinghouse, \u00b6405, thereby resulting in Price Waterhouse accepting incorrect information from WCC. \u00b6\u00b6 374-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">The allegations summarized above are the basis for the following causes of action against the secondary defendants:</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Count One \u2014 In \u00b6 409, Price Waterhouse and Lazard are alleged to have violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making \u201cstatements, described above [which] were false and misleading when made.\u201d The general reference to statements is understood to refer to the specific statements alleged in the body of the complaint, which are again summarized in \u00b6 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Count Two \u2014 In \u00b6 429 and \u00b6 430, Price Waterhouse, Lazard and the underwriter defendants are alleged to have violated Section 11 of the Securities Act in connection with the May, 1991 public offering, by participating in the making of false statements in the registration statement, prospectus, and documents incorporated therein. The references to false statements made or true statements not made are understood to refer to the specifics alleged in the body of the complaint, and are summarized in \u00b6\u00b6 431-433, and in \u00b6 434 as to Price Waterhouse only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">Count Three \u2014 Lazard and the underwriter defendants are alleged, in \u00b6 442, to have sold Westinghouse common stock in the May 1991 offering through the use of a false or misleading registration statement and prospectus in violation of Section 12(2) of the Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">Count Four \u2014 Price Waterhouse is alleged to have violated Section 11 of the Securities Act in the same manner alleged in Count Two, towards the persons who purchased Westinghouse common stock directly through Westinghouse\u2019s dividend reinvestment plan. \u00b6 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Finally, in Count Six, Price Waterhouse, Lazard and the underwriter defendants are alleged to have committed the tort of negligent misrepresentation by failing to disclose Westinghouse\u2019s lack of adequate reserves and by affirmatively representing that Westinghouse\u2019s loss reserves were adequate and that Westinghouse\u2019s book value accurately reflected its financial condition. \u00b6469.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">IV. <em>PLEADING STANDARDS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">A. <em>Rule 12(b)(6)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">When deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint, and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Markowitz v.

By way of example, allegations of \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper story,\u201d would satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b). <em>See Dileo v.

Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>606 F.Supp. 889, 894 (W.D.Pa.1985), serves three purposes: \u201c(1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a \u2018strike suit\u2019; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations.\u201d <em>Fox v.

Kraftsow, </em>890 F.2d 628, 645 (3d Cir.1989); but a plaintiff who makes such allegations must still provide a \u201cstatement of the facts upon which the allegations are based.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Finally, Rule 9(b) permits \u201cknowledge and other condition of mind of a person [to be] averred generally.\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs need not plead intent to defraud with stringent particularity to permit the inference that the defendants are accused of possessing the requisite scienter to state a cause of action for fraud. <em>Cramer v.

Plaintiffs need not allege reliance, scienter or damages, <em>see </em>Louis Loss, <em>Fundamentals of Securities Litigation </em>896-97, 902 (2d ed. 1988), though they must allege that the shares they purchased are traceable to a false or misleading registration statement. <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">E. <em>Section 12(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">Section 12(2) of the Securities Act provides that a person who \u201coffers or sells\u201d newly issued securities \u201cby means of a prospectus or oral communication\u201d that misrepresents or omits a material fact \u201cis liable to the person purchasing such security from him\u201d in an initial offering. 15 U.S.C. <em>77l </em>(1988). As with Section 11, plaintiffs need not allege scienter on the part of the defendant, nor must they allege their own reliance on the misstatement or omission. However, in order to state a claim under Section 12(2), plaintiffs must allege that they did not know of the defendants\u2019 untruth or omission, and that the defendants knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, could have known of the misrepresentation or omission. <em>See Ballay v.

The two theories asserted must be considered separately and distinctly, because aider and abettor liability should properly focus on the connection between the alleged conduct of Westinghouse and the alleged conduct of the secondary defendants, not on the relationship between the plaintiff class and the secondary defendants. Only if Price Waterhouse, Lazard, and the other underwriters are alleged to have knowingly or recklessly participated in Westinghouse\u2019s allegedly fraudulent actions in a substantial way can they be properly held as aiders and abettors. <em>Monsen v.

The direct liability claims against the accountant and underwriters, by contrast, require examination of the communication or nondisclosure of information by the accountant and underwriters to the plaintiffs.

The effect of this alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>manipulation would be to overstate the quality of the receivables portfolio, thereby deceiving the investing public into believing that those portfolios were more valuable (i.e., had a higher expected future cash flow) than they actually did. \u00b6\u00b6 194-198.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">Specifically, plaintiffs allege that Westinghouse and WCC systematically deleted certain assets from the nonearning receivables category during the last month of each quarter. Nonearning loans were allegedly restructured, \u00b6204, and transferred to the unreported \u201cless-than-carry,\u201d or, more conventionally, \u201creduced-earning\u201d receivables category. \u00b6 205. Plaintiffs allege that this concealment scheme enabled Westinghouse and WCC to create the appearance that they \u201cwere justified in recognizing income on those receivables when such recognition was wholly unwarranted.\u201d \u00b6 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Plaintiffs similarly allege that WCC routinely \u201crestructured and modified\u201d the loans of defaulting borrowers \u201cto earn less than their original contract interest rates\u201d in order \u201cto avoid the disclosure and required recognition of substantial losses on these loans.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 57-60. In this manner, plaintiffs aver, WCC increased its internally recorded reduced earning receivables account by approximately $1 billion. \u00b6 62. The effect of these loan restructurings was to mislead \u201cthe marketplace into the belief that WCC\u2019s problem loans were limited to the reported but artificially deflated nonearning receivables, which amounted to only 5-7% of WCC\u2019s net real estate receivables portfolio,\u201d when in reality, by plaintiffs\u2019 calculations, WCC\u2019s \u201cproblem real estate loans\u201d constituted \u201cas much as 60% of its real estate loan portfolio.\u201d \u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Defendants argue that restructuring loans for defaulting borrowers is \u201ca perfectly reasonable business practice,\u201d not inconsistent with GAAP, and that plaintiffs\u2019 concealment theory is \u201centirely conclusory, with no allegations regarding specific loans or deviations, much less material deviations, from generally accepted accounting principles.\u201d Westinghouse Memo at 21. Defendants also contend that those specific accounts that plaintiffs have identified and alleged to be part of the concealment scheme, \u00b6\u00b6 207-245, constitute such a small portion of the 536 accounts for which plaintiffs have had discovery (an even smaller portion of all Westinghouse assets) as to be immaterial. Westinghouse Memo at 32; <em>see also </em>Appendix 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to defendants\u2019 manipulation of non-earning and reduced earning receivables do not satisfy the pleading standards under Section 10(b) of the Securities Act and Rule 9(b). Plaintiffs repeatedly claim that defendants\u2019 lacked a \u201cbasis\u201d or \u201creasonable justification\u201d for restructuring nonearning loans and reclassifying them as reduced earning loans. \u00b6\u00b6 207-245. But these allegations amount to no more than a dispute over the accuracy of defendants\u2019 accounting practices, or a challenge to Westinghouse\u2019s opinion and belief as to when collectibility on the loans became doubtful, neither of which constitutes an actionable claim. <em>See Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 479, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 1304, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977) (internal corporate mismanagement not actionable under \u00a7 10(b)); <em>In re Scott Paper Securities Litigation, </em>138 P.R.D. 56 (E.D.Pa.1991) (allegation that a projection was issued without a reasonable basis and therefore actionable \u201cmust contain facts that if proved would substantiate the charge of lack of a reasonable basis\u201d) (citing <em>Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 645).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">Plaintiffs obviously attempt to allege more than simple internal corporate mismanagement, and paint a picture of asset manipulation in the service of nondisclosure. Plaintiffs claim that Westinghouse and WCC attempted to conceal nonearning receivables by restructuring and improperly reclassifying them as reduced earning receivables, and that defendants knew or should have known this was inconsistent with reasonable accounting practices. This is an allegation that, if properly made, would significantly influence the reasonable investor, <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 281. However, without an explanation of <em>how </em>defendants\u2019 actions violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation is conclusory rather than factual, and therefore insufficient under the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>See Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 284-85; <em>Christidis, </em>717 F.2d at 100. To the extent plaintiffs\u2019 claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>rests on defendants\u2019 alleged restructuring and reclassifying certain accounts, without more, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Whether or not defendants\u2019 restructurings and reclassifications were justified or made with sufficient basis, defendants still had a duty to disclose the fact and effects of the restructurings and reclassifications. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that defendants failed to so disclose, <em>see e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 198, 211, 213, 216, 219, 223, 229, 238, 240, 242, directly concern the \u201cphilosophy of full disclosure,\u201d <em>Santa Fe, </em>430 U.S. at 477, 97 S.Ct. at 1303, embodied in the federal securities laws, and withstands defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that Westinghouse and WCC failed in several Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs to (1) report their aggregate troubled debt restructurings, and (2) disclose the amount of interest that would have been earned if its restructured loans had been performing in accordance with their original terms, and the amount of commitments defendants made \u201cto lend additional funds to debtors owing receivables whose terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 197-98. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 15, this information should have been disclosed, and defendants do not dispute that it was not disclosed. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation is pled with sufficient particularity, as it states when and where the omissions were made, and'how defendants failed to comply with GAAP. This claim withstands defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">2. <em>\u201cWestinghouse and WCC Concealed Real Estate Foreclosures and Losses Through Special Arrangements with the Tontis\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding WCC\u2019s \u201cjoint venture\u201d with Edmond and Robert Tonti, \u00b6\u00b6 65-76, 330-42, are similar to their allegations that defendants concealed non-earning receivables by reclassifying them as reduced earning receivables. WCC allegedly restructured nonperforming commercial real estate loans in such a way that, in economic substance, WCC, and not the Tontis, was the owner of the underlying property in a kind of \u201cjoint venture\u201d arrangement. In form, however, this alleged \u201cjoint venture\u201d was characterized as an ordinary receivable investment, permitting WCC to understate its joint venture portfolios. \u00b6\u00b6 330-340. In this manner, plaintiffs aver, Westinghouse and WCC also avoided reporting losses and taking write-downs on collateral which was in-substance foreclosed, and the \u201ceffect ... was to materially inflate the earnings, assets and net worth of Westinghouse and WCC during the Class Period....\u201d \u00b6342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of fraud are derived from the Tontis\u2019 own allegations in an action brought against Westinghouse in another district to prevent Westinghouse from enforcing loan obligations, \u00b6 65.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As such, it is more akin to hearsay than the type of <em>facts </em>that must accompany plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \u201cindicating why the charges against defendants are not baseless.\u201d <em>Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">A more serious flaw in this claim is that it primarily alleges mismanagement. A fraud allegation based upon failure to disclose a devalued asset base, or failure to timely foreclose in substance upon devalued property is inadequate unless it explains the wrongfulness of defendants\u2019 course of action. Plaintiffs do not allege why under GAAP the Tonti properties should have been foreclosed rather than recognized as possible income. Similarly, plaintiffs baldly state but do not allege how, under GAAP, the economic substance of the restructured loans compels the conclusion that WCC actually entered into a joint venture with the Tontis. Making additional commercial real estate loans at below market rates to a struggling debtor who \u201crarely invested any capital in the [underlying] properties,\u201d \u00b6 70, is risky, may be wrongheaded, may even be gross mismanagement, but it is not fraudulent. <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 283 (improper loan collateralization and insufficient loan management prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>tice not actionable under securities laws). Tacking the phrase \u201cin order to conceal losses\u201d onto the end of such an allegation does not convert it from an allegation of mismanagement into a fraud claim any more than does \u201cinserting the words \u2018defendants failed to disclose that ... \u2019 before the claimed mismanagement.\u201d <em>Fox v. Equimark Corp., </em>782 F.Supp. at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">3. <em>\u201cWestinghouse and WCC Misrepresented the Adequacy of Their Loan Loss Reserves\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">When \u201c[i]t is probable that as of the date of the financial statements,\u201d one or more future events will occur confirming that the value of \u201can asset has been impaired or a liability incurred, based on information available before the actual issuance date of the financial statements,\u201d and \u201cthe amount of loss can be reasonably estimated,\u201d the loan loss reserve<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> established for that asset should be \u201caccrued as a charge to income as of the date of the financial statements.\u201d <em>See </em>Martin A. Miller, <em>GAAP Guide 1992 </em>6.02-6.03 (1992). If the loss appears only \u201creasonably possible\u201d or \u201cremote,\u201d as of the date of the financial statements, GAAP requires that the loan loss reserve be disclosed by footnote, or not disclosed at all, respectively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Plaintiffs allege that \u201cWestinghouse and WCC failed to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in setting their loan loss reserves,\u201d by failing to \u201cmake estimates of specific losses whenever possible, using optimistic assumptions in estimating certain losses, and bas[ing] their overall loss reserves not on a loan-by-loan analysis but on historical benchmark percentages of total loans outstanding, which was inappropriate.... \u201d \u00b6 249. These failings allegedly caused Westinghouse and WCC to misrepresent the adequacy of loss reserves for WFSI in several of its SEC reports, registration statement and prospectus during the proposed class period. \u00b6\u00b6 250-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">In \u00b6\u00b6 250-257, plaintiffs allege that Westinghouse and WCC \u201cknowingly of recklessly misrepresented in the Notes to the Financial Statements ... the adequacy of [their] loss reserves\u201d in their Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs during the period covering the last quarter of 1988 through the second quarter of 1991. Each of the allegedly misleading statements from those SEC reporting forms represents essentially that: (1) Westinghouse or WCC maintains an allowance for possible losses on financing receivables; (2) at a level which provides adequately for future losses that may develop in the portfolio; (3) which allowance or reserve is \u201cbased on historical trends\u201d and \u201cpast ehargeoff experience,\u201d \u201ccurrent delinquencies, the characteristics of the accounts, the value of the underlying collateral and general economic conditions and trends.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 252-257; Exhibit N to Westinghouse Memo at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">Plaintiffs also aver that the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations in their SEC reports were exacerbated by individual Westinghouse officials. In particular, plaintiffs point to the October 24, 1990 statement made by Westinghouse Chairman Paul Lego to a gathering of securities analysts allegedly miseharacterizing WFSI\u2019s reserves as \u201cadequate,\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 258-59, and to a statement by another Westinghouse spokesman, in June 1991, allegedly responding to statement by George Fraise, a market analyst for Smith Barney, that a $500 million write off for Westinghouse was \u201cvery possible\u201d by saying: \u201cOur position on that is that we believe that we have taken an adequate reserve, and at this time we don\u2019t believe that any further reserve is necessary.\u201d \u00b6262.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">Since the late-1980s, federal courts in the northeast region of the United States, where the downturn in real estate markets has been especially severe, have become familiar with Section 10(b) claims alleging loan loss reserve misrepresentations, and the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>in this area is well-developed. The mere fact that loan loss reserves are discovered, <em>ex post, </em>to be inadequate, does not provide the basis for a securities fraud claim. <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 283 (\u201cit is not a violation of the securities laws to simply fail to provide adequate loan loss reserves; properly collateralize or secure a loan portfolio; or provide sufficient internal controls or loan management practices\u201d). However, where the defendant has commented on the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS3\">\u201cnature and quality of the management practices that it has used to reach a particular statement of loan loss reserves,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aax\">or has otherwise</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-4\">\u201ccharaeterize[d] loan loss reserves as \u2018adequate\u2019 or \u2018solid\u2019 even though it knows they are inadequate or unstable, it exposes itself to possible liability for securities fraud. By addressing the quality of a particular management practice, a defendant declares the subject of its representation to be material to the reasonable shareholder, and thus is bound to speak truthfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\"><em>See Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 281-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Westinghouse, through spokesmen and in its SEC reports, undeniably used such language to describe its loan loss reserves, <em>see e.g., </em>Exhibit M to Westinghouse Memo at 42 (\u201cThe financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances .... \u201d \u201cWe believe that the Corporation\u2019s policies and procedures, including its system of internal accounting controls, provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the applicable securities laws and with a corresponding standard of business conduct\u201d), which, <em>under Shapiro </em>would put its loan loss reserves \u201cin play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">a. <em>Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">If a corporation\u2019s agents\u2019 projections or opinions with respect to data such as loan loss reserves are reasoned and justified, with a sound factual or historical basis, they are not actionable even if inaccurate. <em>Eisenberg v. Gagnon, </em>766 F.2d 770, 776 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 946, 106 S.Ct. 342, 88 L.Ed.2d 290 (1985). However, when such opinions are \u201cissued without a genuine belief or reasonable basis,\u201d are made knowingly or recklessly, <em>and </em>are inaccurate, <em>see Virginia Bankshares Inc. v. Sandberg, </em>498 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929, 948 (1991) (\u201cdisbelief or undisclosed motivation, standing alone, [is] insufficient to satisfy the element of fact\u201d in a securities fraud action), they constitute \u201cculpable conduct actionable under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\u201d <em>Eisenberg, </em>766 F.2d at 776 (citations omitted). The issuer\u2019s alleged recklessness in issuing the baseless opinions or projections is sufficient to establish the scienter element of a Section 10(b) claim. <em>Id. </em>at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Where the corporate director or officer has \u201cgreater access to information or [ ] a special relationship to investors making use of the information, there is an obligation to disclose data indicating that the opinion or forecast may be doubtful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 776 (citations omitted). However, management does not have a duty to paint a dark picture of its mismanaged operations, so long as a \u201creasonably detailed account of past operations and complete financial statements\u201d are disclosed. <em>See Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 640 (affirming dismissal of claims that management failed to characterize \u201cits financial reporting and accounting controls as inadequate and ineffective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">Defendants argue that the loan loss reserves allegations cannot support a cause of action, because the allegedly necessary loss reserves were not established for many individual accounts until Westinghouse abandoned its hold for the long term strategy on February 27, 1991. Westinghouse alleges that prior to that time the adequacy of WFSI\u2019s and WCC\u2019s loan loss reserves was properly determined primarily by analyzing past chargeoff experience and historical trends, though defendants\u2019 SEC reports purport that other, more individualized factors were considered as well. In addition, defendants say, Westinghouse and its subsidiaries truly believed its representations regarding the adequacy of their loan loss reserves, and unless plaintiffs can allege facts showing otherwise, plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">Loan loss reserves are a type of \u201csoft information,\u201d consisting essentially of predic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>tions about the future performance of receivables portfolios. As such, characterizations of reserves as adequate are necessarily a matter of opinion and belief. <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 281 (\u201cNo matter what method is used, the economic judgments made in setting loan loss reserves can be validated only at some future date\u201d). Such characterizations can be both material, <em>see Virginia Bankshares, </em>498 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 2757, 115 L.Ed.2d at 944; <em>Flynn v. Bass Bros., Inc., </em>744 F.2d 978, 988 (3d Cir.1984), and factual, for \u201cconclusory terms in a commercial context are reasonably understood to rest on a factual basis ... and expressions of such judgments can be uttered with knowledge of truth or falsity just like more definite statements.\u201d <em>Virginia Bankshares, </em>498 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 2758, 115 L.Ed.2d at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">Plaintiffs have alleged the lack of reasonable basis for failure to take loss reserves in the individual cases with sufficient particularity to put defendants on notice of the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiffs are merely quibbling over one of at least two proper methods of establishing reserves for commercial real estate under GAAP, Westinghouse Memo at 34, loses some force under the combined weight of standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Bradford-White Corp. v. Ernst &amp; Whinney, </em>872 F.2d 1153 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 993, 110 S.Ct. 542, 107 L.Ed.2d 539 (1989) (upholding jury finding that auditor who claimed to comply with generally accepted auditing standards but did not was liable under Rule 10b-5), and would be a matter more properly raised on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">b. <em>Materiality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">Plaintiffs discuss six particular accounts and list seven others in WCC\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio, alleging that even though each of the accounts was underperforming no reserve was established. <em>See Di-Leo, </em>901 F.2d at 626; <em>Fox v. Equimark Corp., </em>782 F.Supp. at 300 (in order to state an actionable claim under the securities laws, the plaintiff must specify how the defendant knew its reserves were inadequate or why it should have increased its reserves earlier). Plaintiffs contend that defendants failed to establish reserves for these accounts without reasonable basis, and that that constitutes fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">Still, to survive a motion to dismiss,. Rule 9(b) requires that a plaintiff plead a specific false representation of a <em>material </em>fact. <em>See Christidis, </em>717 F.2d at 99. Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of materiality in <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976), \u201c[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding\u201d whether to trade shares of the corporation\u2019s stock. \u201cPut another way, there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>The adequacy of loan loss reserves is the type of information that would significantly influence a reasonable investor, <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 281. But the legal materiality of a fact does not turn solely upon the <em>type of </em>information that fact represents. Materiality has both a qualitative and a quantitative dimension. If a particular fact alleged is relevant in terms of the sort of information that investors care about, i.e., information concerning the management and financial position of a corporation, but trifling as a matter of consequence, the information is not legally material. The failure to disclose that a loan portfolio is likely to be impaired by some <em>de minimis </em>amount may be \u201crelevant\u201d in that it is the type of information that investors care about, but of such \u201cdubious significance,\u201d <em>TSC Industries, </em>426 U.S. at 448, 96 S.Ct. at 2132, as to be \u201ctrivial,\u201d and \u201chardly conducive to informed decisionmaking,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 448-49, 96 S.Ct. at 2132, so that to reasonable shareholders, such omission must be immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Instantly, plaintiffs cite examples of problem loans for which WCC allegedly should have, but did not, establish reserves, from periods including the fourth quarter of 1989 through the fourth quarter of 1990. Using plaintiffs\u2019 <em>highest </em>suggested numbers, the total dollar amount of reserves plaintiffs allege were wrongfully not established for each quarter represents a miniscule portion of WCC\u2019s current assets<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for that quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">For example, plaintiffs allege that, during the fourth quarter of 1989, Westinghouse should have reserved between $10 million and $25 million to cover expected losses on its loan to Focus Financial Group Inc., \u00b6 277, and an unspecified substantial amount to cover expected losses on its non-recourse first mortgage on the Daniel Building, an office building in Greenville, South Carolina. \u00b6 283. Westinghouse\u2019s financial statement in its Form 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1989 represented current assets<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of $6,779,000,000. Assuming that the reserves plaintiffs allege defendants should have established during the fourth quarter of 1989 totalled $31 million, the reserves would have represented only 0.46 percent of Westinghouse\u2019s current assets for the same period. Similar calculations for successive quarters yield percentages of 0.21% for the first quarter of 1990,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 1.06% for the second quarter of 1990,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 0.24% for the third quarter of 1990,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 1.28% for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>the fourth quarter of 1990.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In fact, by the end of the fourth quarter of 1990, all the loan loss reserves that plaintiffs allege should have been established, <em>added together, </em>amounted to only 3.0% of Westinghouse\u2019s current assets at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Given these small numbers, it would seem doubtful that plaintiffs have alleged facts showing a <em>material </em>misrepresentation or omission, especially since they have had the benefit of conducting discovery on some 536 loan files <em>before </em>filing their amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">However, the focus on loan loss reserves as a percentage of current assets is misplaced. When it appears \u201cprobable\u201d (as opposed to \u201creasonably possible\u201d or \u201cremote\u201d) that an asset has been impaired by an amount that can be reasonably estimated, the previously established loss reserve, or \u201closs contingency,\u201d should be treated as an actual loss. At that point, the proper accounting response is to accrue the loss reserve as a charge against income as of the date of the financial statements. FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 5 at \u00b6 8. What is affected most immediately by the development of a loss reserve for accounting purposes is income, not assets. In order to determine the materiality of allegedly inadequate loan loss reserves, the focus then must be the amount of loan loss reserves alleged to have been wrongfully not posted as a percentage of income during the relevant period, rather than as a percentage of current assets. <em>See Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Shared Medical Systems Corp., </em>1992 WL 208029 n. 5 (ED.Pa.1992) (rejecting defendants\u2019 argument that an absolute rule of 10 percent defines materiality in securities fraud cases, and considering effect of alleged misstatement on income).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">In 1989, Westinghouse had net income of $922 million, of which $270 million was earned in the fourth quarter. Exhibit L to Westinghouse Memo at 9. Westinghouse\u2019s 1990 net income, unadjusted for the February 27,1991 $975 million pretax charge against 1990 fourth quarter earnings, was $1,001,000,000. After the charge, Westinghouse\u2019s 1990 net income was $268 million. Westinghouse\u2019s unadjusted 1990 fourth quarter net income was $284 million. After the charge, Westinghouse experienced a 1990 fourth quarter net loss of $449 million. Exhibits K and M to Westinghouse Memo at 7 and 22 (1990 Form 10-K.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">Plaintiffs have identified $26 million and $76,442,237 in loan loss reserves wrongfully not established for the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1990. These amounts represent 9.6% of reported 1989 fourth quarter income, and 26.9% of 1990 fourth quarter income (unadjusted), respectively. For the 1990 fiscal year, plaintiffs have identified $153,442,-237 of reserves that they allege should have been posted. These amounts represent approximately 15% of Westinghouse\u2019s 1990 net income, unadjusted for the February 27,1991 charge against 1990 fourth quarter earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">At the motion to dismiss stage of litigation, doubts about materiality should be resolved in favor of the non-movant. <em>See TSC Industries, Inc., </em>426 U.S. at 450, 96 S.Ct. at 2132. With that in mind, and without deciding the applicability of Item 103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.103 (requiring disclosure of extraordinary legal proceedings involving claims exceeding 10 percent of current assets), to actions for allegedly misrepresented loan loss reserves, the Court believes that plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations of wrongfully understated reserves are sufficiently substantial, in relation to Westinghouse\u2019s net income for the relevant time periods, to be deemed legally material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">c. <em>\u201cBespeaks Caution\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">I stated above that defendants\u2019 representations in their SEC reports, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>public statements by Westinghouse officials, would, <em>ceteris paribus, </em>put the adequacy of defendants\u2019 loan loss reserves \u201cin play,\u201d in which case plaintiffs have pled their claims with sufficient particularity and materiality to withstand defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 246-290. However, when Westinghouse\u2019s and WCC\u2019s statements about the adequacy of their loan loss reserves are considered <em>in tato, see Cortec Industries, Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., </em>949 F.2d at 47 (\u201cwhen a district court decides a motion to dismiss a complaint alleging securities fraud, it may review and consider public disclosure documents required by law to be and which actually have been filed with the SEC\u201d), it is apparent that the statements are not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Defendants did not, as plaintiffs\u2019 allegations suggest, tender to the investing public only confident statements of fact that Westinghouse and WCC\u2019s loan loss reserves were adequate and without risk of future increase. Rather, in their annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC, defendants consistently hedged their statements of belief about the adequacy of Westinghouse and WCC loan loss reserves, and the prospects of future operations, with qualifying remarks transparent enough to raise red flags for even the least sophisticated investor. For example, after noting the February 27, 1991 special provision for losses charged against 1990 fourth quarter earnings, the Management Discussion and Analysis section of Westinghouse\u2019s 1990 Form 10-K annual report warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-5\">Management expects earnings for the first quarter of 1991 to be approximately 50% lower than the comparable period in 1990, because of lower operating profit due to deteriorating economic conditions and reduced non-recurring income. Second quarter earnings are expected to be higher than the first quarter, but significantly lower than the second quarter of 1990----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-7\">For the remainder of the year, it is difficult to predict the depth and duration of the current economic downturn and the effects of the current worldwide economic and political uncertainty, particularly in the area of the Persian Gulf, on the economy and, consequently, on corporate performance. Assuming no further deterioration in the Corporation\u2019s markets, the second half of 1991 is expected to outperform the comparable period of 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">Exhibit M to Westinghouse Memo at 17. Referring specifically to the adequacy of loan loss reserves, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASv\">Management believes that, under current economic conditions, the allowance for losses at December 31, 1990 will be adequate to cover future losses that may develop in the various portfolios. However, no assurance can be given that a further or more prolonged downturn in the economy will not have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay and on asset values generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 19. WCC\u2019s 1990 Form 10-K contained almost identical language. <em>See </em>Exhibit N to Westinghouse Memo at 4, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">In its Form S-3 Registration Statement, filed with the SEC on or about April 18,1991 in preparation for a public offering of common stock, Westinghouse disclosed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0C\">The $3.4 billion in higher-risk and underperforming assets reclassified as held for sale or restructuring [pursuant to Westinghouse\u2019s restructuring plan announced on February 27, 1991] included $2.4 billion in receivables. As such, these receivables had and continue to have a high probability of becoming non-earning assets during the expected period of liquidation. Although changes in these assets between earning, reduced earning, non-earning or real estate owned have occurred since December 31, 1990, management does not believe that such changes have had a material effect on the net realizable value of these receivables.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-12\">At March 31, 1991, WFSI\u2019s valuation allowances related to assets held for sale or restructuring, and the allowances for credit losses related to the assets in the ongoing portfolio, amounted to $1,013 million and $306 million, respectively. Management believes that under current economic conditions such allowances should be adequate to cover future losses that may occur. However, a further or more prolonged downturn in the economy or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>real estate, securities or certain other markets could have a negative effect on the ability of WFSI\u2019s borrowers to repay and on asset values generally and could result in additional increases in non-earning assets, restructured loans and, ultimately, increases in allowances for losses in both assets held for sale or restructuring and receivables in the balance of WFSI\u2019s portfolio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Exhibit 0 to Westinghouse Memo at 8, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">On or about May 14,1991 and, Form 10-Q, August 14, 1991, Westinghouse and WCC filed quarterly reports for the first and second quarters, respectively, of 1991. Exhibits R, S, T and U to Westinghouse Memo. Westinghouse stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-7\">Management believes that under current economic conditions, [WFSI\u2019s valuation] allowances should be adequate to cover future losses that may occur. However, a further or more prolonged downturn in the economy or in the real estate, securities or certain other markets could have a negative effect on the ability of WFSI\u2019s borrowers to repay and on asset values generally, and could result in additional increases in nonearning assets, restructured loans and, ultimately, increases in allowances for losses in both assets held for sale or restructuring and receivables in the balance of WFSI\u2019s portfolio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">Exhibit R to Westinghouse Memo at 8. WCC\u2019s Form 10-Q also cautioned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-9\">The majority of receivables held for sale or restructuring are underperforming. Results of sale and restructuring activities related to these receivables were not material for the quarter because implementation of the downsizing plan began late in the quarter. Although management intends to liquidate these assets over the next three years, declining liquidity in credit markets may affect management\u2019s ability to achieve the desired results. Furthermore, Westinghouse Credit may be required to continue to provide financing for certain of these assets, either to existing borrowers to restructure loans or to new borrowers to finance the sale of real estate properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-10\">Nonearning assets at March 31, 1991 included $261 million due from companies that have filed for bankruptcy. A continued downturn in the economy and certain markets served by borrowers may have an effect on the ability of some borrowers to comply with their agreements. This could result in additional increases in nonearning receivables, restructured loans and credit losses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">Exhibit S to Westinghouse Memo at 13, 15; Exhibit U to Westinghouse Memo at 16.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7W\">Westinghouse further disclosed that: Management expects earnings for the second half of 1991 to be down 25% or more from the 1990 second-half results,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-12\">[t]he decline in operating profit [for the first six months of 1991] was due to significantly higher levels of nonearning and reduced earning receivables and a reduction in gains from sales of equity interests in financing transactions.

A further or more prolonged downturn in the economy or in real estate, securities, or certain other markets could have a negative effect on the ability of WFSI\u2019s borrowers to repay and on asset values generally, and could result in additional increases in nonearning assets, restructured loans and, ultimately, increases in allowances for losses in both assets held for sale or restructuring and receivables in the balance of WFSI\u2019s portfolio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-17\">In its Form 10-Q report for the second quarter of 1991, WCC disclosed that although \u201cManagement believes that the revised strategy will reduce portfolio risk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>improve Westinghouse Credit\u2019s future financial position\u201d, [a] lack of liquidity in the markets in which Westinghouse Credit\u2019s customers operate is a continuing concern. Also, a further or more prolonged downturn in these markets or in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay and on asset values generally, and could result in increased credit losses.\u201d Exhibit U to Westinghouse Memo at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">Similarly, after noting that nonearning assets included $186 million due from companies that had filed for bankruptcy, WCC warned that \u201c[a] continued downturn in the economy and certain markets in which Westinghouse Credit\u2019s customers operate may have an effect on the ability of some borrowers to comply with their agreements. This could result in additional increases in non-earning receivables, restructured loans and credit losses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">These remarks, far from being Pollyanish, pointed to still darker clouds on the horizon if the economy generally, and real estate markets specifically, did not improve. It was common knowledge that the likelihood of a prompt rebound in commercial real estate markets was not great during 1990 and 1991, and the reasonable investor would be doubly forewarned after reading Westinghouse\u2019s and WCC\u2019s SEC reports. Furthermore, the professional securities analyst, who is not easily bamboozled by elliptic references to adverse contingencies, would surely take notice of Westinghouse\u2019s disclosures. These professional analysts are generally the first and foremost source of information to the market; their specialized ferreting activity is the primary means by which capital markets are made \u201cefficient,\u201d and stock prices relatively accurate. <em>See generally, </em>Ronald J. Gilson and Reinier H. Kraakman, <em>The Mechanisms of Market Efficiency, </em>70 Va.L.Rev. 549, 569-79 (1984); <em>cf. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 241-45, 108 S.Ct. 978, 988-90, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988); <em>Peil v. Speiser, </em>806 F.2d 1154, 1160-63 (3d Cir.1986) (citing market efficiency as basis for adopting \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory of reliance in securities fraud actions). Plaintiffs do not allege that they actually read any of Westinghouse\u2019s public disclosures, but are instead relying on the alleged fraud on the efficient securities market practiced by Westinghouse. Plaintiffs cannot simultaneously claim that the market participants who at the margin make the market efficient by sophisticated analysis of available information would have naively overlooked Westinghouse\u2019s cautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">Accordingly, despite sufficient allegations of scienter and materiality, defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations about the adequacy of Westinghouse and WCC loan loss reserves were so strongly qualified by clear warnings about the future that plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action based on the averments in \u00b6\u00b6 246-90, except \u00b6258 and \u00b6262, must be dismissed under the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine. This doctrine has been expressly adopted by the courts of appeals for the First, <em>see Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, </em>929 F.2d 875, 879 (1st Cir.1991), Second, <em>see Luce v. Edelstein, </em>802 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir.1986), Sixth, <em>see Sinay v. Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., </em>948 F.2d 1037, 1040 (6th Cir.1991) and Eighth Circuits, <em>see Moorhead v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>949 F.2d 243, 245-46 (8th Cir.1991), and by at least one district court in the Ninth Circuit, <em>see In re Worlds of Wonder Securities Litigation, </em>814 F.Supp. 850 (N.D.Cal.1993), one in the Fifth Circuit, <em>see Porter v. Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc., </em>802 F.Supp. 41, 57 (S.D.Tex.1992), and two district courts in the Third Circuit, <em>see In re Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.

As stated by the court in <em>In re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, </em>\u201cadequate cautionary language ... is the equivalent of full disclosure pertaining to forecasts and predictions, relieving defendants of securities fraud liability, [and] plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not actionable. In essence, the \u2018bespeaks caution\u2019 analysis would subsume or obviate the analysis regarding adequate allegations of falsity or misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552. Put another way, defendants\u2019 statements concerning the adequacy of Westinghouse\u2019s loan loss reserves cannot have been made recklessly, as they were accompanied by sufficiently detailed warnings with respect to future contingencies. <em>Id. </em>at 553 (discussing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>\u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine in light of <em>In re Craftmatic Securities Litigation).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">The cause of action based on the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6258 and 262, shall not be dismissed. Lego\u2019s October 24, 1990 statement (\u201cWe believe our reserves are adequate. We see no major problems there\u201d), and the unidentified Westinghouse spokesman\u2019s unqualified statement on June 24,1991 contradicting Smith Barney securities analyst George Fraise\u2019s opinion about the necessity of another write-off in 1991 lacks the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d language running through Westinghouse\u2019s and WCC\u2019s SEC reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">4. <em>\u201cWestinghouse and WCC Overstated Net Receivables and Understated Real Estate Owned\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Plaintiffs allege at \u00b6\u00b6 291-349 that, throughout the proposed class period, defendants (1) carried as receivables real estate investments that should have been considered foreclosed in substance and therefore accounted for as real estate owned, and (2) misrepresented the value of real estate owned by carrying such assets at the outstanding amounts due under the secured loans, rather than at the fair (market) value of the underlying property \u2014 all in violation of GAAP. In this manner, plaintiffs aver, Westinghouse and WCC knowingly or recklessly misrepresented their net receivables and real estate owned in several SEC annual and quarterly reports. \u00b6\u00b6 294, 295, 311-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">Defendants contend that plaintiffs have not stated actionable claims with respect to five of eight properties that allegedly should have been foreclosed in substance, and that the three other properties, \u00b6\u00b6 324-29, involve dollar amounts so small as to be immaterial. Defendants raise the same immateriality argument in response to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Westinghouse overstated net receivables in \u00b6\u00b6 33(M2. Westinghouse Memo at 34-39; Westinghouse Reply Memo at 21-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">Defendants argue that \u201c[r]efleeting the difference between the original loan amount and the fair value by adjusting a valuation allowance rather than \u2018writing down\u2019 the asset is an entirely appropriate, and, indeed, correct procedure.\u201d Westinghouse Memo at 34-5 (citing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, <em>Statement of Position, Accounting for Foreclosed Assets </em>92-3 \u00b6 12 at 9, Exhibit H to Westinghouse Memo.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The provision of the AICPA Statement of Position cited by defendants does not support their argument. The sentence quoted by defendants prescribes that the deficiency between (a) the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale minus estimated cost to sell and (b) the cost of foreclosed assets held for sale, be recognized as a valuation allowance. The language quoted by defendants does not even address the difference between the original loan amount and the fair value of underlying property, let alone provide a proper method of accounting for it. In fact, the preferable accounting procedure for actual or in substance foreclosures is to carry the asset at its fair value, and recognize the difference between fair value and the recorded investment in the receivable as a loss against net income. FASB, <em>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15 </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">However, FASB Statement No. 15 also \u201crecognizes that creditors use allowances for uncollectible amounts. Thus, a loss from reducing the recorded investment in a receivable may [be] recognized before the restructuring by deducting an estimate of uncollectible amounts in measuring net income and increasing an appropriate valuation allowance. If so, a reduction in the recorded investment in the receivable in a troubled debt restructuring is a deduction from the valuation allowance rather than a loss in measuring net income for the period of restructuring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 35. Under GAAP, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>then, creditors may in fact recognize fluctuating asset values by adjusting valuation allowances, and need not <em>necessarily </em>write down assets, though that appears to be the preferred course. Accordingly, the causes of action based on \u00b6\u00b6 318-323 which allege only failure to write down assets, will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">5. <em>\u201cWestinghouse and WCC Overstated Net Income and Asset Values\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding net income and asset values in \u00b6\u00b6 343^19 are not independent, particular allegations of wrongdoing. Rather, these paragraphs represent the total effect of their previous allegations upon Westinghouse and WCC\u2019s financial statements, which allegations the Court has addressed, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">B. <em>Westinghouse\u2019s Alleged Misrepresentations Regarding the Adequacy of Its Internal Controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">In \u00b6\u00b6 350-73, plaintiffs aver that, throughout the proposed class period, Westinghouse and WCC misrepresented (by overstating) the quality of their internal controls. Defendants\u2019 representations about their internal controls were made in their SEC Form 10-K annual reports, and consisted of the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-8\">The Corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls, supported by adequate documentation, to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the books and records reflect the authorized transactions of the Corporation. Limitations exist in any system of internal accounting controls based upon the recognition that the cost of the system should not exceed the benefits derived. Westinghouse believes its system of internal accounting controls, augmented by its corporate auditing function, appropriately balances the cost-benefit relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-9\">sfc :\u00a1: sj\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-10\">We believe that the Corporation\u2019s policies and procedure, including its system of internal accounting controls, provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the applicable securities laws and with a corresponding standard of business conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">Exhibit M to Westinghouse Memo at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-14\">Plaintiffs also allege liability based on two statements by William A. Powe, Westinghouse\u2019s Executive Vice President and the CEO of WFSI and WCC until October, 1991, which were published in WCC\u2019s 1988 and 1989. annual report in the \u201cMessage to Security Holders.\u201d The statement in the 1988 report assures investors that WCC management had \u201cstrengthened the Company\u2019s evaluation and monitoring of credit and portfolio risks;\u201d the 1989 report states that WCC had given \u201cparticular attention to monitoring the quality and performance of the Commercial real estate financing portfolio, and ... made strategic changes to take advantage of market conditions.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-15\">Finally, in Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 355-73, plaintiffs aver that, sometime prior to August 1990,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> WCC management received from an anonymous WCC employee a tip that WCC\u2019s internal accounting controls were not adequate to ensure the reliability of their reported financial condition. WFSI internal auditors conducted their own investigation, and submitted to Westinghouse a special audit report, dated November 28, 1990. Exhibit Z to Westinghouse Memo. Assessing the validity of the anonymous allegations, the report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-16\">Primary Allegation: Receivable balances are not sufficiently supported by underlying collateral values.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-17\">Conclusion: No exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-18\">Allegation: An independent appraisal for the ECJV property was suppressed because the resultant valuation was significantly less than the outstanding loan balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-19\">Conclusion: No evidence to support allegation. Real estate management considered the appraiser\u2019s underlying assumptions inaccurate and unsupportable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Allegation: Negative information was received from a Leventhal study that was \u201cpushed aside by top management.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-5\">Conclusion: No evidence to support allegation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-6\">Allegation: Underwriters are paid bonuses based on production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-7\">Conclusion: Allegation does not raise concern; controls are reflected in the approval process to prevent abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2. The report then offered, in detail, \u201ccomments and recommendations to improve internal controls\u201d addressing \u201csome overall concerns\u201d that the internal auditors had identified. <em>Id. </em>at cover and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">The causes of action based on the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 350-73 must be dismissed. Plaintiffs have not pled with particularity facts that would put defendants on notice of any claim of alleged fraud, and Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) is meant to foreclose precisely the sort of make-do pleading that this portion of plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint represents. WCC\u2019s internal auditors clearly denied the anonymous allegation that defendants\u2019 internal controls were inadequate. The fact that the internal auditors also recommended improvements in valuation methods and tighter standards for internal valuations does not support plaintiffs\u2019 claim that in its Form 10-Ks Westinghouse fraudulently or even inaccurately represented its internal controls as adequate \u201cto provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the books and records reflect authorized transactions of the corporation.\u201d \u00b6351. Further, the allegations in the complaint that the internal controls were inadequate in fact do not even contradict Powe\u2019s statements in the annual reports that management was strengthening internal controls, much less permit an inference that Powe\u2019s statement was fraudulent. Plaintiffs may not cite confidential communications, policy recommendations and internal memoranda identifying measures by which Westinghouse could improve some area of operations and allege that the corporation had previously committed actionable fraud. Section 10(b) is designed to ensure full and accurate disclosure and may not be used to punish firms for identifying and implementing improvements to corporate policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">C. <em>Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Claim Against the Secondary Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">1. <em>Lazard Freres</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">The additional allegations against Lazard may be summarized as follows: (1) Lazard was retained to advise Westinghouse as to its options, \u00b6 103 <em>et seq.; </em>(2) Lazard conducted a study; (3) Lazard executives Rohatyn and Wilson prepped Lego for the securities analysts meeting of October, 1990 using the Niemcyk memo and attached documents, Exhibit A to Compendium; and (4) Lazard drafted a document, the Question and Answer Memo, relative to proposals to restructure Westinghouse, including by taking a charge against 1990 earnings. \u00b6\u00b6 155-159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">Plaintiffs argue that by taking these actions (1) Lazard advised Lego \u201cto mislead analysts by describing reserves as adequate because \u2018[m]ost analysts are probably unaware of the full extent of the problem\u2019,\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 18; and (2) Lazard prepared the Question &amp; Answer Memo \u201cwhich demonstrated its ... awareness that the $975 million provision was inadequate to protect against likely losses in WCC\u2019s portfolio[,]\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 18-19; and \u201ceffectively orchestrat[ed] a two-step write-down ... by failing to disclose what, at best, was the highly contingent nature of the February 1991 write-down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">Neither of the documents on which plaintiffs base their claim against Lazard \"will bear the construction placed on it. Nowhere in the Niemczyk memo is there any advice to \u201cmislead analysts.\u201d The quotation, \u201cmost analysts are probably unaware of the full extent of the problem,\u201d is extracted by plaintiffs from a discussion of WCC\u2019s position which makes no recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-15\">WCC\u2019s earnings are under pressure. The most obvious problem is a high level of non-performing real estate. Most analysts probably are unaware of the full extent of the problem. This is because part of WCC\u2019s real estate owned (REO) is warehoused at the parent (WFSI) and also because WCC does not publicly disclose renegotiated or \u201cless than carry\u201d loans. To some extent, the level of non-perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ing assets can be managed by lowering interest rates and returning non-earning loans to performing status. The end result is the same \u2014 the overall yield of the portfolio declines, squeezing interest margins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1jW\">Exhibit A to Compendium at 1. The portion of the memo containing Lazard\u2019s proposed answer concerning loss reserves, designed to prepare Lego for analysts\u2019 questions, is set out in full:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">\n<em>Possible Questions</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-5\">Is WCC considering a special charge to earnings to increase loan loss reserves? A restructuring charge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">\n<em>Possible Answers/Approach</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-7\">We believe that our reserves are adequate at the present time. However, we continue to monitor the situation closely and will take whatever steps are necessary to maintain a strong credit profile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-8\">We have no plans at present to take a restructuring charge. [Revise if appropriate for anticipated reductions in branch office staff.] We are undertaking a comprehensive review of our business and will be considering a range of options, [some of which might involve a restructuring charge]. This review is in an early stage and it would be premature to speculate at this time whether a restructuring charge is necessary or even desirable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 7. The proposed answer regarding the adequacy of reserves, prepared only weeks after Lazard was retained, is rendered innocuous by the qualification: \u201cHowever we continue to monitor.... \u201d Further, there are no allegations in the Complaint that even Lego or the other Westinghouse defendants themselves <em>believed </em>at this point that the loss reserves were inadequate, only that the reserves were inadequate <em>in fact </em>and that Price Waterhouse, Lazard and the Westinghouse defendants were either aware of the facts that should have caused them to recognize this inadequacy but did not, or were negligent or reckless in failing to provide internal controls adequate to discover the true state of affairs. <em>See </em>\u00b6 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">Insofar as Lazard (or Price Waterhouse) is alleged to have failed to draw the proper conclusions from known facts, the claims are purely negligence allegations, not claims that Lazard participated with intent to bring about, <em>see Landy v. FDIC, </em>486 F.2d at 163, Lego\u2019s unqualified statement. The claim that Lazard (or the other secondary defendants) provided insufficient internal controls to detect the true state of Westinghouse\u2019s affairs only weeks after being retained is also meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">In fact, Lazard had flagged the issue of loss reserves in the Earnings Outlook portion of its report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-15\">We believe Price Waterhouse (WCC\u2019s auditors) will challenge the adequacy of reserves and argue strongly for additional provisions in the fourth quarter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">Exhibit A to Compendium at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">No reasonable person could conclude from the language of this document (and plaintiffs allege no other actions on Lazard\u2019s part) that Lazard attempted to mislead the securities analysts, or aided and abetted Lego\u2019s alleged attempt to do so. In an attempt to state a claim against Lazard, plaintiffs allege that in the actual presentation to the analysts Lego \u201cfollowed Lazard\u2019s recommended script precisely.\u201d \u00b6 131. Simple comparison of Lazard\u2019s proposed answer and Lego\u2019s alleged actual statements reveals that this characterization is simply not supportable. Even at the pleading stage an allegation which is refuted by the document from which it is derived cannot support a cause of action. The allegation in \u00b6 131 that Rohatyn, Wilson and Niemczyk believed that Lego\u2019s statements to the analysts were false when made still does not satisfy the requirements for a cause of action against Lazard because La<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>zard neither made nor counselled making these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">In \u00b6 136, plaintiffs allege that Lazard recommended that Westinghouse release its fourth-quarter 1990 earnings results without disclosing any of Lazard\u2019s acquired knowledge concerning WCC\u2019s troubled real estate loans or the allegedly planned charge against income. Plaintiffs base this allegation on a document entitled \u201cWestinghouse Financial Services: Discussion Materials,\u201d dated January 9, 1991. Exhibit B to Compendium. The Discussion Materials likewise simply cannot bear the construction placed on them, for there are literally no recommendations at all in the document, and the only mention of a charge against income is posed as an alternative strategy option: \u201cChoose between one-time restructuring charge versus pay-as-you-go alternative.\u201d Exhibit B at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">However, even if Lazard recommended a charge against income to the Westinghouse board, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations would not state a cause of action, because Lazard had no duty to disclose its recommendation to the marketplace of investors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Finally, plaintiffs attempt to state a Section 10(b) claim directly against Lazard based on the May 1991 stock offering by arguing in their brief that Lazard orchestrated a two-step write-down \u2014 i.e. advised Westinghouse to take the February 1991 write-down knowing that the $975 million charge was inadequate. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations bely their conclusions. Plaintiffs\u2019 allege at \u00b6 145, that Lazard completed a Model Plan calling for a $1.0 billion-$1.2 billion charge to increase the loan loss reserves, that Westinghouse management decided on a $975 million charge, \u00b6 148, and that Lazard Freres prepared the Board Meeting Q &amp; A which stated that the $975 million charge was, in Lazard Freres\u2019s opinion, \u201cclearly reasonable but at the low end of the range,\u201d was based on an unstable economic environment, and was contingent on the success of disposing of WCC assets. \u00b6 157. These documents are the only basis for plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Lazard. <em>See </em>\u00b6 158. Plaintiffs make additional allegations concerning Lazard\u2019s knowledge at \u00b6 182-83, but the allegations simply are not relevant to a securities fraud claim. At \u00b6 182, plaintiffs allege that Lazard knew as of the February 27, 1991 board meeting \u201cthat the conditions which Lego cited [in \u00b6 181] for the [$1.68 billion charge] in October of 1991 existed.\u201d That much is not even in dispute. Asserting Lazard\u2019s knowledge that the economy was weak, the real estate credit market was weak, and the market for commercial properties was weak is in no way equivalent to asserting that Lazard was responsible for Westinghouse\u2019s February 1991 $975 million charge knowing that it was inadequate, and planning an undisclosed second charge for October 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">2. Price <em>Waterhouse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">Price Waterhouse was Westinghouse\u2019 independent accountant during the class period, and as auditor expressed its unqualified opinions on the financial statements of Westinghouse, WFSI, and WCC in 1988, 1989, and 1990. \u00b6 14. The unqualified opinions were published in Westinghouse and WCC\u2019s 1988, 1989, and 1990 Form 10-Ks. The 1990 financial statements were also referenced in the prospectus for the May 1991 stock offering by Westinghouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">Additionally, Price Waterhouse reported to the Westinghouse board .of directors\u2019 Audit Review Committee on January 23, 1991, and audited the adequacy of the February 1991 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">Plaintiffs allege that Price Waterhouse violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by certifying in each of these financial documents that Price Waterhouse\u2019s audits were conducted in accordance with GAAS and that the statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP, even though Price Waterhouse violated GAAS as alleged in \u00b6 351, \u00b6\u00b6365*-69*, \u00b6\u00b6 374-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Plaintiffs, in addition to the allegations based on the documents, allege that Price Waterhouse \u201cagreed to maintain reserves at a capped 2.5% (later increased to a grossly inadequate 2.8%) despite known massive increases in problem loans,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6 77-90, and \u201cparticipated in the scheme to defraud by recklessly disregarding the lack of internal controls, failing to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter, failing to broaden the scope of its audit where circumstances required, and failing to maintain independence,\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 371*; <em>see generally </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Plaintiffs do not allege that Price Water-house expressed any opinions or was retained or consented to render opinions in any other public disclosures. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 137-62. Nor do plaintiffs allege that Price Water-house was party to Lazard\u2019s review of Westinghouse\u2019s options in late 1990, nor in the Westinghouse board of directors\u2019 decision to take the $975 million charge. Finally, plaintiffs do not allege that Price Waterhouse was involved in or commented on the $1.68 billion charge taken in October, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Price Waterhouse\u2019s unqualified opinions on Westinghouse\u2019s financial statements in the class period directly violate Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are sufficient to state a claim at this stage of the proceedings. Plaintiffs must allege, in order to state a direct claim, that Price Waterhouse knowingly or with reckless indifference made a false statement of material fact intending to induce the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance thereon. <em>Lewis v. Chrysler Corp., </em>949 F.2d at 649. It is not actionable that a financial statement is incorrect or even that the party audited is committing a fraud which the auditor does not detect, because the expression of the auditor\u2019s opinion does not make the auditor an insurer of every investor who purchases in reliance on the financial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals has approved, although in a distinguishable procedural context, liability based on allegations that an auditing firm misrepresented its adherence to GAAS. <em>See Bradford-White Corp. v. Ernst &amp; Whinney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Measured by the pleading standards of Rule 9, however, the complaint is inadequate to state any cause of action against Price Waterhouse for aiding and abetting. Plaintiffs\u2019 aiding and abetting allegations, for example that Price Waterhouse \u201cagreed\u201d that WCC\u2019s loss reserves would be 2.5%, <em>see </em>\u00b6 80, and \u201capproved\u201d an inadequate level of loss reserves so that the individual Westinghouse defendants could garner performance bonuses, \u00b6 90, are inherently improbable as a matter of fact and insufficient as a matter of law. In the absence of any allegation that would support an inference that Price Water-house had either the legal power or a factual incentive to agree to or approve loss reserves, plaintiffs\u2019 aiding and abetting claim is based on two allegations: (1) that Price Waterhouse received fees from Westinghouse, \u00b6 78, and that it acted as CFO of Brad Cable at the time of some of its audits, \u00b6405.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Accounting firms do not offer their services to large corporations <em>gratis, </em>and there is nothing improper in Price Water-house receiving fees for its services. Nevertheless, a different situation might be presented if plaintiffs alleged that Price Water-house\u2019s compensation was well above the market rate or that it was somehow bartered for a favorable opinion. Paragraph 78 makes no such allegations, and adds nothing to plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">The allegation that Price Water-house\u2019s audit integrity was compromised because it was also acting as CFO of Brad Cable is also rejected. Regulation S-X requires an accountant\u2019s independence, but considers independence to be impaired only by a \u201cdirect financial interest\u201d or a \u201cmaterial indirect financial interest.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.2-01(b). Price Waterhouse\u2019s alleged indirect financial interest in Brad Cable is, on the facts alleged, immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">VI. <em>COUNTS TWO, THREE, FOUR and FIVE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">A. <em>Westinghouse Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">In order to state a claim under Sections 11 and 12(2), plaintiffs need only allege that they acquired a security which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>was accompanied by a registration statement, any part of which contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, regardless of scienter. <em>Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 382, 103 S.Ct. 683, 687, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983). Allegations of \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 12(2) violations that sound in fraud must be pled with the particularity required by Rule 9(b). <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">In \u00b6\u00b6 423-466, plaintiffs allege that all defendants including the individual defendants, violated Sections 11, 12(2) and 15 of the Securities Act by making misrepresentations of fact in the registration statement and prospectus filed with the SEC on April 18, 1991 in connection with the May 1991 public offering, and by offering or selling Westinghouse securities by the use of a misleading prospectus. Specifically, plaintiffs aver that the registration statement and prospectus misrepresented Westinghouse\u2019s earnings, assets, net worth and loan loss reserves. Plaintiffs also aver that Westinghouse falsely predicted in its prospectus that the restructuring plan announced February 27, 1991 would \u201creduce risk and improve the financial position and results of operations of WFSI and WCC in future periods,\u201d and that \u201cmanagement believe[d] that under current economic conditions [WFSI\u2019s valuation allowances] should be adequate to cover future losses that may occur.\u201d \u00b6 432. Finally, plaintiffs allege that Westinghouse\u2019s 1990 Form 10-K annual report, referred to in the prospectus, contained false statements about the adequacy of Westinghouse\u2019s loan loss reserves and internal controls, misleading characterizations about the February -27, 1991 restructuring, and falsely represented that, \u201cManagement believes that, under current economic conditions, the allowance for losses at December 31, 1990 will be adequate to cover future losses that may develop in the various portfolios.\u201d \u00b6 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">1. <em>Control Person Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the individual defendants are premised upon the allegation that Messrs. Lego, Stern, Hollinshead, Faust, Powe and Pugliese were \u201ccontrolling persons,\u201d pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Act. Section 15 defines \u201ccontrolling person\u201d as every person who \u201ccontrols any person liable under section 11 or 12____\u201d 15 U.S.C. 77o (1988). The Securities and Exchange Commission defines \u201ccontrol\u201d in this context as \u201cthe possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.12b-2. In <em>Rochez Bros., Inc. v. Rhoades, </em>527 F.2d 880, 890-91 (3d Cir.1975), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated that \u201cheavy consideration\u201d is given \u201cto the power or potential power to influence and control the activities of a person, as opposed to the actual exercise thereof.\u201d The court held that a person who owned fifty per cent of the outstanding stock, was Chairman, CEO and President of the company, and ran the day-to-day business activities was a \u201ccontrolling person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">None of the individual defendants in the instant matter bear as many incidents of control as did the defendant in <em>Rochez Bros.; </em>they are each, however, \u201ccontrolling persons.\u201d Each of the individual defendants is alleged to have possessed the power, or the potential power, to control the activities of Westinghouse and/or WFSI and WCC. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11. At the motion to dismiss stage, such alleged influence, even \u201cshort of actual direction,\u201d is sufficient to make one a controlling person, <em>see Gould v. American-Hawaiian S.S. Co., </em>535 F.2d 761, 779 (3d Cir.1976). The ultimate question \u201c[w]hether a defendant is a controlling person within the meaning of federal securities law is a question of fact,\u201d and may therefore be raised again in a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Wiley v. Hughes Capital Corp., </em>746 F.Supp. 1264, 1283 (D.N.J.1990) <em>(citing In re Worlds of Wonder Securities Litigation, </em>694 F.Supp. 1427, 1435 (N.D.Cal.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">2. <em>Rule 12(2) \u201cOffers or Sells\u201d Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">The Westinghouse Defendants argue that Counts Three and Five should be dismissed as to them because plaintiffs have not pled facts demonstrating that the Westinghouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>defendants offered or sold securities, an essential element of any claim <em>under </em>Section 12(2) of the Securities Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In \u00b6\u00b6 442 and 461, plaintiffs allege in wholly conclusory terms that defendants \u201cwere sellers of Westinghouse securities within the meaning of Section 12(2) of the Securities Act and either sold or promoted the sale of said securities directly to plaintiffs and other Class members or solicited plaintiffs and other Class members to buy such securities.\u201d Relying on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 holding on this issue in <em>Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 637, plaintiffs argue that their legal conclusion, <em>unsupported, by any allegation of fact, </em>establishes that the Westinghouse defendants, acting out of their own financial interests, either sold, or solicited the purchase of, Westinghouse securities as part of the May 19, 1991 public offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\"><em>The </em>Supreme Court in <em>Pinter v. Dahl, </em>486 U.S. 622, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d 658 (1988), held that \u00a7 12(1) liability extends both to sellers and to those who solicit securities purchases, motivated by their own or the securities owners\u2019s financial interests. <em>Id. </em>at 642-47, 108 S.Ct. at 2076-78. The <em>Craftmatic </em>court, applying the rule from <em>Pinter, </em>to Section 12(2) claims, 890 F.2d at 635, held that an issuer who itself sold nearly two-thirds of an initial public offering of common stock, <em>Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 630, was not immunized from \u00a7 12 liability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-5\">In <em>Craftmatic, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that: Each of the defendants ... either sold said securities directly to plaintiffs ... or solicited plaintiffs ... to buy Craftmatic common stock ... and in so acting were motivated by a desire to serve their own financial interests or the financial interests of the owner[s] of Craftmatic securities, and they ... conspired with and aided and abetted one another in connection with the preparation of the false and misleading Prospectus and Registration Statement used in conjunction with the sale of Craftmatic securities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 637. The court found \u201cthat plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Craftmatic defendants were \u2018sellers\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 12(2) is sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. The operative word in the <em>Craftmatic </em>plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was \u201csold,\u201d because it accurately described the facts underlying that case. Instantly, plaintiffs<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> have not alleged that the Westinghouse defendants in fact sold or solicited the purchase of Westinghouse securities, but attempt nonetheless to analogize their allegations to the allegations and holding in <em>Craftmatic </em>by pointing to the similarity of language employed. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 95 n. 44. But <em>Craftmatic </em>does not stand for the proposition that a Section 12(2) plaintiff states a claim simply by repeating the <em>Craftmatic </em>plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, or that a plaintiff can avoid alleging facts that would support a legal conclusion, viz., that defendants were statutory offerors or sellers, by pleading the legal conclusion itself. The conclusory allegation that defendants sold or solicited the purchase of securities will withstand a motion to dismiss only if accompanied by allegations of <em>fact </em>that defendants did sell or solicit the purchase of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 have not alleged that the Westinghouse and individual defendants sold or solicited the purchase of Westinghouse securities. Instead, plaintiffs allege that the defendants \u201caided and abetted one another in connection with the preparation of the false and misleading Registration Statement/Prospectus and documents incorporated therein by reference and used in conjunction with the sale of Westinghouse securities to plaintiffs and members of the Class.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 442, 461. This allegation does not state a claim under Section 12(2). The <em>Craftmatic </em>court specifically held that \u201cpersons who fail to qualify as sellers under the <em>Pinter </em>standard may not be held liable under \u00a7 12(2) on an aiding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>abetting theory.\u201d <em>Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The only remaining question, then, is whether \u201cpreparation of [a] false and misleading Registration Statement/Prospeetus and documents incorporated therein by reference used in conjunction with the sale of ... securities\u201d brings one within the scope of a Section 12 seller. <em>Pinter </em>and <em>Craftmatic </em>are clear on this point: absent \u201cdirect and active participation in the solicitation of the immediate sale,\u201d an issuer is not \u201cliable under \u00a7 12(2) solely on the basis of its involvement in preparing the prospectus.\u201d 890 F.2d at 636. <em>See Pinter, </em>486 U.S. at 651, 108 S.Ct. at 2080 (\u201c[Section] 12\u2019s failure to impose express liability for mere participation in unlawful sales transactions -suggests that Congress did not intend that the section impose liability on participants collateral to the offer or sale\u201d). Thus, preparation of financial statements and prospectuses, a requirement of any stock issue, <em>see </em>Section 7 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77g; <em>see also </em>Securities and Exchange Commission Form S-3, are not considered part of the solicitation process, which is, as the Fifth Circuit has noted, akin to an intensive marketing campaign to convince the public to buy a product. <em>Abell v. Potomac Ins. Co., </em>858 F.2d 1104, 1114 n. 8 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 918, 109 S.Ct. 3242, 106 L.Ed.2d 589 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">3. <em>The Bespeaks Caution Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">When considering whether a claim has been stated under Sections 11 and 12(2) for false and misleading statements in a registration statement or prospectus, courts are not limited to the quotations and allegations contained on the face of the complaint, and can examine the registration statement and prospectus themselves. <em>See I. Meyer Pincus &amp; </em>Assoc. <em>v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>936 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir.1991); <em>In re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, </em>793 F.Supp. at 546 n. 1. Westinghouse\u2019s May 9, 1991 prospectus, Exhibit Q to Westinghouse Memo, issued approximately one week before the public offering, \u201cvirtually bristles with warnings\u201d about Westinghouse\u2019s competitive position, and more importantly, about the risk of further deterioration in real estate markets (information which, this Court judicially notes, was widely reported and generally known to the investing public, <em>see In re Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation, </em>793 F.Supp. at 562), which could (1) negatively affect Westinghouse\u2019s ability to sell assets under its restructuring plan, and (2) strain the adequacy of WFSI\u2019s loan loss reserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">With respect to WFSI\u2019s competitive status, Westinghouse disclosed in the prospectus that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-11\">The Financial Services group operates in a highly competitive environment. Commercial finance companies, commercial banks, leasing companies and other financial institutions compete in varying degrees in the several markets in which WFSI does business. In view of the market fragmentation resulting from numerous local and regional competitors, it is not possible to provide a meaningful description of the group\u2019s competitive position to individual markets. Its activities are also subject to a variety of federal and state regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">Exhibit Q at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">Westinghouse\u2019s statements concerning the adequacy of its February 27,1991 restructuring plan, and reclassification of assets as being held for sale or restructuring, and of its loan loss reserves, are among the strongest warnings in the entire record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-14\">As part of the reclassification of $3.4 billion of assets, the Company reclassified for sale approximately $654 million of marketable securities. In accordance with its decision to liquidate this portfolio, the Company recognized a special provision of $163 million in addition to the $15 million pre-existing valuation allowance. This $178 million valuation allowance reflects the difference between the cost of those investments and their estimated market values as of December 31, 1990. This portfolio will be liquidated as soon as practicable; however, <em>future deterioration in market value could result in additional losses prior to sale and appreciation, if any, in market values tvill not be recognized currently. </em>At March 31, 1991, the difference between the cost and estimated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>market values of the marketable securities was approximately $130 million, reflecting improved conditions in the markets for high-yield securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-4\">The $3.4 billion in higher-risk and underperforming assets reclassified as held for sale or restructuring included $2.4 billion in receivables. As such, <em>these receivables had and continue to have a high probability of becoming non-earning assets during the expected period of liquidation. </em>Although changes in these assets between earning, reduced earning, non-earning or real estate owned have occurred since December 31, 1990, management does not believe that such changes have had a material effect on the net realizable value of these receivables.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-5\"># * H* # * H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK-Pg\">At March 31, 1991, WFSI\u2019s valuation allowances related to assets held for sale or restructuring, and the allowances for credit losses related to the assets in the ongoing portfolio, amounted to $1,013 million and $306 million, respectively. <em>Management believes that under current economic conditions such allowances should be adequate to cover future losses that may occur. However, a further or more prolonged doumtum in the economy or in the real estate, securities or certain other markets could have a negative effect on the ability of WFSI\u2019s borrowers to repay and on asset values generally and could result in additional increases in non-earning assets, restructured loans and, ultimately, increases in allowances for losses in both assets held for sale or restructuring and receivables in the balance of WFSFs portfolio.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 8-9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Westinghouse\u2019s statement about the sufficiency of its reserves is remarkably equivocal. The statement that \u201c[mjanagement believes that under current economic conditions such allowances <em>should </em>be adequate to cover future losses that may occur\u201d is even less confident than Westinghouse and WCC\u2019s similar representations about the adequacy of loan loss reserves in prior annual reports. In its Form 10-K for the financial year ended December 31, 1990, Westinghouse stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">\u201cManagement believes that, under current economic conditions, the allowance for losses at December 31, 1990 <em>will </em>be adequate to cover future losses that may develop in the various portfolios.\u201d Exhibit M to Westinghouse Memo at 19 (emphasis added). WCC\u2019s Form 10-K for the same year stated: \u201cA special provision for losses of $925 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 1990 to reflect the decline in estimated realizable value of affected assets. Management believes that this change in strategy <em>will </em>reduce portfolio risk and improve Westinghouse Credit\u2019s future financial position and results of operations.\u201d Exhibit N to Westinghouse Memo at 9 (emphasis added). In light of these relatively confident declarations, which were themselves qualified by additional language that bespoke caution, the replacement of the word \u201cwill\u201d with \u201cshould\u201d in Westinghouse\u2019s May 9, 1991 prospectus (prepared within two months of the 1990 Form 10-Ks) could only have been interpreted by the hypothetical reasonable investor as a step in the direction of greater caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">If that were not enough, Westinghouse went on to spell out exactly what result might follow from a \u201cprolonged downturn in the economy\u201d generally, or in a comprehensive list of markets, including the real estate, securities, or \u201ccertain other\u201d markets: WFSI\u2019s borrowers might default on their loans, which \u201ccould result in additional increases in non-earning assets, restructured loans, and ultimately increases in allowances for losses in both assets held for sale or restructuring and receivables in the balance of WFSI\u2019s portfolio.\u201d Exhibit Q at 9. This straightforward language communicated a clear caveat about the future adequacy of Westinghouse reserves. Such disclosures are precisely what the federal securities laws are designed to produce, for they remove any misleading effect more positive statements about company performance may have. Accordingly, Counts Two, Three, Four and Five, plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) against the Westinghouse defendants, as well as against the individual defendants pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Act, will be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>B. <em>Secondary Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Lazard, Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc.; Lehman Brothers International, Ltd; Goldman Sachs <em>&amp; </em>Co.; Goldman Sachs International, Ltd.; Lazard Brothers &amp; Co., Ltd; and the unnamed proposed class of underwriter defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Counts Two through Five will also be granted. Little additional discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">In Count Two, plaintiffs allege that they acquired securities in the May 1991 public offering accompanied by a prospectus and registration statement that contained untrue statements of material fact. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 430-434. Comparison of those statements with those in the sections of the Complaint alleging causes of action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 reveals that the bases for the Section 11 claims are virtually the same as the Section 10(b) claims. Pursuant to Section 11(a)(5), these would state a prima facie case against \u201cevery underwriter with respect to such security,\u201d except that as discussed above, Part VI.A, the statements alleged to be actionable are accompanied by statements bespeaking caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">In Count Three, plaintiffs must allege, to state a viable Section 12(2) cause of action, that the underwriter defendants were \u201csellers\u201d within the meaning of Section 12(2). That is, there must be an allegation that a particular proposed defendant sold or solicited the sale of Westinghouse securities to the individual plaintiffs. <em>Pinter v. Dahl, </em>486 U.S. at 643-47, 108 S.Ct. at 2076. This element is lacking. Plaintiffs may not rely on what in other contexts might be called market share liability. <em>See e.g. City of Philadelphia v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., </em>994 F.2d 112 (3d Cir.1993). Nor may the plaintiffs rely on the underwriter defendants\u2019 alleged aiding and abetting of one another, to attribute the actions by one defendant to all other defendants. <em>See Craftmatic, </em>890 F.2d at 635-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">In short, an additional deficiency of Count Three as to the proposed underwriter class is that plaintiffs attempt to bring a plaintiffs class action against a proposed class of defendants without alleging facts which would establish standing by a plaintiff against each defendant. Plaintiffs cite district court decisions from California dispensing with the requirements of standing, but in this circuit it is established that before the question of class status can be addressed there must be a representative plaintiff who alleges sale or solicitation by each proposed defendant. <em>Haas v. PNB, </em>526 F.2d 1083, 1096 n. 18 (3d Cir.1975) <em>Kauffman v. Dreyfus Fund, Inc., </em>434 F.2d 727, 734 (3d Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 974, 91 S.Ct. 1190, 28 L.Ed.2d 323 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">VII. <em>COUNT SIX</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQb\">A. <em>Westinghouse Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">In \u00b6\u00b6 467-71, plaintiffs base a claim for negligent misrepresentation under Pennsylvania common law on allegations that \u201cdefendants negligently misrepresented ... that Westinghouse had adequately reserved against under-performing assets, that the book value of Westinghouse accurately reflected its financial condition, and also failed to disclose the fact that Westinghouse had not established adequate reserves for its underperforming or non-performing assets.\u201d \u00b6 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-14\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 claim for negligent misrepresentation must be dismissed where there is no allegation of contractual privity .between plaintiffs<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the Westinghouse defendants. Contractual privity is not required under Pennsylvania law. <em>Eisenberg v. Gagnon, </em>766 F.2d at 779-80; <em>Wilder v. Williams, </em>1989 WL 67821 (W.D.Pa.1989). In Pennsylvania, negligent misrepresentation is a tort, the elements of which are set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552, <em>see Eisenberg v. Gagnon, </em>766 F.2d at 778; <em>J.E. Mamiye &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Fidelity Bank, </em>813 F.2d 610, 615 (3d Cir.1987), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-15\">(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-4\">(2) [T]he liability stated in subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-5\">(a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-6\">(b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or know that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-7\">(3) The liability of one who is under a public duty to give the information extends to loss suffered by any of the class of persons for whose benefit the duty is created, in any of the transactions in which it is intended to protect them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">Defendants, relying principally upon <em>In re Delmarva Securities Litigation, </em>794 F.Supp. 1293 (D.Del.1992), argue that plaintiffs\u2019 claim for negligent misrepresentation must be dismissed because the class of potential claimants is not \u201ca limited group of persons for whose benefit\u201d the allegedly misleading information was intended. Westinghouse Memo at 48-9. I agree with Judge Schwartz\u2019 reasoning in <em>In re Delmarva Securities: </em>imposing liability upon the Westinghouse defendants for their allegedly negligent misrepresentations in the SEC forms would, in the words of Judge Cardozo in <em>Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, </em>255 N.Y. 170, 189, 174 N.E. 441, 448 (1931), subject them to \u201cpotential liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class,\u201d contrary to the language and intent of Section 552(2). Public disclosures made in SEC reports are representations made not to a specific, limited group of persons, but to the world at large. Where a corporation does not and cannot know the identity of the recipients of its disclosures at the time those disclosures are made, liability under Section 552(2) does not obtain. <em>See also In re Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>733 F.Supp. 668, 686 (S.D.N.Y.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 negligent misrepresentation liability is based upon Section 552(3), which creates an exception to the limitation of Section 552(2) where the defendant is under a public duty to supply the information in question. Subsection (3)\u2019s broader scope of liability \u201cmay apply to private individuals or corporations who are required by law to file information for the benefit of the public.\u201d <em>See </em>Comment k to Section 552(3). Public corporations are certainly required by law to file information for public benefit, but application of Section 552(3) to alleged misrepresentations in public corporations\u2019 SEC reports would threaten such firms with the prospect of liability to an almost unlimited class of persons: all potential investors in the firm\u2019s stock. This position requires an assumption about the Restatement drafters\u2019 view of liability that one federal district court has disapprovingly termed \u201cextraordinary,\u201d <em>see In re Crazy Eddie Securities Litigation, </em>812 F.Supp. 338, 359 (E.D.N.Y.1993), and that another (the only other reported decision on point) rejected outright. <em>See In re Delmarva Securities Litigation, </em>794 F.Supp. at 1310-11. Lacking any indication that Pennsylvania courts would adopt so expansive a basis of corporate liability, this Court will decline to impose negligent misrepresentation liability upon the Westinghouse defendants under Restatement (Second) of Torts. \u00a7 552(3). Because plaintiffs lack standing to make a state law claim for negligent misrepresentation under both Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 552(1) and 552(3), Count Six will be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">B. <em>Secondary Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">Plaintiffs assert that Lazard, Price Waterhouse and the underwriters are liable to them for any negligent misrepresentations made either in the financial statements or in the registration statement for the May 1991 public offering. Plaintiffs do not allege that Lazard, Price Waterhouse, or the underwriters made representations to them individual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>ly. Nor do plaintiffs allege reliance on any particular representation or on the prospectus or registration statement as a whole. The fraud on the market theory has never been made applicable to a common law claim of negligent misrepresentation, and it is not reasonable to predict that Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court, which has adopted Restatement of Torts (Second) \u00a7 552(l)\u2019s requirement that the loss be caused by \u201ctheir justifiable reliance upon the information\u201d would so weaken the causation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">Plaintiffs argue that liability for common law misrepresentation is alleged under Subsection 552(3) because \u201ceach of the defendants here is under a public duty to give information to the class of plaintiffs before this Court.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 104. That is an overstatement of the law. Westinghouse is under a public duty imposed by the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act to provide information to shareholders, and in the ease of the May 1991 public offering, to prospective shareholders. The disclosure of information by Westinghouse\u2019s investment banker, accountant, and underwriters, however, is purely a matter of contract between Westinghouse and Lazard, Price Waterhouse, or the underwriters, not a public duty. Liability against the secondary defendants therefore cannot be premised upon subsection (3). <em>See In re Crazy Eddie Securities Litigation, </em>812 F.Supp. at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of negligent misrepresentation against the underwriter defendants must also be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. There are no federal claims against the underwriter defendants to which any tort claims could be pendent. Even assuming that diversity exists in the case of the claims of any of the named plaintiffs against any of the defendants, there is no allegation that the jurisdictional threshold is met, nor is it likely that it could be. <em>See generally Packard v. Provident Mutual Bank, </em>994 F.2d 1039 (3d Cir.1993). It is therefore unnecessary to address further any questions of standing or the sufficiency of the allegations as to this cause of action against the underwriters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">AND NOW, this 27th day of July, 1993, in accordance with the foregoing Opinion, plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (Docket No. 84) is dismissed. Count One, is dismissed without prejudice to repleading. Counts Two, Three, Four, and Five are dismissed with prejudice. Count Six is dismissed with prejudice as to the Westinghouse defendants, Lazard, Freres &amp; Co., and Price Waterhouse, and dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as to the underwriter defendants without prejudice to proceeding pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amended Complaint shall be filed on or before August 20, 1993. Because, as stated in the foregoing opinion, some of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss, the stay of discovery previously ordered in this matter is dissolved. For clarity\u2019s sake, however, the defendants need not respond to the allegations of the Complaint until the Second Amended Complaint is filed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">.
