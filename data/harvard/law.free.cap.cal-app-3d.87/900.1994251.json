Hocker,. Jr., only. All defendants (Guy J. Hocker, Jr., Gail Hocker and Patricia L. Hocker) cross-appeal from (1) the judgment against them in the amount of $190,000 as to Guy and Gail and in the amount of $15,000 as to Patricia; (2) an order denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; and (3) an order denying their motion for new trial. The appeal lies (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (d)), but the cross-appeal lies only from the judgment and from the order denying defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subds. (a), (d); 6 Witkin, pt. I, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 71, p. 4084.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The dispositive issue on both the appeal and the cross-appeal is whether substantial evidence exists to support the special finding of the jury that, at the time of the accident in which plaintiff was negligently injured, the aforementioned defendant, Gail Hocker, was the agent of the aforementioned codefendant, Guy J. Hocker, Jr., and was acting within the scope of her authority.  We will hold that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>evidence does not exist and will therefore, among other things, modify the judgment under appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 629 by reducing the liability thereunder of the said Guy J. Hocker, Jr., to $15,000. (See <em>Hauter </em>v. <em>Zogarts </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 104, 110 [120 Cal.Rptr. 681, 534 P.2d 377, 74 A.L.R.3d 1282].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">On the evening of July 13, 1973, the aforementioned defendant, Gail Hocker, requested permission from her aforementioned father, Guy, to use the family car that night to transport herself and a friend to a movie. On the way to the movie, with Gail driving negligently, the car was involved in an accident in which plaintiff was injured. At that time Gail was 16 years old, visually handicapped, and had been licensed for five days to drive a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The car which Gail borrowed, and which was involved in the aforementioned accident, was owned by her father, Guy. Funds for its purchase had come from the family\u2019s earnings. Guy owned a real estate business and used this car regularly in that business. In fact he deducted as a business expense all the mileage driven in that car at the rate of 10 cents per mile from the gross income of his business that he reported to the taxing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">For most of the time the car was in use, it carried on either side removable magnetic signs advertising Guy\u2019s real estate business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record contains no direct evidence that the car was carrying these signs at the time of the accident, but such may be readily inferred from the frequency of their use on all occasions generally except when the car was being driven on an extended family trip. For the purpose of this decision, we assume these signs were on the car at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>The case was tried to a jury which specially found that at the time of the accident Gail was operating Guy\u2019s car as his agent and within the scope of her authority. As we have already noted in part, defendants then moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. Both of these motions were predicated essentially on the claim of a lack of substantial evidence to support the special finding of agency. The trial court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but granted the motion for new trial pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 657, subdivisions 6 and 7. It so acted essentially on its view that substantial evidence did not exist to support the special finding of agency and authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In the absence of statute, ordinarily a parent is not liable for the torts of his minor child. (See 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 652, p. 2931.) A parent, however, becomes liable for the torts of his minor child if that child in committing a tort is his agent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>acting within the child\u2019s authority. (See Prosser, Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 123, pp. 871-872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">In California agency is either actual or ostensible. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2298.) An agency is actual when the agent is really employed by the principal. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2299.) An agency is ostensible when a principal causes a third person to believe another to be his agent, who is really not employed by him. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">An agent has the authority that the principal, actually or ostensibly, confers upon him. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2315.) Actual authority is the authority the principal intentionally confers upon the agent or allows the agent to believe that he possesses. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2316.) Ostensible authority, on the other hand, is the authority of the agent which the principal causes or allows a third person to believe that the agent possesses. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Neither actual agency nor actual authority exists in this case. Gail was never employed by Guy in Guy\u2019s business and the trip, during which the accident occurred, was entirely a personal trip of Gail\u2019s. Gail did not believe that she had any authority to act for Guy with respect to the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We turn therefore to ostensible agency and ostensible authority.  In this connection we note first that ordinarily a principal is not liable for physical harm caused by the negligent physical conduct of a nonservant agent even <em>during the performance of the principal\u2019s business. </em>(See Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 250.) According to Prosser, this is because the principal does not have the right of control over the details of the nonservant agent\u2019s conduct. (See Prosser, Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 70, p. 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">We note secondly that ordinarily a principal is subject to liability only for those torts which result from reliance upon, among other things, conduct within an agent\u2019s apparent authority (see Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 265), and that unless one within his apparent authority causes others to act, the existence of apparent authority does not cause a principal to be liable for negligently causing physical harm. (See comment on <em>id., </em>subsection 2.) In fhis connection we note further that Civil Code section 2334 specifically provides that a principal is bound by the acts of his agent, under merely ostensible authority, only to those persons who have in good faith, and without want of ordinary care, incurred a liability or parted with value, upon the faith thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>In this case plaintiff relies upon only two indicia of ostensible agency and ostensible authority. They are: (1) Guy\u2019s mileage deduction for income tax purposes; (2) the presence of the signs advertising Guy\u2019s business on the Hocker car involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Neither is sufficient as a matter of law to convert this personal trip of Gail\u2019s into a business trip of Guy\u2019s. The claimed mileage deduction was presumably known only to Guy\u2019s accountants and to the taxing authorities. Plaintiff could never therefore have relied upon its existence. (See 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Agency and Employment, \u00a7 163, p. 761.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Guy\u2019s business may well have received an incidental benefit from the presence of the signs advertising that business on the Hocker car at the time of the accident. But this benefit, at best, was negligible. (Cf. <em>Gurklies </em>v. <em>General Air Conditioning Corp. </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 734, 737-738 [205 P.2d 749].)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Plaintiff did not rely upon these signs to his injury. Apparently they had nothing to do with the causation of the accident that injured him. Under these circumstances there is no basis for an estoppel, and estoppel is the real foundation for both ostensible agency and ostensible authority. (See Witkin, <em>op cit.; Yanchor </em>v. <em>Kagan </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 544, 549 [99 Cal.Rptr. 367].) We therefore hold that neither the mileage deduction nor the presence of the advertising signs on the Hocker car at the time of the accident, singly or together, created either ostensible agency or ostensible authority in Gail.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The order granting the new trial as to defendant Guy J. Hocker, Jr., is reversed. The order denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, insofar as it applies to him alone, is likewise reversed, and the judgment under cross-appeal is modified by changing the liability of Guy J. Hocker, Jr., and that of Patricia L. Hocker to a joint and several liability in the amount of $15,000. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Defendants and appellants to recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Potter, Acting P. J., and Allport, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> As noted, the judgment under appeal contains an award of damages against the aforementioned defendant, Patricia .fi. Hocker, in the amount of $15,000. This award was based solely upon the fact that she signed Gail\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license. It was therefore made pursuant to Vehicle Code section 17707. This statutory liability under the circumstances present in this case is limited to a maximum amount of $15,000. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 17709, subd. (a).) Furthermore this maximum still holds even though permissive use liability also exists under Vehicle Code section 17708 and ownership liability attaches under Vehicle Code section 17150. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 17714; see also <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Britt </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 868, 871 [112 Cal.Rptr. 710].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\"> The car also bore personalized California license plates bearing the Hocker name. We attach no significance to this fact as the use of such plates has become fairly common.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> With respect to subdivision 7, the trial court recited in its minute order that it granted defendants\u2019 motion for new trial \u201cDue to insufficiency of evidence, the Court should not have submitted the question of agency to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ave\">In support of its grant of a new trial, pursuant to subdivision 6, the trial court gave the following ten reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5op\">\u201c1. Any benefit to the defendant Guy Hocker as a result of having the signs on his car, if in fact they were ever on the car on the evening in question, was negligible and not of sufficient benefit on which to based on</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARW\">\u201c2. The \u2018Hocker\u2019 license plate identification is a common means of vehicle identification in California and of no significance in determining whether Gail Hocker was an of Hocker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ase\">\u201c3. The trip taken by Gail Hocker was purely a social venture at night at a time when the.signs would have been difficult to observe if they ever, in fact, were on the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9j\">\u201c4. There is no evidence that Guy Hocker had any interest in the trip: the trip was for the benefit of the daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWxx\">\u201c5.

The daughter, a minor, was not engaged in any task normally performed by the parents. She was out that evening on her own: she had been duly licensed by a licensing authority to operate a vehicle. Therefore, there being no legal duty and without the assertion of any right of control by the parents, no agency exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAU\">\u201c8.
