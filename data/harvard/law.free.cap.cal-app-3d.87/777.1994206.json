A.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALI\">In an information as amended petitioner was charged with burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and forcible rape (\u00a7 261, subd. 3)\u2014both alleged to have occurred on December 18, 1975\u2014and five prior burglary convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">On March 8, 1976, he pleaded guilty to first degree burglaiy and admitted two prior burglary convictions, a California conviction which occurred April 15, 1969, and a Texas conviction which occurred January 7, 1974. On March 29, 1976, he was sentenced under the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) for the burglaiy conviction with the two priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>On April 6, 1978, the Community Release Board (CRB) under the retroactive provisions of the determinate sentence law (DSL) convened a serious offender hearing pursuant to section 1170.2, subdivision (b), set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">After the statutory hearing the CRB recomputed petitioner\u2019s term at seventy-two months by aggravating to four years the three-year middle term for burglary, then enhancing the upper term by two additional years comprising one year for each of petitioner\u2019s two prior felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">While there are some satellite issues, petitioner\u2019s nucleus contentions are that the statutory principles and California Rules of Court which govern trial court sentencing apply to serious offender hearings and that those principles and rules were violated because petitioner suffered only one prior prison term which would qualify under section 667.5; that there was a dual use of the prior prison terms to both aggravate and enhance in violation of section 1170, subdivision (b), and California Rules of Court rule 441; and that the CRB based its finding of aggravation on erroneous factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Quite obviously if the CRB in serious offender hearings is not strictly bound by the statutory principles and California Rules of Court but is to utilize them only as guidelines, a violation thereof would not per se invalidate CRB action,  We have concluded that an analysis of the statutory provisions and the functions of the CRB as successor to the Adult Authority in the administration of the ISL (see \u00a7\u00a7 5077, 5078) leads unerringly to the conclusion that the CRB when acting pursuant to section 1170.2, subdivision (b), is not required to strictly apply the statutory principles and California Rules of Court which are binding upon trial courts in passing sentence. Further, the specific terms of section 1170.2, subdivision (a), require the CRB to apply those principles and rules only when recalculating sentences under that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Commenting upon section 1170.2, subdivision (b), the court in <em>Way </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 165, 172-173 [141 Cal.Rptr. 383], explicated that section. \u201cThe statute appears to require that such a longer term be justified on the basis of certain objective facts, viz. (1) the number of crimes of which the prisoner was convicted; (2) the number of prior convictions; (3) the fact that the prisoner was armed; or (4) that he used a deadly weapon; or (5) that he inflicted great bodily harm on the victim; this is further implied by the due process guarantees written into the law, including an inmates\u2019 right to counsel and to be \u2018informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated.\u2019 But having thus seemingly narrowed the board\u2019s discretion, the Legislature ends on a broad discretionary note: \u2018In fixing a term under this section the board shall be guided by, but not limited to, the term which reasonably could be imposed on a person who committed a similar offense under similar circumstances on or after July 1, 1977, and further, the board shall be guided by the following finding and declaration hereby made by the Legislature; that the necessity to protect the public from repetition of extraordinary crimes of violence against the person is the paramount consideration.\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>In re Gray </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 255, 261 [149 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>416].) The Legislature obviously was concerned with the crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>committed by a prisoner involving harm or threat of harm to the victims or potential victims of the crime.  In adopting its regulations the CRB has employed harm or threat of harm to the victim as a primary consideration (see Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2162); and in serious offender proceedings it clearly appears from the express language of the statute that the CRB is given discretion to impose a greater term than could have been imposed by the court under the DSL,</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Having a bearing upon this problem is the fact that \u201c. . . recalculation by the CRB of an ISL offender\u2019s term of imprisonment pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.2, is not a resentencing. The original indeterminate sentence \u2018for the term provided by law\u2019 remains valid. [Citation.] The only difference is that under section 1170.2, the CRB, in deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s term below the maximum, may consider ameliorative effects of the DSA on length of sentences generally and the express legislative objective of uniform treatment of offenders.\u201d <em>(In re Gray, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at p. 262; <em>In re Brown </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 647, 652 [143 Cal.Rptr. 549].)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The other provisions of the DSL and the California Rules of Court refer only to the courts or the trial judge as being required to apply the sentencing rules (see \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(2), \u00a7 1170.3; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 421, 441), thus lending support for the proposition that the CRB, in acting pursuant to section 1170.2, subdivision (b), is not absolutely bound by those principles and rules but is given a broad discretion to recalculate a longer term than the strict application of those principles and rules would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Admittedly the broader the discretion vested in the CRB the more likely there will be less uniformity in sentencing. However, as has been pointed out, the discretion is limited by certain objective restraints, including the requirement that the sentencing principles and practices applicable to the trial court be used as guidelines, the specific standards set forth in section 1170.2, subdivision (b), required before a serious offender hearing may be called, the requirement of presence of counsel and the statutory requirement that the \u201cprisoner shall be informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated.\u201d (See \u00a7 1170.2, subd. (b).) Given these checks and the overall legislative objective of achieving uniformity, we perceive little chance for a wide disparity in terms among serious offenders with similar offenses and backgrounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>It appears the Legislature had two legitimate objectives: (1) proportionality, that is, that the term of imprisonment be proportionate to the seriousness of the offense, and (2) uniformity in the sentences of offenders committing the same offense under similar circumstances. (See \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1).)  In enacting subdivision (b) of section 1170.2 the Legislature has recognized that the state interest in uniformity must in small measure yield to the compelling state interest in proportionality by preventing extraordinary crimes of violence against the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s summary contention that equal protection is violated by the disparate treatment provided for under section 1170.2, subdivisions (a) and (b), must be rejected. Such disparities are not violative of the equal protection clause if they further a compelling state interest. <em>(In re Kapperman </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 542 [114 Cal.Rptr. 97, 522 P.2d 657].) Clearly the state has a compelling interest in preventing extraordinary crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Moreover, the prisoner always stands to benefit from the redetermination of his term under section 1170.2 since he can never be kept in custody for a period of time longer than he would have been kept under the ISL. (See \u00a7 1170.2, subd. (c).)  The CRB succeeded to the power and to the performance of the functions of the Adult Authority in fixing terms and setting parole under the ISL. (\u00a7\u00a7 5077, 5078; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Gonzales) (1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 134 [144 Cal.Rptr. 89].) With respect to offenses committed prior to July 1, 1977, the ISL remains in effect. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Gonzales), supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 134; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 425 [141 Cal.Rptr. 442].) The authority and discretion to fix indeterminate sentences remain in the CRB even though the factors which the board should consider have been altered. That being the case the same standards of judicial review which have been applied for years under the ISL also apply to the term-fixing decisions of the CRB after a serious offender hearing, namely, whether based upon the entire record the board abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily, capriciously or without information <em>(In re Minnis </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 639 [102 Cal.Rptr. 749, 498 P.2d 997]; <em>In re Streeter </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 47 [56 Cal.Rptr. 824, 423 P.2d 976]; <em>In re Wilkerson </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 798, 803 [77 Cal.Rptr. 340]) and whether the actual sentence fixed by the board is constitutionally disproportionate to the offense <em>(In re Rodriguez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 653-656 [122 Cal.Rptr. 552, 537 P.2d 384]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169 [121 Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001]).  In addition section 1170.2, subdivision (b) requires that \u201cthe prisoner shall be informed in writing of the extraordinary factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated.\u201d This requirement does not imply that the CRB must state the entire evidentiary basis for the conclusions reached in its statement of reasons in order to insulate the statement of reasons against an attack on due process grounds. (See <em>In re Sturm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 258, 265-270 [113 Cal.Rptr. 361, 521 P.2d 97]; <em>Way </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.3d 165, 172-173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We turn to the record to determine if the CRB abused its discretion in this case, keeping in mind that the CRB in its term fixing function under section 1170.2, subdivision (b), \u201cshall be guided by, but not limited to\u201d the considerations which limit the sentencing court and the CRB when acting pursuant to section 1170.2, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In aggravating the term the CRB used the court rules (see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 421) and referred to \u201cthe extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative\u201d (\u00a7 1170.2, subd. (b)). (See fn. 3, <em>ante, </em>for the language of CRB\u2019s statement of reasons.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Referring to those reasons, petitioner attacks the statement \u201cJudicial Council Rule 421 (a)(1),[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] threat of bodily harm, tore nightgown off victim\u201d on the ground that tearing the nightgown off the victim does not involve bodily harm or a threat of bodily harm. However the probation report to which the CRB referred Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 2165, subd. (g)) demonstrates that rule 421 (a)(1) applied. That report shows that the CRB considered evidence that in committing the present offense the petitioner struck his victim over the head and later tore her nightgown and attempted to rape her. The victim was required to seek medical attention for a possible detached retina and for muscle spasms apparently resulting from the attempted rape. The victim reported that she was in great fear for her life and that she believed that if she had not been successful in locking herself in the bedroom petitioner would have killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In view of the expression of the Legislature that the paramount consideration under section 1170.2, subdivision (b), is to protect the public from extraordinaiy crimes of violence, it is not insignificant that the Legislature in section 667.5 has defined rape as an extraordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>crime of violence. In this regard petitioner\u2019s reference to <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274] is inapposite. In that case the Supreme Court held that rape in and of itself is not great bodily injury within the meaning of enhancement statutes. However, rule 421 (a)(1), California Rules of Court, relates to <em>aggravation </em>of the middle term, <em>not an enhancement, </em>arid refers to \u201cthreat of great bodily harm,\u201d not requiring the actual infliction of great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Petitioner also argues that the CRB statement in the statement of reasons \u201cJudicial Council Rule 421 (b)(3), had served prior prison terms\u201d indicates a dual use of facts for aggravation of the middle term and enhancement of the sentence.  For the reasons heretofore stated in proceedings under section 1170.2, subdivision (b), the CRB is not bound by the prohibition against dual use of facts in fixing an indeterminate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Petitioner attacks the one-year enhancement assessed by reason of the prior Texas burglary. As noted in footnote 3 in connection with that burglary, the CRB stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cThe prisoner has been committed for prior prison terms as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cTexas for Burglary, paroled to CDC 1/27/75, from CDC 10/30/75, which is a felony within the meaning of Penal Code \u00a7 667.5(b). The fact of this prior prison term is found to be true in this hearing and was imposed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201cThe term is, therefore, extended by 12 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In fact the CRB\u2019s records which were before it at the hearing conclusively show that the prior Texas burglary did not qualify under section 667.5, subdivision (f),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the petitioner did not serve a term of one year in the Texas prison. The CRB panel took the immovable position that it had no discretion with respect to the Texas prior because it had been imposed by the sentencing court and it would not go behind the face of the judicial record. As we have pointed out, however, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>667.5 only applies to sentencing courts and to the CRB when it acts pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 1170.2. In section 1170.2, subdivision (b), proceedings the CRB is merely required to use section 667.5 as a guide and could have imposed an additional term for the prior felony notwithstanding the failure of the prior felony to meet the requirements of section 667.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">However, it clearly appears that the CRB refused to exercise its discretion under section 1170.2, subdivision (b), and treated the Texas prior as if it met the requirements of section 667.5 because the trial court\u2019s judgment reflected it had found the Texas prior to be true. The CRB imposed the one-year enhancement for that conviction as if it were acting as a mandatory matter. When imposing an enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (f), the sentencing court has an obligation to go behind the face of the record to determine if the prior felony prison term in fact meets the requirements of that section.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Based on this record we are simply unable to determine if the CRB would have imposed the additional one-year term if it had exercised its discretion to impose it notwithstanding the failure of that prior to comply with section 667.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Accordingly, it is concluded that the CRB\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion regarding the nature of the Texas prior requires the case to be returned to the CRB for a new serious offender hearing limited to the issue of the imposition of the additional year for the Texas prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Let a writ of habeas corpus issue directing the Community Release Board to schedule and hold a new serious offender hearing pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.2, subdivision (b), limited to the issue of whether an additional term not to exceed one year should be imposed for the Texas prior, all in accordance with the principles enunciated herein; the writ is otherwise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Hopper, J., and Accurso,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 19, 1979, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied on February 14, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-12\"> All code references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> Section 1170.2, subdivision (b) provides in pertinent part that if \u201cat least two of the members of the Community Release Board after reviewing the prisoner\u2019s file, determine that due to the number of crimes of which the prisoner was convicted, or due to the number of prior convictions suffered by the prisoner, or due to the fact that the prisoner was armed with a deadly weapon when the crime was committed, or used a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime, or inflicted or attempted to inflict great bodily injury on the victim of the crime, the prisoner should serve a term longer than that calculated in subdivision (a), . . . the prisoner shall be entitled to a hearing before a panel consisting of at least two members of the Community Release Board as provided for in Section 3041.5. . . . At such hearing the prisoner shall be entitled to be represented by legal counsel, a release date shall be set, and the prisoner shall be informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated. In fixing a term under this section <em>the board shall be guided by, but not limited to, </em>the term which reasonably could be imposed on a person who committed a similar offense under similar circumstances on or after July 1, 1977, and further, <em>the board shall be guided by the following finding and declaration hereby made by the Legislature: that the necessity to protect the public from repetition of extraordinary crimes of violence against the person is the paramount consideration.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> The CRB\u2019s written report of the extended term proceedings stated the factors upon which it based its aggravation and enhancements.
