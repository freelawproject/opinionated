On May 11, 1978, he was ordered committed to the Youth Authority \u201cpursuant to Section 1737 WIC.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The formal commitment order is a printed form entitled \u201cCommitment To The Youth Authority [Juvenile] [W.I.C. Sec. 731].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The form contains certain factual findings, also in printed form, as to the minor\u2019s age, his suitability for Youth Authority commitment, and his status as a person described in section 602. The printed portion of the second finding reads as follows: \u201cThe mental and physical condition and qualifications of this minor are such as to render it probable that he will be benefited by the reformatory educational discipline or other treatment provided by the Youth Authority.\u201d Typewritten as an appendage to this printed finding is the language \u201cpursuant to Section 1737 of Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On May 19, 1978, petitioner moved to set aside the order of commitment on the ground that section 1737 applies only to commitments of adult defendants to Youth Authority. He sought instead a commitment under the terms of section 704.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion was denied. The minute order of May 19, 1978, states: \u201cMinor remains a ward of the court under Section 602 WIC. The order dated 5-11-78 ordering minor committed to California Youth Authority pursuant to Section 1737 WIC remains in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Despite this ruling, at some unspecified time between May 22d and June 8th, 1978, a second formal commitment order was filed. The words \u201cCorrected Commitment\u201d are typed in red above the printed title of the order. The typewritten words \u201cpursuant to Section 1737 of Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d have not been appended to finding number 2, nor do they appear elsewhere in the order. No explanation for the filing of this \u201ccorrected\u201d order appears in the record. On August 10, 1978, a nonappearance minute order was entered stating that the diagnostic report \u201cpursuant to Section 1737 Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d had been reviewed by the court and that no change in the previous disposition and commitment was being ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Section 1737 provides: \u201cRecall of commitment: Resentencing and crediting of time served.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cWhen a person has been committed to the custody of the authority, if it is deemed warranted by a diagnostic study and recommendation approved by the director, the judge who ordered the commitment or, if the judge is not available, the presiding or sole judge of the court, within 120 days of the date of commitment on his own motion, or the court, at any time thereafter upon recommendation of the director, may recall the commitment previously ordered and resentence the person as if he had not previously been sentenced. The time served while in custody of the authority shall be credited toward the term of any person resentenced pursuant to this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Petitioner asserts, correctly, that section 1737, by its terms, is not a commitment section at all, but rather provides for the recall of commitments previously made. Petitioner further asserts that the use of the words \u201cresentence\u201d and \u201csentenced\u201d in section 1737 and the provision for credit for time served require the interpretation that the section is intended to apply only to adult defendants. Petitioner\u2019s argument is persuasive.  A juvenile court declaration of wardship is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>criminal conviction (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 203), and a dispositional order following such declaration is not a sentence. <em>(In re Leonard R., </em>76 Cal.App.3d 100, 104 [142 Cal.Rptr. 632].)  Thus a person processed through the juvenile court could neither be sentenced nor resentenced as provided for in section 1737. Nor are juvenile court wards entitled to credit for predisposition time in custody. <em>(In re Leonard R., supra.) </em> From this it follows that section 1737 is intended to apply to Youth Authority commitments from adult court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The history of section 1737 reinforces this conclusion. Prior to enactment of the current version of the statute in 1975, section 1737 read: \u201cAfter a court has committed a person to the authority such court has no power to suspend execution of the commitment. Nothing in this section shall limit or restrict the jurisdiction and powers of the juvenile court under Sections 775 and 779 of this code.\u201d This version of the statute clearly constituted a limitation solely on the powers of adult courts. Just as clearly, the current statute provides a measure of flexibility to adult courts in those cases in which the court chooses to exercise it. Sections 775 and 779<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> still apply to juvenile courts, however, and afford them far greater flexibility in dealing with juveniles than is provided for in section 1737.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We hold that section 1737 does not apply to Youth Authority commitments from juvenile court. If the juvenile court desires a diagnostic study of a ward, it should proceed according to the provisions of section 704.  A question remains, however, as to what effect the court\u2019s erroneous invocation of section 1737 has upon petitioner\u2019s present status.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Petitioner asserts that since he was ordered committed \u201cpursuant to section 1737,\u201d and since section 1737 is not a commitment section, he has never been formally committed and that he is now entitled to a disposition hearing. He also argues that section 704 is the exclusive statutory vehicle for obtaining a diagnostic evaluation of a juvenile court ward, that section 704 is a precommitment statute which entitles the juvenile to a hearing after the court receives the diagnostic report, and that because he did not receive such a hearing, his present commitment is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The trial court was not unaware of section 704, nor did it not invoke section 1737 through inadvertence. It was the court\u2019s intention to commit petitioner to the Youth Authority and that is what it did. The formal commitment order\u2014citing section 731\u2014makes that clear, as does the court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to set aside the order and its filing of the corrected order. The addition of the language \u201cpursuant to Section 1737 . . .\u201d to the body of the text of the original commitment order did not transmute that order into a precommitment diagnostic referral, nor otherwise suspend commitment. Neither did it invalidate what was an otherwise appropriate order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In effect, all that happened was that the court obtained and reviewed a diagnostic study for which there was no statutory authority. This \u201cerror\u201d did not confer upon petitioner a right to a further hearing to which he was not otherwise entitled. If petitioner believes that there is something helpful to him in the diagnostic report,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or if there are other factors of which he and his counsel are aware which suggest the possibility that a modification of the previous commitment order is called for, he may seek redress pursuant to section 778. He has not been denied due process merely because the trial court, after determining that commitment to Youth Authority was the proper form of treatment for petitioner and committing him to that institution, caused a diagnostic report to be prepared that convinced the court that its original disposition was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The order to show cause is discharged.
