The matter arose as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">On November 22, 1976, petitioner, holder of an off-sale general alcoholic beverage license issued by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (hereafter Department) sold a quart of Old Crow whiskey to an employee of the Department for $1.63 less than the minimum price and a magnum of Cresta Blanca wine for 92 cents less than the posted price. On November 30, 1976, petitioner sold another bottle of Old Crow whiskey to the same employee for $1.63 less than the minimum price. After notice and hearing, the Department found that petitioner had violated section 24755 and title 4, section 99, subdivision (a), of the California Administrative Code in the sale of distilled spirits, and section 24862 and title 4, section 101, subdivision (a) in the sale of wine. The Department ordered petitioner\u2019s license suspended for 10 days on each of the three counts, the penalties to be served concurrently. On appeal to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (hereafter Board), the Board, following <em>Rice, </em>reversed the decision of the Department with respect to the counts alleging sale of distilled spirits below the minimum price, but affirmed the decision of the Department with respect to the count alleging sale of wine below the posted price. The Board believed itself prohibited from declaring the wine price maintenance provisions invalid by reason of article III, section 3.5 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Petitioner seeks annulment of that portion of the Board\u2019s order affirming the decision of the Department, contending that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>the ruling in <em>Rice, supra </em>(21 Cal.3d 431) should be extended to invalidate wine price maintenance provisions as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We have compared the statutes and regulations relating to price maintenance of distilled spirits invalidated in <em>Rice </em>with the statutes and regulations relating to price maintenance of wine challenged in this proceeding, and find no significant differences. Although the statute invalidated in <em>Rice </em>(\u00a7 24755) is more comprehensive than the statute challenged in this proceeding (\u00a7 24862),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 24862, construed in conjunction with the other sections contained in chapter 11 (\u00a7 24866 et seq.),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> accomplishes the same end. Section 24866, for example, requires winegrowers, wholesalers licensed to sell wine, wine rectifiers and rectifiers to post schedules of selling prices of wine, make and file fair trade contracts and file schedules of resale prices. Section 24862 prohibits an off-sale retail licensee from selling at less than that prescribed price.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We agree with petitioner that the wine price maintenance provisions of section 24862 and related statutes differ from the price maintenance provisions relating to distilled spirits only in the type of beverage and the precise language of the respective sections, and that the impact of the restrictions is identical. As respondent Board acknowledges, the arguments in favor of retail price maintenance rejected by the California Supreme Court in <em>Rice, supra </em>(21 Cal.3d 431) cannot be accepted here. We conclude that the wine price maintenance provisions cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>distinguished from the price maintenance provisions invalidated in <em>Rice </em>and, for the reasons stated in <em>Rice, </em>must also fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">That portion of the Board\u2019s order affirming the decision of the Department with respect to alleged violations of the wine price maintenance schedule (count two) is annulled. The Board is directed to enter its order reversing the decision of the Department with respect to count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Taylor, P.
