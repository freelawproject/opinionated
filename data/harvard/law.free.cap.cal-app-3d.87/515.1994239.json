J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYH\">The trial court found 81-year-old Charles C. Munson to be \u201cgravely disabled\u201d within the provisions of the conservatorship chapter of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS). (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5350 et seq.) Munson was \u201cdisoriented to time, place and circumstance.\u201d His diagnosis was (1) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (2) congestive heart failure, stable, and (3) organic brain syndrome with dementia. The court appointed H. N. Welborn as conservator of Munson\u2019s <em>person </em>for a period of one year under chapter 3 of LPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">As required by LPS, one year later Welborn filed and served his notice of filing of \u201cPetition to Reestablish Conservatorship of Person\u201d of Munson. The conservatorship was by court order reestablished on March 23, 1977. While this latter petition to reestablish conservatorship was pending, Munson by his counsel filed a written notice to compel an <em>accounting </em>by Welborn as conservator of Munson\u2019s person. The trial court denied Munson\u2019s motion holding that Probate Code section 1904 applied to the conservatorships of estates, not to conservatorships of persons. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">LPS section 5350 states: \u201cThe procedure for establishing, administering and terminating conservatorship under this chapter shall be the same as that provided in Division 5 (commencing with Section 1701) of the Probate Code, except as follows: . . .\u201d The exceptions set forth are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Probate Code (div. 5) section 1904, provides: \u201cAt the expiration of one year from the time of his appointment, and thereafter not less frequently than biennially, unless otherwise ordered by the court, the conservator must <em>present his account to the court for settlement and allowance. </em>When an account is rendered by or on behalf of two or more joint conservators, the court, in its discretion, may settle and allow the same upon the verification of any of them.\u201d (Italics added.)  Mun-son\u2019s counsel asserts that the express language of this code section mandates the LPS conservator of the person to render an accounting yet he concedes that historically, accountability \u201cwas oriented around estate matters\u201d and \u201cdirected to the roles of surrogate managers of estates not persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>To answer this contention, we begin with the fundamental rule that a court \u201cshould ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal., </em>51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].) In determining such intent \u201c[t]he court turns first to the words themselves\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>35 Cal.2d 175, 182 [217 P.2d 1]) and to their \u201cusual, ordinary import\u201d <em>(In re Alpine, </em>203 Cal. 731, 737 [265 P.2d 947, 58 A.L.R. 1500]).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201caccount\u201d as: \u201cA detailed statement of the mutual demands in the nature of debt and credit between parties, arising out of contracts or some fiduciary relation. A statement in writing, of debts and credits, or of receipts and payments; a list of items of debts and credits, with their respective dates.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (4th ed. 1968) p. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It is equally a fundamental rule of statutory construction that every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd, </em>10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) We must therefore examine section 1904 in the context of chapter 5 (titled Inventory and Accounting) sections 1901-1912 of the Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Section 1901 of the Probate Code requires the conservator \u201cof the <em>estate or person and estate\u201d </em>of the conservatee to file an inventory and appraisement of the estate of the conservatee within three months after the conservator\u2019s appointment and thereafter as specified, whenever any other property of the conservatee is discovered, inherited, or acquired. The sections following Probate Code section 1901, including Probate Code section 1904, speak exclusively of the <em>estate, </em>its assets, the settlement of accounts, allowance for expenses and disbursements, and termination of the conservatorship when the estate is exhausted (see Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1902, 1903, 1904, 1908 and 1909). Probate Code section 1912 requires the conservator to show that during the period covered by the account he has kept all cash in his possession invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments authorized by law. We conclude this Probate Code chapter, of which section 1904 is a part, relates exclusively to conservatorships of the estate, or person and estate. To impose upon a conservator such a duty to account of the person only, is to read section 1904 totally out of context.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>For further guidance in construing section 1904, we examine the parallel provisions of division 4, chapter 9 (commencing with \u00a7 1550) of the Probate Code providing for \u201cInventory And Accounting\u201d procedures to be followed by a guardian of the estate of a ward. The language of Probate Code section 1553 entitled \u201cAccount, Settlement and Allowance\u201d is identical to that of Probate Code section 1904 in all critical provisions. A review of the cases citing Probate Code section 1553 requiring the guardian to \u201cpresent his account to the court for settlement and allowance\u201d makes it clear that such language has been applied exclusively to accountings for guardianships of the estate. No case is found where it has been applied to the guardianship of the person only.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Munson\u2019s counsel argues that recent changes in California law reflect an intent to hold conservators accountable for their acts. He cites the 1976 amendment to Probate Code section 1754 and the adding of Probate Code section <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amendment and addition to the conservator-ship act does not expressly or by implication hint at a requirement of an annual accounting of Munson\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Munson\u2019s counsel next contends he would be deprived of any effective mechanism to seek redress against an abusive or negligent conservator if he does not obtain the accounting for the person he here seeks. He fails to consider the protective provisions of an LPS. The conservatorship of the person expires after one year. The court must notify the conservator and his conservatee and the person in charge of the facility in which the person resides and the conservatee\u2019s attorney at least 60 days before termination of the one-year period. This notice states that if the conservator wishes to reestablish the conservatorship for another year he must petition the court to do so. This notice further informs these concerned parties if the conservatee, his attorney, or the persons in charge of the facility in which he resides request it, there shall be a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>hearing or a jury trial on the petition to reestablish the conservatorship. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5362.) If the petition for reappointment is filed, it must include the opinion of two physicians that the conservatee is still gravely disabled. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5361.) The conservatee has the right to a court hearing and a jury trial upon that petition. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5350, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Further, the conservatee has a right to petition the court for writ of habeas corpus if he feels he is improperly or illegally hospitalized by his conservator. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The humane concern counsel has voiced for the care of Mr. Munson strikes a responsive cord in this court. If his concern is based on an appropriate fact base, then the subpoena, subpoena duces tecum, county\u2019s funds for investigation, and attorneys\u2019 fees and the presently established legal procedures await counsel\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The conservator argues the appeal is moot, for the conservatorship order from which Munson appeals expired March 16, 1977. While it is true the particular conservatorship period has ended, yet Munson\u2019s contention here of the right to an accounting under Probate Code section 1904 remains a viable question and requires an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We conclude Probate Code section 1904 does not authorize the species of accounting requested by Mr. Munson\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Wiener, J., and Harelson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> The author of California Conservatorships 1968 (Cont.Ed.Bar 1968) in his comments on section 1904 agrees: \u201c[A] conservator of the person does not account to the court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>(\u00a7 6.26, p. 244.)

After communicating such information to the person and prior to the appointment of his conservator, the court shall consult the person to determine his opinion concerning the appointment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
