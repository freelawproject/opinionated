J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUr\">Preliminary to formal adoption proceedings, the Department of Social Services of the County of Santa Clara (hereafter Department) instituted proceedings pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code section 232<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to declare the minor wards of the court, Heidi and Ralph (now age 12 and 11, respectively), free of parental custody and control. The trial court found that as a result of the neglect and mental disability of appellant (hereafter Carol), the natural mother, it would be detrimental to return their custody to Carol and rendered judgment freeing the minors from her custody and control and referring them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Department for adoptive <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Carol challenges the validity of that judgment on several grounds. Our examination of the record, in light of governing principles, discloses no prejudicial error as claimed. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The record reveals an unfortunate history of economic deprivation and social maladjustment ultimately resulting in Carol\u2019s decision to relinquish physical custody of the two minor children to a county juvenile agency; in December 1967, the minors were adjudicated dependent children of the court and placed in a foster home with the proposed adoptive parents where they have remained ever since. The impoverished circumstances of the family, compounded by the desertion of the natural father (now deceased), presented substantial obstacles for Carol in her efforts to adequately raise and provide for her family of five children. Shortly after the birth of Ralph, Carol began to manifest symptoms of emotional and mental instability resulting in several hospital confinements and a continuing need for medical treatment. On many occasions, she was observed to be in a dazed and unresponsive condition oblivious to the reality of her surrounding circumstances. Psychiatric evidence disclosed Carol suffered from a chronic mental illness, manifested by a detached reality and likely to become exacerbated when confronted with the normal stresses associated with the rearing of young children. While Carol\u2019s condition has shown improvement in recent years, two of the examining psychiatrists believed that Carol is and will remain incapable of adequately performing the role of parent; a third psychiatrist (called by Carol), while unable to evaluate Carol\u2019s present ability to provide parental care and control, stated his reluctance to disturb the children\u2019s present living situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">\n<em>Standard of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Initially, we meet the issue presented by Carol as to the proper standard of proof to be applied in section 232 emancipation proceedings. Focusing on the grave nature of the personal interests at stake, Carol contends\u2014as she did below\u2014that due process considerations and the far-reaching consequences generated by the instant termination proceedings demand that proof be made beyond a reasonable doubt or, at least, by clear and convincing evidence. While no relevant precedents are cited for the former proposition,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the latter proposal finds nearly uniform support in a number of cases. (See <em>In re Cynthia K. </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 81, 85-86 [141 Cal.Rptr. 875]; <em>In re George G. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 146, 165, fn. 14 [137 Cal.Rptr. 201]; see also <em>In re Robert P. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 310, 318 [132 Cal.Rptr. 5] [hg. den. 10/28/76] [dependency proceedings]; <em>Alsager v. District Court of Polk Cty., Iowa </em>(S.D.Iowa 1975) 406 F.Supp. 10; cf. <em>In re Rose G. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 406, 420 [129 Cal.Rptr. 338] [hg. den. 7/1/76] [proof by preponderance of the evidence].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In light of the more serious consequences flowing from a permanent severance of the parental relationship <em>(In re Jacqueline H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 170, 175 [145 Cal.Rptr. 548, 577 P.2d 683]) and the strong policy considerations favoring parental custody over that of nonparents <em>(In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482, 489 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514]) we are persuaded that the holdings in <em>Cynthia K, George G., </em>and <em>Robert P. </em>are soundly reasoned and should be followed. Thus, we hold that the appropriate standard to be applied herein requires proof by clear and convincing evidence. While the record is silent as to which standard was employed, we may properly presume that the correct \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard was applied. (See <em>In re Cynthia K., supra, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 81, 86.) The evidence under review (discussed <em>infra) </em>adequately demonstrates compliance with that more stringent standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>(See <em>In re Robert P., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 310, 319.) That standard is for the guidance of the trial court only; on review, our function is limited to a determination whether substantial evidence exists to support the conclusions reached by the trial court in utilizing the appropriate standard. (See <em>Crail </em>v. <em>Blakely </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 744, 750 [106 Cal.Rptr. 187, 505 P.2d 1027]; see also Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 209, pp. 190-191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Carol challenges the sufficiency of the findings underlying the judgment grounded upon neglect (subd. (a)(2)) and incapacitating mental illness (subd. (a)(6)). We consider the latter claim initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Preliminarily, we focus upon Carol\u2019s contention that the statutory test sanctioning termination of parental custody if \u201cincapable of supporting or controlling the child in a proper manner [due to] . . . mental illness\u201d (subd. (a)(6)) is unconstitutionally vague and incapable of objective application. We disagree. A substantially similar claim was urged and rejected in <em>In re Baby Boy T. </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 815 [88 Cal.Rptr. 418], which held that the legislative intent in enacting the subdivision (formerly \u00a7 232, subd. (g)) was to adopt the substantive definitions then provided by Welfare and Institutions Code former section 5550<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (at pp. 820-821). (See also <em>In re Eugene W. </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 623, 628, fn. 2 [105 Cal.Rptr. 736].) Significantly, our state Supreme Court has expressly approved the definitions of mental illness relied upon in the <em>In re Baby Boy T. </em>and <em>Eugene W. </em>decisions. (See <em>In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 482, 490-492.) The resulting effect measured against a standard of inability to support or control the minor in a \u201cproper manner\u201d is generally understood to mean \u201csuch control as parents ordinarily exercise . . . [and implies] . . . the usual incidents of the exercise of control\u201d over the child. (See <em>Marr v. Superior Court </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 527, 530 [250 P.2d 739]; see also <em>In re Edwards </em>(1930) 208 Cal. 725, 733 [284 P. 916].) No vagueness or fatal uncertainty is manifested in the statutory language either facially or in its application. (Cf. <em>In re Robert P., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 310, 318.) We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>In assessing Carol\u2019s further claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support the challenged finding, our function is governed by clearly defined principles of review:  It has been repeatedly held that \u201cWhen a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the finding of fact. <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>53 Cal.2d 567, 583 . . .; <em>Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 693 . . . .) [Further] [If] When two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, a reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court. <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Simpson, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 567, 583; <em>Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 694.)\u201d <em>(Green Trees Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., </em>66 Cal.2d 782, 784-785 [59 Cal.Rptr. 141, 427 P.2d 805].) And, as summarized by our Supreme Court in <em>Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 925-926 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480]: \u201cIn resolving the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence; we are bound by the established rules of appellate review that all factual matters will be viewed most favorably to the prevailing party <em>(Leming </em>v. <em>Oilfields Trucking Co. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 343, 346 . . .; <em>Bancroft-Whitney Co. </em>v. <em>McHugh </em>(1913) 166 Cal. 140, 142 . . .; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) \u00a7 245, at p. 4236) and in support of the judgment <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 389, 394 . . . .) All issues of credibility are likewise within the province of the trier of fact. <em>{Estate of Teel </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 520, 526 . . . .) \u2018In brief, the appellate court ordinarily <em>looks only at the evidence supporting the successful party, and disregards the contrary showing.\u2019 </em>(6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 249, at p. 4241.) All conflicts, therefore, must be resolved in favor of the respondent. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 .. . .)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In the light of the foregoing principles, we consider the evidence in the record to determine its sufficiency to support the challenged finding. In so doing, we disregard the conflicting and unfavorable evidence which Carol emphasizes in her brief. (See <em>Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 925 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Two qualified psychiatrists<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> testified as to appellant\u2019s long-standing mental illness\u2014diagnosed as a form of chronic schizophrenia\u2014rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>her incapable of providing either emotional support or proper parental control for the two children. Their opinions were amply supported by other substantial evidence revealing an unfortunate history of hospitalizations due to psychiatric episodes, frequently marked by morbid hallucinations and a complete detachment from reality. On one occasion in 1974, Carol engaged in an unprovoked attack upon one of the assigned social case workers; on yet another, she demonstrated a total inability to cope with the aggressive demands of her 12-year-old son, Robert (to whom she surrendered her public assistance check after he had ransacked the family home), resulting in a further period of hospitalization. The unstable family life was exacerbated by frequent changes of residence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> failure to impose needed discipline, irregular\u2014and often strained\u2014visits with the youngsters accompanied by broken promises to soon reunite as a family unit. Although the evidence reflects encouraging progress in Carol\u2019s ability to function normally, the medical testimony strongly indicated that the added stress in caring for the needs of growing children would likely result in aggravating her presently quiescent symptoms, thus producing further disabling psychiatric reactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">While the sum of the evidence is not without conflict, as we have noted in another context our \u201cparamount responsibility . . . [is] ... to determine what would be best in the child\u2019s interests\u201d <em>(In re D. L. C. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 840, 848 [126 Cal.Rptr. 863]); the weight to be given such rehabilitation efforts and justification for past deficiencies is a matter for the trial court whose province we may not invade. (See <em>In re Morrow </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 39, 57 [88 Cal.Rptr. 142] [disapproved on other grounds, <em>Hollister Convalescent Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rico </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 674 (125 Cal.Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349)].) We conclude there is no merit in Carol\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Since the proven finding of Carol\u2019s continuing mental illness rendering her incapable of providing proper support or control independently supports the judgment entered, nothing is to be gained by conducting a further examination of the evidence of impoverished circumstances and consequent deprival upon which the alternative finding of neglect is largely based. Thus, we rest our decision solely on the ground alleged and proved pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">\n<em>Failure to Consider Less Drastic Means</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Carol next contends that before state action may be undertaken to involuntarily terminate the natural relationship of parent and child, less drastic alternatives, such as provision for child protection services, must first be explored.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the principle advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">It is now well recognized that prelude to a judicial determination resulting in the permanent severance of the vitally significant parent-child relationship, the trial court should consider less severe available alternatives designed to keep the family unit intact. <em>(In re Susan M. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 300, 310-311 [125 Cal.Rptr. 707]; <em>In re T. M. R. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 694, 703 [116 Cal.Rptr. 292]; accord: <em>In re Carmaleta, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 482, 489; <em>In re Jacqueline H., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 170, 177.) But the record does not support Carol\u2019s claim that the Department was derelict in failing to explore and offer such alternative services.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The supervising social services worker testified that while some attempt had been made to provide supportive services, no actual referral was made to the children\u2019s protective services unit since Carol\u2019s lack of motivation due to her chronic mental illness offered little likelihood of success. To the extent that the Department\u2019s qualified denial constituted a failure to meaningfully consider the appropriateness of such services, the decision whether to order them and delay the proceedings pending evaluation was committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(In re Susan M., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 300, 311.) In expressly finding that the services should not be offered in order to avoid jeopardizing the children\u2019s best interests as a result of delay, no abuse of discretion was manifested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\n<em>Admissibility of the Probation Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">While recognizing the statutory requirement for an investigation and written report by the designated county agency adjunct to the filing of the petition (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 233), Carol challenges the legal sufficiency of the report received in evidence over objection on grounds of inadequate investigation, hearsay and unjustified recommendations. The challenge is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Initially, it appears settled that the written report mandated by the statute is admissible over a general hearsay objection so long as a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine and to controvert the content of the report is afforded. (See <em>In re George G., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 146, 155-156; <em>In re Rose G, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 406, 425, fn. 5, 426; cf. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 732, 736 [59 Cal.Rptr. 790] [imposing similar safeguards concerning probation reports filed in juvenile proceedings under authority of former \u00a7 582 (now \u00a7 281) of the Welf. &amp; Inst. Code].) Unlike the factual circumstances reflected in <em>In re George G. </em>(at pp. 157-158), Carol was permitted wide latitude in cross-examining many of the individuals whose statements were contained in the report, and could readily have availed herself of the opportunity to examine the investigating and reporting probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Contrary to Carol\u2019s assertion, the report on its face discloses that the required investigation was adequately performed; incorporation of copies of the official juvenile court records relating to the children\u2019s dependency status clearly falls within the statutory directive to investigate \u201cthe circumstances of said minor . . . and [those] alleged to bring said minor person within . . . the provisions of section 232.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 233.) Nor is the recommended termination of parental relationship unsupported by the content of the report, as Carol contends. Both asserted claims arguably are addressed to the weight of the report rather than to admissibility, a matter peculiarly within the province of the trial court. (See <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 557, 565 [218 P.2d 66].) Moreover, there was an abundance of evidence independent of the report to sustain the trial court\u2019s findings. Any technical deficiencies in the report itself were clearly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\n<em>Minors\u2019 Right to Appointed Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Carol\u2019s final claim of error concerns the failure of the trial court to ascertain the children\u2019s express desires and to appoint separate counsel to represent their interests. The claim is spurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Not only did Carol fail to raise such objection below, a circumstance generally foreclosing review on appeal (see <em>Estate of Cooper </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1122-1123 [90 Cal.Rptr. 283]), but she actively resisted the Department\u2019s request that the court consider the wishes of the children independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">It has been consistently held that the governing statutes (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 237, 237.5) permit but do not mandate the appointment of separate counsel to represent the minors\u2019 interests during emancipation proceedings. (See <em>In re Richard E. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 349, 353-354 [146 Cal.Rptr. 604, 579 P.2d 495]; <em>In re Marcos S. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 768, 778-779 [140 Cal.Rptr. 912]; <em>In re Dunlap </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 428, 438-439 [133 Cal.Rptr. 310] [disapproved on other grounds, <em>In re Richard E., supra].) </em>Only when it is found that the child\u2019s separate interests would be otherwise unprotected is the trial court required to exercise its discretion in favor of appointing separate counsel. (See <em>In re Richard E., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 349, 354.) The authorities relied upon by Carol are factually distinguishable (both <em>In re Richard E., supra, </em>and <em>In re Dunlap, supra, </em>involved a denial of an express request for separate counsel; no similar request was made herein). Moreover, the fact that the proceedings were instituted by a public agency on behalf of long-standing dependent-child wards of the court, constitutes \u201csignificant factors tending to establish that the [children\u2019s] interests . . . are represented.\u201d <em>(In re Dunlap, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d 428, 439, fn. 2; see also <em>In re Marcos S., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d 768, 780.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">As the court observed in <em>In re Richard E. </em>(at p. 354): \u201cA proceeding to free a child from parental custody and control is essentially accusatory in nature, directed to challenges against the parent\u2014not against the child. [Citation.] . . . Thus, the issue at a hearing is whether a parent is fit to raise the child. To that end are directed all the arguments of opposing parties, . . . each side generally contending it is protecting the best interests of the child. It is thus likely that in a particular case the court will be fully advised of matters affecting the minor\u2019s best interests, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>little assistance may be expected from independent counsel for the minor in furtherance of his client\u2019s or the court\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Here, the trial court was so fully advised: Carol was extended adequate opportunity to present evidence tending to subserve the children\u2019s best interests. Notwithstanding Carol\u2019s objection, evidence of the children\u2019s preference to remain with their foster parents was admitted through the testimony of others; additionally, evidence of the inter-family relationships (between the minors on the one hand and Carol and her other children, and the foster parents and their children on the other) was likewise presented for the court\u2019s consideration. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to imagine, nor does Carol even suggest, what other meaningful assistance independent counsel might have offered. The record manifestly demonstrates that the interests of the minors herein were adequately protected without the intervention of appointed counsel. <em>(In re Marcos S., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d 768, 778.) We find no error as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Elkington, J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> That section provides in relevant part as follows: \u201c(a) An action may be brought for the purpose of having any person under the age of 18 years declared free from the custody and control of either or both of his parents when such person comes within any of the following descriptions:...
