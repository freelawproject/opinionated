A.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-M\">As a result of an incident which occurred on October 14, 1976, petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of voluntary manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. I)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was sentenced for the term prescribed by law for that offense under the then existent Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL). Though it is conceded that petitioner, used a deadly weapon, a knife, in the commission of the offense, the court did not enhance petitioner\u2019s sentence for that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">On March 29, 1977, while serving his term of imprisonment, petitioner was found guilty of possessing a crude prison-made knife by a prison disciplinary committee and was given prison discipline for that offense. He was not prosecuted on the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Following the passage of the determinate sentence law (DSL) (\u00a7 1170 et seq., eff. July 1, 1977), the Community Release Board (CRB), pursuant to the retroactive provisions of that law, ordered a serious offender hearing under the provisions of section 1170.2, subdivision (b). The CRB recalculated petitioner\u2019s sentence at <em>4lA </em>years, consisting of 36 months (middle term), base term for manslaughter (\u00a7193), 12 months for use of a deadly weapon in commission of the offense, and 6 months for the in-prison possession of a prison-made weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Petitioner contends that: (1) The 12-month enhancement was improperly added by the CRB because the court did not find the allegation to be true or impose the enhancement. (2) The CRB improperly added the 6 months enhancement for in-prison conduct. (3) The use of the in-prison disciplinary board\u2019s finding as a basis of enlarging the sentence deprived him of due process of law. (4) The CRB did not inform him in writing of \u201cthe extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative . . .\u201d as required by section 1170.2, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The retroactive provisions of the DSL contained in section 1170.2 set forth the manner in which the terms of prisoners sentenced under the ISL shall be recalculated under the DSL. Subdivision (a) of that section sets forth fixed standards for the conversion of indeterminate terms into determinate terms. We are not concerned with that subdivision. In the case at bench the CRB acted pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 1170.2 which provides in pertinent part that if: \u201c. . . at least two of the members of the Community Release Board after reviewing the prisoner\u2019s file, determine that due to the number of crimes of which the prisoner was convicted, or due to the number of prior convictions suffered by the prisoner, or due to the fact that the prisoner was armed with a deadly weapon when the crime was committed, or used a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime, or inflicted or attempted to inflict great bodily injury on the victim of the crime, the prisoner should serve a term longer than that calculated in subdivision (a), . . . the prisoner shall be entitled to a hearing before a panel consisting of at least two members of the Community Release Board as provided for in Section 3041.5. ... At such hearing the prisoner shall be entitled to be represented by legal counsel, a release date shall be set, and the prisoner shall be informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated. In fixing a term under this section <em>the board shall be guided by, but not limited to, </em>the term which reasonably could be imposed on a person who committed a similar offense under similar circumstances on or after July 1, 1977, and further, <em>the board shall be guided by the following finding and declaration hereby made by the Legislature: that the necessity to protect the public from repetition of extraordinary crimes of violence against the person is the paramount consideration.'\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In analyzing the authority of the CRB under section 1170.2, subdivision (b), we concluded <em>In re Greenwood </em>(1978) <em>ante, </em>page 777 [151 Cal.Rptr. 223], that \u201can analysis of the statutory provisions and the functions of the CRB as successor to the Adult Authority in the administration of the ISL (see \u00a7\u00a7 5077, 5078) leads unerringly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>conclusion that the CRB when acting pursuant to section 1170.2, subdivision (b), is not required to strictly apply the statutory principles and California Rules of Court which are binding upon trial courts passing sentence. Further, the specific terms of section 1170.2, subdivision (a), require the CRB to apply those principles and rules only when recalculating sentences under that subdivision.\u201d (At p. 782.) Rather, subdivision (b) of section 1170.2 specifically provides, the CRB \u201c[i]n fixing a term under this section . . . shall be guided by, but not limited to, the term which reasonably could be imposed on a person who committed a similar offense under similar circumstances on or after July 1, 1977,</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">We further concluded in <em>In re Greenwood, supra, ante, </em>that . . in serious offender proceedings it clearly appears from the express language of the statute that the CRB is given discretion to impose a greater term than could have been imposed by the court under \"the DSL.\u201d (At p. 783.)\"</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Further germane to the issues herein is our observation in <em>Greenwood </em>that: \u201cWith respect to offenses committed prior to July 1, 1977, the ISL remains in effect. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Gonzales), supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 134; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 425 [141 Cal.Rptr. 442].) The authority and discretion to fix indeterminate sentences remain in the CRB even though the factors which the board should consider have been altered. That being the case the same standards of judicial review which have been applied for years under the ISL also apply to the term-fixing decisions of the CRB after a serious offender hearing, namely, whether based upon the entire record the board abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily, capriciously or without information <em>(In re Minnis </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 639 [102 Cal.Rptr. 749, 498 P.2d 997]; <em>In re Streeter </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 47 [56 Cal.Rptr. 824, 423 P.2d 976]; <em>In re Wilkerson </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 798, 803 [77 Cal.Rptr. 340]) and whether the actual sentence fixed by the board is constitutionally disproportionate to the offense <em>(In re Rodriguez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 653-656 [122 Cal.Rptr. 552, 537 P.2d 384]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169 [12) Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001]). In addition section 1170.2, subdivision (b) requires that \u2018the prisoner shall be informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated.\u2019 This requirement does not imply that the CRB must state the entire evidentiary basis for the conclusions reached in its statement of reasons in order to insulate the statement of reasons against an attack on due process grounds. (See <em>In re Sturm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 258, 265-270 [113 Cal.Rptr. 361, 521 P.2d 97]; <em>Way </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>[1977] 74 Cal.App.3d 165, 172-173.)\u201d (At pp. 784-785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Applying these principles to the facts of this case, it is manifest that the CRB acted well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Prior to the enactment of the DSL the Adult Authority was empowered to increase the amount of time to be served by a prisoner for prior conduct even though the acts were not pleaded and proved in court. <em>(In re Stanley </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 1030 [126 Cal.Rptr. 524].) The CRB as successor to the Adult Authority has the same power under section 1170.2, subdivision (b) when fixing the term of an indeterminate sentenced prisoner where the enhancement is assessed for use of a deadly weapon during an offense. This authority is made especially clear in this instance since using a weapon during the commission of the crime is one of the specified grounds authorizing the convening of a serious offender hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">By analogy the court in <em>In re Gray </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 255 [149 Cal.Rptr. 416], held that the CRB, acting pursuant to section 1170.2, subdivision (b), may impose an additional period to the base period due to the number of crimes of which the prisoner was convicted even though the trial court ordered such sentences to run concurrently. Thus the court sanctioned authority in the CRB to do an act which was in effect contrary to what the trial court ordered under the ISL. In the instant case it is an exercise of a lesser authority by the CRB to permit an assessment of an enhancement for the use of a deadly weapon upon which the trial court was silent. We find no error in the CRB\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Turning next to the six-month enhancement for the in-prison conduct, we likewise find no error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">As has been pointed out, the CRB \u201c[i]n fixing a term under this section . . . shall be guided by, but not limited to, the term which reasonably could be imposed on a person who committed a similar offense under similar circumstances on or after July 1, 1977, and, further, . . . shall be guided by the following finding and declaration hereby made by the Legislature: that the necessity to protect the public from repetition of extraordinary crimes of violence against the person is the paramount consideration.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.2, subd. (b).)  Thus in setting the determinate sentence the CRB should impose a term which in its sound discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>it deems necessary to protect the public from repetition of crimes of violence against the person. In this regard the CRB stated in its written report of the serious offender hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">\u201cThe prisoner has been found to have committed other offenses in a Disciplinary Proceeding as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cManufacture and possession of a Prison Made Weapon, as described in CDC 115 of 3/10/77, a long piece of metal tubing flattened and fashioned into a Prison Made Knife, which panel views with concern because of said behavior being consistent with behavior of commitment offense in which the prisoner used a knife to inflict the fatal wound upon the victim.\u201d (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Obviously the CRB was concerned with petitioner\u2019s propensity toward the possession and use of knives against other persons. The possession of a prison-made knife bears a reasonable relationship to a consideration of what is necessary to \u201cprotect the public from repetition of extraordinary crimes of violence against the person\u201d under section 1170.2, subdivision (b), and was a legitimate consideration for the CRB to utilize in fixing the determinate term of an indeterminately sentenced prisoner under the facts before it. We therefore hold that the CRB did not exceed its authority or abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Without citation of authority or argument petitioner contends he was deprived of his due process rights because he was not represented by counsel at the disciplinary proceeding, did not have a trial by jury and was not found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It is petitioner\u2019s burden to furnish a record. He has furnished no record of the disciplinary proceeding. It is also his burden to support his arguments with citations to authorities. He has cited none. We could reject the contention without more. In passing, however, we point to <em>In re Spence </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 636 [111 Cal.Rptr. 782] as fully supporting the validity of using an in-prison disciplinary committee\u2019s findings to extend a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Lastly, petitioner argues that the CRB did not inform him in writing of \u201cthe extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative\u201d in the recalculation of his sentence. The CRB\u2019s written report (see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>fully explicated the factors utilized in calculating the sentence. Petitioner\u2019s argument in substance is that something more is required than merely listing one or more of those factors set forth in section 1170.2, subdivision (b), which allows the CRB to set a sentence longer than that imposed under section 1170.2, subdivision (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">\u201cExtraordinaiy factors\u201d refers not to factors in addition to the finding of the enhancement fact but rather refers to the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>section 1170.2, subdivision (a), and section 1170.2, subdivision (b). As discussed above, section 1170.2, subdivision (a), is the \u201cordinaiy\u201d method of retroactively applying the determinate sentence law following fixed criteria. Application of section 1170.2, subdivision (b), in its stead requires a finding of an \u201cextraordinary factor,\u201d i.e., one or more of those factors listed that allows the CRB to set a sentence longer than that which could be imposed under section 1170.2, subdivision (a), including, as in this case, use of a deadly weapon in the commission of the crime. Section 1170.2, subdivision (a), rests on determinations made by the original trial court in sentencing. Section 1170.2, subdivision (b), rests on findings made by the CRB. (3) The prisoner is required to be informed of those factors specifically considered determinative by the CRB and the basis on which the release date was formulated. As we have stated, this requirement does not imply that the CRB must state the entire evidentiary basis for the conclusions contained in its statement of reasons in order to meet the requirements of due process. (See <em>In re Sturm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 258, 265-270 [113 Cal.Rptr. 361, 521 P.2d 97].) This is the construction of the statute that was applied by the court in <em>Way </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 165, 172-173 [141 Cal.Rptr. 383], when it noted that section 1170.2, subdivision (b): \u201c. . . appears to require that such a longer term [than that required by \u00a7 1170.2, subd. (a)] be justified on the basis of certain objective facts, viz. (1) the number of crimes of which the prisoner was convicted; (2) the number of prior convictions; (3) the fact that the prisoner was armed; or (4) that he used a deadly weapon; or (5) that he inflicted great bodily harm on the victim; this is further implied by the due process guarantees written into the law, including an inmate\u2019s right to counsel and to be \u2018informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the CRB\u2019s written report of the serious offender proceedings which was delivered to petitioner satisfies the requirement that he \u201cbe informed in writing of the extraordinary factors specifically considered determinative and on what basis the release date has been calculated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Hopper, J., and Accurso, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 19, 1979, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied on February 14,1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> All code references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> The pertinent language used by the CRB\u2019s written report of the extended term proceedings stated the factors upon which it based the enhancements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aal\">\u201cThe base term set forth above is increased due to the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Q\">\u201cH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM6\">\u201cThe prisoner used a deadly or dangerous weapon, knife, in the commission of the offense stated in I above and such was not an element of the offense itself.

(See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2931, 2932.) It is relevant to note, however, that under title 15, California Administrative Code, section 2451, subdivision (a)(4), \u201cpossession of a weapon without permission\u201d is one of the in-prison offenses for which administrative discipline may be imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
