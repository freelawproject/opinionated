J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7A\">Petitioner William Rumbaugh contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) erred in calculating pursuant to Labor Code section 4658<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the dollar value of the awards for his two industrial back injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Since April 1, 1972, section <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has provided a graduated scale whereunder the number of weekly benefits increases in proportion to the percentage of the permanent disability. <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 1, 4 [128 Cal.Rptr. 673, 547 P.2d 449]; <em>Aten </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 113, 117 [142 Cal.Rptr. 42].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It should be further noted that pursuant to sections 4658 and 4659 a permanent disability rating of 70 percent or more entitles the injured to a life pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\n<em>Proceedings Before the Appeals Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Rumbaugh sustained two industrial back injuries. One occurred while he was employed on December 1, 1974, by Midtown Bowl (Midtown), whose compensation insurance carrier was then Republic Indemnity Company of America (Republic). The second was a cumulative trauma injury to his back while employed by various employers, including Midtown, during the period 1970 through April 18, 1975.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the cumulative trauma injury, pursuant to section 5500.5, subdivision (c), Rumbaugh elected to proceed against Midtown and its carrier Republic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">As a result of the 1974 injury and the cumulative trauma injury Rumbaugh was found to have sustained a total of 76 percent permanent disability, which the workers\u2019 compensation judge apportioned 75 percent to the specific 1974 injury and 25 percent to the cumulative trauma injury. Rumbaugh thereby received a permanent disability rating of 57 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>for the 1974 injury, which is equal to 290 weeks of disability payments at $70 per week in the total sum of $20,300; and a rating of 19 percent on the cumulative trauma injury, which is equivalent to 66.25 weeks of permanent disability payments at the rate of $70 per week in the total sum of $4,637.50. The two awards total $24,937.50. No life pension was awarded as to either injury since the permanent disability for neither injury separately was 70 percent or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Rumbaugh then sought reconsideration by the Board. He contended that he was entitled to a combined disability rating for the two injuries of 76 percent permanent disability. A 76 percent permanent disability rating would entitle Rumbaugh to an award totalling $30,047.50 payable at $70 per week for 429.25 weeks, and thereafter a life pension of $25.85 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The Board granted reconsideration and analyzed Rumbaugh\u2019s position in light of our Supreme Court opinions in <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 1 and <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 491 [138 Cal.Rptr. 696]. <em>Fuentes </em>and <em>Wilkinson </em>both deal with the application of the graduated benefit scale of section 4658.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\"><em>Fuentes </em>involved an injured worker who sustained an industrial injury to his lungs. While his total permanent disability rated at 58 percent, only 33.75 percent of that disability was industrially related. The court applied section 4658 by compensating the industrial disability at the bottom of the graduated scale. The court held that this method was required by section 4750 which states;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201cAn employee who is suffering from a previous permanent disability or physical impairment and sustains permanent injury thereafter shall not receive from the employer compensation for the later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">\u201cThe employer shall not be liable for compensation to such an employee for the combined disability, but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The court in <em>Fuentes </em>acknowledged that by their application of section 4658 an injured worker who sustained one injury which resulted in 50 percent permanent disability would receive greater benefits than one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>sustained two successive injuries each of which causes a permanent disability of 25 percent when considered alone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court viewed this result as \u201cneither unfair nor unjust\u201d but \u201c[rjather, it is a consequence of the recent amendments to section 4658 and is consistent with the . . . policy [of section 4750] of encouraging employers to hire the disabled.\u201d <em>{Fuentes, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 8.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In <em>Wilkinson </em>the injured sustained two successive bilateral knee injuries while working for the same employer. The two injuries became permanent and stationary<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at the same time. The appeals board awarded the injured a 15.25 percent permanent disability rating for each injury. The Supreme Court annulled the two separate awards and held that the injured was entitled to a combined permanent disability award of 30.5 percent. The <em>Wilkinson </em>court reached that result by following the reasoning of the Board in <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1969) 34 Cal. Comp. Cases 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">While <em>Bauer </em>was decided prior to the adoption of the graduated scale of section 4658, the <em>Wilkinson </em>court found it relevant as <em>Bauer </em>dealt with the situation where three successive injuries resulted in a combined disability in the life pension range (i.e., 70 percent or more permanent disability) while each injury if considered alone would not have resulted in a life pension. In <em>Bauer </em>the Board held that the injured was entitled to a life pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">As summarized by the Supreme Court in <em>Wilkinson, </em>the <em>Bauer </em>doctrine provides that \u201cwhenever a worker, while working for the same employer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>sustains successive injuries to the same part of his body and these injuries become permanent at the same time, the worker is entitled to an award based upon the combined disability.\u201d <em>(Wilkinson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 494.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The <em>Wilkinson </em>court found that <em>Bauer </em>was not inconsistent with the requirement of section 4750 that there be apportionment of successive permanent disabilities. The court reasoned that \u201c[i]f the worker incurs successive injuries which become permanent <em>at the same time, </em>neither permanent disability is \u2018previous\u2019 to the other, and section 4750 hence does not require apportionment.\u201d <em>(Wilkinson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 497; italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The <em>Wilkinson </em>opinion then goes on to explain that <em>\u201cBauer </em>also serves the practical purpose of avoiding the necessity to apportion disability in a class of cases in which, because of the nature and timing of the injuries, any apportionment is likely to be unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 497; <em>Aten, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 113, 118-119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In <em>Wilkinson, </em>the court was careful to note that it was not overruling <em>Fuentes </em>but rather that it was distinguishing it based upon <em>Bauer. (Wilkinson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 491, 500-501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">In reviewing Rumbaugh\u2019s two injuries, the Board noted that one element of the <em>Wilkinson-Bauer </em>doctrine was not present\u2014the employers for the cumulative trauma and the 1974 injury were not the same. Accordingly, the Board refused to apply <em>Wilkinson-Bauer </em>and affirmed the trial judge\u2019s separate awards.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>Wilkinson </em>spells out the three requirements for the application of the <em>Bauer </em>doctrine to cases coming under the progressive schedule of section 4658. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">1. The successive injuries must be sustained in the employ of the same employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">2. The successive injuries must involve the same parts of the body; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">3. The successive injuries must become permanent and stationary at the same time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Here, both of Rumbaugh\u2019s injuries involve back disability and both injuries became permanent and stationary at the same time. The missing element under <em>Wilkinson </em>is that the injuries here did not occur while working for the same employer; rather, while one of the employers in the cumulative trauma claim, Midtown, was the same employer for the 1974 specific injury, there are other employers for the cumulative trauma injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">The issue then is whether the <em>Bauer-Wilkinson </em>doctrine may be applied where there is not an identity of employers at the times of the successive injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">In <em>Wilkinson, </em>at pages 500-501, the court, in rejecting the contention that applying <em>Bauer </em>conflicted with the state policy of encouraging employers to hire and retain handicapped persons, stated: \u201cThe <em>Bauer </em>doctrine as presently limited only applies to cases in which both injuries were sustained in the course of employment by the same employer and thus would not discourage hiring of previously injured persons. And since that doctrine applies only in the rare circumstance that an employee sustains a second injury to the same part of his body before the first injury has become permanent, we cannot see how <em>Bauer </em>would induce employers to discharge injured workers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Seemingly, this language limits <em>Wilkinson </em>to the very \u201crare\u201d factual situation presented there and in <em>Bauer. </em>We observe, however, that since at the time <em>Wilkinson </em>was decided <em>Bauer </em>had not been applied to a factual situation like the one before us,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> our Supreme Court had no reason to consider such a situation. Thus, we must decide whether the legal analysis of <em>Wilkinson </em>should apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">The two cornerstones of <em>Wilkinson </em>and <em>Bauer </em>are the concepts that (1) under section 4750 there is no preexisting disability where both injuries become permanent and stationary at the same time; and (2) the use of <em>Wilkinson </em>and <em>Bauer </em>avoids the \u201cartificial\u201d apportionment between two injuries where because of the closeness in time it is relatively difficult to determine if all the disability or only part is due to one or the other injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">As to Rumbaugh\u2019s injuries these two concepts are equally applicable. Both injuries became permanent and stationary at the same time; therefore, there was no pre-existing disability as to either injury. If section 4750 does not prevent t\u00edre result in <em>Wilkinson, </em>we do not see why it should preclude the application of <em>Wilkinson </em>here merely because there is not complete identity of employers for both injuries. The policy behind section 4750 is to encourage employers to hire and to retain previously disabled workers. (See <em>Wilkinson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 500; <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 6.) Nothing in . the language of section 4750 indicates that the section applies differently where the successive injuries occur while working for the same employer as opposed to different employers. Indeed, no such distinction has been made in the cases applying section 4750 to successive injuries. (See, e.g., <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 711 [129 Cal.Rptr. 161, 548 P.2d 361]; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Ind. Acc. Com. (Hutchinson) </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 45 [27 Cal.Rptr. 702, 377 P.2d 902]; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Gaba) </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 13 [139 Cal.Rptr. 802]; <em>Amico </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 592 [117 Cal.Rptr. 831]; <em>National Auto &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 204 [30 Cal.Rptr. 685]; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>see <em>Wilkinson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 504 (cone, and dis. opn. of Richardson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In <em>Wilkinson </em>the two injuries were separated by two and one-half months. Rumbaugh\u2019s specific injury occurred toward the end of the five-year period of the cumulative trauma injury. It seems clear, though, that the two injuries interacted. Thus, it would be unrealistic to conclude that as to Rumbaugh\u2019s back injuries the disability specifically attributable to each is possible of separate determination. In addition, where, as here, a specific injuiy allegedly occurs during the period of a cumulative trauma injury, the application of <em>Wilkinson </em>eliminates the effect of the often dubious finding of a specific injuiy when that specific injuiy appears as nothing more than a part of the cumulative trauma injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We also observe that the situation of multiple employers of a cumulative injury will become rarer in the future as commencing January 1, 1978, there will occur under section 5500.5, subdivision (a) (see fns. 5 and 6, ante) a yearly reduction of the five-year liability period for cumulative trauma injuries. For claims filed or asserted on or after January 1, 1981, the liability period for cumulative trauma injuries will be only one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Thus, the fact that multiple employers are involved in the cumulative trauma injuiy and only Midtown is involved in the 1974 specific injuiy does not affect the two \u201ccornerstones\u201d of <em>Wilkinson </em>and <em>Bauer. </em>To fail to apply <em>Wilkinson </em>and <em>Bauer </em>to Rumbaugh\u2019s injuries would treat him differently than injureds who are similarly situated except that they are \u201cfortunate\u201d enough to have complete identity of employers for the two injuries. This difference in treatment must necessarily be based upon a factor which is clearly irrelevant under <em>Wilkinson-Bauer </em>and would be contrary to the policy of liberal construction, expressly stated in section 3202, which mandates that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cshall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>(See <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 436, 439 [71 Cal.Rptr. 684, 445 P.2d 300]; <em>Hulbert </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 634, 639 [121 Cal.Rptr. 239].) The amount of compensation in this kind of successive injuries case should depend upon the severity of the disability and not upon the fortuitous circumstance of identity of employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Nothing in sections 3208.1,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 3208.2,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 5303,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which proscribe the merger of specific and cumulative trauma injuries <em>(Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. (Coltharp), supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d 329, 334; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. (Burris) </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 812, 817-818 [82 Cal.Rptr. 102]), prevents the application of <em>Wilkinson </em>to Rumbaugh\u2019s claims. Nothing in these sections \u201csuggests that the Legislature intended to require apportionment in ordinary disability cases which do not fall within the scope of section 4750 <em>or </em>that it intended to overturn the <em>Bauer </em>doctrine that a case involving successive injuries to the same part of the body which became permanent and stationary at the same time does not fall within the scope of section 4750.\u201d <em>(Wilkinson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 501, fn. 5; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the Board should have followed <em>Wilkinson-Bauer </em>in computing the dollar amount of benefits and awarded Rumbaugh a combined permanent disability rating of 76 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Accordingly, the awards and the Board\u2019s opinion and decision after reconsideration are annulled.

This stipulation was accepted by the judge, and he made a finding of fact to that effect. (See \u00a7 5702.) No party now challenges this finding and we may not disturb it. We do observe, however, that at the time of the specific injury, Rumbaugh was putting away 12 ounce bottles of beer, bottle by bottle, an activity he did every day of his employment. Certainly had the appeals board found that no specific injury occurred on December 12, 1974, but that events of that day were merely part of the cumulative trauma injury it would have been supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d (See <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. (Coltharp) </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 329, 340-341 [110 Cal.Rptr. 780].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> Section 3208.1 provides: \u201cAn injury may be either: (a) \u2018specific,\u2019 occurring as the result of one incident or exposure which causes disability or need for medical treatment; or (b) \u2018cumulative,\u2019 occurring as repetitive mentally or physically traumatic activities extending over a period of time, the combined effect of which causes any disability or need for medical treatment.
