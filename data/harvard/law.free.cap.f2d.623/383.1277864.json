RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">In <em>Ballew v. Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978), the United States Supreme Court held that conducting a criminal trial before a jury consisting of only five members deprives the defendant of his right to trial by jury under the sixth amendment as applied to the states by the fourteenth amendment. This habeas corpus petition seeks retroactive application of that decision in order to invalidate Irvin Thomas\u2019s conviction by a five-member Louisiana jury. Concluding that <em>Ballew </em>is retroactive, we affirm the district court decision according Thomas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">Only last month, the Supreme Court considered a similar problem. In <em>Burch v. Louisiana, </em>441 U.S. 130, 99 S.Ct. 1623, 60 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979), the Court held that a 5-1 verdict convicting the defendant of a non-petty offense violates the right to jury trial. In <em>Brown v. </em>Louisiana, -U.S.-, 100 S.Ct. 2214, 64 L.Ed.2d ..... (1980), the Court held that <em>Burch </em>should be applied retroactively. Four members of the Court (Justices Brennan, Stewart, Marshall and Blackmun) joined in the plurality opinion. Justices Powell and Stevens concurred in the judgment but would have limited retroactive application to cases pending on direct review at the time the new constitutional rule was announced. Thomas\u2019s original state proceedings were completed in 1972, so his case does not meet the requirements of the concurring opinion. Nonetheless, we conclude that the authority of the <em>Brown </em>decision constrains us to reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">The factors to be considered have been fully set forth in <em>Hankerson v. North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233, 97 S.Ct. 2339, 53 L.Ed.2d 306 (1977); <em>Michigan v. Payne, </em>412 U.S. 47, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736 (1973); <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); and <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). They were all again reviewed in <em>Brown. </em>The three criteria are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-18\">(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-19\"><em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1203 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">\u201cForemost among these factors is the purpose to be served by the new constitutional rule.\u201d <em>Desist v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 249, 89 S.Ct. 1030,1033, 22 L.Ed.2d 248, 255 (1969) (footnote omitted). Indeed, the other two factors are determinative \u201conly when the purpose of the rule in question [does] not clearly favor either retroactivity or prospectivity.\u201d <em>Brown v. Louisiana, -U.S. </em>-,-, 100 S.Ct. 2214, 2219, 64 L.Ed.2d -,-(1980) (brack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ets in original). \u201cWhere the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect. Neither good-faith reliance by state or federal authorities on prior constitutional law or accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice has sufficed to require prospective application in these circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388, 395 (1971) (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">To demonstrate that the purpose of <em>Bal-lew </em>was to \u201covercome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function,\u201d <em>Brown v. Louisiana, </em>-U.S. at-, 100 S.Ct. at 2219, 64 L.Ed.2d at-, and to demonstrate that the Supreme Court views the purpose of <em>Ballew </em>as indistinguishable from the purpose of <em>Burch, </em>so that both must be given retroactive application if either is, we need only quote from the analysis in <em>Brown :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax4\">We think it apparent that the rationale behind the constitutional rule announced in <em>Burch </em>mandates its retroactive application. Mr. Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion in <em>Ballew </em>catalogued the several considerations that led the Court to conclude that the operation of the jury was inhibited to a constitutionally significant degree by reducing its size to five members. Prominent among these concerns was the recognition, supported by a number of empirical studies, that a decline in jury size leads to less accurate factfinding and a greater risk of convicting an innocent person. 435 U.S. at 232-235. In addition, statistical and empirical data established that because of a concomitant decrease in the number of hung juries, a reduction in the size of the jury panel in criminal cases unfairly disadvantages one side \u2014 the defense. <em>Id., </em>at 236. Lastly, the opinion noted that the opportunity for meaningful and appropriate minority representation diminishes with the size of the jury. <em>Id., </em>at 236-237.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">Identical considerations underlay our decision in <em>Burch. </em>The threat which conviction by a 5 to 0 verdict poses to the fairness of the proceeding and the proper role of the jury is not significantly alleviated when conviction is instead obtained by the addition of a sixth, but dissenting, ballot. When the requirement of unanimity is abandoned, the vote of this \u201cadditional\u201d juror is essentially superfluous. The prosecution\u2019s demonstrated inability to convince all the jurors of the accused\u2019s guilt certainly does nothing to allay our concern about the reliability and accuracy of the jury\u2019s verdict. And while the addition of another juror to the five-person panel may statistically increase the representativeness of that body, relinquishment of the unanimity requirement removes any guarantee that the minority voices will actually be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">In sum, <em>Burch </em>established that the concurrence of six jurors was constitutionally required to preserve the substance of the jury trial right and assure the reliability of its verdict. It is difficult to envision a constitutional rule that more fundamentally implicates \u201cthe fairness of the trial \u2014 the very integrity of the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 639 (1965). \u201cThe basic purpose of a trial is the determination of truth,\u201d <em>Tehan v. Shott, </em>382 U.S. 406, 416, 86 S.Ct. 459, 465, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966), and it is the jury to whom we have entrusted the responsibility for making this determination in serious criminal cases. Any practice that threatens the jury\u2019s ability properly to perform that function poses a similar threat to the truth-determining process itself. The rule in <em>Burch </em>was directed toward elimination of just such a practice. Its purpose, therefore, clearly requires retroactive application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">-U.S. at -, 100 S.Ct. at 2222, 64 L.Ed.2d at -(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The recognition that <em>Ballew </em>and <em>Burch </em>share the same purpose mandates that <em>Bal-lew </em>also be applied retroactively, regardless of good-faith reliance by the state on the former rule or disruptive effect on the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ministration of justice. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388, 395 (1971) (plurality opinion). Moreover, retroactive application of the <em>Ballew </em>rule will not have a devastating impact on the administration of the criminal law. Only two states other than Louisiana \u2014 Georgia and Virginia\u2014 have utilized five-person juries, and they did so only in misdemeanor cases. In 1974, by revision of the Louisiana Constitution and of the state\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure, the five-member jury (or as it was called locally, the bob-tail jury) was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Thus in Louisiana only persons convicted prior to 1974 could attack the statute. It applied only to cases for which a prison sentence was not mandatory. La. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 782 (West 1966) (amended 1974). Some of those convicted by five-member juries were no doubt not sentenced to prison and others sentenced to prison have no doubt been released. The state at oral argument could not give an estimate of the number still in prison but it did not contend that the affected group is large. Furthermore, what the Supreme Court said in <em>Brown </em>is applicable here as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">What little disruption to the administration of justice results from retroactive application of <em>Burch </em>\u201cmust be considered part of the price we pay for former failures to provide fair procedures.\u201d <em>Adams v. Illinois, </em>[405 U.S. 278, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202] <em>supra, </em>at 297 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">- U.S. at -, 100 S.Ct. at 2224, 64 L.Ed.2d at -.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Finally, we consider the state\u2019s claim that Irvin Thomas\u2019s failure to challenge the five-member jury at the time of his criminal trial, as required by Louisiana\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule, La. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 841 (West 1966) (amended 1974), should bar him from bringing his federal constitutional claim in this federal habeas action. The denial of habeas corpus relief in the state courts was not based upon his violation of Louisiana\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule but rather was a decision on the merits,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a federal court can, therefore, also reach the merits of his claim for habeas relief, without considering whether he satisfies the cause-and-prejudice test established by <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). <em>County Court v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 146-155, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2219-23, 60 L.Ed.2d 777, 785-791 (1979); <em>Cannon v.

Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 486 n.4, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1275 n.4, 51 L.Ed.2d 498, 505 n.4 (1977); <em>see also Franks v.
