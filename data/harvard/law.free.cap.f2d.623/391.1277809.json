Finding the SPFFC\u2019s contentions to be without merit, we enforce the ICC\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The peculiar nature of railroad ratemak-ing necessitates our taking a brief excursus into its history before discussing the particulars of the instant case. Since the 1890\u2019s, railroads have formed associations for the joint consideration and establishment of rates, classifications, and charges. <em>See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, </em>166 U.S. 290, 338, 17 S.Ct. 540, 557, 41 L.Ed. 1007 (1907). These organizations, called rate bureaus, serve primarily as a forum for the collective determination of rate matters. Because this manner of establishing rates brought rail carriers into conflict with the antitrust laws,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress in 1948 passed section 5a of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5b (originally enacted as Act of June 17, 1948, ch. 491, 62 Stat. 472), extending antitrust immunity to carriers with respect to collective ratemak-ing agreements approved by the ICC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">In response to \u201cchanges in the competitive nature of the transportation market\u201d in the course of the past century, <em>see </em>S.Rep., <em>supra </em>n. 2, at 11, most notably the diminished need for protection against rail monopoly, <em>id., </em>Congress passed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (the \u201cRRRR Act\u201d), Pub.L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31 (codified at 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq. (West 1979)), to further competition among railroads and otherwise modernize railroad ratemaking. The RRRR Act narrowed the antitrust exemption previously available to railroads in several respects, only one of which is relevant here. Before the RRRR Act was passed, any carrier who was a member of a rate bureau could participate in the bureau\u2019s rate determinations, <em>see </em>n. 2, <em>supra, </em>for an interline movement, regardless of whether it hauled goods along the route in question. Under the RRRR Act, only a carrier who can \u201cpracticably participate\u201d in an interline movement is permitted to participate in agreements or rates related to that movement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">To bring its agreement into line with the provisions of the RRRR Act, the SPFFC submitted a revised agreement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the ICC. The revised agreement contained the following provision, addressing a carrier\u2019s ability to participate in proposals concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the rates or charges applicable to an interline movement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">(b) In the case of a proposal to establish or change rates, allowances, or charges relating to any particular interline movement (called an \u201cinterline proposal\u201d herein), only such carriers as can practicably participate in a movement involved in the proposal as an origin and/or destination carrier or as an intermediate carrier shall be eligible to vote or agree on such proposal. For purposes of this subpara-graph, <em>a carrier can practicably participate in a movement involved in a proposal if such carrier participates in a route as published in a tariff on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission from an origin involved in the proposal to a destination involved in the proposal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agi\">(emphasis added). Objections to the SPFFC\u2019s definition of \u201cpracticably participate,\u201d italicized above, were filed with the Commission by the National Industrial Traffic League (\u201cNITL\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The NITL contended that the definition of the term \u201cpracticably participate,\u201d as used in section 10706(a)(3)(A)(i), should be restricted to those carriers who participate in the movement of the particular commodity involved in an interline movement. The FTC likewise protested that the SPFFC\u2019s proposed definition was too broad; however, it did not submit an alternative definition at that time. Despite this opposition, a division, or panel, of the ICC held that the SPFFC\u2019s definition provided \u201can adequate statement of the standards necessary for determination of the eligible member carriers authorized to consider collectively or vote on an interline proposal under the section [10706 (aX3)(A)(i)].\u201d Southern Ports Foreign Freight Committee \u2014 Agreement, 355 I.C.C. 216, 230 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The FTC appealed the division\u2019s ruling on this matter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the full Commission, contending that the SPFFC\u2019s proposed definition would enable a carrier that was relatively disinterested in a particular interline movement to participate in setting rates for that movement. According to the FTC, a carrier could submit a \u201cpaper tariff,\u201d containing merely a \u201chypothetical alternate route,\u201d to the Commission for approval. Once that tariff was approved, the carrier could participate in rate determinations relating to that route even if it were unreasonable or had never been used. Additionally, the FTC raised the possibility that carriers who were relatively disinterested in a particular movement, but nonetheless eligible to vote, could trade a vote on that movement for favorable votes on movements in which they more actively participated. As a solution, the FTC proposed an alternative definition to determine when a carrier can \u201cpracticably participate\u201d in an interline movement: whether the carrier currently participates in the movement or has participated in it within the preceding two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Convinced by the FTC\u2019s arguments, the full Commission agreed that the SPFFC\u2019s definition was too broad and adopted the FTC\u2019s definition with one modification not relevant here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 358 I.C.C. 696 (1978). To support its conclusion, the ICC relied on the rule of construction that antitrust exemption statutes must be construed narrowly,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concluding that \u201c[a] narrow construction of \u2018practicably participate\u2019 in this context favors competition and is, therefor, consonant with the objective sought by Congress in enacting the particular prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. Accordingly, it reversed the division\u2019s decision and terminated the division\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>im approval of the SPFFC agreement, subject to SPFFC\u2019s filing an amended agreement in conformity with the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The SPFFC petitioned the ICC for a reconsideration. Although the ICC modified its decision on a provision not at issue here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it affirmed its order in all respects relevant to the instant case. Southern Ports Foreign Freight Committee \u2014 Agreement (Aug. 29, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In its petition before this court, the SPFFC contends that we must deny enforcement to the Commission\u2019s order because it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, however, pertains only to our review of <em>factual </em>determinations made by a government agency, not to matters of statutory construction. In reviewing the latter, we merely look to see if the agency\u2019s construction of the statute is reasonable: \u201cIt is settled that courts should give great weight to <em>any reasonable construction </em>of a regulatory statute adopted by the agency charged with the enforcement of that statute.\u201d <em>Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 626-27, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1097, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971) (emphasis added). <em>Cf. Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965) (court owes \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the interpretation of the statute by the agency charged with its administration). In the instant case, it is clear beyond peradventure that the ICC, the agency charged with the enforcement of the RRRR Act, was engaged in interpreting the meaning of the term \u201cpracticably participate\u201d as it appears in that statute. Consequently, we review the Commission\u2019s order only to ascertain whether or not its interpretation of the phrase \u201cpracticably participate\u201d is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We are persuaded by the record that the Commission\u2019s construction of the statute is both reasonable and in harmony with the intent of Congress in passing the RRRR Act. The Commission\u2019s definition comports with the economic realities of railroad rate-making. Focusing as it does on <em>current </em>or <em>recent </em>participation in an interline movement, the Commission\u2019s definition effectuates the express legislative mandate that a railroad <em>actually </em>be able to participate in an interline movement before it is entitled to vote on rates affecting that movement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">The second primary restriction in section 5(B) provides that where a rate, fare, allowance or charge is proposed to be applicable to a particular joint line movement, carriers which could not <em>practically participate </em>in that movement would not be permitted to participate in the consideration of the proposal. <em>Only those railroads which could actually handle the movement of traffic under the rate as an origin, destination, or intermediate carrier could join in the rate bureau proceedings relating to that rate. </em>Railroads which could not <em>practically participate </em>in a movement under the rate from origin to destination would be excluded from any bureau proceedings relating to that interline rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">S.Rep., <em>supra </em>n. 2, at 55, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976 at p. 69 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The high degree of actual participation required by the Commission\u2019s definition is in sharp contrast to the lax standard embodied in the SPFFC\u2019s definition. Under the latter, a railroad need only file a tariff in order to participate. However, as the FTC points out in its brief, the \u201cinterconnecting nature of railroad rights-of-way permits virtually any railroad to construct a hypothetical route involving its own lines between any particular pair of origin and destination points.\u201d Thus, the SPFFC\u2019s definition would in effect permit any carrier who could <em>conceivably </em>handle a movement to participate in ratemaking relative to that movement. Given that Congress\u2019 primary purpose in passing the RRRR Act was to narrow the scope of the railroads\u2019 exemption from the operation of the antitrust laws, the SPFFC\u2019s interpretation renders the statutory provision at issue here completely ineffectual. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>SPFFC\u2019s definition leaves open an opportunity for collusive or other anticompetitive activities on the part of railroads that may be marginally, if at all, interested in a particular movement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The definition adopted by the Commission eliminates that opportunity to a considerable extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Finally, contrary to what the SPFFC contends, the Commission\u2019s definition of \u201cpracticably participate\u201d would <em>not </em>eliminate from ratemaking all carriers who use circuitous routes. If a carrier is using or has used a circuitous route for a particular movement within the preceding two years, it will be allowed to participate in the rate-making negotiations concerning that movement. The ICC formulation will eliminate only those carriers with a hypothetical or, at best, tangential interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Given all of these circumstances, we harbor no doubt that the definition adopted by the Commission was not only reasonable but wise. Accordingly, the order of the Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. <em>See, e. g., United States v.

A carrier or shipper files a proposed tariff with a rate bureau. The proposal is circulated to other members of the bureau, who vote on it. Once passed, the proposal is filed with the ICC. If approved by the Commission, the proposal establishes a rate for a specific route that every member railroad may charge. A member need not, however, participate in that rate; it may submit a different rate to the members of the bureau for approval. In this fashion, the rights of every bureau member are guaranteed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-16\">.

Concerned that the FTC\u2019s definition would eliminate collective consideration by member carriers of proposals covering new traffic (i. e., traffic that has not moved by rail within the past two years) not previously handled by the rail carriers, the Commission extended the definition of \u201cpracticably participate\u201d to permit those carriers who would handle the new traffic to vote on such proposals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b453-12\">. <em>See </em>Tidewater Coal Demurrage Agreement, 356 I.C.C. 66, 77-78 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">.
