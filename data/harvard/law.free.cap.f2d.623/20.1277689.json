Section 151 <em>et seq. </em>by coercively interrogating some of its employees concerning their union activities and sympathies and further found that the Company violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by refusing to rehire Ferrell Hensley and Freddy Johnson, by imposing more onerous working conditions upon Bill Scott, by discharging Leona Hensley and by discharging Betty Jo McClenda because of their union sympathies and activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-21\">The principal issue in the case is whether the Board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-22\">We have held that coercive interrogation of employees about their union sympathies or activities violates Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. <em>Jervis Corp. v. N. L. R. B., </em>387 F.2d 107, 111 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-23\">Where there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s inferences of unlawful motivation, it is not our province to discard the Board\u2019s choice between two conflicting views even though we might have arrived at a different conclusion if we were considering the matter de novo. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>We are of the opinion that the Board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence and is not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">It is therefore ordered that the order of the Board be and it is hereby enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
