The district court held the association to be a tax-exempt charity and granted the refund. The government appeals, contending that \u00a7 501(c)(3) does not extend to hospital laundry services like those involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The identical issues were recently before the Third Circuit in <em>HCSC-Laundry v. United States of America, </em>624 F.2d 428, (3rd Cir. 1980). There, as here, a group of charitable hospitals had formed a nonprofit corporation in order to effect economies of scale that could not be realized if each hospital were to install and staff its own laundry. There, as here, the laundry services were performed for the tax-exempt hospitals that had created the corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, as here, the district court held that because a charitable hospital could operate its own laundry without impairing its exemption under \u00a7 501(c)(3), it should be able to pool its laundry facilities (and its exemptions) with other hospitals and thus confer tax exemption upon the new entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">A group of charitable \u00a7 501(c)(3) hospitals may jointly create and own a tax-exempt entity under \u00a7 501(e)(1)(A) to perform certain functions: e. <em>g., </em>computer service, purchasing, warehousing, laboratory, printing, billing and collecting, and other services listed in \u00a7 501(e)(1)(A) of the Code. The issue is whether, under \u00a7 501(c)(3), the hospitals may create tax-exempt entities to perform services not listed in \u00a7 501(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">After a careful examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 501(e)(1)(A) and of established legal principles which we need not repeat here, the Third Circuit held that Congress had intentionally omitted laundry services from the list of commercial services for which charitable hospitals could form jointly-owned entities that would be tax-exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-21\">Whether the legislative decision to favor the commercial laundry industry by removing a tax advantage from competitors was a wise or equitable decision is obviously not a judicial question. On the only judicial question \u2014 the meaning of the tax law \u2014 we agree with the Third Circuit for the reasons stated in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-22\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-16\">. The taxpayer in the case at bar may not strictly qualify under \u00a7 501(e)(1)(B) because, at the time it was organized, it served a hospital that did not then qualify for exemption under \u00a7 501(c)(3). We need not reach this question, however, as the case turns on the meaning of \u00a7 501(e)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
