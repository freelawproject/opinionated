On October 16, 1979, they obtained a search warrant for an apartment in St. Louis, Missouri, from Missouri Circuit Judge Thomas McGuire. The following morning St. Louis Police Department detectives executed the search warrant in the company of Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent Walter Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The officers found Brinkley asleep in a bedroom on the apartment\u2019s second floor. Their search of that bedroom revealed two bags of cocaine,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one on the night table next to Brinkley\u2019s bed and a larger one under the mattress on which he had been sleeping. Elsewhere in the apartment they found and seized various items identified by Special Agent Miller as narcotics paraphernalia. The officers then placed Brinkley under arrest. Brinkley\u2019s defense at trial was that the cocaine did not belong to him and that he did not have dominion or control of the premises in which it was found.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Brinkley first contends that the affidavits on which Missouri Circuit Judge McGuire issued the search warrant fail the two-prong test of probable cause established in <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and that the district court should therefore have suppressed the items seized pursuant to the warrant. We disagree. The affidavits submitted to Judge McGuire by two St. Louis Police Department detectives establish the underlying circumstances of both the informant\u2019s belief that narcotics were in the apartment and the officers\u2019 belief in the informant\u2019s reliability. The affidavits disclose that the officers\u2019 informant supplied the information concerning the whereabouts of the narcotics on the basis of personal observation and that the informant had in the past supplied reliable information to the officers. Because the affidavits establish the basis for both the information supplied by the informant and the officers\u2019 belief in the informant\u2019s reliability, the district court correctly determined that the affidavits made out probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. <em>See id. </em>at 114-15, 84 S.Ct. at 1514; <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>566 F.2d 623, 625 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Brinkley finally contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence those items obtained by police in executing the search warrant. The gist of Brinkley\u2019s argument seems to be that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the seized items because the Government proved only an attenuated connection between Brinkley and the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">The argument lacks merit. The undisputed evidence disclosed that officers seized two bags of cocaine from a bedroom in which Brinkley slept and various narcotics paraphernalia from elsewhere in the apartment. These items were relevant to establish two elements of the offense, the controlled substance and intent to distribute. Hence, they were admissible. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Evid. 401, 402. See <em>generally, United States v. Jones, </em>543 F.2d 627, 629-30 (8th Cir. 1976) <em>(per </em>curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1051, 97 S.Ct. 763, 50 L.Ed.2d 767 (1977). The district court properly instructed the jury that in addition to these elements, it must find that Brinkley actually or constructively possessed the cocaine be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>yond a reasonable doubt. From the evidence before it, the jury could reasonably infer that Brinkley possessed the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We have carefully considered additional issues also raised by Brinkley on appeal. We find no merit in his contentions. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-15\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-16\">(a) Except as authorized by this subchap-ter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-17\">(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substancef.] Cocaine is a Schedule II controlled substance. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), Schedule 11(a)(4) (1976).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-27\">. The Honorable James H. Meredith, United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, imposed a 10-year sentence of imprisonment to be followed by a special parole term of five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">. Brinkley also contends that the district court erred in failing to declare a mistrial and in overruling his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case. We have carefully reviewed the record and find these contentions to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">. Harold Messier, a chemical analyst, testified that the substance contained in both bags was cocaine and that the cocaine found in the larger bag was 54 percent pure. Special Agent Miller testified that cocaine of that purity would be adulterated and then distributed rather than consumed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b594-14\">. In other words, Brinkley disputed the possession element of the offense charged, asserting that he neither actually nor constructively possessed the cocaine. <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>594 F.2d 1046, 1050 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
