Martin, was injured in an automobile accident at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky on August 2, 1973. The other vehicle was driven by Allen R. Lisenby, a minor and a citizen of California, and the vehicle was owned by the minor\u2019s grandfather, Nelson Stokes, who operated a garage in the Ft. Campbell area and was a citizen of Kentucky. The minor, with his mother, was visiting in the area at the time. Thereafter, Ms. Martin retained counsel at her home in Roanoke, Virginia, and counsel entered into settlement negotiations with adjusters for the liability insurance company whose policy covered the vehicle driven by Lisenby. Both Martin\u2019s attorney and the adjusters were under the mistaken impression that Kentucky, like Virginia, had a two-year applicable statute of limitations; in fact, the applicable Kentucky statute was one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">After somewhat more than a year had expired following the accident, offers had been made by the adjusters and rejected, and a lawsuit was contemplated, the adjusters and counsel for Martin discovered that Kentucky\u2019s statute of limitations was one year. Counsel for Martin thereupon, in March, 1975, filed a diversity action for her in the federal district court for the Western District of Virginia and summonses were directed to the United States Marshals at Los Angeles and Paducah, Kentucky, and Lisenby and Stokes were personally so served in their home districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Lisenby and Stokes then, through their attorney retained by the insurance company, filed motions to \u201cquash process . for the reason that service of process was had on this defendant outside of the territorial limits of the State of Virginia.\u201d While these motions were probably well taken (see Rule 4(f), Fed.R.Civ.P.), the district court denied them and, in the order denying these motions to quash process, the district court granted defendants\u2019 oral motion to transfer the case to the Western District of Kentucky.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This order did not state the ground for denying the motions to quash. It also did not state whether the transfer was for the convenience of the parties and the witnesses under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) or was a transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) because there was a legal impediment to proceeding in that forum, and, as will be seen, the nature of the transfer determines the law to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Following the transfer to Kentucky, Li-senby and Stokes filed a motion to dismiss the action asserting that it was barred by the one year Kentucky statute of limitations. In response to that motion, Martin contended that the two year Virginia statute of limitations was controlling. The district court, in granting the motion to dismiss, concluded that the Kentucky statute was applicable and that therefore the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>was barred by the one year statute of that state. Martin then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The parties agree that a Virginia state court would, labeling its statute of limitations as \u201cprocedural\u201d law, apply its statute to this claim even though it grew out of an accident that occurred in Kentucky. It appears that the federal district court in Virginia should and would have likewise applied the Virginia statute; this is true because the federal district court should and would, for <em>Erie </em>purposes, have characterized this choice of law principle of Virginia as being \u201csubstantive\u201d law. <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); <em>Sampson v. Channell, </em>110 F.2d 754 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>310 U.S. 650, 60 S.Ct. 1099, 84 L.Ed. 1415 (1940). Thus, as the parties agree, the question is whether the Kentucky federal district court should apply the Virginia statute of limitations as the Virginia federal district court would have or should apply the Kentucky statute as it would have had this action initially been filed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In <em>Van Dusen v. Barrack, </em>376 U.S. 612, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964), the Supreme Court resolved at least in part the issue of what state law should be applied following the transfer of a diversity action from a federal district court in one state to a federal district court in another state. The Court held that where a defendant seeks and obtains a \u201cconvenience\u201d transfer of venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), \u201cthe transferee district court must be obligated to apply the state law that would have been applied if there had been no change of venue.\u201d <em>Van Dusen, </em>however, did not specifically decide whether the state law to be applied following a transfer should be affected by which party sought the transfer. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Choice of Law in Federal Court After Transfer of Venue, </em>63 Cornell Law Review 149 (1977), 1 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>10.145[4.-5] at 1608-1614. We conclude that it should make no difference whether the transfer was made on motion of plaintiff or defendant and that, as stated, the choice of law should depend upon the motive of the transfer, that is, whether the transfer was pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) or \u00a7 1406(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The purposes of the two principal transfer provisions are significantly different. Section 1404(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applies in general to those actions brought in a permissible but inconvenient forum. A district court may, \u201c[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,\u201d transfer the action to a more convenient forum. In contrast, \u00a7 1406(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applies in general to those actions brought in an impermissible forum. Rather than dismiss the action when the issue is raised, a district court may, in its discretion, transfer the action to a permissible forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">In reaching its conclusion in <em>Van Dusen </em>that, in a \u201cconvenience\u201d transfer, the law of the transferor court is to be applied, the Supreme Court relied primarily on the underlying purposes of \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">The legislative history of \u00a7 1404(a) certainly does not justify the rather startling conclusion that one might \u201cget a change of law as a bonus for a change of venue.\u201d Indeed, an interpretation accepting such a rule would go far to frustrate the remedial purposes of \u00a7 1404(a). If a change of law were in the offing, the parties might well regard the section primarily as a forum-shopping instrument. And, more importantly, courts would at least be reluctant to grant transfers, despite considerations of convenience, if to do so might conceivably prejudice the claim of a plaintiff who had initially se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>lected a permissible forum. We believe, therefore, that both the history and purposes of \u00a7 1404(a) indicate that it should be regarded as a federal judicial housekeeping measure, dealing with the placement of litigation in the federal courts and generally intended, on the basis of convenience and fairness, simply to authorize a change of courtrooms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">(Footnotes omitted.) <em>Van Dusen v. Barrack, supra </em>at 636-637, 84 S.Ct. at 819. Since a transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) represents only a change in courtrooms for the convenience of the litigants and witnesses, it should not affect the state law governing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The purposes of \u00a7 1406(a), however, suggest just the opposite choice of law. A transfer under \u00a7 1406(a) is based not on the inconvenience of the transferor forum but on the impropriety of that forum. If the state law of the forum in which the action was originally commenced is applied following a \u00a7 1406(a) transfer, the plaintiff could benefit from having brought the action in an impermissible forum. Plaintiffs would thereby be encouraged to file their actions in the federal district court where the state law was the most advantageous, regardless of whether that district court was a proper forum. Such forum-shopping was what the Supreme Court sought to eliminate by its decision in <em>Van Dusen. </em>Accordingly, we conclude, as have the majority of authorities that have considered this question, that following a transfer under \u00a7 1406(a), the transferee district court should apply its own state law rather than the state law of the transferor district court. <em>See Geehan v. Monahan, </em>382 F.2d 111 (7th Cir. 1967); <em>Broome v. Antlers\u2019 Hunting Club, </em>448 F.Supp. 121 (M.D.Pa.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, 595 </em>F.2d 921 (3rd Cir. 1979); Note, <em>Choice of Law in Federal Court After Transfer of Venue, supra </em>at 160; 1 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra </em>at 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">While some authorities, including one in this court, have emphasized the importance of the party seeking the transfer, <em>see Carson v. U-Haul Co., </em>434 F.2d 916 (6th Cir. 1970);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Parham v. Edwards, </em>346 F.Supp. 968 (S.D.Ga.1972), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>470 F.2d 1000 (5th Cir. 1973); 15 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 3846, we believe that the more appropriate emphasis is on the nature of the transfer. If, for example, the choice of law is based on which party requested the transfer, then the danger of improper forum-shopping would still remain in those situations where the plaintiff had brought his action in a permissible forum but had selected one with less favorable state law. The plaintiff could correct that error simply by moving to transfer the action under \u00a7 1404(a). <em>See </em>Note, <em>Choice of Law in Federal Court After Transfer of Venue, supra. </em>Section 1404(a) in such a situation would, contrary to <em>Van Dusen, </em>represent more than just a change of courtrooms. Moreover, such a result would be inconsistent with the underlying policies of <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). As stated in <em>Van Dusen v. Barrack, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 638-639, 84 S.Ct. at 820,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">we should ensure that the \u201caccident\u201d of federal diversity jurisdiction does not enable a party to utilize a transfer to achieve a result in federal court which could not have been achieved in the courts of the State where the action was filed. This purpose would be defeated in cases such as the present if nonresident defendants, properly subjected to suit in the transferor State (Pennsylvania), could invoke \u00a7 1404(a) to gain the benefits of the laws of another jurisdiction (Massachusetts). What Erie and the cases fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>lowing it have sought was an identity or uniformity between federal and state courts, and the fact that in most instances this could be achieved by directing federal courts to apply the laws of the States \u201cin which they sit\u201d should not obscure that, in applying the same reasoning to \u00a7 1404(a), the critical identity to be maintained is between the federal district court which decides the case and the courts of the State in which the action was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">By determining the choice of law solely on the basis of the nature of the transfer, a result is reached that is consistent both with <em>Van Dusen </em>and the <em>Erie </em>doctrine. Once a plaintiff has exercised his choice of forum by selecting a permissible forum, the state law of that forum should govern the action, regardless of the wisdom of the plaintiff\u2019s selection. Thus, no matter who seeks to transfer the action to a more convenient forum under \u00a7 1404(a), the state law of the forum in which the action was originally commenced remains controlling. In this manner, the outcome in the transferee district court will be the same as the outcome would have been in the state courts of the state where the action was originally brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the choice of law is dependent on the nature of the transfer. If an action is transferred under \u00a7 1404(a), the state law of the transferor court should be applied. In contrast, if an action is transferred under \u00a7 1406(a), the state law of the transferee district court should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">While the law to be applied following a transfer is determined by the nature of that transfer, the nature of that transfer is often difficult to ascertain. The Courts of Appeal have construed \u00a7 1404(a) and \u00a7 1406(a) in conflicting manners, particularly in the context of the transfer of an action brought in a district court where venue was proper but personal jurisdiction over the defendant was absent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">In <em>Goldlawr v. Heiman, </em>369 U.S. 463, 466-467, 82 S.Ct. 913, 916, 8 L.Ed.2d 39 (1962), the Supreme Court held that a district court in which venue was improper could transfer an action under \u00a7 1406(a) even though it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">The language of \u00a7 1406(a) is amply broad enough to authorize the transfer of cases, however wrong the plaintiff may have been in filing his case as to venue, whether the court in which it was filed had personal jurisdiction over the defendants or not. The section is thus in accord with the general purpose which has prompted many of the procedural changes of the past few years \u2014 that of removing whatever obstacles may impede an expeditious and orderly adjudication of cases and controversies on their merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apv\">Justice Harlan dissented from <em>Goldlawr </em>on the basis that the opinion permitted the transfer of actions \u201cwhere both venue and jurisdiction are lacking in the district where the action was commenced, while neglecting to provide any comparable alleviate measures for the plaintiff who selects a district where venue is proper but where personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained.\u201d <em>Goldlawr v. Heiman, supra </em>at 468, 82 S.Ct. at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Since <em>Goldlawr, </em>the Courts of Appeal have uniformly held that an action brought in a district court where venue is proper but where personal jurisdiction is lacking may be transferred to a proper forum. The bases for allowing such transfer, however, have been far from uniform. Some courts have applied the rationale of <em>Goldlawr </em>to \u00a7 1404(a) holding that a transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) is proper even though the district court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>United States v. Berkowitz, </em>328 F.2d 358 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 821, 85 S.Ct. 42, 13 L.Ed.2d 32 (1964); <em>Koehring Company v. Hyde Construction </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>Company, </em>324 F.2d 295 (5th Cir. 1963). <em>See also </em>15 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3827. Other courts, rather than relying on \u00a7 1404(a), have interpreted \u00a7 1406(a) broadly to provide for the transfer of an action where there exists any obstacle to adjudication such as improper venue or lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>Mayo Clinic v. Kaiser, </em>383 F.2d 653 (8th Cir. 1967); <em>Dubin v. United States, </em>380 F.2d 813 (5th Cir. 1967). One Circuit, declining to rely either on \u00a7 1404(a) or on \u00a7 1406(a), has adopted a third position. It has held that an action brought in a district court where venue \u25a0 is proper but personal jurisdiction is absent may be transferred when in the interest of justice. <em>Corke </em>v. <em>Sameiet M.S. Song of Norway, </em>572 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">These three conflicting bases for permitting a transfer reflect the difficulty of construing either \u00a7 1404(a) or \u00a7 1406(a) so as to cover the transfer of an action brought in a district court where venue is proper but where personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 1404(a) does not seem to provide for transfer in such a situation in that \u00a7 1404(a), to the extent that it is comparable to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, presumes the existence of two permissible forums.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But neither does \u00a7 1406(a) appear to provide for such a transfer in that it is defined in terms of the transfer of an action \u201claying venue in the wrong division or district.\u201d Thus, whereas the reliance on \u00a7 1404(a) necessitates an overly simplified construction of that provision, the reliance on \u00a7 1406(a) necessitates an overly broad interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In confronting this issue, this Circuit has adopted the broad construction of \u00a7 1406(a). In <em>Taylor v. Love, </em>415 F.2d 1118, 1120 (6th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1023, 90 S.Ct. 1257, 25 L.Ed.2d 533 (1970), Judge Edwards, quoting from <em>Dubin v. United States, supra </em>at 815, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201cLooking to the language of \u00a7 1406, the statute is couched in terms of \u2018laying venue in the wrong division or district.\u2019 The statute does not refer to \u2018wrong\u2019 venue, but rather to venue laid in a \u2018wrong division or district.\u2019 We conclude that a district is \u2018wrong\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1406 whenever there exists an \u2018obstacle [to] ... an expeditious and orderly adjudication\u2019 on the merits. Inability to perfect service of process on a defendant in an otherwise correct venue is such an obstacle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The law in this Circuit, therefore, is that \u00a7 1406(a) provides the basis for any transfer made for the purpose of avoiding an obstacle to adjudication on the merits in the district court where the action was originally brought. That defect may be either improper venue or lack of personal jurisdiction. This construction of \u00a7 1406(a) necessarily limits the application of \u00a7 1404(a) to the transfer of actions commenced in a district court where both personal jurisdiction and venue are proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Accordingly, the law to be applied following the transfer of an action depends on the nature of that transfer. The nature of the transfer depends in turn on whether the transferor district court was one where venue was proper and where personal jurisdiction over the defendant could be obtained. Unfortunately, in this case, the defendants\u2019 motion to transfer was oral and the record does not indicate the basis of the transfer to Kentucky. Nor does the record show whether personal jurisdiction could be obtained over the defendants though such appears unlikely.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>It appears that the only basis for such jurisdiction would have been Virginia\u2019s broad long-arm statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But that statute can be relied upon, of course, only when a defendant has sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy due process requirements. <em>See Willis v. Semmes, Bowen &amp; Semmes, </em>441 F.Supp. 1235 (E.D.Va.1977). The record in this case does not affirmatively reflect whether or not the defendants have such minimum contacts. The district judge in the Western District of Kentucky correctly determined that if the district court in Virginia could not obtain personal jurisdiction of defendants, then the Kentucky statute of limitations should be applied; the problem is that the record was not complete enough for the district judge to determine that jurisdiction could not be obtained under Virginia\u2019s long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Accordingly, we believe that this case should be remanded to the district court in Kentucky for a determination of whether the defendants had sufficient contacts with Virginia to permit service of process through the Virginia long-arm statute. If the district court could have obtained personal jurisdiction by means of that statute, then the transfer could only have been pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a). Virginia law would therefore be applicable. If the district court could not have obtained personal jurisdiction, however, then the transfer could only have been made pursuant to \u00a7 1406(a). In such a situation, Kentucky law would be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The plaintiff asserts, as a separate basis for reversal, that the defendants are estopped, under both Kentucky law and Virginia law, from raising the statute of limitations as a defense to this action. As a basis for such estoppel, the plaintiff relies on the fact that neither the insurance adjuster for the defendants nor the attorney for the plaintiff realized during settlement negotiations that Kentucky had a one year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s argument lacks merit. If Virginia law is applied in this case, then the issue of estoppel need not be decided since this action was filed within the applicable statute of limitations for that state. If Kentucky law is applied, then the ignorance of both parties as to the length of the statute of limitations would not be sufficient under Kentucky law to estop the defendants from asserting the statute of limitations, particularly when the plaintiff is being represented by an attorney. <em>See Miller v. Thacker, </em>481 S.W.2d 19 (Ky.1972). There is no claim of fraud on the part of the insurance adjusters; indeed, the record shows that they made a settlement offer <em>after </em>Kentucky\u2019s one year statute expired and before the action was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is vacated. The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-16\">. Ft.
