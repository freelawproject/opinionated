Appellants are union members who sought to compel appellee Sabine Independent Seamen\u2019s Association (SISA) to produce its financial records for inspection under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(c) and also to reimburse union members for a dues increase that violated the provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(aX3)(A). The district court granted limited inspection under \u00a7 431(c) but held that the \u00a7 411(a) claim failed because appellants had waived their rights by failing to revoke a check-off authorization for dues collection. Attorneys\u2019 fees requested by appellants were also denied. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-18\">I. Inspection Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b409-19\">Appellants sought to inspect SISA financial records to investigate suspected double payments to union officials. Their initial request did not specify the dates of the documents they sought, but a subsequent request and motion, directed to the court, stated that appellants sought financial records dating from 1970. The district court denied this request and ordered inspection only of financial records dating from January 1,1975 to the date of trial, December 5, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-20\">The inspection order was justified. All that is required is that appellants show \u201cjust cause\u201d for the inspection, which need be only a suspicion that would put a reasonable union member to further inquiry. <em>Fruit and Vegetable Packers and Warehousemen Local 760 v. Morley, </em>378 F.2d 738, 744 (9th Cir. 1967). Wrongdoing need not be shown by a preponderance of the evidence, and the possibility of double-dipping found by the district court constitutes just cause. That finding is not clearly erroneous, and the order of inspection from 1975 to the date of trial was justified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-21\">However, the district court refused to order inspection of pre-1975 documents on the ground that the pre-trial order had limited inspection to documents dating from January 1,1975. This was error. The pre-trial order related only to discovery, and the documents were sought pursuant to that order for the purpose of demonstrating that just cause existed for a broader order of inspection under \u00a7 431(c). To limit relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>under \u00a7 431(c) to already discovered documents erodes the remedial purposes of the statute, which operates as a check on union wrongdoing. Since appellants have demonstrated just cause for inspection by their showing of possible double payments, they were entitled to inspect SISA\u2019s financial records from 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">II. Dues Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In 1975 SISA raised its dues from $4.00 to $10.00 per month. The election that approved this increase was not accomplished by secret ballot, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3)(A). The increase was ratified in 1977 by an election allegedly conforming to \u00a7 411(a). The district court held that appellants had waived their right to challenge the 1975 dues increase by their failure to revoke a dues check-off authorization. SISA does not deny that the 1975 election was invalid but urges that appellants waived their right to challenge it, or, alternatively, that appellants were guilty of laches in asserting their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">It is undisputed that the 1975 dues increase was invalid. The sole question is whether appellants waived their right to challenge the increase. This court has held that failure to provide a secret ballot invalidates a subsequent check-off. <em>Steib v. New Orleans Clerks and Checkers, Local No. 1497, </em>436 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1971). The check-off in this case was therefore invalid and failure to revoke it could not serve to waive appellants\u2019 claims. <em>See also Local No. 2, International Brotherhood of Telephone Workers v. International Brotherhood of Telephone Workers, </em>362 F.2d 891 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 947, 87 S.Ct. 321, 17 L.Ed.2d 226 (1966). This is but one aspect of the general rule that rights under \u00a7 411 cannot be waived. <em>Tincher v. Piasecki, </em>520 F.2d 851 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>International Brotherhood of Boilermakers v. Rafferty, </em>348 F.2d 307 (9th Cir. 1965). Nor could the increase be ratified retroactively by the 1977 election. <em>Telephone Workers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The district court should have held that appellants stated a prima facie case under \u00a7 411(a) and granted reimbursement for the dues collected between 1975 and 1977 unless it found laches. The court should also have determined the validity of the 1977 election in order to determine the appropriate scope of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">III. Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">On the inspection claim, appellants sought an order permitting inspection and attorneys\u2019 fees. We have already stated that appellants were entitled to the inspection order. Attorneys\u2019 fees are permitted under \u00a7 431(c) in the discretion of the district court. The district court denied attorneys\u2019 fees, and appellee urges that this did not constitute an abuse of discretion. However, the LMRDA, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is a remedial statute. <em>International Brotherhood of Boilermakers v. Braswell, </em>388 F.2d 193, 200-01 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 U.S. 935, 88 S.Ct. 1848, 20 L.Ed.2d 854 (1968). Thus the rationale of <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968), applies, and attorneys\u2019 fees should be awarded absent special circumstances rendering such an award unjust. <em>See, e. g., International Oceanic Enterprises, Inc. v. Menton, </em>614 F.2d 502 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>606 F.2d 635 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">On the dues claim, appellants sought reimbursement for themselves and all union members, injunctive relief against continued collection of the dues, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Appellants are entitled to reimbursement for themselves in the amount of the invalid increase for at least the period 1975-1977, unless the district court finds the claim barred by laches.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, as the suit was not brought as a class action, and no other union members were joined as plaintiffs, relief should be limited to reimbursement of the individual named plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tiffs. The class action is intended as a device for litigating the claims of individuals other than named plaintiffs, and failure to resort to it precludes the award of monetary relief to the hypothetical class. <em>See In re General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litigation, </em>594 F.2d 1106, 1128 n.33 (7th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 870, 100 S.Ct. 146, 62 L.Ed.2d 95 (1979); Advisory Committee Notes to F.R.Civ.P. 23; <em>cf. Thomas v. Weinberger, </em>384 F.Supp. 540, 543 (S.D.N.Y.1974) (comparison with injunctive or declaratory relief).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The propriety of injunctive relief depends on the validity of the 1977 election and should be determined by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">There is no provision for attorneys\u2019 fees for violations of \u00a7 411. However, courts have interpreted \u00a7 412, which provides \u201cappropriate relief\u201d for \u00a7 411 violations, to permit attorneys\u2019 fees under either of two circumstances: if the union has acted in bad faith or if the suit confers a substantial benefit on union members. <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 8-9, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 1947-1948, 36 L.Ed.2d 702, 709-10 (1973); <em>McDonald v. Oliver, </em>525 F.2d 1217 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 61, 50 L.Ed.2d 77 (1976). In this case neither element has been satisfied. There has been no showing that the union acted in bad faith. In view of the nominal sums and small number of union members involved, we hold that the suit did not confer a substantial benefit on union members.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court was therefore not required to award attorneys\u2019 fees for the \u00a7 411 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-16\">. The district court also held that SISA had waived its right to have the first opportunity to determine just cause, and abort the suit, by its failure to respond to appellants\u2019 initial request. As we hold that just cause did exist, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. If the district court finds on remand that the 1977 election was also invalid appellants are entitled to reimbursement for the period subsequent to 1977 as well, for as long as they have paid the illegal dues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">. The class action device was potentially available in this case. <em>See Connor v. Highway Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers, </em>68 F.R.D. 370 (E.D. Pa.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. Numbers alone will not preclude an award of attorneys\u2019 fees where the interest plaintiffs seek to vindicate is of paramount importance and union members\u2019 rights would most likely have continued to be infringed without the action taken by plaintiffs. <em>See Hall v. Cole, supra </em>(right of free speech). No such likelihood exists here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
