LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b368-21\">This is an appeal from a denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court held that the appellant had failed to satisfy the \u201cexhaustion of state remedies\u201d requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and had failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). We disagree with both of these conclusions and therefore will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-23\">The appellant, Robert Bisaccia, was convicted in a New Jersey state court along with three co-defendants of conspiracy, entering with intent to steal, and larceny of goods of value in excess of $500. During the trial, the prosecution presented the testimony of a co-conspirator, Joseph Cicala, who testified about his own plea of guilty to a charge arising out of the alleged conspiracy. Over defense counsel objections, the trial judge permitted the introduction of this testimony as to the guilty plea without requiring the prosecutor to explain its purpose and without cautioning the jury that evidence of this nature could not be used as substantive proof of the existence of a conspiracy. In his summation, the prosecutor additionally sought to impress the jury with the significance of the guilty plea by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-24\">[A] young man named Joseph Cicala <em>pleaded guilty </em>to conspiring to break, en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ter and commit larceny inside the Bruno home. They [the defendants] said it never happened, you see. Mr. Cicala <em>pleaded guilty </em>to something that didn\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, isn\u2019t your intelligence being insulted by an argument like that? I mean, aren\u2019t these defendants talking down to you as if you were a bunch of five year old children?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\"><em>Quoted in State v. Stefanelli, </em>153 N.J.Super. 452, 458, 380 A.2d 276, 279 (1977) (emphasis added). Bisaccia appealed his conviction, along with his co-defendants, to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. In his brief, Bisaccia alleged numerous grounds for reversal, among them the introduction of the Cicala guilty plea without limiting instruction and the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent comments. He argued that the cumulative effect of these errors impermis-sibly prejudiced his case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">An accused is not entitled to a trial perfectly free from all error, but he is entitled as a <em>constitutional </em>right to a fair trial and it is respectfully urged that the manner in which the court below conducted this hearing did not begin to render the defendants a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Brief to the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division at 37, <em>reprinted in </em>App., at 44a (emphasis added) (hereafter Appellate Division Brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The Appellate Division agreed with the appellant's attack on the unrestricted admission of the guilty plea, finding that \u201c[i]t is fairly apparent that the testimony of Cicala with respect to the guilty plea was used for the purpose of impressing the jurors of the existence of the conspiracy.\u201d 153 N.J.Super. at 459, 380 A.2d at 279. On the basis of the \u201cprejudicial error inherent in the admission of such testimony,\u201d the Appellate Division concluded that the trial court \u201c \u2018deprived the defendant of a very substantial protection to which he was entitled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 380 A.2d at 279, 280, <em>quoting United States v. Toner, </em>173 F.2d 140, 142 (3d Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The New Jersey Supreme Court then granted certification on the issue of the guilty plea testimony. The court addressed the appellant\u2019s constitutional argument in terms of the Sixth Amendment confrontation right and, because of the availability of cross-examination, found no violation. While finding that the trial court erred in failing to issue cautionary instructions to the jury regarding the testimony, the court held nevertheless that the error \u201cdid not have a clear capacity to produce an unjust result\u201d and was harmless. <em>State v. Stefa-nelli, </em>78 N.J. 418, 437, 396 A.2d 1105, 1114 (1979). The question of harmless error was answered in terms of New Jersey evidentia-ry law. Bisaccia\u2019s conviction was reinstated. His habeas corpus petition to the district court was denied and this appeal followed. The district court based its denial of the habeas corpus petition on the grounds that the appellant failed to exhaust his remedies in the state court system and that the error alleged did not violate the United States Constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">The requirement, embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), that state remedies must be completely exhausted before federal courts will grant habeas corpus relief is well settled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ex Parte Royall, </em>117 U.S. 241, 253, 6 S.Ct. 734, 741, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886). The United States Supreme Court has more recently articulated a standard for determining what constitutes sufficient exhaustion. In <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 428, 83 S.Ct. 822, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), the Supreme Court held that a \u201cfederal claim must be fairly presented to state courts.\u201d In determining what constitutes a fair presentation, the Supreme Court has required that the claim presented to the state court be the \u201csubstantial equivalent\u201d of the claim asserted in a federal habeas corpus petition. <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 278, 92 S.Ct. 509, 513, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971). The Court in <em>Picard </em>carefully noted that \u201c[w]e do not imply that respondent could have raised the [constitutional] claim only by citing \u2018book and verse on the federal constitution\u2019. . . .We simply hold that the substance of a federal habeas corpus claim must first be presented to the state courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A determination of whether the substance of the appellant\u2019s claim was advanced in the state proceedings requires \u201ca searching scrutiny by the federal habeas court of the points that were raised in the state tribunals, in order to ensure that the state system was granted a fair opportunity to confront arguments that are propounded to the federal habeas courts.\u201d <em>Zicarelli v. Gray, </em>543 F.2d 466, 472 (3d Cir. 1976) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The district court found Bisaccia\u2019s presentation of issues to the New Jersey courts dissimilar to those presented in his petition for federal habeas corpus. It held that he failed to present his constitutional arguments to the state courts and thus the state courts did not have a fair opportunity to consider the constitutional implications of the trial court\u2019s error. The district court opinion notes that the only \u201cconstitutional\u201d reference made by appellant before the New Jersey courts was the \u201ccryptic\u201d argument that \u201che is entitled as a constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d Appellate Division Brief, App., at 44a. The appellee further points out that not even the <em>federal </em>constitution was specified by the appellant. Moreover, it is suggested that this vague reference addressed not only the issue of the use of the guilty plea but also the alleged bias of the trial judge and the violation of the rules of pretrial discovery. In support of its contention that the appellant\u2019s claim was not fairly presented, the appellee relies on <em>Wilson v. Fogg, </em>571 F.2d 91, 94 (2d Cir. 1978), which held that the failure to raise a constitutional violation altogether, but with a citation to cases addressing a particular issue in constitutional terms, \u201chardly amounts to providing the state courts with the \u2018fair opportunity\u2019 to weigh the constitutional claim required by <em>Picard </em>Although these arguments are not totally without merit, we nevertheless conclude that the appellant\u2019s broadly alleged constitutional argument, together with the repeated assertion that he was denied a fair trial, is enough to satisfy the exhaustion requirement. In <em>Zicarelli v. Gray, </em>this court noted that in order to determine whether the \u201csame claim\u201d or the \u201csubsequent equivalent\u201d of the claim has been previously presented to the state courts, it is necessary to ask whether the \u201cmethod of analysis\u201d asserted in the federal courts was readily available to the state court. 543 F.2d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In reversing the appellant\u2019s conviction, the Appellate Division, relying on <em>United States v. Toner, </em>173 F.2d 140 (3d Cir. 1949), explicitly concluded that Bisaccia\u2019s trial was so wrought with unfairness as to require setting aside the verdict of the jury. \u201cBecause of the error . . . relating to the testimony of Cicala with respect to his guilty plea to the conspiracy charge, we find defendants to have been prejudiced to the extent that they were denied a fair trial.\u201d 153 N.J.Super. at 460, 380 A.2d at 280. While the Appellate Division did not cite to the Fourteenth Amendment in its reversal, its \u201cmethod of analysis\u201d was consistent and synonymous with the classic findings required for Fourteenth Amendment due process violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">It is fairly apparent that the testimony of Cicala with respect to the guilty plea was used for the purpose of impressing the jurors of the existence of the conspiracy. After all, an individual would not plead guilty to a conspiracy that did not exist. <em>We believe even the inference to be drawn from this testimony created prejudice which had to affect the outcome of the trial. </em>In addition, no limiting instruction was given by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>judge so that the jurors were permitted to use Cicala\u2019s testimony as they pleased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">153 N.J.Super. at 459, 380 A.2d at 279 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Although the New Jersey Supreme Court majority apparently believed there to be no such unfairness, it nevertheless pursued a method of analysis consistent with Fourteenth Amendment due process determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">[A] guilty plea of one person as such cannot be considered satisfactory or worthy evidence of the guilt of others even though similarly circumstanced and is properly excludable under the axiom that a defendant on trial is entitled \u201cto have his guilt or innocence determined by the evidence presented against him, not by what has happened with regard to a criminal prosecution against someone else.\u201d <em>United States v. Toner, supra </em>at 142; <em>Babb v. United States, supra </em>[218 F.2d 538] at 542 [5th Cir.]. Hence we conclude, as did the court below, that Cicala\u2019s guilty plea was inadmissible as substantive evidence of the guilt of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">78 N.J. at 433, 396 A.2d at 1112. Although it followed this analysis, the court concluded that \u201cthe error did not have the clear capacity to produce an unjust result and that it had a minimal effect on the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 396 A.2d at 1114. The dissent by Justice Pashman unequivocally states that the evidentiary admission violated fundamental fairness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">It is <em>patently unfair </em>to subject a defendant to criminal sanctions merely because his alleged co-conspirator has not elected to stand trial. In effect, the guilty plea evidence cannot be introduced because its relevance is far outweighed by its potential prejudicial impact upon the jurors\u2019 deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 441, 396 A.2d at 1116 (emphasis added). Justice Pashman\u2019s statement that the trial was \u201cpatently unfair\u201d is a description similar to the traditional characterizations used to assess purported Fourteenth Amendment due process violations. As Justice Frankfurter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">Due process of law, as a historic and generative principle, precludes defining, and thereby confining, these standards of conduct more precisely than to say that convictions cannot be brought about by methods that offend \u201ca sense of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfN\"><em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 173, 72 S.Ct. 205, 210, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). A trial which is \u201cpatently unfair\u201d surely offends the \u201csense of justice\u201d that Justice Frankfurter described as an element of due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Particularly in view of Justice Pashman\u2019s finding that the admission of the evidence was \u201cpatently unfair,\u201d thereby casting his dissent in constitutional language, this is not a case, as with <em>Wilson </em>or <em>Picard, </em>where the state courts had no indication of constitutional infirmity. Nor does <em>Zicarelli </em>undercut the appellant\u2019s position. In that case, a state prisoner alleged that his constitutional rights were violated when he was tried by a jury selected from residents of a county other than the one in which the alleged crimes were committed and that he was denied his right to trial by a jury comprising a representative cross-section of the locale where the crimes took place. This court concluded that the defendant had failed to exhaust his state remedies by merely transmitting a letter to the New Jersey Supreme Court highlighting a California case which discussed the cross-section issue and by making further reference to the decision at oral argument. Although Zicarelli\u2019s state court briefs addressed the venue issue, they ignored the cross-section claim. Thus, Judge Adams, writing for the court, concluded that \u201c[s]ueh an arrangement hardly seems to conform to the Supreme Court criteria of \u2018fairly presenting\u2019 an issue. Nor does it appear to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>comity rationale that undergirds the exhaustion rule.\u201d 543 F.2d at 474-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Because the substance of the appellant\u2019s state claim is virtually indistinguishable from the due process allegation now before the federal court, and because the method of analysis is indistinct, the <em>Picard </em>test for exhaustion of state remedies has been met. This conclusion is especially appropriate because of the necessarily vague nature of a due process allegation. Failure to invoke the Due Process Clause more specifically should not therefore stand in the appellant\u2019s path to habeas relief, especially since the state courts understood and considered the \u201csubstantial equivalent\u201d of the appellant\u2019s claims before this court and the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">It is a well-established principle that evidentiary errors of state courts are not considered to be of constitutional proportion, cognizable in federal habeas corpus proceedings, unless the error deprives a defendant of fundamental fairness in his criminal trial. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642-43, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974); <em>United States ex rel. Perry v. Mulligan, </em>544 F.2d 674, 678 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 972, 97 S.Ct. 1659, 52 L.Ed.2d 365 (1977). We next consider whether use of the co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea rises to the level of constitutional proportions. If so, the appellant will have satisfied the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">It is well settled in this circuit that use of a co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea as substantive proof of a defendant\u2019s complicity in a conspiracy without cautionary instruction is not admissible as evidence. <em>United States v. Toner, </em>173 F.2d 140, 142 (3d Cir. 1949). However, as the district court noted, the cases address this issue in evidentiary rather than constitutional terms. Indeed, the appellee urges that the error merely amounted to \u201cevidentiary irrelevance.\u201d We nonetheless disagree. The use of such evidence is sufficiently unfair so as to raise the spectre of unconstitutionality for purposes of habeas corpus relief. We ground this conclusion on the concept of fundamental fairness inherently required in every criminal trial. Judge Goodrich\u2019s eloquent statement in <em>United States v. Toner </em>is our starting point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">From the common sense point of view a plea of guilty by an alleged fellow conspirator is highly relevant upon the question of the guilt of another alleged conspirator. If A\u2019s admission that he conspired with B is believed, it is pretty hard to avoid the conclusion that B must have conspired with A. This is one of the cases, therefore, where evidence logically probative is to be excluded because of some countervailing policy. There are many such instances in the law. See 4 Wigmore Evidence \u00a7 1171 <em>et seq. </em>(3d Ed. 1940)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">The foundation of the countervailing policy is the right of every defendant to stand or fall with the proof of the charge made against him, not against somebody else. Acquittal of an alleged fellow conspirator is not evidence for a man being tried for conspiracy. So, likewise, conviction of an alleged fellow conspirator after a trial is not admissible as against one now being charged. The defendant had a right to have his guilt or innocence determined by the evidence presented against him, not by what has happened with regard to a criminal prosecution against someone else. We think that the charge given upon this point was contrary to that rule and inadvertently, of course, deprived the defendant of a very substantial protection to which he was entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ate\">173 F.2d at 142. (footnotes omitted). Judge Goodrich\u2019s rationale in <em>Toner </em>is bottomed as much on concepts of constitutional fairness as on concepts of \u201cevidentiary\u201d fairness. For the underlying purpose ultimately is to assure a criminal defendant that his guilt or innocence will be \u201cdetermined by the evidence presented against him, not by what has happened with regard to a criminal prosecution against someone else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The inherent unfairness and likely prejudice of such evidence in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>challenges our concept of due process. The Seventh Circuit, in addressing the practice of introducing evidence of other, related crimes, has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">When it must be said that the probative value of such evidence, though relevant, is greatly outweighed by the prejudice to the accused from its admission, then use of such evidence by a state may rise to the posture of fundamental fairness and due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>United States ex rel. Bibbs v. Twomey, </em>506 F.2d 1220, 1223 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>quoting United States ex rel. Durso v. Pate, </em>426 F.2d 1083, 1086 (7th Cir. 1970). Under the circumstances here, the admission of the co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the failure of the trial judge to give cautionary instructions to the jury about this evidence and the prosecutor\u2019s comments on this evidence so exceeded the tolerable level of ordinary trial error as to amount to a denial of constitutional due process. As such, we hold that the appellant has satisfied the requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Since the appellant has exhausted all available remedies and since the error in this case may be viewed as a violation of the appellant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process right, this case must be remanded for a determination of whether it was harmless error. In order for constitutional error to be found harmless, it must be \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). The relevant question then is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Applying the <em>Chapman-Fahy </em>test to the facts in this case, a district court might well conclude that use of the Cicala guilty plea as substantive evidence of Bisaccia\u2019s guilt without limiting instructions to the jury, coupled with inflammatory prosecutorial remarks, might have contributed in some meaningful sense to the conviction. The district court found that even if the appellant had exhausted his state remedies, he failed \u201cto demonstrate a constitutional violation by the trial court.\u201d Because we concluded above that a constitutional violation was demonstrated, the question remains whether under <em>Chapman </em>the error here was harmless. The case will be remanded for the limited purpose of making a finding on this latter issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus will be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">. The relevant statutory provisions are 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) &amp; (b) and provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5m\">(a) The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\">(b) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, or that there is either an absence of available State corrective process or the existence of circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rights of the prisoner.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\">. As the late Chief Justice Warren wrote in dissent in <em>Spencer v. State of Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 570, 87 S.Ct. 648, 657, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">[T]he criteria for decision in procedural due process cases are necessarily drawn from the traditional jurisprudential attitudes of our legal system rather than from a relatively specific constitutional command.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b373-13\">SEITZ, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AtJx\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">I agree with the majority that appellant\u2019s rights under the federal Constitution were denied when the state used a co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea as evidence of his guilt. Therefore, I concur in the decision to reverse the order of the district court and to remand for application of the harmless error standard of <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). I write separately because I believe that appellant was denied his sixth amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. I would avoid invoking the due process standard of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">The Supreme Court applied the confrontation clause to restrict a prosecutor\u2019s use of third-party convictions and guilty pleas in <em>Kirby v. United States, </em>174 U.S. 47, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899). In a prosecution for receipt of property stolen from the United States, the government\u2019s proof of the fact of theft from the United States consisted of guilty pleas of three of the thieves and the conviction after trial of a fourth. The Court reversed the receiver\u2019s conviction, holding that he had not been \u201cwithin the meaning of the Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 19 S.Ct. at 579.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">It is important to note that the confrontation clause violation in <em>Kirby </em>did not result from the government\u2019s failure to confront the defendant with the persons who had pled guilty or had been convicted. The Court saw the effect of the government\u2019s use of third-party conviction records and guilty pleas as allowing the government to use its witnesses to prove facts incriminating to a defendant while not allowing the defendant an opportunity to challenge, impeach, and cross-examine those witnesses. In the absence of a restriction, the Court reasoned that the government might use its witnesses to establish facts necessary to convict a third person, either by presenting the witnesses at trial or by inducing a guilty plea, and might then offer the third person\u2019s conviction in its prosecution of the defendant as proof of the facts essential to sustain the earlier conviction. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R. Evid. 803(22) (final judgment of conviction entered after trial or guilty plea admissible to prove facts essential to conviction).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At no point in this process would the government confront the defendant with the witnesses that it assembled in its prosecution of the third person. <em>See generally Kirby, </em>174 U.S. at 55, 19 S.Ct. at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In appellant\u2019s trial the state attempted to prove the existence of a conspiracy involving appellant by introducing a co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea. In so doing, the state violated appellant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause, as construed in <em>Kirby. </em>The error was not avoided by the opportunity that appellant had to cross-examine the co-conspirator at trial. In <em>Kirby, </em>the Court addressed a defendant\u2019s right to confront not the third person who pleaded guilty but the witnesses that the government would have presented in a trial of the third person. We can have no assurance that appellant had an opportunity to confront those witnesses at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In this sense, confrontation in the circumstances of <em>Kirby </em>differs from the confrontation in the circumstances of <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). In <em>Bruton </em>the Court prohibited the use of a codefendant\u2019s confession in a joint trial. There the Court addressed the right of a defendant to confront and cross-examine his confessing co-defendant, a right which can be preserved when the codefendant testifies at trial and subjects himself to cross-examination. <em>See Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The appellant has presented his claim of a deprivation of confrontation rights to this court and to the district court in terms of a violation of <em>United States v. Toner, </em>173 F.2d 140 (3d Cir. 1949). In <em>Toner, </em>this court ruled that the guilty plea of a co-conspirator was not admissible to prove the guilt of a criminal defendant. The opinion does not mention the confrontation clause specifically, and the court might well have rested its ruling on different or additional grounds, including nonconstitutional grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Nonetheless, the ruling in <em>Toner </em>was <em>mandated </em>by the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the confrontation clause in <em>Kirby. </em>Therefore, I read <em>Toner </em>as reflecting the requirements of the confrontation clause and recognize that appellant has stated a sufficient claim of a violation of his confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Because the majority and I rely on different constitutional claims, I must consider also whether appellant fairly presented the substance of his federal claim to the Supreme Court of New Jersey and thereby satisfied the requirement of exhaustion of state remedies. <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 278, 92 S.Ct. 509, 513, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971); <em>Zicarelli v. Gray, </em>543 F.2d 466, 470-75 (3d Cir. 1976). The brief that appellant filed in the Supreme Court of New Jersey argues explicitly that the state\u2019s violation of <em>Toner </em>deprived him of rights under the sixth amendment. Moreover, the opinion of the New Jersey court discusses and rejects the suggestion that the rule in <em>Toner </em>reflects the requirements of the confrontation clause. <em>State v. Stefanelli, </em>78 N.J. 418, 396 A.2d 1105, 1111-12 (1979). It is true that appellant did not present the New Jersey court with a citation of <em>Kirby </em>or with an argument incorporating <em>Kirby\u2019s </em>particular application of the confrontation clause. However, because that application of the confrontation clause derives from a reported opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, it is a method of analysis readily available to the state court. Its specific citation was not necessary to satisfy the exhaustion requirement. <em>Zicarelli v. Gray, supra </em>at 472. I conclude that appellant has satisfied the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The majority reads <em>Toner </em>as reflecting the requirements of the due process clause because its restriction on the government\u2019s use of third-party guilty pleas is an essential element of fundamental fairness. <em>Don-nelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642-43, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). Review of state convictions under a standard of fundamental fairness allows the federal court to ensure that state criminal defendants do not suffer from trial errors that are inconsistent with the concept of justice implicit in the due process clause but are not prohibited by specific provisions of the Bill of Rights. The fundamental fairness standard is necessarily very general in its terms and not greatly restricted in its application by specific precepts and precedents. A court should not employ this standard when it can base a finding of constitutional error on a specific provision of the Constitution. In this case, the court\u2019s judgment can rest on a specific provision of the Bill of Rights and on a Supreme Court application of that provision to the particular circumstances of this case. Invocation of the fundamental fairness standard of the due process clause is unnecessary and best avoided.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. The statute at issue in <em>Kirby </em>provided that the conviction of the principal felons for theft of property from the United States was conclusive proof of the fact of theft in a subsequent prosecution of a receiver of the property. Act of March 3, 1875, ch. 144, \u00a7 2, 18 Stat. 479 (1879). The district court instructed the jury differently, charging them that the guilty pleas and conviction constituted <em>prima facie </em>proof. <em>See </em>174 U.S. at 50-51, 19 S.Ct. at 575. The Supreme Court ruled that both the statutory standard of conclusive proof and the district court\u2019s modification violated the confrontation clause: \u201cThe fundamental error in the trial below was to admit in evidence the record of the conviction of the principal felons as competent proof for any purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 19 S.Ct. at 579.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\">. This rule of admissibility does not apply when a third-party conviction- is \u201coffered by the Government in a criminal prosecution for purposes other than impeachment.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(22). The purpose of this exception is to avoid a conflict with the right of confrontation construed in <em>Kirby. </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(22) (Advisory Committee\u2019s Note).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\">. The opinion does address the same general concern addressed in <em>Kirby: </em>the use of third-party guilty pleas to prove facts against a defendant allows the government to rely on the establishment of facts in a proceeding in which the defendant did not participate. The court concluded, \u201cThe defendant had a right to have his guilt or innocence determined by the evidence presented against him, not by what has happened with regard to a criminal prosecution against someone else.\" <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
