We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">The facts presented to the trial court show that a bank employee was taken from her home at gun point, blindfolded, forced into a car, and held overnight. Meanwhile, her abductor called the bank manager and demanded that ransom be left at a drop site. Although the manager complied, the money was not picked up by the abductor because he detected that the site was under surveillance. Subsequently, the employee was released unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">Hackett was arrested after the last ransom call was traced to his residence. He was indicted in counts I and II for extortion with the use of a handgun. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (the Hobbs Act). In counts III-V, he was indicted for attempting to rob a federal bank by force during the course of which he assaulted a person and used a handgun to force a person to accompany him without her consent. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and (e). Counts I and II were later dismissed on double jeopardy grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The case was tried to a judge without a jury or witnesses. At Hackett\u2019s request, the evidence before the court consisted of a stipulation by Hackett and the government stating how potential witnesses would have testified if they had been called. At trial Hackett was fully informed of his right to a trial by jury and his right to call witnesses. Hackett, who is well educated, voluntarily waived these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Hackett contends that the trial judge could not properly find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because his submission of evidence conflicted with parts of the government\u2019s case. Because of this conflict, he asserts that the court could not convict him without observing the demean- or of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Hackett\u2019s contention is without merit. The evidence summarized by the government presented clear proof of Hackett\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The bank employee\u2019s statement implicating Hackett was amply corroborated. Therefore, the trial court could properly find Hackett guilty without observing the demeanor of the witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Hackett next contends that even if all of the facts contained in the government\u2019s submission are true, they do not show a violation of \u00a7 2113 because there was no attempt to take money \u201cfrom the person or presence of another\u201d and Hackett did not enter the bank as required by \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Several other courts of appeals have found violation of \u00a7 2113 under substantially similar circumstances. <em>See, e. g., Brinkley v. United States, </em>560 F.2d 871 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Beck, </em>511 F.2d 997 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Marx, </em>485 F.2d 1179 (10th Cir. 1973). <em>But see United States v. Culbert, </em>548 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir. 1977) (by concession), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>435 U.S. 371, 372 n.l, 98 S.Ct. 1112, 1113 n.l, 55 L.Ed.2d 349 (1978), <em>opinion on remand, </em>581 F.2d 799 (9th Cir. 1978). Relying on the precedent of <em>Marx, Brinkley, </em>and <em>Beck, </em>we conclude that property is taken from a bank in the presence of another when bank officers are induced by threats of violence to leave the bank\u2019s money at a pre-arranged drop site.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Hackett\u2019s complaint that he was prejudiced by the bail set by the district court is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">. Because Hackett can only be sentenced under one statutory scheme, the government\u2019s appeal from this ruling is rendered moot by our decision upholding Hackett\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 2113. With respect to counts III-V, the district court\u2019s order provided that if the convictions were affirmed, it would set aside the sentences on counts III and IV, leaving only the sentence imposed on count V, which charged a violation of \u00a7 2113(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. If the government\u2019s proof had depended on the uncorroborated testimony of witnesses, submission of the evidence by stipulation would have presented grave difficulties. We recommend therefore that this procedure not be followed in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
