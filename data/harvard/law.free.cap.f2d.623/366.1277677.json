The action was filed against Peoples Bank of Indianola for alleged racial discrimination presumably based upon the administrative claim filed with it by Emanuel Walls and for relief for all persons \u201cadversely affected by the unlawful employment practices.\u201d On January 9, 1978 the District Court granted the Bank\u2019s motion to limit the issues to the claim of Walls\u2019 charge of discrimination. <em>EEOC v. Peoples Bank of Indianola, </em>No. GC-119-K (N.D.Miss. Jan. 9, 1978). The Court, viewing the complaint as a class action, also struck the class allegations under <em>EEOC v. D.H. Holmes, </em>556 F.2d 787 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 962, 98 S.Ct. 3082, 57 L.Ed.2d 1129 (1978), for failure to comply with F.R.Civ.P. 23. <em>Id. </em>The EEOC moved for reconsideration of the denial of class certification which was denied. <em>EEOC v. Peoples Bank of In-dianola, </em>No. GC-119-K (N.D.Miss. Feb. 2, 1978). Subsequently, on February 23, 1978, the parties stipulated for dismissal without prejudice of the individual claim of Walls. <em>EEOC v. Peoples Bank of Indianola, </em>No. GC-119-K (N.D.Miss. Feb. 23, 1978). The EEOC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">We hold that the stipulated dismissal related solely to the individual claim of Walls, leaving only the question of the propriety of the District Court\u2019s order rejecting the class-wide action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 12, 1980, the Supreme Court decided <em>General Telephone Co. of Northwest, Inc. v. </em>EEOC,- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 1698, 64 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980), which repudiated <em>D.H. Holmes. </em>Since the disposal of the class feature is the only issue left in the case and the Supreme Court held that the approach in <em>D.H. Holmes </em>requiring compliance with F.R.Civ.P. 23 is no longer good law, we reverse and remand for action consistent with <em>General Telephone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\">. As this appeal ^ concerns only the District Court\u2019s action regarding the class action feature, we need not decide the appealability of the voluntary stipulation of a dismissal without prejudice under <em>LeCompte v. Mr. Chip, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 601 (5th Cir. 1976) and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
