THOMPSON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">This is an appeal from an order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellees on the appellant\u2019s claim that, as an employee of a CETA-funded program, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-992 (Comprehensive Employment &amp; Training Act of 1973), he enjoyed a \u201cproperty\u201d interest in being afforded notice and the opportunity to be heard before being discharged. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 98.26 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Recent cases are uniform in their rejection of the contention that the CETA requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 98.26, gives rise to a constitutionally protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest. <em>Gooley </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>590 F.2d 744, 746 (8th Cir. 1979), <em>aff\u2019g, </em>452 F.Supp. 399 (E.D.Mo. 1978); <em>Hark v. Dragon, </em>611 F.2d 11 (2nd Cir. 1979), <em>aff\u2019g, </em>477 F.Supp. 308 (D.Vt.); <em>Maloney v. Sheehan, </em>453 F.Supp. 1131, 1141 (D.Conn. 1978). The reasoning underlying these decisions is sound and is adopted by this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-15\">\u201cPlaintiff bases his claim of a property interest on the CETA regulation which required written notice and an opportunity to respond to charges before termination. He argues that the regulation gave him a right to continued employment unless and until these procedures were followed. This argument, however, loses sight of \u2018the decisive distinction between procedure and substance.\u2019 <em>Shirck v. Thomas, </em>486 F.2d 691, 692 (7th Cir. 1973). A law establishes a property interest in employment if it restricts the grounds on which an employee may be discharged. For example, if discharge can only be for \u2018just cause,\u2019 an employee has a right to continued employment until there is just cause to dismiss him. See <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 151-52, 94 S.Ct. 1633 [1642-43], 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974) (opinion of Rehnquist, J.). But the CETA regulation allowed an employer to discharge an employee for any reason or for no reason at all. A guarantee of procedural fairness does not establish a property interest. <em>Lake Michigan College Federation of Teachers v. Lake Michigan Community College, </em>518 F.2d 1091, 1095-96 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 427 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 3189, 49 L.Ed.2d 1197 (1976); <em>Suckle v. Madison General Hospital, </em>499 F.2d 1364, 1366 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>Shirck v. Thomas, </em>supra; <em>Weathers v. West Yuma County School District R-J-I, </em>387 F.Supp. 522, 558 (D.Colo. 1974), aff\u2019d, 530 F.2d 1335 (10th Cir. 1976).\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-16\"><em>Maloney v. Sheehan, </em>453 F.Supp. at 1141. To confer on CETA participants an ongoing right to continued CETA employment would be fundamentally at odds with the overall scheme of the Act, which looks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the training of unemployed individuals with an eye towards their eventual assimilation into the unsubsidized labor force. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 94.1(a). In 1978, Congress amended CETA to limit the benefits any individual may receive under CETA to a maximum of eighteen months of public service employment in any given five-year period. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(h).</p>\n<p id=\"am9-dedup-0\">Whatever administrative remedies the appellant may have (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 818(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 98.40 et seq.; see <em>Serghini v. City of Richmond, </em>426 F.Supp. 326 (E.D.Va. 1977)), he has failed to demonstrate the existence of a constitutionally protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest, deprivation of which would entitle him to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
