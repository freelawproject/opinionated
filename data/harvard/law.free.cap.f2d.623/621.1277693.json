D. Christianson. The contract did not reserve to the County any royalty interest in mineral rights. Upon performance of the contract, however, Dawson County conveyed the land to Christianson by a quit claim deed which reserved a <em>QlA </em>percent royalty interest in all oil, gas and minerals. In 1951, Christianson brought a quiet title action and acquired a confirmation deed which made no reservation of a royalty interest to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-26\">Plaintiff Lamar Hunt, lessee of the oil and gas rights to the property in question, brought this interpleader action to determine the validity of the County\u2019s royalty interest, naming as defendants Dawson County and the mineral owners who acquired title through Christianson. The United States District Court for the District of Montana found for Christianson\u2019s successors in interest on the ground that the County was bound by the result in Chris-tianson\u2019s 1951 confirmation deed action. Dawson County appeals, contending that it was not a party to the confirmation deed action and that its royalty interest in min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>eral rights was therefore not determined in that proceeding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Under the Montana confirmation deed statute in effect in 1951, Christianson was required to name \u201call persons having any interest in said land, whose interest shall appear of record in the office of the county clerk . . . together with the county treasurer . . . .\u201d Mont. Rev. Codes Ann. \u00a7 84-4145 (enacted by 1945 Mont. Laws, Ch. 43, \u00a7 2; repealed by 1977 Mont. Laws, Ch. 126, \u00a7 15). The provision for naming the county treasurer was intended to give the court jurisdiction to order the treasurer to execute a confirmation deed, not to give him or her authority to represent the County\u2019s property interest. The treasurer must be named even if the County has no ownership interest in the contested land.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Mont. Rev. Codes Ann. \u00a7 16-803, which was in effect in 1951, provides that a county \u201cmust be . designated [by its corporate name] in all actions and proceedings touching its corporate . . . property . .\u201d Christianson was required to name the County by its corporate name to make it a party to the confirmation deed action. Since he failed to do so, the court had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of Dawson County\u2019s royalty interest. To the extent the quiet title judgment and confirmation deed purported to determine the County\u2019s interest, they may be collaterally attacked. <em>Bentley v.
