FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b467-27\">Plaintiff-Appellant Hans Jensen brought suit against his former employer, Gulf Oil Corporation and Gulf Oil Refining and Marketing Company, a division of Gulf Oil Corporation (Gulf), alleging that Gulf violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-34 (1976) by forcing him to retire because of his age. From a summary judgment entered in Gulf\u2019s favor, Jensen appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>Appellant, a Gulf employee for twenty-nine years, was involuntarily retired on January 31, 1977, at the age of fifty-one, pursuant to the terms of an employee benefit plan that has been in effect at Gulf continuously since 1944. Under that plan, the normal retirement age is sixty-five, but after an employee has accumulated seventy-five points, computed on the basis of age plus years of service with Gulf, he can be retired at any time either upon his own request or upon application of any of the Gulf companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The purpose of the ADEA is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621(b) (1976). Under the ADEA it is unlawful for an employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQI\">to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 623(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">At the time of Jensen\u2019s retirement, \u00a7 623(f)(2) of the ADEA contained the following language permitting some involuntary retirements prior to age sixty-five:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap9\">(f) It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">(2) to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter, except that no such employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to hire any individual . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-13\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 623(f)(2) (amended 1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1978, that subsection was amended to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">(f) It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">(2) to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter, except that no such employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to hire any individual, and no such seniority system or employee benefit plan shall require or permit the involuntary retirement of any individual specified by section 631(a) of this title because of the age of such individual .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-16\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 623(f)(2) (Supp. II 1978).

R.Civ.P. 56(c). The first issue presented in this appeal is the retroactive application of the 1978 amendment to \u00a7 623(f)(2). If that amendment governs in this case, Gulf\u2019s action was concededly unlawful. If the amendment does not apply retroactively, the question remains whether Gulf\u2019s action was unlawful under the unamended version of \u00a7 623(f)(2) in effect at the time of Jensen\u2019s retirement. Answering both questions in the negative, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>III. RETROACTIVITY OF AMENDMENT TO \u00a7 623(f)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Since the amendment of the ADEA in 1978, several courts have had occasion to consider whether the amendment to \u00a7 623(f) (2) should be applied to involuntary retirements occurring before April 6, 1978, the date of enactment of the Act amending the ADEA. <em>See, e. g., Sikora v. American Can Co., </em>22 FEP 638 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>Marshall v. Delaware River &amp; Bay Authority, </em>471 F.Supp. 886 (D.Del.1979); <em>Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>461 F.Supp. 362 (D.Md.1978); <em>Marshall v. Atlantic Container Line, </em>18 FEP 1167 (S.D.N.Y.1978); <em>Davis v. Boy Scouts of America, </em>457 F.Supp. 665 (D.N.J.1978). Of those cases, we are aware of only one holding that the amendment to \u00a7 623(f)(2) should be applied to an involuntary retirement occurring before the ADEA was amended, <em>Davis, </em>457 F.Supp. 665.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Wagner v. Sperry Univac, Division of Sperry Rand Corp., </em>458 F.Supp. 505, 511 n.3 (E.D.Pa.1978) (1978 amendments to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d), lowering some procedural hurdles with which plaintiffs must comply under the ADEA, said to be applicable only to actions brought after April 6, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Applying the principle set forth in <em>United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>5 U.S. 103 (1 Cranch), 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and elaborated upon in <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), that \u201ca court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary,\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>416 U.S. at 711, 94 S.Ct. at 2016, we conclude that the amended version of \u00a7 623(f)(2) does not apply to retirements occurring before the date the amendment was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">A. Statute and Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Turning first to the statute, we do not find the statement that the amendment prohibiting involuntary retirement before age sixty-five shall take effect upon enactment dispositive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Turning next to the legislative history, Appellant stresses that one of the purposes of the amendment was to clarify Congress\u2019 original intent. <em>See, e. g., </em>H.R.Conf. Rep.No. 950, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 7-8, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 504, 528-29. In order to reach the result that involuntary retirement before age sixty-five would not be excused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u00a7 623(f)(2) as worded when enacted in 1967, unless the reasons for the retirement were other than age, clarification was needed since courts construing that section had held to the contrary. <em>See Zinger v. Blanchette, </em>549 F.2d 901 (3d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1008, 98 S.Ct. 717, 54 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978); <em>Brennan v. Taft Broadcasting Co., </em>500 F.2d 212 (5th Cir. 1974). The Fourth Circuit, however, had held that a pre-age-sixty-five involuntary retirement under a retirement plan, meeting the <em>Brennan </em>tests (requiring that it exist and pay substantial benefits in order to be bona fide and that it predate the enactment of the ADEA in order not to be a subterfuge), is nevertheless proscribed by the ADEA unless the employer can demonstrate that the early retirement provision \u201cha[s] some economic or business purpose other than arbitrary age discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>McMann v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 217, 221 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>434 U.S. 192, 98 S.Ct. 444, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977). The Supreme Court reversed that decision during the pendency of the 1978 amendments to the ADEA and held that no such purpose was required to justify bona fide pre-existing plans in order to satisfy the subterfuge language of \u00a7 623(f)(2). <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. McMann, </em>434 U.S. 192, 98 S.Ct. 444, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977). Justice Marshall, dissenting in that case, was of the opinion that the Committee reports concerning the 1978 amendments \u201cmake plain that, properly understood, the existing Act already prohibits involuntary retirement, and that the amendment is only a clarification necessitated by court decisions misconstruing congressional intent. H.R.Rep.No. 95-527, pp. 5-6 (1977); <em>id., </em>at 27 (additional views of Rep. Weiss, quoting statement of Sen. Javits); S.Rep.No. 95-493, pp. 9-10 (1977).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 98 S.Ct. at 458. (Marshall, J., dissenting). In response to this argument, however, the majority noted that \u201c[legislative observations 10 years after passage of the Act are in no sense part of the legislative history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200 n.7, 98 S.Ct. at 449 n. 7. <em>See also Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans, </em>441 U.S. 750, 758, 99 S.Ct. 2066, 2072-2073, 60 L.Ed.2d 609 (1979) (quoting McMann); <em>Rogers v. Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>611 F.2d 1074, 1080 (5th Cir. 1980) (\u201cWhat happened after a statute was enacted may be history and it may come from members of the Congress, but it is not part of the legislative history of the original enactment.\u201d); <em>Holliday </em>v. <em>Ketchum, MacLeod &amp; Grove, Inc., </em>584 F.2d 1221, 1229 (3d Cir. 1978) (\u201cCertainly the intent of the 1978 amenders of the ADEA cannot be said to represent or reflect the intent of the 1967 Congress: there is no necessary relation back.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Furthermore, the clearest statement in the legislative history on the question of retroactivity of the amendment supports the view that it should not be applied retroactively. During Senate debates the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">Mr. Randolph: I should like to ask the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Williams) whether this bill retroactively covers a forced retirement at, say, age 60 or 62 prior to the effective date of this bill where the individual so retired is eligible for, and actually receives, a pension under a pension plan which has been qualified with the Internal Revenue Service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">Mr. Williams: The bill is not retroactive. The question of mandatory retirements prior to the effective date of this bill will be determined by the courts\u2019 interpretation of existing law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">123 Cong.Rec.S. 17304 (daily ed. Oct. 19, 1977). Other passages may be found in the legislative history which could be construed to support either position, but we do not deem them particularly helpful. We are of the opinion that neither the statute itself nor the legislative history warrants the conclusion that the 1978 amendment to \u00a7 623(f)(2) should be applied retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">B. Manifest Injustice</p>\n<p id=\"apn-dedup-0\">We turn next to determination of whether application of the amendment to \u00a7 623(f)(2) to involuntary retirement occurring prior to the date of enactment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>result in manifest injustice. Under <em>Bradley, </em>we must consider \u201c(a) the nature and identity of the parties, (b) the nature of their rights, and (c) the nature of the impact of the change in law upon those rights.\u201d 416 U.S. at 717, 94 S.Ct. at 2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Noting that these factors overlap considerably, especially (b) and (c), we turn to examination of the first factor. In <em>Bradley, </em>the Supreme Court held \u00a7 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, authorizing federal courts to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party in a school desegregation case, applicable to attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered prior to the statute\u2019s enactment, where the propriety of the fee award was pending resolution on appeal when the statute became law. 416 U.S. at 710, 94 S.Ct. at 2015. In <em>Bradley </em>the defendant was the School Board, a publicly funded governmental entity, with litigation resources far exceeding those of the plaintiffs, a class of children whose constitutional right to a nondiscriminatory education was furthered by the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 718, 94 S.Ct. at 2019. The Court stated that \u201cschool desegregation litigation is of a kind different from \u2018mere private cases between individuals,\u2019 \u201d and found that the statute at issue had to do with a \u201c \u2018great national concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. at </em>718-19, 94 S.Ct. at 2019 (quoting <em>Schooner Peggy). </em>Thus, the nature and identity of the parties weighed in favor of the Court\u2019s holding the statute applicable in the case before it. In an action such as this one, however, between private employers and their employees, it is important that such private employers be able to order their affairs to comport with current, reasonable interpretations of existing law. It is this need for an acceptable standard of compliance that distinguishes the present case from cases such as <em>Bradley </em>and tends to militate against retroactive application of the statute, despite the conceded fact that age discrimination is an issue of great national concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We next consider the nature of the rights affected by the change in the law sought to be applied retroactively; that is, whether the rights are substantive and whether they are matured or unconditional. <em>Bradley, </em>416 U.S. at 720-21, 94 S.Ct. at 2020-2021. We also consider the related question of the impact of the change in law upon those rights. The latter concern \u201cstems from the possibility that new and unanticipated obligations may be imposed upon a party without notice or an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As was recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">[CJourts have characterized defendants\u2019 rights in terms of whether they could expect that they had a right to engage in the now proscribed activity, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinds County School Board, </em>[560 F.2d 619, 622 (5th Cir. 1977)], or whether they would have \u201cordered their conduct differently if they had known the new statute was going to apply\u201d to that activity. <em>King v. Greenblatt, </em>[560 F.2d 1024, 1025-26 n.2 (1st Cir. 1977)]; <em>see Bradley, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 720-21, 94 S.Ct. 2006 [2020-2021],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\"><em>Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>461 F.Supp. at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Application of the 1978 amendment in this case would deprive Gulf of substantive contractual rights upon which it had a right to rely under a retirement plan which Jensen concedes is bona fide and not \u201cin and of itself\u201d a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the ADEA. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7. <em>See Sikora, </em>22 FEP at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Jensen disputes Gulf\u2019s good faith reliance on the validity of its action since <em>McMann </em>was not decided by the Supreme Court until after Gulf involuntarily retired him and the \u201cCircuit Court opinion in effect when Gulf acted held such mandatory plans invalid.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14. Appellant apparently overlooks <em>Brennan v. Taft Broadcasting Co., </em>which was approved by the Court in <em>McMann </em>and was the law in this Circuit at the time Gulf acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">An interpretive bulletin, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 860.-10 (1979), issued by the Department of Labor soon after enactment of the original statute reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajf-dedup-0\">(a) . Thus, the Act authorizes involuntary retirement irrespective of age, provided that such retirement is pursuant to the terms of a retirement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>pension plan meeting the requirements of section 4(f)(2). The fact that an employer may decide to permit certain employees to continue working beyond the age stipulated in the formal retirement program does not, in and of itself, render an otherwise bona fide plan invalid insofar, as the exception provided in section 4(f)(2) is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">(b) This exception does not apply to the involuntary retirement before 65 of employees who are not participants in the employer\u2019s retirement or pension program. It should be noted that section 5 of the Act directs the Secretary of Labor to undertake an appropriate study of institutional and other arrangements giving rise to involuntary retirement, and report his findings and any appropriate legislative recommendations to the President and to Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Secretaries of Labor since that time have revised the Department\u2019s position. In \"a 1975 report to Congress, Secretary Brennan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">[Retirements [before 65] are unlawful unless the mandatory retirement provision: (1) is contained in a bona fide pension or retirement plan, (2) is required by the terms of the plan and is not optional, and (3) is essential to the plan\u2019s economic survival or to some other legitimate pur<em>pose </em>\u2014 i. e., is not in the plan for the sole urpose [sic] of moving out older workers, which purpose has now been made unlawful by the ADEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Dept, of Labor Ann. Rep. on Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 17 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">In <em>McMann </em>the Court concluded that the plan at issue was mandatory and thus did not address the mandatory/optional distinction or the effect of the conflicting agency interpretations. 434 U.S. at 197 n.4, 98 S.Ct. at 447 n.4. In discussing these inconsistent interpretations, the court in <em>Zinger </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">In adopting this stance, [in the 1975 Report] the Secretary ignored the obvious and important distinction implicit in his previous bulletin between discharge without pay and retirement on a pension. Moreover, the Secretary\u2019s latter day position is not only contrary to that taken by his predecessor contemporaneously with the consideration and passage of the Act, but also to the views of the Congressional committees which declined that proposal when it was forthrightly presented to them. Thus, rather than proposing an amendment to Congress, as Congress had instructed, the Secretary seeks to change the Act by court decision or administrative fiat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">549 F.2d at 908 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">Jensen asserts that Gulf could not have relied in good faith on the validity of its action since \u201cthe only authoritative interpretation of the section at issue, as it applies to involuntary <em>discretionary </em>retirements, in effect when Gulf terminated Plaintiff was the ruling issued by the Department of Labor in 1975.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14. The statute itself does not except from exemption otherwise qualified plans pursuant to which involuntary retirement is at the employer\u2019s option nor does it require that there be reasons other than age for involuntary early retirement. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Zinger, </em>549 F.2d at 908. Furthermore, courts may decline to follow administrative guidelines when they are inconsistent with earlier agency interpretations. <em>See General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 142, 97 S.Ct. 401, 411, 50 L.Ed.2d 44 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We are of the opinion that Gulf\u2019s reliance on the validity of its action was reasonable in spite of the existence of the 1975 report. In <em>Sikora, </em>the plaintiffs were retired in September 1975 and January 1976 and the Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">[A]t that time the defendant had an interpretive ruling of the Secretary of Labor and a court of appeals opinion sustaining the position that the ADEA permitted involuntary retirement before age 65. Plaintiffs at that juncture therefore had no firmly established right to continue in employment until they reached the age of 65. On the other hand, much as we sympathize with plaintiffs\u2019 position, the defendant had the contractual option to retire its employees as permitted by the plan. To that extent, the rights and obligations of the company \u2014 and of the plaintiffs as well \u2014 had been fixed and in place in 1975 and 1976 when they retired. In such circumstances, <em>post-Bradley </em>cases have declined to apply new law to pending eases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">22 FEP at 643 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">We conclude that application of the amended version of \u00a7 623(f)(2) to Gulf\u2019s conduct in this case would deprive Gulf of matured, substantive rights in contravention of Gulf\u2019s reasonable expectation that its conduct would be valid. We agree with the district court that application of the amendment in this case would result in manifest injustice, that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ase-dedup-0\">would penalize good faith reliance upon statutory law, and would impose hardship not only upon Gulf but upon the entire business community in obligating them to reinstate and reimburse retired individuals who could reasonably have been thought to be lawfully retired pursuant to bona fide retirement plans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\"><em>Jensen v. Gulf Oil Refining &amp; Marketing Co., </em>No. H-78-99 at 5 (S.D.Tex., filed Feb. 12, 1979). Accordingly, we hold that the 1978 amendment to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2) should not be applied retroactively to involuntary retirements occurring before April 6,1978, the effective date of the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">IV. LAWFULNESS OF GULF\u2019S CONDUCT UNDER UNAMENDED VERSION OF \u00a7 623(f)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Finally, we turn to the remaining question whether Gulf\u2019s action was unlawful under the unamended version of \u00a7 623(f)(2) in effect at the time of Jensen\u2019s retirement. That subsection, quoted above, makes lawful involuntary retirement pursuant to a bona fide pension plan that is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the ADEA. A retirement plan is bona fide if it is genuine and pays substantial benefits. <em>See, e. g., Marshall v. Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>575 F.2d 763, 766 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Brennan v. Taft Broadcasting Co., </em>500 F.2d 212, 217 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>McKinley v. Bendix Corp., </em>420 F.Supp. 1001, 1003 (W.D.Mo. 1976). Since Gulf\u2019s plan has been in effect continuously since its establishment in 1944, it cannot be a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the ADEA, passed twenty-three years later. <em>See, e. g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. McMann, </em>434 U.S. 192, 203, 98 S.Ct. 444, 450, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977); <em>Brennan v. Taft Broadcasting Co., </em>500 F.2d at 215. In <em>McMann, </em>the Court rejected any <em>\u201cper se </em>rule requiring an employer to show an economic or business purpose in order to satisfy the subterfuge language of the Act.\u201d 434 U.S. at 203, 98 S.Ct. at 450 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">Jensen concedes that the plan is bona fide and not, in and of itself, a subterfuge. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7. Jensen argues, however, that although facially qualified, the plan may be applied to certain individuals in such a way as to constitute a subterfuge. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Appellant argues that under the Gulf plan at issue the discretion afforded the employer in deciding whether to exercise its option to force an employee to retire early could result, and in Jensen\u2019s case did result, in the plan\u2019s being applied in a manner violative of the ADEA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>We disagree. Although there is some conflict in the cases, several courts have upheld involuntary early retirements under plans permitting the employee to be retired after he reaches a certain age at the option of the employer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., Marshall v.

As we have noted, the Supreme Court did not reach the issue in <em>McMann </em>since it concluded that the plan there in question called for mandatory retirement at age sixty. 434 U.S. at 197 n.4, 98 S.Ct. at 447 n.4. We follow the weight of authority in holding that under the unamended version of \u00a7 623(f)(2), Gulf\u2019s action in involuntarily retiring Jensen pursuant to the terms of its plan, which was bona fide and not a subterfuge, was not unlawful, despite the discretion afforded Gulf.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\">. See <em>also Renaudin v.

Subsection (3) of \u00a7 623(f) provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employee to be discharged or otherwise disciplined for good cause. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(3) (1976). Although Gulf raised \u00a7 623(f)(3) in addition to \u00a7 623(f)(2) as a defense, it is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. In <em>Davis </em>the court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Initially, it appeared that the plaintiff was seeking a retroactive application of the amendment. Upon reflection, however, it appears that what is being suggested is that I apply the law which is currently in effect' when I make my decision. While the final authority as to the meaning of any federal law is the United States Supreme Court, a decision of that Court is subject to change both by the Court itself or by Congress. Here the Congress has seen fit to change the interpretation of the ADEA given by the Supreme Court, <em>see United Airlines, Inc. v. McMann, </em>434 U.S. 192, 98 S.Ct. 444, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977), to comport with what it says was its original intent. This change, in the state of the law, is analagous to a reversal by the Supreme Court of an earlier decision in that the inferior federal courts become bound to apply the law as revised, not as it was sometime earlier. Thus, the plaintiffs suggestion is in accord with the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEu\">457 F.Supp. at 673 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. In <em>Schooner Peggy, </em>Mr. Chief Justice Marshall wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">It is, in the general, true, that the province of an appellate court is only to inquire whether a judgment, when rendered, was erroneous or not. But if, subsequent to the judgment, and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied. If the law be constitutional ... I know of no court which can contest its obligation. It is true, that in mere private cases between individuals, a court will and ought to struggle hard against a construction which will, by a retrospective operation, affect the rights of parties, but in great national concerns . the court must decide according to existing laws .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">5 U.S. at 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-17\">. As noted by the court in <em>Sikora, </em>the wording could mean only that no such retirements could take place after April 6, 1978 or that defenses based on existing retirement plans are eliminated. 22 FEP at 640.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">.

As has been stated, under Gulf\u2019s plan, the employee may be retired at age sixty-five or after the sum of his age plus years of service with Gulf equals or exceeds seventy-five.
