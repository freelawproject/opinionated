Vinson filed a claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 901 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cLHWCA\u201d), for injuries sustained during his employment with Avondale Shipyards, Inc. After conducting a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found in favor of Vinson and awarded $70 per week temporary total disability from October 28, 1972 to June 16, 1973; thirty-five percent permanent partial disability dating from June 17, 1973, at the rate of $44.04 per week, continuing as long as the disability or until the statutory limit of \u00a7 14(m) (formerly 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(m), the provision operative prior to the 1972 amendments) was reached; interest, statutory penalty, attorney fees, and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">That decision was affirmed by the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d). Avondale appeals, contending that Vinson did not sustain a disabling injury at work, that he failed to provide timely notice of any injury, that the ALJ lacked jurisdiction because the injury occurred on land, and that interest, penalties and attorney fees should not have been awarded. The Director of the Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation, United States Department of Labor, cross-appealed on Vinson\u2019s behalf challenging the application of \u00a7 14(m) which was repealed, effective November 26, 1972. We modify the decision of the Benefits Review Board to the extent that it applied the law prior to the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA to limit Vinson\u2019s recovery; in all other respects we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">Billy R. Vinson worked as a pipefitter for Avondale Shipyards, Inc. In May 1972, Vinson sustained a back injury when pipes fell on him during the course of his employment. The accident was reported to his supervisor, and appropriate entries made in the company\u2019s first aid records. Although Vinson did not lose any time from his job as a result of this accident, he eventually filed suit in federal district court in May 1973 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>medical expenses and loss of income. This suit was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because Vinson\u2019s sole recourse was a suit under state workmen\u2019s compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Vinson allegedly sustained a second back injury in October 1972, during the course of his employment. The injury sustained in this October accident gave rise to the present litigation. Vinson again claimed that he was hurt when pipes fell upon him. In a hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, Vinson testified that he informed his supervisor of the accident and stated that he was going to his personal physician for examination. That afternoon, Friday, October 27,1972, Vinson was examined by his personal physician, Dr. Cramner, who had been treating him for unrelated physical problems. Dr. Cramner referred Vinson to an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Winters, for treatment of his back problems. Vinson visited Dr. Winters on Monday, October 30. Although Dr. Winters\u2019 handwritten notes taken at the time do not reflect the sequence of accidents Vinson testified to, Dr. Winters admitted that his notes could have been inaccurate. In any event, Dr. Winters\u2019 notes do support Vinson\u2019s testimony to the extent that they indicate two separate incidents in which Vinson injured his back. Dr. Winters advised Vinson to see Avon-dale\u2019s company physician, and Vinson did, either that afternoon or the next day. Avondale\u2019s doctor examined Vinson but neither his records, nor any of Avondale\u2019s records reflect that Vinson ever notified anyone of his October 27, 1972 injury. Nonetheless, Avondale\u2019s doctor determined that Vinson\u2019s present complaint did not relate back to the May injury. In fact, no cause was determined for Vinson\u2019s back ailments, but he was, nonetheless, placed under Avon-dale\u2019s self-administered non-occupational insurance program and received short-term disability benefits at the rate of $85 per week for 26 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">Vinson did not return to work as a pipe-fitter at Avondale while he remained under Avondale\u2019s insurance program. Instead, because his back problems persisted, he underwent surgery on February 13,1973. After a period of convalescence, he returned to Avondale in June 1973, doing \u201clight duty\u201d work in the fabrication shop for several months, after which he was returned to regular duty work as a pipefitter. Vinson complained of continued back problems, though, and when his request to be returned to light duty work was not honored, he quit Avondale\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">\n<em>Existence and Notice of Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"axs-dedup-0\">Avondale contends that Vinson failed to establish the existence of an injury in October 1972, but attributes his back problems to the May accident. This issue presents only a factual dispute on which we find substantial evidence in the record as a whole to sustain the ALJ\u2019s determination, thereby warranting the decision of the Review Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In resolving disputes under the LHWCA \u201call doubtful questions of fact are to be resolved in favor of the injured employee.\u201d <em>Strachan Shipping Co. v. Shea, </em>406 F.2d 521, 522 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>U.S. 521, 89 S.Ct. 1773, 23 L.Ed.2d 238 (1969); <em>Ryan-Walsh Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Trainer, </em>601 F.2d 1306, 1316 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Young &amp; Co. v. Shea, </em>397 F.2d 185, 188 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 920, 89 S.Ct. 1771, 23 L.Ed.2d 237 (1969); <em>Swinton v. Kelly, </em>554 F.2d 1075, 1085 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 820, 97 S.Ct. 67, 50 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Vinson testified that he informed his supervisor of the accident that Friday, and Avondale\u2019s personnel director the following Monday. In addition, all of Vinson\u2019s actions were consistent with his allegation of injury on October 27. He left work early that day to visit his regular physician who referred him to an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Winters. Vinson did not return to work at Avondale immediately, but underwent a series of examinations. Vinson was examined by Dr. Winters on no less than eight occasions between October 30,1972 and June 16, 1973, not counting two hospitalizations of two week periods, during one of which Vinson underwent back surgery. On June 16, 1973, on Dr. Winters\u2019 advice, Vinson returned to light duty work at Avondale, but was transferred to regular duty work after a few months. He voluntarily left Avon-dale\u2019s employ when the strain of regular duty work proved too severe and his request for a return to light duty work was denied. He then left New Orleans and joined his brother-in-law in the furniture business in Ferriday, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Our recapitulation of the facts serves not only to demonstrate the support for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Vinson established the existence of a compensable injury, but that Avondale received adequate notice. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912(a) and (b) require a claimant to file written notice of an injury within thirty days of its occurrence. It is undisputed that this notice was never given. Section 912(d) excuses the failure to provide notice, however, if the employer or his agent had knowledge of the injury, and the employer suffers no prejudice. As to the latter matter, the AU found that Avondale was not prejudiced by the lack of written notice. As to the former, under \u00a7 920(b) it is presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that sufficient notjce has been given. It must be presumed, therefore, that an employer has notice of the work-relatedness of an injury when the injury manifests itself on the job. <em>See United Brands Co. v. Melson, </em>594 F.2d 1068,1072 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Butler v. District Parking Management Co., </em>363 F.2d 682 (D.C.Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\"><em>Strachan Shipping Co. v. Davis, </em>571 F.2d 968 (5th Cir. 1978), heavily relied on by Avondale, is therefore inapplicable. In <em>Strachan Shipping, </em>this court held that an employer\u2019s knowledge of an employee\u2019s illness was insufficient to toll the limitations period unless the employer had knowledge that the illness was job-related. In the case at bar, Vinson, on the advice of his orthopedist, reported to the company doctor for specific back complaints. Although the company doctor ruled out the May accident as a contributing factor to Vinson\u2019s current back ailment, no other cause was attributed. Nonetheless, Vinson was placed under the company\u2019s non-occupational insurance and received benefits of $85 per week in apparent recognition that he had sustained some injury. These facts, when coupled with Vinson\u2019s unrefuted testimony that he informed his supervisor of his injury, constitute sufficient knowledge on the employer\u2019s part to alert it to investigate the matter further. <em>See Duluth, Missabe, &amp; Iron Range Ry. Co. v. Department of Labor, </em>553 F.2d 1144, 1148 (8th Cir. 1977). That Vinson subsequently completed an insurance form on which he listed May as the date of injury, and the fact that Dr. Winters\u2019 records did not precisely corroborate Vinson\u2019s timetable, while important, do not provide compelling reasons for overturning the ALJ\u2019s decision, \u201cWhere there is substantial evidence on both sides of an issue, the [Administrative Law Judge\u2019s] finding is conclusive.\u201d <em>Wheatley v. Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307, 314 (D.C.Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">\n<em>Timeliness of Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Our conclusion that Avondale received adequate notice of Vinson\u2019s injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>mandates our holding that Vinson\u2019s suit was timely filed. Although \u00a7 913(a) provides a one year statute of limitations for filing a claim under the Act, the tolling provision of \u00a7 930(f) prevents its application in this case. Under \u00a7 930(f), the limitations period of \u00a7 913(a) does not begin to run against the claim of the injured employee until the employer files a report of the injury as required by \u00a7 930(a). Because Avondale failed to file the report required by \u00a7 930(a), Vinson\u2019s suit was timely. <em>United Brands Co. v. Melson, </em>594 F.2d at 1070-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">\n<em>Ex Parte Medical Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Avondale objects to the ALJ\u2019s admission of, and reliance on, the <em>ex parte </em>medical report of Dr. Dennis LaRavia, Vinson\u2019s physician in Ferriday, Louisiana. Relying on <em>Southern Stevedoring Co. v. Voris, </em>190 F.2d 275 (5th Cir. 1951), and <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Clayton, </em>578 F.2d 113 (5th Cir. 1978), Avondale contends that the admission of this report denied it the right of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In both <em>Southern Stevedoring </em>and <em>Bethlehem Steel, </em>the ALJ based his decision in favor of the claimant, at least in part, on <em>ex parte </em>reports from claimant\u2019s doctors, thereby effectively denying the employer the right to cross-examine. In the case at bar, by contrast, while the ALJ accepted Dr. LaRavia\u2019s medical report although he was not present to testify, the record of the administrative hearing was pointedly left open to afford Avondale the opportunity to impeach the report\u2019s reliability by subsequent cross-examination of the doctor. The AU told Avondale that the medical report would be \u201cread in connection with the deposition or affidavit or interrogatories, which ever way you would like to proceed.\u201d Record at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">Avondale chose not to accept the ALJ\u2019s offer, though it alleged no difficulty in complying. That Avondale would have suffered no prejudice by utilizing post-hearing interrogatories or depositions is evident from the fact that its evidence would have been of the same nature as Vinson\u2019s. Because only Dr. LaRavia\u2019s report was introduced uncoupled with live testimony, no demeanor evidence was available to affect the ALJ\u2019s perception. Avondale, in fact, may well have been placed at a considerable advantage. By proceeding post-hearing, not only would Avondale have had the luxury of additional time to prepare its questions, it would have had the benefit of a hindsight unavailable under traditional cross-examination; claimant\u2019s entire case would already have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">Title 33, section 923(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for an informal administrative hearing unencumbered by \u201ccommon law or statutory rules of evidence or by technical or formal rules of procedure,\u201d and even <em>Southern Stevedoring </em>stated that this \u201crelaxation of the ordinary rules of procedure and evidence does not invalidate the proceedings, provided the substantial rights of the parties are preserved.\u201d 190 F.2d at 277. By affording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>Avondale the opportunity of post-hearing cross-examination, we find that the ALJ provided an adequate means for the protection of Avondale\u2019s rights. We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s acceptance of this medical report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Avondale\u2019s remaining objections, which ultimately hinge upon the ALJ\u2019s factual resolutions, are overruled because we have found sufficient evidence in the record as a whole to sustain the fact-findings. The decision below is modified, though, by removing the $24,000 limitation upon Avon-dale\u2019s liability. The 1972 amendments (which took effect November 26, 1972) repealed the ceiling of \u00a7 14(m). We believe that Vinson is entitled to the benefit of the amendments, although his injury occurred prior to their effective date, for the reasons presented in <em>Hastings v. Earth Satellite Corp., </em>No. 78-1759, (D.C.Cir. March 19, 1980), slip op. at 15-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">. Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) the court of appeals only reviews orders of the Benefits Review Board. The Board, in turn, reviews decisions of the administrative law judge and is bound to uphold the ALJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. \u00a7 921(b)(3). When the court of appeals reviews decisions of the BRB, then, its only function is to correct errors of law and to determine if the BRB has adhered to its proper scope of review \u2014 i. e., has the Board deferred to the ALJ\u2019s fact-finding or has it undertaken de novo review and substituted its views for the ALJ\u2019s. <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance </em>Service, 529 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1976). The appellate court must nonetheless conduct an independent review of the record to determine if the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock v. McCabe, </em>593 F.2d 234 (3rd Cir. 1979). In labor cases, by contrast, the labor board may disagree with the findings of the administrative law judge, but it is the <em>Board\u2019s </em>findings that the court reviews under a substantial evidence test. <em>Presley, </em>529 F.2d at 436; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). The LHWCA, therefore, has the effect of shifting deference away from the BRB and to the ALJ. The only difference is what institution, the ALJ or the Board which reviews its decision, is entitled to the ultimate deference when there is a conflict. In LHWCA cases, the ALJ wins, in labor cases, the Board wins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(a) (1978) provides as follows: \u00a7 923.
