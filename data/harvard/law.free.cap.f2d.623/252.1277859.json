In the four-minute skit the town fathers of Sodom discuss a plan to improve their city\u2019s image. The satire ends with the singing of \u201cI Love Sodom\u201d to the tune of \u201cI Love New York.\u201d The District Court for the Southern District of New York (Gerard L. Goettel, Judge) rejected appellant\u2019s claim of copyright infringement, concluding that the parody was protected fair use. Believing that, in today\u2019s world of often unrelieved solemnity, copyright law should be hospitable to the humor of parody, and that the District Court correctly applied the doctrine of fair use, we affirm on Judge Goettel\u2019s thorough opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 482 F.Supp. 741.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-12\">. The District Court concluded, among other things, that the parody did not make more extensive use of appellant\u2019s song than was necessary to \u201cconjure up\u201d the original. 482 F.Supp. at 747. While we agree with this conclusion, we note that the concept of \u201cconjuring up\u201d an original came into the copyright law not as a limitation on how much of an original may be used, but as a recognition that a parody frequently needs to be more than a fleeting evocation of an original in order to make its humorous point. <em>Columbia Pictures Corp. v. National Broadcasting Co., </em>137 F.Supp. 348, 354 (S.D.Cal.1955). A parody is entitled at least to \u201cconjure up\u201d the original. Even more extensive use would still be fair use, provided the parody builds upon the original, using the original as a known element of modern culture and contributing something new for humorous effect or commentary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
