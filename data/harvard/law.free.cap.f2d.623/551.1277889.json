The Government, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, has appealed from an order of the district court granting defendants\u2019 motions to suppress evidence seized at the time of their arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In October, 1977, Michael Brown, who was under arrest for manufacturing methamphetamine, told Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Michael Freder-icks that he and defendant Howard Bernard had been involved in manufacturing methamphetamine during 1977. Brown further informed Fredericks that Bernard and two other persons currently operated a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory in Uma-tilla County, Oregon, and that through a legitimate \u201cfront\u201d business,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they would be purchasing and stockpiling chemical ingredients for the manufacturing of methamphetamine sometime around March, 1978. Subsequent DEA investigation and surveillance activities corroborated much of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The information that Bernard was stockpiling chemicals was reinforced by his purchase of chemicals used in the production of methamphetamine on at least four occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DEA agents learned that Bernard, using a pickup truck registered to defendant Sammy Brock, had recently purchased a large quantity of chemicals in Portland, Oregon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They also observed him make purchases from a supply house in Spokane, Washington in December, 1977 and later in March, 1978. On the latter occasion, the agents, through use of an electronic beeper attached to a canister of chemicals, tracked the chemicals to a suspected drug trafficker\u2019s residence in Clarkston, Washington and later picked the signal up in Meacham, Oregon at defendant Brock\u2019s residence. The final purchase occurred on April 6,1978, the day before the agents made their arrests. DEA agents observed defendants Childress and Bard pick up an order placed by Bernard at the Spokane supply house.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After purchasing the chemicals, the defendants flew to Hermiston, Oregon, where they ultimately drove to 456 Madrona Street, defendant Childress\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">Other events fostered suspicion that Bernard and his associates were engaging in illegal activities. When they picked up the chemical ingredients from the Spokane supply house, the defendants conducted what appeared to be counter-surveillance in an attempt to determine whether law enforcement officers were watching them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Informer Brown\u2019s estimate that methamphetamine production would begin around March, 1978 was partially corroborated by other informer tips in early April that methamphetamine would be manufactured in the Clarkstown area soon and then be made available in the Hermiston-Pendleton area.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">On April 7, the date they arrested the defendants, the DEA agents were conducting surveillance at defendant Brock\u2019s Mea-cham, Oregon residence where they were still receiving a signal from the beeper, and defendant Childress\u2019 residence in Hermi-ston, Oregon, where Bard and Childress had driven with the April 6 purchase of chemicals. During the early part of the day, the agents encountered defendant Bard at a restaurant in Hermiston and followed his jeep to a mobile home camper parked at a mobile home park. Waiting with the mobile home were a green jeep, owned by defendant Cochran, which had earlier that day been seen at Brock\u2019s Meacham resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>dence, and a rented Toyota. At approximately 2:00 P.M. the vehicles drove north to a recreational area, Hat Rock State Park, bordering the Columbia River.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">At the state park, the motor home parked approximately 20 yards from the river. The other vehicles criss-crossed throughout the area conducting what DEA agents thought was counter-surveillance. From aerial surveillance DEA agents observed the defendants carrying boxes of unknown contents from the vehicles to the motor home.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">During the course of the afternoon DEA agents and police officers, both on foot and in vehicles around the park, observed the activities at the mobile home. Agent James Nielsen testified that he observed that the defendants had all of the vents and the door on the mobile home open, but kept the curtains drawn. One curtain facing the road where vehicles might approach, however, was partially opened in a V-shape. Nielsen also testified that he observed two significant events at approximately 5:30 P.M. First, he saw two persons, whom he identified as Childress and Bard, leave in the Toyota and return approximately ten minutes later. He then heard persons whom he believed to be Bard and Childress, telling their companions that DEA agents were still staking out the park. At about the same time, Nielsen observed a person, whom he identified as defendant Brock, rush out of the mobile home \u201cgasping, breathing deep,\u201d and \u201cshaking his head\u201d in an apparent effort to get some fresh air.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">About ten minutes after observing Brock gasping for air, agent Nielsen conferred with agent Lackey, who was also watching the mobile home. From what they had observed, they concluded that the suspects were using the mobile home as a laboratory to produce methamphetamine. Slightly after 6:45 P.M., agent Fredericks arrived and conferred with Lackey, but not with Nielsen. Lackey told Fredericks that he concluded that the suspects were manufacturing methamphetamine, but he failed to inform Fredericks of the two incidents which Nielsen observed at 5:30 P.M.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Based upon the information gathered during the investigation, the observations Lackey related to him, and Lackey\u2019s conclusion that the suspects were producing methamphetamine in the mobile home, Freder-icks authorized the warrantless arrests. At about 7:00 P.M. the agents surrounded the motor home and arrested Bernard, Chil-dress, Brock, Bard, and Cochran.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The agents then searched the mobile home, discovering that the suspects were apparently producing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">\n<em>District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">Following a pretrial suppression hearing, United States Magistrate George Juba recommended that the court deny the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress all evidence as fruits of an arrest unsupported by probable cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the date set for trial, District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Judge Otto Skopil, at the Government\u2019s request, conducted a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing on defendants\u2019 suppression motions. After taking additional testimony and reviewing the record before the magistrate, Judge Skopil held that the Government lacked probable cause to arrest and granted defendants\u2019 motions to suppress derivative evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the court ruled that (1) the Jencks Act required suppression of all testimony given by agent Nielsen at the suppression hearing since Nielsen had destroyed observation notes he made at the scene of the arrest, and (2) the court could not consider the alleged incident where Brock exited the mobile home gasping for air as part of agent Fredericks\u2019 factual foundation for a probable cause determination since Fredericks was unaware of this incident at the time that he authorized the arrests. The court also found that even if Nielsen\u2019s testimony was considered, the DEA agents still lacked sufficient information to form a foundation for probable cause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">\n<em>Issues on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">This appeal raises two issues: (1) did the district court err in excluding Agent Nielsen\u2019s testimony under the Jencks Act because the agent destroyed his rough observation notes after incorporating them into a final report; and (2) did the district court err in determining that the Government lacked probable cause to arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">\n<em>Suppression of Agent Nielsen\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">During the suppression hearing, it was discovered that Agent Nielsen had made rough observation notes of the events which occurred at Hat Rock State Park prior to the arrests. He later lost or destroyed these notes after completing a typed report of the events leading to the defendants\u2019 arrests. The district court held that the Jencks Act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> required the exclusion of Agent Nielsen\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing because he failed to preserve his notes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The decision was based on the court\u2019s interpretation of <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Harris, </em>543 F.2d 1247 (9 Cir. 1976) where this court held that rough notes taken by the FBI during the course of an investigation were potentially discoverable material and, therefore, subject to production under the Jencks Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Under the Jencks Act, however, the Government is not required to produce \u201cstatements and reports\u201d until the witness \u201chas testified on direct examination in the trial of the case\u201d. It is well established in this circuit that the statutory language \u201ctrial of the case\u201d does not include pretrial suppression hearings. <em>United States v. Curran, </em>498 F.2d 30 (9 Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Spagnuolo, </em>515 F.2d 818 (9 Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Defendants recognize that \u201ctrial of the case\u201d has been construed to mean the actual trial, but argue that the prior holdings should be overruled \u201cbecause (1) no demonstrative Congressional history dictates them and (2) they unduly subvert the landmark Brady<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> holding that . . \u2018the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We find <em>Curran </em>and <em>Spagnuolo </em>controlling. Nor are we persuaded that there is merit in either of defendants\u2019 contentions. They first argue that in all probability Congress did not consider the question of whether a suppression hearing is itself a \u201ctrial\u201d or at least an integral part of the trial. They suggest that if Congress had objectively considered the federal criminal process, it would have concluded that Jencks must be applicable to suppression hearings, at least where such hearings cannot be otherwise fairly conducted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We do not accept this argument. We cannot hypothesize that Congress would have added pretrial suppression hearings to the scope of the Act had the members thought about it. Even if we were to accept defendants\u2019 argument that Congress would have so acted, \u201cit is not our function to engraft on a statute additions which we think the legislature logically might or should have made.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper Corp., </em>312 U.S. 600, 605, 61 S.Ct. 742, 744, 85 L.Ed. 1071 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">We also disagree with defendants\u2019 contention that restricting application of the Jencks Act to the trial of the general issues subverts <em>Brady v. Maryland. </em>Rather, <em>Brady </em>exists as an independent foundation to preserve evidence and is not intended to override the mandate of the Jencks Act. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>543 F.2d 1247,1252 (9 Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>524 F.2d 421 (D.C.Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>546 F.2d 1151 (5 Cir. 1977). To fall within the scope of <em>Brady, </em>the material must be (1) suppressed by the prosecution, (2) favorable to the accused, and (3) material to either guilt or to punishment. <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 794-95, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 2568, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the case before us, the claim that <em>Brady </em>is violated fails at least on the third requirement. \u201c[T]he issue [at this hearing] is the preliminary one of probable cause, and guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>or innocence is not at stake.\u201d <em>McCray v. Illinois, </em>386 U.S. 300, 311, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 1062,18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967). Agent Nielsen\u2019s observations just prior to the arrest will neither exculpate the defendants nor reduce their punishment when offered on the issue of probable cause.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">We conclude that the court erred in suppressing the testimony of agent Nielsen and imposing Jencks Act sanctions against the Government at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Nielsen\u2019s Testimony at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We deem it appropriate, under the circumstances of this case, to determine, as the Government has requested, whether Nielsen\u2019s testimony would be admissible at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In <em>United States v. Harris, supra, </em>this court held that government agencies must \u201cpreserve the original notes taken by agents during interviews with prospective government witnesses or with an accused. The preservation of such evidence is necessary in order to permit courts to play their proper role in determining what evidence must be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act or other applicable law.\u201d 543 F.2d at 1253. <em>Harris </em>was followed in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>546 F.2d 309 (9 Cir. 1976). See also <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>524 F.2d 421 (D.C.Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\"><em>Harris, Robinson, </em>and <em>Harrison </em>all involved rough notes made by government agents of interviews with the accused or prospective government witnesses. Each court found that the rough notes were statements within the meaning of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, which defines the term \u201cstatement\u201d, in relation to any witness called by the United States, as \u201ca written statement made by said witness or otherwise adopted or approved by him\u201d. \u00a7 3500(eXl)-<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Government contends that the term \u201cstatement\u201d should not be \u201cread so broadly as to reach surveillance notes\u201d. The Government argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">To include fragmentary surveillance notes, which are almost never a complete account of the witness\u2019 observations, considering the time limitations and lack of opportunity to take detailed notes during surveillance operations, invites distortion and misquotation. Such cursory notes can not accurately be described as being \u201cadopted or approved\u201d by the agent since they are incomplete and not in context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">We have found no case where the <em>Harris-Robinson </em>rule has been applied to rough surveillance notes. In <em>United States v. Lane, </em>574 F.2d 1019, 1022 (10 Cir. 1978), the court found surveillance notes distinguishable from interview notes, saying in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An4\">However, the cited cases each consider the practice only as it pertains to agent\u2019s notes taken contemporaneously with an <em>interrogation. </em>The agent\u2019s notes in such regard are intended to reflect only the informed accused\u2019s or a witness\u2019 statement. It is obvious that any deviation from the notes appearing in the official report of the statement may furnish an aid to an accused. Such is not our case. The subject notes concerned the undercover agent\u2019s activities. The notes are not written contemporaneously but hours, even days, later. The very existence of such notes constitute a real hazard to the undercover agent. Interrogation notes are intended to be factual only. Notes of undercover activity may well contain im-pressionary matter involving diverse persons. We think it would be a judicial invasion into proper law enforcement to <em>require </em>the preservation of such notes</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">We are persuaded that the distinction recognized in <em>Lane </em>is a proper one. Rough interview notes involve a recording of potential testimony of another person\u2014 an accused or prospective witness. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>notes are factual only. The agent has an opportunity to prepare complete initial notes during the interview. Those notes may well constitute a statement as defined in \u00a7 3500(e).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On the other hand, rough notes of an agent\u2019s surveillance activities are often sketchy and incomplete, made in a hurry, at different times, and will include the agent\u2019s own impressions and conclusions. When his written report is prepared, additional material may be included. We are convinced that the holding in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Robinson </em>should not be extended to rough surveillance notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Our holding is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cstatement\u201d in <em>Palermo v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 343, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959), where the Court set forth in detail the legislative history with respect to the adoption of the Jencks Act, following the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957). The Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">One of the most important motive forces behind the enactment of this legislation was the fear that an expansive reading of <em>Jencks </em>would compel the undiscriminating production of agent\u2019s summaries of interviews regardless of their character or completeness. Not only was it strongly feared that disclosure of memoranda containing the investigative agent\u2019s interpretations and impressions might reveal the inner workings of the investigative process and thereby injure the national interest, but it was felt to be grossly unfair to allow the defense to use statements to impeach a witness which could not fairly be said to be the witness\u2019 own rather than the product of the investigator\u2019s selections, interpretations and interpolations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><em>Id., </em>360 U.S. at 350, 79 S.Ct. at 1223.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azr-dedup-0\">It is clear that Congress was concerned that only those statements which could properly be called the witness\u2019 own words should be made available to the defense for purposes of impeachment. It was important that the statement could fairly be deemed to reflect fully and without distortion what had been said to the government agent. Distortion can be a product of selectivity as well as the conscious or inadvertent infusion of the recorder\u2019s opinions or impressions. It is clear from the continuous congressional emphasis on \u201csubstantially verbatim recital,\u201d and \u201ccontinuous, narrative statements made by the witness recorded verbatim, or nearly so . . . that the legislation was designed to eliminate the danger of distortion and misrepresentation inherent in a report which merely selects portions, albeit accurately, from a lengthy oral recital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 352, 79 S.Ct. at 1224-1225.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The Supreme Court in <em>Palermo, Augen-blick, </em>and <em>Goldberg </em>was of course concerned with interview notes and their use for impeachment purposes. As in <em>Harris, Robinson, </em>and <em>Harrison, </em>there was no mention of surveillance notes. We are satisfied that the Jencks Act was not intended to cover rough surveillance notes of the type Nielsen made and later destroyed when he prepared his written report. The destruction of the notes will not preclude his testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">\n<em>Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">An arrest without a search warrant and a reasonable search incident to the arrest are valid if the arrest is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>probable cause. The test if probable cause is whether at the moment of arrest the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the arresting officers \u201cand of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See also <em>United States v. See, </em>505 F.2d 845, 854-855 (9 Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 992, 95 S.Ct. 1428, 43 L.Ed.2d 673 (1975). \u201cIn applying these standards, we must consider <em>ail </em>the facts known to the officers and consider <em>all </em>the reasonable inferences that could be drawn by them before the arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>509 F.2d 1211, 1213 (9 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 967, 95 S.Ct. 1958, 44 L.Ed.2d 455 (1975). (Emphasis in text). If the officers have probable cause to make the arrest it is not necessary to prove exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless arrest. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 423, 96 S.Ct. 820, 827, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">(1) <em>Information Possessed by Agent Fredericks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">At the time Agent Fredericks authorized the arrests, his own investigation had provided him with the following information: (1) an informant\u2019s tip that defendant Bernard was operating an illegal methamphetamine laboratory and might be ready to produce the drug sometime around March, 1978; (2) corroborating surveillance information that Bernard was purchasing the ingredients necessary to produce the drug and that some of the chemicals were located in Meacham, Oregon and probably in the Hermiston, Oregon<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> area; (3) knowledge that Bernard and his associates acted suspiciously while purchasing chemicals, indicating that they were conducting counter-surveillance; (4) knowledge that Bernard had phoned the supplier of chemicals the morning of the day before the arrest that Chil-dress would pick up the chemicals, and that Childress and Bard did in fact pick them up that afternoon; (5) knowledge that vehicles which had been at the residence in Mea-cham and Hermiston, where some of the chemicals were located, were together at the scene of the arrest; and (6) knowledge that Bernard associated with suspected drug traffickers. This information gave agent Fredericks strong reason to believe that Bernard and certain of his associates were indeed contemplating the manufacture of methamphetamine in the not too distant future. The information, however, did not show where or exactly when the laboratory operations would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-29\">We turn now to events which were specifically related to agent Fredericks by other agents at the scene of the arrest and inferences he drew from that information. Agent Fredericks testified before Judge Skopil that he made the decision to arrest the defendants on the basis of the following: (1) the pre-April 7 investigation information summarized above; (2) an inference that the location of the mobile home in an isolated area would be a suitable site for a clandestine laboratory operation; (3) some of the persons identified at the park had assisted Bernard in purchasing chemicals; (4) an inference that the boxes transferred from the vehicles to the mobile home contained the ingredients for producing methamphetamine; (5) an inference that the vents and doors of the mobile home were left open to provide ventilation for the lab and that the curtains were drawn to conceal the operations; and (6) an inference that the defendants were involved in counter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>surveillance activities when they were driving in the area around the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">We agree with Judge Skopil that the specific information known to agent Fredericks was insufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the defendants were committing an offense. Other inferences could reasonably be drawn from many of the facts upon which he relied. Although taken together these events might create suspicion in the minds of agents looking for signs that a particular crime is being committed, they fall short of the factual basis necessary to make a finding of probable cause. Moreover, neither Fredericks nor the other agents were aware that Bernard, the focus of the investigation, was present at the park until after the arrests were made.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Fredericks was unaware of the incident concerning Brock\u2019s choking or of the possibility that agent Nielsen may have smelled something cooking.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">(2) <em>Information Possessed by other Agents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The Government argues, however, that we need not confine our inquiry to the <em>personal </em>knowledge of agent Fredericks, but rather may consider the <em>collective </em>knowledge of all of the agents involved in the investigation and surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Agent Fredericks testified that he conferred with agent Lackey for approximately half an hour and relied \u201cto a great degree\u201d on Lackey\u2019s opinion in deciding to make the arrests. Agent Nielsen had communicated to Lackey his observations of Brock\u2019s breathing difficulties, and the conversation Nielsen overheard indicating that the defendants knew they were under surveillance. Fredericks was aware that both Lackey and Nielsen were of the opinion that the occupants of the motor home were manufacturing methamphetamine. In effect all of them participated in the decision to make the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"A6a\">Fredericks, Lackey and Nielsen were all experienced DEA agents familiar with methods employed in the manufacture of illicit drugs. Their experience may properly be considered in determining whether they had probable cause to make the arrests. \u201cConduct innocent in the eyes of the untrained may carry entirely different \u2018messages\u2019 to the experienced or trained observer.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 F.2d 458, 460 (D.C.Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 949, 89 S.Ct. 2031, 23 L.Ed.2d 469 (1969). \u201cThe test is whether ordinary, reasonable men, possessed of the experience and knowledge of [the arresting officers] would conclude that the transaction . . . was more likely than not a criminal transaction.\u201d <em>United States v. Wabnik, </em>444 F.2d 203, 205 (2 Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 851, 92 S.Ct. 88, 30 L.Ed.2d 91 (1971).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The collective knowledge of agents Fredericks, Lackey and Nielsen was sufficient to constitute probable cause. While no one event, considered in isolation, would be sufficient, the \u201csuccession of superficially innocent events had proceeded to the point where a prudent man could say to himself that an innocent course of conduct was substantially less likely than a criminal one.\u201d <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>492 F.2d 995 (9 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 846, 95 S.Ct. 82, 42 L.Ed.2d 75 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">There remains for consideration the question of whether agent Fredericks could rely upon information known to agents Lackey and Nielsen which had not been communicated to Fredericks. In <em>United States v. Stratton, </em>453 F.2d 36, 37 (8 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1069, 92 S.Ct. 1515, 31 L.Ed.2d 800 (1972), the court held that secret service agents who made warrantless arrests were not required at the moment of arrest to possess personal knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, but rather that probable cause was \u201cto be determined upon the objective facts available for considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>tion by the agencies or officers participating in the arrest . . . The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">We think the knowledge of one officer is the knowledge of all and that in the operation of an investigative or police agency the collective knowledge and the available objective facts are the criteria to be used in assessing probable cause. The arresting officer himself need not possess all of the available information. As stated in <em>Stassi v. United States, </em>410 F.2d 946 (5 Cir. 1969). \u201cThe officers involved were working in close concert with each other and the knowledge of one of them was the knowledge of all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">We recognize that in some of the cases holding that the collective knowledge of the arresting officers could be considered in determining probable cause, the substance of information obtained by other officers had been communicated to the arresting officers. See, e. <em>g., United States </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>382 F.2d 322 (4 Cir. 1967). We do not find, however, that this is required, particularly where, as here, the agents were working in close concert. Moreover, as noted <em>supra, </em>agent Fredericks relied to \u201ca great degree\u201d on the opinion of agent Lackey in making the final decision to effect the arrests.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We recognize also that \u201cthe standards applicable to the factual basis supporting the officer\u2019s probable-cause assessment at the time of the challenged arrest and search are at least as stringent as the standards applied with respect to the magistrate\u2019s assessment.\u201d <em>Whiteley v. Warden, </em>401 U.S. 560, 566, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 1036, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971); <em>accord United States v. Fernandez-Guzman, </em>577 F.2d 1093, 1097 (7 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 954, 99 S.Ct. 351, 58 L.Ed.2d 345 (1978). In <em>Whiteley, </em>a sheriff, acting on a tip, obtained a warrant from a magistrate. A police radio bulletin described the suspects, automobile, and money taken in a burglary. Relying on the radio bulletin, an officer in another county made a warrantless arrest and search. The complaint had not mentioned that the sheriff was acting on an informant\u2019s tip and had no information to corroborate the tip. The Court held that under these circumstances the police radio bulletin could not support the element of probable cause that the officer who issued the bulletin lacked. The Court noted, however, that police officers are entitled to rely on radio bulletins that are based on probable cause.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">In <em>United States v. Gaither, </em>527 F.2d 456 (4 Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 952, 96 S.Ct. 1728, 48 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976), a warrant-less arrest was made by a police officer on a radio bulletin \u201cbased on personal observation by the FBI, not on an informant\u2019s tip alone.\u201d In distinguishing <em>Whiteley v. Warden, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">The Court (in Whiteley) noted that officers are entitled to rely on radio bulletins that <em>are </em>based on probable cause \u201ccan rest upon the <em>collective </em>knowledge of the police, rather than solely on that of the officer who actually makes the arrest.\u201d (Citing <em>United States v. Pitt, supra.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHe\">Similarly, agent Fredericks was entitled to rely on the observations and knowledge of agents Lackey and Nielsen, even though some of the critical information had not been communicated to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We conclude that (1) the district court erred in suppressing agent Nielsen\u2019s testimony at the pretrial suppression hearing; (2) the destruction of Nielsen\u2019s rough surveillance notes will not preclude his testifying at the trial with respect to his observations prior to the arrests at Hat Rock State Park; (3) the collective knowledge of DEA agents Fredericks, Lackey and Nielsen may be considered in determining whether there was probable cause for the arrests; and (4) based on that collective knowledge, there was probable cause to effect the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. Bernard claimed to be in the business of manufacturing fertilizer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">. When questioned during the investigation, Bernard told DEA agents that he was purchasing the chemicals to produce fertilizer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">. American Supply, where Bernard purchased the chemicals, became suspicious of Bernard\u2019s large orders and notified the DEA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-10\">. Bernard had phoned the supply house that Childress would pick up the chemicals Bernard had ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b613-15\">. For instance, during the December, 1977 purchase of chemicals Bernard led the agents on what they termed a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d. During the pick up of chemicals on April 6, 1978, one of the defendants went to a phone and feigned a call, apparently to check the chemical supply house lobby for the presence of DEA agents. Later when they reached Hermiston, the defendants drove to their destination in a very circuitous manner, apparently in a continuing attempt at counter surveillance. (Aerial surveillance indicated that at one point they drove into a school parking lot, turned around, and waited).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">. Nielsen also testified that he smelled something \u201ccooking\u201d, but at the time, he could not identify it as chemicals that might be used to produce methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">. Specifically, these were the choking incident involving Brock and the conversation among the suspects that they knew they were under surveillance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">. They were unaware that Bernard was in the mobile home prior to this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b614-9\">. Judge Juba found the \u201cimportant facts\u201d supporting probable cause to be: \u201cagents knew persons in mobile home were associated with narcotics users and traffickers; knew that some of the persons in mobile home were recently in possession of or had access to chemicals used in making methamphetamine; were informed that Bernard was running illegal amphetamine lab; observed clandestine activity among defendants culminating in their secluding mobile home and numerous vehicles in remote section of state park during April; doors of mobile home open towards river and vents open; one person exits mobile home appearing as though he was having trouble breathing (which may be caused by fumes from choking chemicals)\u201d. The magistrate also found the agents had probable cause for the search of the motor home for the same reasons they had probable cause to believe that defendants were committing an offense. Finally, he found justification for the warrantless search of the motor home as an inventory search; as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>search under exigent circumstances; and as an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d search. The only witness to testify at the hearing was Agent Freder-icks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">. Agents Nielsen and Fredericks testified at the <em>de novo </em>hearing. Defendants put Russel Murray, a resident of the area where the arrest occurred, on the stand to impeach some of the Government\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. After striking Agent Nielsen\u2019s testimony as a sanction under the Jencks Act, the court made the following finding concerning probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">Without the testimony of Agent Nielsen, the Government\u2019s claim of probable cause cannot stand. Although there had been some prior suspicion of some of these defendants because of their contact with Mr. Bernard, that was not sufficient to justify an immediate warrantless arrest. The agents did not even suspect that Mr. Bernard was in the trailer. The \u201cbeeper\u201d was still in the Mea-cham cabin, 60 or 70 miles away. No chemicals or equipment had been traced to any of the vehicles at Hat Rock State Park. None of the agents smelled anything \u201ccooking\u201d. Agent Fredericks had no knowledge of the alleged incident where defendant Brock exited the motor home, having trouble breathing. The evidence that they did have gave them enough for a suspicion of what was going on</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">in the motor home; which turned out to be correct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b615-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (the Jencks Act) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-16\">(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the Unites States no statement or report in the possession of the Unites States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">(b) After a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b615-18\">. The court also excluded Nielsen\u2019s testimony as a sanction required by the Jencks Act because the Government failed to timely supply the defendants with a copy of Nielsen\u2019s more formal typed report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. In <em>Harris </em>and FBI agent had interviewed the defendant and destroyed the notes he made at the interview after incorporating them in a formal report. While the court found that the failure to preserve the original notes in that case was harmless error, it was made clear that the \u201cFBI must hereafter preserve the original notes taken by agents during interviews with prospective government witnesses or with an accused\u201d. Harris was decided on September 23, 1976. The notes which Nielsen destroyed were made on or after April 7, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">.
