Among those killed was Croce\u2019s road manager, Kenneth Dominick C\u00f3rtese, whose wife and son are the plaintiffs in this wrongful death action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-25\">Initially, we recite only the most pertinent facts; other relevant ones are detailed in our discussion below of the numerous legal issues. On September 18, 1973, Bill Breedlove, the Director of Operations of Mustang Aviation, Inc. (\u201cMustang\u201d), entered into an agreement with Lloyd St. Martin of Variety Artists International, Inc. (\u201cVariety Artists\u201d), a booking agency for popular singers, to provide an aircraft to fly the Jim Croce Group from Shawnee, Oklahoma, to Columbus, Mississippi, to Natchitoches, Louisiana, and then on to Dallas. Mr. St. Martin wired Mustang the agreed upon fee ($952.63). Later that day, Mr. Breedlove learned that the aircraft he had planned to use to transport the group was disabled. He thereupon contacted John Roberts, President of Bromley Corporation, d/b/a Roberts Airways (\u201cRoberts Airways\u201d), who agreed to provide a Roberts Airways plane and pilot to fly the charter for Mustang.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether the group or its booking agent was ever notified that Roberts Airways had been substituted for Mustang is disputed by the parties. In any event, the Roberts Airways plane, flown by Robert N. Elliott, followed the itinerary until its fatal crash on leaving Natchitoches airport on September 20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The circumstances surrounding the airplane crash and the cause of the crash were hotly contested at trial. There was conflicting evidence as to whether the pilot\u2019s negligence \u2014 for example, his failure to perform a full preflight check of the aircraft or his taking off downwind into a \u201cblack hole\u201d \u2014or his having had a heart attack was the cause of the crash. Taking off at night, the plane was airborne only a short while before crashing. Everyone aboard the plane died instantly. Some marijuana and other controlled substances were found in the plane\u2019s debris, and a small amount of marijuana was found on the body of the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Linda and Eric C\u00f3rtese, decedent\u2019s wife and minor son, brought this wrongful death action against both Mustang and Roberts Airways. <em>See </em>n.l, <em>supra. </em>Three separate trials were held, each addressing a different question, and this appeal involves aspects of all three trials. At the first, bench trial, held in July 1976, the sole material issue was Mustang\u2019s liability for the actions of Roberts Airways. The trial judge rejected plaintiffs\u2019 theories of vicarious liability, re-spondeat superior, and joint venture but held Mustang liable on two alternative grounds: (1) Mustang was liable for the acts of its agent, Roberts Airways, and was estopped from denying that agency; and (2) Mustang was liable as the agent of an undisclosed principal (Roberts Airways). The court denied an interlocutory appeal. At the second trial, held in August 1977, a jury found that the pilot\u2019s failure to exercise the highest degree of care was a proximate cause of the airplane crash. In a separate order, the trial court held that \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d the defendants were \u201ccommon carriers who owed plaintiffs\u2019 decedent[] the highest standard of care.\u201d Therefore, in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, the court held defendants Mustang and Roberts Airways jointly and severally liable for plaintiffs\u2019 damages. The third trial, on the issue of damages, resulted in a jury verdict for plaintiffs in the following amounts: $250,-000 for care, maintenance, and support; $10,000 for household services; $20,000 for love, affection, counsel, and guidance; and $20,000 for sorrow, mental anguish, or grief suffered as a result of the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">Both Roberts Airways and Mustang bring this appeal, alleging numerous errors in the second and third trials. With respect to the second trial, they challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for a directed verdict, a judgment n. o. v., and a new trial; its holding as a matter of law that the defendants were carriers who owed the highest degree of care to plaintiffs\u2019 decedent; its admitting certain evidence with respect to the pilot\u2019s prior conduct; and its failure to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interests of decedent\u2019s minor son. From the third trial, defendants appeal the court\u2019s admitting certain testimony concerning the decedent\u2019s future earnings, its refusing to give an instruction that any damages awarded by the jury would not be subject to federal income tax, and its permitting the jury to award separate damages for mental anguish and loss of love and affection. In addition, Mustang appeals the district court\u2019s holding in the first trial that it is liable for the actions of Roberts Airways. We will initially discuss the issue of Mustang\u2019s liability, as determined in the first trial, and then proceed to consider the other issues <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-11\">\n<em>Mustang\u2019s Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-12\">The district court concluded as a matter of law that \u201cMustang is estopped to deny agency because Mustang led the Croce group to believe that Robert Elliott, the pilot, was Mustang\u2019s agent, flying Mustang\u2019s airplane,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Croce Group reasonably relied, to its detriment, on Mustang\u2019s implied promise that Mustang would fly the charter flight.\u201d Thus, it held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>Mustang liable for the actions of Roberts Airways and its pilot, Robert Elliott. Alternatively, the court found Mustang liable as \u201cthe agent of an undisclosed principal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mustang contends that it is not liable under either theory. We disagree. We hold that Mustang is liable for the actions of Roberts Airways and its pilot on estoppel grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Mustang asserts that the district court erred in allocating the burden of proof on the estoppel theory. The following statement from the court\u2019s explanatory Memorandum and Order, issued after Mustang challenged its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, provides the basis for Mustang\u2019s assertion: \u201cMustang was under a duty to speak. Mustang did not. The <em>burden </em>of avoidance of this breach of duty by proof that the Croce group learned from sources other than Mustang of the substitution [of Roberts Airways] can <em>hardly be placed upon the Croce group.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">The remainder of the Memorandum and Order, however, makes clear that the district court properly placed the burden of proving estoppel on the plaintiffs and that he was persuaded by the evidence adduced at trial that plaintiffs had carried that burden. In the margin, we quote in full the relevant portion of the Memorandum and Order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This language reveals that the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>legedly erroneous statement to which Mustang points concerns merely an <em>alternative </em>estoppel theory, the breach of a duty to speak,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that was, in the court\u2019s words, \u201c[w]holly apart from the <em>direct evidence </em>of nondisclosure, which in this court\u2019s view would <em>directly meet the burden of proof argument . . </em>. (emphasis added). The direct evidence was provided in large part by Richard Linden, a Mustang employee. Linden testified that he had contacted a member of the group on the road and left word that a substitute aircraft would be provided;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> however, he also indicated that he was not likely to have informed the person that the substitute would be provided by Roberts Airways or that Mustang would no longer be responsible for the flight. The district court found, as a matter of fact, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-5\">there is no credible evidence that Richard C. Linden informed the Croce agent that Roberts [Airways] was the owner and operator of the substitute or that Roberts [Airways] was solely responsible for the flight, nor did anyone secure the Croce Group\u2019s agreement to the change from the original contract. While the evidence on this point is sparse, the reasonable inferences from the evidence left the court with the firm belief that no such communication occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">In light of Linden\u2019s testimony, this finding is not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Nor is the finding that no one \u201cin the Croce Group knew or should have known that Mustang was not responsible for the flight or that Roberts [Airways] was flying it in Mustang\u2019s place.\u201d Besides the direct evidence of nondisclosure provided by Linden, the district court relied on testimony given by the president of Roberts Airways that it was customary for Roberts Airways not to disclose to customers that they were substituting for Mustang. The inferences drawn by the trial court from this evidence are reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the factual findings detailed above fully support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs carried their burden of proof on the estoppel issue, we hold that Mustang is estopped from denying that Roberts Airways was its agent and is liable for the acts of that agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">\n<em>Denial of Defendants' Motions for a Directed Verdict, Judgment N.O.V., and New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">Defendants claim that there was insufficient evidence of the pilot\u2019s negligence to support a jury verdict for plaintiffs in the second trial and that the district court therefore erred in denying their motions for a directed verdict, a judgment n. o. v., and a new trial. Having thoroughly reviewed the trial transcript, we are firmly convinced that the defendants\u2019 position is without merit. <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc), sets out the standard by which to measure the denial of a motion for a directed verdict or for a judgment n. o. v. <em>Shipman </em>mandates that we consider <em>all </em>of the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposed to the motion \u2014 in this instance, plaintiffs. \u201c[I]f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">The evidence presented at the second trial was substantial enough to withstand the motion for a directed verdict or a judgment n. o. v. The central issue at the trial was whether the pilot\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the crash. Although defendants presented expert testimony to the effect that the pilot had suffered a heart attack shortly after takeoff,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the plaintiffs presented evidence that was certainly sufficient to raise doubt in the mind of a reasonable juror that the pilot had suffered a heart attack.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contended at trial that various acts of negligence on the part of the pilot, rather than a heart attack, caused the crash.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Any one of the several negligent acts alleged,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> if proved, would be sufficient to support a jury verdict for plaintiffs. Of these, we discuss in detail only one \u2014 the pilot\u2019s alleged spatial disorientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 expert medical witness testified at length that spatial disorientation resulting from the pilot\u2019s taking off into a \u201cblack hole\u201d was the cause of the crash. <em>See </em>n.12, <em>supra. </em>This theory was buttressed by the testimony of Asher Van-denberg, a commercial, multiengine pilot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>with instrument ratings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Vandenberg testified that \u201cNatchitoches is the worst [black-out area] I have ever seen\u201d and that a pilot taking off at night to the south \u201cwould fly into a black void.\u201d Such a takeoff, according to Vandenberg', would severely hinder a pilot\u2019s ability to tell by visual reference whether, and how far, the airplane was climbing or turning. Although other pilots testified for defendants that the deceased pilot\u2019s takeoff on the night of the crash was proper, all of the evidence on this issue, when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, <em>Shipman, </em>411 F.2d at 374, could have led a \u201creasonable and fair-minded\u201d person to conclude that the pilot was in fact negligent in taking off in the manner that he did. Given all of the evidence on plaintiffs\u2019 various theories of negligence and the conflicting evidence concerning the pilot\u2019s alleged heart attack, we conclude that the trial judge rightly denied defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and let the issue of the pilot\u2019s negligence go to the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It follows that his denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment n. o. v. was proper as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">With respect to the judge\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, we are bound by an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>See Conway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., </em>610 F.2d 360 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Spurlin v. General Motors Corp., </em>528 F.2d 612 (5th Cir. 1976). In light of the evidence outlined above, we find no such abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">\n<em>Duty of Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">The district court at the August 1977 trial ruled that defendants were \u201ccommon carriers who owed the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent[] the highest standard of care\u201d with regard to the flight in question. The jury found that the pilot\u2019s failure to exercise the highest degree of care was a proximate cause of the airplane crash. Defendants submit that they owed the decedent only a duty of ordinary care and that they are therefore entitled to a judgment in their favor in light of the additional jury finding that the pilot\u2019s failure to exercise ordinary care was not a proximate cause of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">Defendants concede that a common carrier ordinarily owes one who is a \u201cpassenger\u201d the highest duty of care. However, they argue that the decedent lost his status as a \u201cpassenger\u201d by carrying marijuana aboard the airplane and thereby became a mere licensee, invitee, or trespasser to whom they owed only a duty of ordinary care.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Evidence adduced at trial showed that the decedent was carrying a small amount of marijuana<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on his person. The thrust of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>fendants\u2019 argument is that their contract of carriage with the decedent is void because it had an illegal purpose: to transport the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">We find defendants\u2019 contention on this point to be specious. The purpose of the contract between the defendants and the decedent was to transport the decedent and the other members of the Jim Croce Group, not to transport marijuana. The policy underlying the requirement that a common carrier exercise the highest degree of care is to ensure that it provide safe transportation to those who contract for the use of its services. We agree with the plaintiffs that a common carrier should not be entitled to avoid the high standard of care it owed its passengers \u201cbecause of some unknown or undisclosed conduct of the passenger, <em>merely incidental to the trip, </em>that happen[s] to be in violation of a statute or regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (emphasis added). It makes no sense to say that a common carrier owes a lesser duty of care to a traveler who is carrying a marijuana cigarette or two in his pocket<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> than to a \u201cpassenger\u201d seated nearby who is not. Defendants\u2019 counsel admitted as much at oral argument,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and agreed that a passenger traveling with one marijuana cigarette on his person could not be said to be traveling with the intent to transport it. An airline passenger may be subject to other penalties for transporting a small amount of marijuana in violation of state or federal laws, but he is still entitled to the assurance that a carrier will exercise the utmost degree of care in order to insure his safety. In essence, decedent\u2019s carrying a small amount of marijuana aboard the airplane is immaterial for the purpose of determining the degree of care that a common carrier owes its \u201cpassengers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">\n<em>Evidence of Pilot's Prior Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-0\">Defendants argue that the district court erred in admitting evidence of the pilot\u2019s past conduct to prove that he acted in conformity with that conduct on the evening of the accident in violation of Fed.R. Evid. 404.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The trial transcript makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>clear, however, that the judge permitted this evidence to be introduced not for the purpose proscribed by Rule 404 but for the limited purpose of rebutting certain opinions given by defendants\u2019 experts concerning the pilot\u2019s previous deportment as a pilot.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We agree with the district court, whose ruling is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that the admission of the evidence for this circumscribed purpose was entirely proper.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, since the defendants themselves, despite repeated warnings by the trial court, \u201cplace[d] the general reputation of the pilot in issue, see n.24, <em>supra, </em>they can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>not now be heard to complain of the district court\u2019s error, if any, in admitting this evidence. <em>See United States v. Spiegel, </em>604 F.2d 961, 966 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert denied. </em>-U.S.-, 100 S.Ct. 2151, 64 L.Ed.2d. -(1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">\n<em>Failure to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aobl\">Defendants submit that the court\u2019s failure to appoint a guardian ad litem pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c) constituted reversible error. We disagree. Rule 17(c) authorizes the district court to appoint a guardian ad litem \u201cfor an infant . <em>not otherwise represented </em>in an action . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In the instant case the infant was \u201cotherwise represented\u201d; the child\u2019s legal guardian, his mother, brought this action on his behalf. Thus, there was no need for the court to appoint a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">Defendants nevertheless contend that the trial court erred in failing even to \u201cconsider the question of whether a guardian ad litem should have been appointed to represent the minor Plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For this proposition, they cite <em>Roberts v. Ohio Casualty Insurance Co., </em>256 F.2d 35 (5th Cir. 1958). <em>Roberts, </em>however, is clearly distinguishable: in <em>Roberts </em>the children\u2019s mother was not a party to the cause of action, and neither she nor any other legal representative pressed the children\u2019s interests until after a judgment was entered against them; in the instant case, to the contrary, the child\u2019s mother and legal guardian was a party to the lawsuit below and vigorously pressed her child\u2019s claims before the trial court. The defendants here have demonstrated absolutely no conflict between Mrs. Cortese\u2019s interests and those of her son, nor have they shown any prejudice to the child\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We discern no error on the part of the trial court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-15\">\n<em>Evidence of Decedent\u2019s Future Earnings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-16\">Defendants further contend that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of Allen Neuman, a former employee of the organization by which the decedent was employed, and the testimony of decedent\u2019s wife concerning the decedent\u2019s future earnings because such testimony was speculative and conjectural in nature.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In their view, Louisiana law pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>hibits the consideration of such evidence in awarding damages for the loss of future earnings. However, Louisiana law does not control the issue of whether this evidence should have been admitted in a federal district court;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Fed.R.Evid. 403<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> provides the proper standard. Evaluated by that standard, the testimony concerning decedent\u2019s future earnings, albeit speculative and conjectural, was properly admitted. Because Louisiana law permits plaintiffs in a wrongful death action to recover for loss of support, which is equivalent to the loss of future earnings, see <em>Viator v. Gilbert, </em>253 La. 81, 216 So.2d 821, 822 (1968), the testimony was certainly relevant to the issue of damages. Moreover, we are not convinced that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The speculative nature of the evidence affects only the <em>weight </em>of the evidence and was therefore properly before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">\n<em>Damages for Mental Anguish and Loss of Affection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">Defendants complain that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to award $20,000 for loss of \u201clove, affection, counsel, and guidance\u201d and an additional $20,000 for \u201csorrow, mental anguish, or grief suffered as a result of his [Kenneth Dominick Cortese\u2019s] death\u201d.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We agree with defendants that Louisiana law<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> does not sanction such \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Louisiana\u2019s wrongful death statute provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he survivors in whose favor this right of action survives may also recover the damages which they sustained through the wrongful death of the deceased.\u201d La.Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 (West 1979). The statute, by its terms, does not restrict the elements to be considered in assessing damages, and we have previously noted that \u201cLouisiana courts recognize as proper elements of damages [for wrongful death] not only loss of support, loss of contributions, from the decedent, but also loss of society and the grief and anguish of the beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>Travelers Insurance Co., </em>277 F.2d 257, 261 (5th Cir. 1960) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, no case to which we have been referred stands for the proposition that plaintiffs in a wrongful death action can recover <em>separate </em>monetary awards for loss of love and affection on the one hand and for sorrow and mental anguish on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\"><em>Blancher v. Samuels, </em>354 So.2d 213 (La. App.) (on reargument), <em>writs denied, </em>355 So.2d 257, 263 (La. 1978), cited by plaintiffs, acknowledges that damages for wrongful death \u201cinclude not only loss of support, but also loss of the love and affection of the decedent and the grief and anguish of the survivor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 223, but it does not support their contention that separate awards were proper in the instant case. In fact, <em>Blanch-er </em>cuts against, rather than in favor of, plaintiffs\u2019 contention. The special interrogatory on damages<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that the judge in Blancher submitted to the jury required the jury to fix a single dollar figure to compensate the plaintiff for <em>both </em>loss of love and affection <em>and </em>grief and mental anguish.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Blancher </em>thus cannot be read to support the duplicative recovery permitted in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">Absent a clear expression from the Louisiana courts favoring separate monetary awards for distinct elements of nonpecuni-ary damages,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> we decline to authorize separate awards here. Our caution is dictated at least in part by a fear that a contrary-decision could result in further \u201cfragmen-tizing\u201d of awards for nonpecuniary losses in future cases. Moreover, our refusal to award separate damages gains support from 3 Stone, <em>Louisiana Civil Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 26 at 32 (1977) (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-11\">The question whether a survivor could in addition recover damages under the action for wrongful death for distress and mental suffering occasioned by the death is more difficult. In <em>Dobyns v. Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. </em>Co.,83 the Supreme Court re-83119 La. 72, 82, 43 So. 934 (1907). ferred to \u201cdistress and mental suffering\u201d of the plaintiff but such was due to the \u201cdeprivation of her husband\u2019s companionship\u201d and so it can be argued that these were merely ways of describing loss of companionship. In <em>Bourg </em>v. <em>Brownell-Drews Lumber </em>Co.84 the court took into 84 120 La. 1009, 45 So. 972 (1908). consideration \u201cthe mental suffering and deprivation caused to a parent by the death\u201d but again the use of the word \u201cdeprivation\u201d could indicate that what was here referred to was loss of affection, companionship etc. The better opinion would seem to be that Judge Monroe in these cases was <em>not creating a separate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number><em>category of recoverable damage but was merely describing that damage which was included under the heading of loss of society and companionship.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Insofar as the district court allowed plaintiffs to recover separately for loss of affection and mental anguish, its judgment is reversed. Plaintiffs are entitled to recover a total of $20,000 for their nonpecuniary losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">\n<em>Failure to Give Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Defendants next contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury, as they had requested,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> that any damages the jury awarded to the plaintiffs would not be subject to federal income taxation. In their brief, defendants observed that \u201cthe propriety of an instruction as to the effect of federal income tax law upon the issues [related to damages] is a matter of the proper application of Louisiana law\u201d and proceeded to argue on the basis of Louisiana case law that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give their requested instruction constitutes reversible error. At oral argument, however, defendants relied not on Louisiana law but on <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. v. </em>Liepelt, -U.S.-, 100 S.Ct. 755, 62 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980), decided by the Supreme Court after the submission of briefs in this case, for the proposition that the district court was required to give their requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">We cannot agree with the defendants that <em>Liepelt </em>controls our disposition of this issue; for reasons explained below, we look to state law to determine whether the instruction was required, as defendants contended in their brief. Our reading of the Louisiana cases, unlike defendants\u2019, indicates that a trial judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction would <em>not </em>constitute reversible error in Louisiana. Accordingly, the district judge\u2019s refusal to give the instruction was <em>proper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">In <em>Liepelt </em>the administratrix of a fireman\u2019s estate brought suit under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 <em>et seq., </em>for damages that his survivors suffered as a result of his death. At trial an expert witness testified for plaintiffs that they had suffered damages in the amount of $302,000.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> An expert witness for defendant sought to testify that the decedent\u2019s federal income taxes for the years 1973 through 2000 would have amounted to $57,000. Taking this figure into account and using different assumptions about decedent\u2019s future salary and the calculation of the present value of future earnings, defendant\u2019s expert estimated plaintiffs\u2019 net pecuniary loss to be $138,327. The trial court, however, refused to allow evidence of the decedent\u2019s future taxes into evidence and also refused to instruct the jury on the nontaxability of a damage award as requested by defendant. The jury returned a verdict of $775,000. After Illinois appellate courts affirmed, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the lower court erred both in refusing to admit the evidence and in refusing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">We are convinced that <em>Liepelt </em>does not control our decision here. The wrongful death action in <em>Liepelt </em>arose under the FELA and not under a state statute, as the instant case did. In our view, this distinction is crucial. In discussing the issue of whether federal or state law governed the propriety of the court\u2019s refusal to give the instruction in <em>Liepelt, </em>the Supreme Court specifically acknowledged the federal na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>ture of suits brought pursuant to the FELA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-5\">Whether it was error to refuse that instruction, as well as the question whether evidence concerning the federal taxes on the decedent\u2019s earnings was properly excluded, is a matter governed by federal law. It has long been settled that <em>questions concerning the measure of damages in an FELA action are federal in character. </em>See, e. <em>g., Michigan Cent. R. Co. v. Vreeland, </em>227 U.S. 59, 33 S.Ct. 192, 57 L.Ed. 417. This is true even if the action is brought in state court. See, e. <em>g., Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. v. Kelly, </em>241 U.S. 485, 491, 36 S.Ct. 630, 632, 60 L.Ed. 1117.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\"><em>Id. </em>100 S.Ct. at 757 and n.5 (emphasis added). In the instant case federal concerns are lacking; this wrongful death action is a statutory creation of the state, and the measure of damages to be recovered, as we noted above, <em>see </em>n.32, <em>supra, </em>is governed by state law. Nor is the need for uniformity throughout the United States, which was \u201c[o]ne of the purposes of the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act,\u201d <em>id., </em>100 S.Ct. at 757 n.5, implicated in a cause of action brought to vindicate a state-created right. Despite some broad language approving an instruction that informs the jury that an award of damages will not be subject to income tax, <em>see id. </em>100 S.Ct. at 759, there is no suggestion that the Supreme Court in <em>Liepelt </em>intended to <em>require </em>a trial judge to give such an instruction in wrongful death actions predicated upon state statutes.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-12\">Moreover, the jury in <em>Liepelt </em>awarded the plaintiffs $775,000, far in excess of the estimation of the plaintiffs\u2019 pecuniary loss ($302,000) made by their own expert witness. The Court, noting this discrepancy, opined: \u201cIt is surely not fanciful to suppose that the jury erroneously believed that a large portion of the award would be payable to the Federal Government in taxes and that therefore <em>it improperly inflated the recovery.\u201d Id. </em>100 S.Ct. at 759 (emphasis added). At the trial below on the issue of damages, there was no inflation of the recovery beyond the amounts testified to by the expert witnesses. We thus have no reason to suppose, as the Court in <em>Liepelt </em>did, that the jury labored under the misconception that federal taxes would be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-13\">Having determined that <em>Liepelt </em>does not control the outcome of this issue, we turn to Louisiana ease law to ascertain whether the refusal to give the requested instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>constitutes error in Louisiana.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We conclude that it does not. In <em>Guerra v. Young Construction Co., </em>165 So.2d 882 (La.App.), <em>writ ref\u2019d, </em>246 La. 864, 167 So.2d 676 (1964), the court held that a refusal to give a similar instruction was not error.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The defendants mistakenly contend that <em>DeBose v. Trapani, </em>295 So.2d 72 (La.App.), <em>writ ref\u2019d, </em>299 So.2d 359 (La. 1974), repudiated the holding of <em>Guerra. See also Francis v. Government Employers Insurance Co., </em>376 So.2d 609 (La.App. 1979), <em>writ ref\u2019d, </em>378 So.2d 1391 (La. 1980). In <em>DeBose </em>the trial court had in fact <em>given </em>the requested instruction; the appellate court merely held that the trial judge had not erred in doing so. 295 So.2d at 74-75. <em>Cf. Francis, </em>376 So.2d at 612 (following DeBose). The court in <em>DeBose </em>was simply not confronted with the issue presented in <em>Guerra </em>and in the instant case. In the absence of contrary authority,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> we follow the mandate of <em>Guerra </em>in upholding the district court\u2019s refusal to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's imposition of joint and several liability on Mustang and Roberts Airways for plaintiffs\u2019 damages, as modified herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1145-19\">. A number of other plaintiffs joined in initiating this action, but they have since settled with the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1145-20\">. Mr. Roberts testified that Roberts Airways and Mustang had a longstanding agreement that Roberts Airways would fly charters that Mustang had booked but could not fly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1145-27\">. After the crash, Mustang paid Roberts Airways $552.35 of the sum it had received from Variety Artists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-28\">There was some evidence presented at trial to show that the plane was not en route to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>Dallas, as originally scheduled, but to Sherman, Texas, apparently as a result of an agreement between the pilot and the Jim Croce Group. Moreover, the plane left Natchitoches at night, rather than on the following morning as originally planned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1146-14\">. The parties had stipulated that the plaintiffs would also recover funeral expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">. The district court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 theories of respondeat superior, vicarious liability, and joint venture. These theories are not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">. Because we conclude that Mustang is liable on an estoppel theory, we need not decide whether it is liable as an agent for an undisclosed principal. However, we note that several cases suggest that the latter theory is inapposite in the instant case, since there is no evidence to show that Mustang was an agent for Roberts Airways at the time it entered into its contract with the Jim Croce Group. See, e. <em>g., Casey v. Sanborn's, Inc., </em>478 S.W.2d 234 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Houston 1972, no writ); <em>Vincent Murphy Chevrolet Co. v. Auto Action, Inc., </em>413 S.W.2d 474 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Eastland 1967, writ ref'd n. r. e.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">. a) The Burden of Proof: Mustang misconceives the court\u2019s ruling. There was evidence of a custom or practice of Mustang and Roberts not to disclose a substitution of Roberts for Mustang in situations where Mustang was not able to perform a contracted for charter. Mustang booked the Croce charter and retained a substantial portion of the charter fee. One naturally inquires why the fee arrangement existed and why there was a habit and practice of such nondisclosure. The answers are common sense deductions from the evidence. Mustang enjoys enhancement of custom by being able to furnish the requested charter service. That is, Mustang avoids having to disclose to a prospective customer that it is not equipped to deliver. It thereby enjoys greater chance of future business. The ability of Mustang to retain a substantial portion of the fee is reflective of its greater ability (than Roberts) to attract business stemming in no small part from its greater size. One inference is that Mustang has a sufficient edge over Roberts to command such a healthy (as a percentage of the total) referral fee. The Croce group contracted with Mustang thereby expressing in concrete terms their confidence both in Mustang\u2019s flying ability and presumably its financial responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">Significantly, there is evidence that <em>Mustang </em>did not disclose the substitution of the smaller charter service, Roberts, and that evidence should be viewed against the background as a practice and custom of nondisclosure of such substitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">There are at least two difficulties with Mustang\u2019s burden of proof argument. The first is the presence of evidence of Mustang\u2019s nondisclosure. Second, Mustang proceeds upon the assumption that it had no duty to speak. In other words, Mustang argues that the deceased pilot may have told the deceased passengers or the unfortunate passengers may have otherwise learned that there had been a substitution of charter services; that the Croce burden was in any event to adduce proof to negate that possibility. Wholly apart from the direct evidence of nondisclosure, which in this court\u2019s view would directly meet the burden of proof argument, if arguendo apposite, Mustang fails to grasp the point that an estoppel can arise from a breach of a duty to speak (See Finding 4a). As stated by the Supreme Court of Texas in <em>Burnett v. Atteberry, </em>105 Tex. 119, 145 S.W. 582 (1912):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-14\">\u201cAn estoppel may arise as effectually from silence, where it is a duty to speak, as from words spoken. One may be induced to act to his injury on account of the silence of one interested in a transaction, and when such course of action is permitted with a knowledge of the interested party or induced by silence or tacit acquiescence, the doctrine of estoppel may be invoked. The rule is tersely but accurately stated by Mr. Bigelow in the following sentence: \u2018A representation in the nature of a negative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>one\u2019s rights may, as we have seen, arise from pure silence; and from pure but <em>misleading </em>silence with knowledge, or passive conduct joined with a duty to speak, an estoppel will arise .\u2019 [Emphasis the courts] ... \u2018A party who negligently or culpably stands by and allows another to contract on the faith and understanding of a fact which he can contradict cannot afterwards dispute that fact in an action against the person whom he has himself assisted in deceiving\u2019.\u201d Id. <em>Burnett v. Atteberry, </em>145 S.W. 587 (1912).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aop\">Mustang was under a duty to speak. Mustang did not. The burden of avoidance of this breach of duty by proof that the Croce group learned from sources other than Mustang of the substitution can hardly be placed upon the Croce group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1148-14\">. <em>See Barfield v. Howard M. Smith Co., </em>426 S.W.2d 834 (Tex. 1968). We note that the district court, \u201cin the absence of suggestion by the parties to the contrary,\u201d looked to Texas law to resolve the agency issue before it. Its action in doing so was proper and is not contested on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1148-15\">. Mr. Linden testified that he could not recall the name of the person to whom he spoke but that the person had offered no objection to the proposed substitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1148-16\">. <em>See </em>n.7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">. Defendants presented the testimony of Dr. William J. Reals, a board-certified pathologist and professor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine, who had examined the pilot\u2019s heart after the crash at the request of the FAA. Describing at length the condition of the pilot\u2019s heart, including extensive narrowing of the arteries, Dr. Reals testified that he believed the pilot had suffered a heart attack, either \u201ca classic coronary with pain or a cardiac arrhythmia, or a sudden cardiac arrest.\u201d He further testified that the pilot would not necessarily have been aware that he had a heart condition prior to the time of the heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">Evidence was also adduced at trial that the pilot, a frequent jogger, unable to secure transportation to the airport, began jogging toward the airport, some three miles away, shortly before flight time. Eventually, he was picked up by local police, interrogated, driven to the airport, and released. In light of this evidence, Dr. Reals testified that the pilot\u2019s having jogged so soon before the flight, particularly in conjunction with the stress of takeoff, might well have contributed to the pilot\u2019s heart attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">. Dr. Harry L. Gibbons, a board-certified specialist in aerospace medicine, testified for the plaintiffs that in light of the pilot\u2019s medical history and condition, the pilot would \u201cprobably\u201d have had symptoms preceding the onslaught of a heart attack, most likely while he was jogging toward the airport. Dr. Gibbons also cited to numerous articles that cautioned against ascribing an unexplained accident to coronary disease in the pilot. As opposed to a heart attack, Dr. Gibbons proffered the theory that, based on his extensive experience, the crash was caused by the pilot\u2019s suffering a spatial disorientation as a result of his taking off into a \u201cblack hole.\u201d A \u201cblack hole,\u201d according to Dr. Gibbons, is the proper term for a black night takeoff. The jury was thus presented with a credibility choice between the parties\u2019 expert witnesses, and it was entitled to believe Dr. Gibbons rather than Dr. Reals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">Moreover, in addition to the testimony of Dr. Gibbons, the plaintiffs sought to impeach the testimony of Dr. Reals during their cross examination of him. Dr. Reals admitted on cross examination that he had twice previously noted that \u201cthe <em>possibility </em>of sudden cardiac incapacitation must be considered in evaluating the accident.\u201d (emphasis added). Dr. Reals also admitted that his examination of the pilot\u2019s heart revealed no evidence of dead heart tissue or fibrosis (scarring); nor was there any evidence of \u201cprior cardial infarct.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also got Dr. Reals to admit that \u201cin all medical probability a man whose arteries had narrowed as much as the pilot\u2019s\u201d would have had some symptoms of cardiac abnormality. Finally, plaintiffs questioned Dr. Reals about a study indicating that persons who died from sudden heart attacks had either an abnormal EKG, high blood pressure, or a history of smoking. It is undisputed that the pilot had none of these characteristics. This impeachment testimony, taken as a whole, in conjunction with the expert testimony of Dr. Gibbons, was sufficient to raise a jury question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">. The parties stipulated that \u201c[pjost-crash examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence to indicate material failure or mechanical malfunction of the aircraft prior to impact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">. Plaintiffs alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the pilot was negligent for taking off downwind into a \u201cblack hole,\u201d for failing to perform a preflight check, and for taking off when he was in an unstable mental and physical condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">. Vandenberg was also an accident investigator for the Natchitoches sheriff\u2019s office. Moreover, he had landed at the Natchitoches airport only 20 minutes before the airplane crash. He was thus well qualified to discuss the particular conditions existing at Natchitoches airport on the night of the crash, as well as the more general characteristics of the airport.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">. Plaintiffs submit that defendants\u2019 violation of certain FAA regulations was an act of negligence per se, citing <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 342, 40 S.Ct. 155, 64 L.Ed. 297 (1920), and <em>United States v. Schultetus, </em>277 F.2d 322 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 828, 81 S.Ct. 67, 5 L.Ed.2d 56 (1960). Both of those cases state that government regulations have the \u201cforce and effect of law,\u201d but neither case concerns a violation of a governmental regulation by a defendant or addresses the issue of negligence per se. <em>Maryland Casualty </em>dealt with the <em>government's </em>failure to take into account its own regulations in rejecting a taxpayer\u2019s claimed deductions, while <em>Schuitetus </em>concerned a <em>judge\u2019s </em>error in failing to apply certain regulations. However, because we find that there was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motions, we need not decide whether defendant\u2019s violation of the FAA regulations constituted negligence per se.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">. Plaintiffs contend that defendants have stipulated that the decedent and other members of the Jim Croce Group were \u201cpassengers\u201d and cannot be heard to argue that the decedent was merely a licensee, invitee, or trespasser. However, that stipulation was made only for the purposes of the July 1976 trial in which Mustang\u2019s vicarious liability was the sole material issue. We can give no weight to this stipulation in determining the duty of care owed by defendants to plaintiffs\u2019 decedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">. According to a criminalistics laboratory report, a plastic bag containing \u201cgreen vegetable matter\u201d and \u201cfoil with green substance\u201d was found on the body of the deceased. After laboratory analysis, the \u201cgreen vegetable matter\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>was determined to contain marijuana, and the \u201cgreen substance\u201d was determined to contain marijuana extract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Marijuana, hashish, and a variety of other drugs were found on the bodies and in the luggage of other members of the Jim Croce Group, and other controlled substances were found in the aircraft. These additional drugs have no bearing on our decision today. We are presented only with the question of the duty of care owed by defendants to decedent, not to other occupants of the plane or to the Jim Croce Group. There was no evidence adduced at trial to show that these other drugs were the property of the decedent. Thus, only the small amount of marijuana that was found on decedent\u2019s body is relevant to our resolution of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">. Moreover, if a carrier\u2019s duty to a person onboard an aircraft is determined by whether that person is committing some infraction of a state law, then the duty of care owed to a single individual might well vary in the course of a single interstate or transcontinental flight, as the aircraft passed across state boundaries. We cannot subscribe to such an unpredictable means of determining carrier responsibility to persons onboard its aircraft. Passenger safety is the paramount consideration, and in the absence of a contract for an illegal purpose or of disruptive conduct on the part of the \u201cpassenger,\u201d <em>see Williams v. Shreveport Yellow Cab Co., </em>183 So. 120 (La.App.1938), which interferes with the carriage, the standard establishing the highest degree of care must prevail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">. <em>See </em>n.18, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">.

In his final charge, the judge explained to the jury that he was admitting \u201cevidence of the prior accidents experienced by Robert N. Elliott not because they have any bearing on the cause of the crash now in question but to avoid your possibly concluding [by inference from defendants\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony] that no such incidents had occurred.\u201d He had previously cautioned the jury on a number of occasions that the evidence was being admitted for this limited purpose only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">. I want the record to reflect in the Pre-Trial Order it\u2019s recited in it Robert N. Elliott held an Airline Transportation Pilot Certificate No. 37153 with airplane single and multi engine ratings, together with a Certified Flight Instructor\u2019s Rating, and a current medical certificate. Despite the fact that it was so stipulated the Defendants have repeatedly referred to these certifications in differing factual contexts to communicate to the Jury that Robert N. Elliott was a safe and careful pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">In the opening statement of the Counsel, both defense Counsel specifically told the Jury that they intended to show that the pilot was extremely capable, experienced and in general possessed traits of being a safe pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">During the trial, despite the warnings of the Court that the defense Counsel were attempting to place the general reputation of the pilot in issue, the defense Counsel have persisted and the Defendants have asked hypothetical questions of the expert witness now on the stand and others as to the cause of the accident, which assumes for the purposes of expressing the opinion that Robert Elliott was experienced by virtue of his large number of hours and in general possessed traits of being a safe pilot and in general he was a pilot competent of good judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">In sum, the Defendants have calculatedly placed in evidence opinion evidence that Robert Elliott was a safe pilot and that because of his total hours and certifications adhered to such safe practices all leading to the conclusion hoped for by Defendants that he was unlikely to have made a mistake on this take-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">Now, seems to me this character of evidence as to the reputation or opinion of Robert Elliott as a safe pilot is not proper evidence that Elliott adhered to safe practices at the time of the accident. At the same time where the Defendants have, despite the admonitions of the Court, and under circumstances which eliminate any possibility of inadvertence, elicited testimony which is no more than or no less than opinions as to Robert Elliott\u2019s traits and judgments that adheres to safe practices of the pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">The Plaintiffs must be able to resist under Rule 405. The Court is sensitive to the distinction between matters of habit and custom and general reputation. The Court has labored to avoid receipt in evidence of prior specific acts of this pilot but in the posture of the case, which is a direct result of the efforts of the Defense Counsel to not allow this Jury to learn of this pilot\u2019s record, will not avoid potential prejudice but would affirmatively mislead them particularly in the factual context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">The record of Robert N. Elliott should have remained a neutral circumstance but Defendants chose not to leave it in this posture, that is to say that Defendants could not have informed the Jury of Robert N. Elliott\u2019s background, including his certifications, but Defendants by no means confined themselves to such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">For all those reasons, and for the reasons which the Court will articulate after the verdict, the Plaintiff will be allowed hereafter to cross examine with regard to the prior record of Mr. Elliott and its effect upon the opinions of the witnesses and to offer into evidence affirmatively his record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1152-15\">. <em>American Airlines, Inc. v.

We nevertheless held the evidence at issue to be admissible because it was presented in support of another theory. <em>Id. </em>In this case evidence of the pilot\u2019s prior conduct was not presented to prove he was acting in conformity with a previous negligent act; it was therefore properly admitted under the <em>American Airlines </em>rationale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"A9Pe\">. In this regard, defendants point out that plaintiffs presented no proof of guardianship until the time of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">. Nor, of course, have they shown any prejudice to themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">. For the sake of clarity, we first outline below certain background information so as to provide a context within which the challenged testimony can be viewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">From September 1972 until his death, plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was a road manager for Variety Theatre International, Inc. (\u201cVariety Theatre\u201d), an organization that booked and produced concerts for colleges throughout the United States. At the time of the fatal accident, he was managing the tour of the Jim Croce Group. For his services the decedent was paid $700 per month, plus a yearly bonus of $400-500. In addition, all of his tour-related expenses were paid while he was on tour.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">In July 1974, the president of Variety Theatre sold the corporation to his associates, who put up $15,000 apiece (except for one who put up $30,000). The new organization, named Variety Artists International, Inc. (\u201cVariety Artists\u201d), was identical to Variety Theatre except that each of the purchasers became an officer of the new corporation, and the former president was removed. Otherwise, all of Variety Theatre\u2019s employees were retained by Variety Artists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-17\">Against this factual background, we recount the testimony to which the defendants object. Allen Neuman, a former road manager for Variety Theatre, testified that he had been trained for that position by the decedent. He disclosed that in September 1973, at the time of the airplane crash, his salary was $600 per month. Mr. Neuman testified that in July 1974, at the time of the corporate changeover, he had borrowed $15,000 from a bank in order to buy into Variety Artists; his salary at that time was approximately $12,000 annually. By his calculations, his salary had risen to $16,000 annually by July 1976. Mr. Neuman revealed that he had become a booking agent in November 1974. On the basis of his experience as a booking agent, he averred that the decedent would have been a good salesman and would still have been employed by Variety Artists. Defendants complain of the admission of Mr. Neuman\u2019s testimony as a \u201cyardstick\u201d by which to measure the decedent\u2019s future earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-18\">Defendants also object to certain testimony given by decedent\u2019s wife to the effect that her parents had the means to extend a $15,000 loan to the decedent so that he could have pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>chased a share in Variety Artists had the opportunity presented itself. After a lengthy discussion outside the presence of the jury, the court allowed this testimony in, ruling that her parents\u2019 ability to make a loan was a question of fact for the jury. Defendants also raise on appeal the admissibility of her testimony that the decedent had wanted to become a booking agent for Variety Artists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Curiously, defendants do not object to the admission of the testimony of Lloyd St. Martin, former office manager and travel coordinator of Variety Theatre and an officer of Variety Artists. Mr. St. Martin testified that decedent was likely to have become a booking agent or salesman for Variety Artists at a substantially higher salary had he survived. Like Mr. Neu-man, Mr. St. Martin had bought into Variety Artists. When Mr. St. Martin was asked if he would have to assume that the decedent had \u201c$15,000 he could have put up to buy into Variety Artists,\u201d Mr. St. Martin responded that the decedent \u201cwould probably have done what everyone else did\u201d \u2014 buy into the new corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">.

The dissent, in fact, explicitly recognizes that state law governs questions such as the one raised here unless the state law contravenes federal policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-9\">This Court, to be sure, has asserted federal control over a number of incidents of state trial practice that might appear to be procedural, and has done so out of concern, apparently, for protecting the rights of FELA plaintiffs. See, e. g., <em>Brown v. Western R. of Alabama, </em>338 U.S. 294, 70 S.Ct. 105, 94 L.Ed. 100 (1949) (a State cannot apply, in a FELA case, its usual rule that pleadings are construed against the pleader); <em>Dice v.

I agree, of course, that state rules that interfere with federal policy are to be rejected, even if they might be characterized as \u201cprocedural.\u201d See, e. g., Note, State Enforcement of Federally Created Rights, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 1551, 1560-1561 (1960). See generally Note, Procedural Protection for Federal Rights in State Courts, 30 U.Cin.L.Rev. 184 (1961). I cannot conclude, however, that a purely cautionary instruction to the jury not to misbehave implicates any federal interest. This issue truly can be characterized as one of the \u201cordinary incidents of state procedure,\u201d <em>Dickinson v. Stiles, </em>246 U.S. 631, 633, 38 S.Ct. 415, 416, 62 L.Ed. 908 (1918), which should be governed by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-15\">100 S.Ct. at 762-63 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">.
