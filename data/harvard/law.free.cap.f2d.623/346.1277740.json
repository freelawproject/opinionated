Following a trial on the merits the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant bank and its insurer. On this appeal Pokorny and the Shupings contend the district court erroneously denied them summary judgment against the bank, which they argue was liable as a matter of law for the actions of its employees in instigating the arrest of Pokorny and Shuping by reporting an attempted bank robbery when they lacked probable cause to believe that such an attempt had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">In <em>Pokorny v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Largo, </em>563 F.2d 763 (5th Cir. 1977), we certified to the Supreme Court of Florida the questions whether the bank\u2019s employees had directly procured the plaintiffs\u2019 arrest so as to be liable under <em>Johnson v. Weiner, </em>155 Fla. 169, 19 So.2d 699 (1944), and whether the rules governing arrest and imprisonment by private citizens applied to this action. The Florida Supreme Court answered both questions in the negative. <em>Pokorny v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Largo, </em>382 So.2d 678 (Fla.1980). Based upon the Florida Court\u2019s ruling, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
