We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">Appellant\u2019s invention relates to a fuel pellet configuration used in controlled nuclear fusion systems; also, to a method of increasing the efficiency of a fusion burn of the fuel. Claims 1 and 2 are illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-21\">1. A method of increasing the efficiency of a fusion burn of a small quantity of fusion fuel which comprises:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-22\">(a) surrounding the fusion fuel with a contiguous envelope of uranium,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-23\">(b) encasing the fuel and the uranium envelope in a contiguous layer of a relatively light material selected from aluminum and beryllium,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-24\">(c) directing a laser beam toward said fuel to cause a transfer of fast neutrons from said fuel to said uranium and a fission reaction in said uranium to heat said fuel and maintain a high pressure on said fuel to retard the disassembly of the fusion fuel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-25\">2. A fuel configuration for a fusion burn utilizing a laser beam as an energy source which comprises:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-26\">(a) a core of deuterium-tritium having a radius of about 1 millimeter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-27\">(b) a contiguous envelope of uranium around said core, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-28\">(c) a contiguous encasement of relatively light material selected from aluminum and beryllium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-29\">In affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2181,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Clearly, the invention (the claimed subject matter) is useful solely in the utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy <em>in a fuel configuration for laser fusion burn. </em>If appellant\u2019s invented <em>fuel configuration for laser fusion burn </em>is an atomic weapon, then 42 U.S.C. 2181 proscribes the granting of a patent on the invention. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the board pointed out that an atomic weapon is \u201cany device utilizing atomic energy <em>... the principal purpose of which </em>is for use as, or <em>for development of, </em>a weapon, a weapon prototype, or a weapon test device.\u201d (Board\u2019s emphasis.) It added that the examiner had shown that the <em>\u201cprincipal use\u201d </em>of pellets, such as those claimed, is and has been in the development of weapons \u2014 a fact not refuted by appellant. The board agreed with the examiner that a nuclear fusion, fuel-containing pellet is, per se, an atomic weapon and sustained the rejection under section 2181.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On reconsideration, the board said that while appellant\u2019s various arguments might be compelling when considered only in the context of section 2181 and a layman\u2019s understanding of the phrase \u201catomic weapon,\u201d it was bound by the definition in section 2014. It rejected appellant\u2019s argument that the invention has dual utility, relying on that section\u2019s reference to principal use. It declared that the claimed invention is, by definition, an atomic weapon and that, \u201cmanifestly,\u201d section 2181 proscribes the granting of a patent to an atomic weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Appellant argues that the background and legislative history of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act require that the provisions of the act be read narrowly to encourage private participation in the utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; that the board\u2019s error in applying section 2181(a) was that it effectively separated the word \u201csolely\u201d from the phrase \u201cin an atomic weapon,\u201d contrary to the purpose and intent of Congress; and that where an invention has uses other than in weapons, patent rights are not forbidden by section 2181(a), but are only forbidden by section 2181(b) to the extent that the invention is actually used in the weapons field. Appellant emphasizes that the unclassified status of the present application<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> demonstrates that the invention is not directed to weapons technology; that the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the invention is per se an atomic weapon, and that, at most, the invention has both weapon and nonweapon utility, which is sufficient to avoid application of section 2181(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">The Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d), in its amicus brief, argues that the board failed to recognize that its application of the special definition of \u201catomic weapon\u201d in section 2014(d) to \u201catomic weapon\u201d in section 2181(a) would lead to a result that conflicts with the express scheme devised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>by Congress for the allocation of patent rights in section 2181(b). In DOE\u2019s view, the board\u2019s interpretation would have the effect of deleting the words \u201cuseful solely\u201d from section 2181(a) and substituting \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d therefor, thereby rendering meaningless the phrase \u201cto the extent\u201d in section 2181(b). DOE points out that the legislative history shows that Congress intended inventions \u201cuseful solely\u201d in weapons to not be patentable, while inventions having dual uses would be patentable to the extent of their nonweapon use.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The University of Rochester, in another amicus brief, argues that the policy of the 1954 Act was to permit issuance of patents by removing 1946 Act limitations that precluded all patents which were useful in the production or utilization of atomic energy; that the existence of any utility other than one involving an atomic weapon removes jurisdiction from the PTO to reject a patent application; that authority to determine weapons applications of any invention that may involve atomic energy resides in DOE under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2162; and, finally, that because neither DOE nor the Department of Defense has made a determination that appellant\u2019s application contains restricted data, atomic weapons are not involved, and section 2181 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Solicitor argues that the board correctly concluded that the rejection was proper, because the principal purpose of the claimed subject matter is for development of a weapon, a weapon prototype, or a weapon test device; that appellant and amicus DOE ignore the words \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d in derogation of the preamble of section 2014; that the board\u2019s construction of section 2181(a) is not at odds with the operation of section 2181(b); and that appellant has provided no evidence that the \u201cspecific invention claimed\u201d serves any purpose \u2014 for use in weapon development or in peaceful energy production. It is further argued that the unclassified status of the application does not demonstrate that the invention is not directed to weapon development; that the examiner and board have established a <em>prima facie </em>case of what the principal purpose likely was at the time of filing the application \u2014 namely, use in development of weapons, weapon prototypes, and weapon test devices; and that appellant has not rebutted that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The board recognized that the proper test under section 2181(a) is whether the invention is \u201cuseful solely in the utilization of . atomic energy in an atomic weapon,\u201d and then correctly looked to section 2014(d) for the definition of atomic weapon. However, it erred in then ignoring the word \u201csolely\u201d in section 2181(a) and the complementary provisions in section 2181(b). <em>United States v. Blasius, </em>397 F.2d 203, 207 n.9, 158 USPQ 371, 373 n.9 (2d Cir. 1968), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>393 U.S. 1008, 89 S.Ct. 615, 21 L.Ed.2d 557, 160 USPQ 832 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Even assuming that appellant\u2019s invention meets the definition of \u201catomic weapon\u201d in section 2014(d), it is necessary to determine whether the invention is \u201cuseful <em>solely\u201d </em>in an atomic weapon. The record is clear, and the PTO does not argue to the contrary, that appellant\u2019s invention has nonweapon utility. Therefore, we hold that the restrictions of section 2181(a) are not applicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">The examiner suggested that, if the claims recited a \u201cpeaceful purpose\u201d limitation, section 2181(a) would not be applicable. However, this ignores the phrase \u201cto the extent\u201d in section 2181(b) and would require that each atomic energy type claim include a boilerplate phrase, such as \u201cused only for peaceful or nonweapon purposes.\u201d Such a limitation is already impliedly incorporated into every such claim by section 2181(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">The decision of the board is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">\n<em>REVERSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-16\">.
