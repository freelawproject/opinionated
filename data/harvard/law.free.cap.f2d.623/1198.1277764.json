The indictment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> charged Watson, a highway contractor, with making a false declaration when he responded in the negative to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-18\">Have you ever asked any other contractor to submit a bid higher than the amount which you intended to submit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-19\">On appeal, Watson raises five alleged errors and asserts that he is entitled at least to a new trial. Finding each of his objections lacking in merit, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-20\">I. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjY\">Watson argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove that he ever asked any other contractor to submit a bid higher than the amount which he intended to submit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because a holding in Watson\u2019s favor on this point would preclude a retrial, <em>see Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 15-17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2149-2150, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), it is important to consider this argument initially. After reading the record and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Zarattini, </em>552 F.2d 753, 761 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 942, 97 S.Ct. 2661, 53 L.Ed.2d 262 (1977), we find we must reject Watson\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>To convict Watson the jury was required to find that, in testifying under oath before a grand jury, he knowingly made a false declaration as to a material<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> fact when he denied ever having requested a complementary bid. <em>See United States v. Whimpy, </em>531 F.2d 768, 770 (5th Cir. 1976). Watson himself admitted he had appeared before the grand jury and given the testimony which formed the basis for the indictment in this case. To prove the elements of falsity and knowledge, the government called three other road building contractors, Henry Eppel, Virion Suits, and Leonard Tobey to testify about the bidding procedures for numerous contracts for which they competed together with Watson. Both Suits and Tobey testified that on several occasions Watson had told them what amount their bids should exceed. Watson has brought to our attention inconsistencies in the testimony of the government witnesses as well as questions about their credibility. These problems were brought out at trial, and we believe they are matters properly left for resolution by the jury. <em>United States v. Consolidated Packaging Corp., </em>575 F.2d 117, 128 (7th Cir. 1978). Similarly, we find Watson\u2019s contention on appeal that he had no motive to seek complementary bids was also an argument presented to the jurors and apparently rejected by them. We see no warrant in the record for disturbing the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">II. <em>Evaluation of Materiality of the Alleged Falsehood</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">As another ground for reversal, Watson contends that the court improperly applied a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard instead of a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt test in evaluating the materiality of his statement to the grand jury. Although proof of a statement\u2019s materiality, defined as its \u201ceffect or tendency to impede, influence or dissuade the grand jury from pursuing its investigation,\u201d <em>see United States v. Devitt, </em>499 F.2d 135, 139 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 975, 95 S.Ct. 1974, 44 L.Ed.2d 466 (1975), is an essential element of the crime charged in the indictment, it is well settled that the determination of materiality is a question of law for the court. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>538 F.2d 159, 163 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Demopoulos, </em>506 F.2d 1171, 1176 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 991, 95 S.Ct. 1427, 43 L.Ed.2d 673 (1975). <em>Cf. </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 241.1 (1962). \u201cSince the issue of materiality is a legal question, not a question of fact, the government need not prove materiality beyond a reasonable doubt . . .\u201d <em>United States v. Giacalone, </em>587 F.2d 5, 7 (6th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 940, 99 S.Ct. 2882, 61 L.Ed.2d 310 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>do we believe, as the government contends, that the prosecution need show materiality by a preponderance of the evidence. As a question of <em>law, </em>there cannot appropriately be <em>any </em>evidentiary or factual burden with respect to the issue of materiality. A question of law is by definition susceptible of only two answers: \u201cyes,\u201d the requirements of legal principle are met or \u201cno,\u201d they are not met. There is, in theory at least, no continuum of assurance and dubiosity as to the establishment of a proposition of law similar to the varying degrees of certainty and uncertainty which may be ascribed to propositions of fact. Although the trial judge here stated he determined materiality by a standard of \u201cmore probably true than not true, by the preponderance of the evidence,\u201d we believe this reference to evidentiary standards may be regarded as gratuitous and harmless. We find the government has shown (and the district court has concluded) that defendant\u2019s alleged false declaration to the grand jury was material. The declaration had a \u201ctendency . to influence . . . [the grand jury\u2019s] investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">III. <em>Compliance with the Speedy Trial Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">Watson urges error in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss for failure to place him on trial within the time limit required under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Without addressing the merits of the parties\u2019 contentions regarding calculation of time periods under the Act, we note that dismissal is the appropriate sanction for the violation alleged by Watson. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). Under the terms of the Act, however, this sanction applies only \u201cto all cases commenced by arrest or summons, and all informations or indictments filed, on or after July 1, 1980.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3163.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Until that time, the sanction of dismissal is inapplicable under the express language of the statute. <em>United States v. West, </em>607 F.2d 300, 305 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. DeJesus Moran-Rojo, </em>478 F.Supp. 512, 513 (N.D.Ill. 1979). <em>Accord, United States v. Hooper, </em>596 F.2d 219, 224 (7th Cir. 1979) (finding the sanction of dismissal unavailable before its original effective date); <em>United States v. Gandara, </em>586 F.2d 1156, 1161 (7th Cir. 1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">The first indictment in this case was filed on May 18, 1979, and was dismissed on motion of the government on July 11, 1979. Watson was reindicted on August 8, 1979. It is indisputable that his prosecution commenced prior to July 1, 1980. Accordingly, the sanction of dismissal is unavailable for alleged violations of the standards of the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-12\">IV. <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Other Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">As previously noted, the indictment charged Watson with falsely responding to a question whether he had ever requested other contractors to submit a complementary bid on his behalf. At trial, he moved <em>in limine </em>for a two-pronged order excluding evidence (1) that Watson \u201chad been involved in bid rigging\u201d and (2) that he \u201csubmitted complementary bids at the request of any other contractor.\u201d The trial judge denied the motion, and on appeal, defendant contends such denial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence permits the admission of evidence of crimes extrinsic to the one charged in the indictment if such evidence is offered to prove knowledge (and like matters) rather than merely to prove criminal disposition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>Watson does not dispute that the evidence he sought to exclude by his motion <em>in limine </em>is relevant to the question whether he knew the negative answer he gave to the grand jury was false. Watson does contend, however, that the admission of the evidence was improper because it was not necessary to the government\u2019s case and because it \u201cmade the jury conclude that the [djefendant had a propensity for perjurious acts\u201d despite a cautionary instruction that the evidence was to be considered only with regard to the element of knowledge. These arguments are apparently based on Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">The balancing of probity and prejudice required under Rule 403 is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>United States v. Fairchild, </em>526 F.2d 185, 186 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1682, 48 L.Ed.2d 186 (1976), and we are \u201cobligated to afford substantial deference to the evidentiary ruling of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dolliole, </em>597 F.2d 102, 107 (7th Cir. 1975). Although our review might have been facilitated by written findings on this issue by the district court, we do not believe the district court here abused its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">The evidence adduced at trial showed a scheme for the exchange of complementary bids. Evidence that Watson asked for complementary bids was necessary to demonstrate that he was aware of the falsity of his testimony before the grand jury. Evidence challenged under the second prong of his motion, namely evidence that he submitted, or agreed to submit, complementary bids for others, was so intertwined with proof of his solicitation of bids that one practice could not be adequately demonstrated without testimony about the others. Given this interplay, evidence that Watson submitted bids for others has great probative value. We do not believe that this evidence was unnecessary since it was a crucial part of each witness\u2019 explanation of the manner in which the contractors allegedly sought to allocate construction projects among themselves. <em>Cf. United States v. Aleman, </em>592 F.2d 881, 885-86 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>438 F.2d 461, 465-66 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">Any prejudice arising from the admission of evidence of Watson\u2019s submission of bids for others was slight. The judge properly instructed the jury concerning the proper use of this evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not find, as Watson contends, that the jury was misled. This is not a case in which evidence of acts other than those charged in the indictment was misused or argued improperly to the jury. <em>See United States v. Vargas, </em>583 F.2d 380 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>492 F.2d 1141 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">Our discussion has not addressed Watson\u2019s primary and broader request for exclusion of all evidence of his involvement with bid-rigging. Nowhere in the record do we find a specification of what this request entailed. To the extent the request covered proof of his solicitation of bids, it was properly rejected since that evidence was highly probative of the element of knowledge. To the extent it referred to Watson\u2019s submission of complementary bids, the request was duplicative of the more specific prong of the motion which we have discussed. We find the district court properly rejected both parts of Watson\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXqq\">V. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">Finally, Watson objects to the trial court\u2019s failure to adopt six of his proposed jury instructions. Counsel discussed their respective proposed instructions with the trial judge at a conference before closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>arguments and then after summation, immediately prior to charging the jury. Neither at those times nor after the instructions were given to the jury did defense counsel make any specific objections to the charge as given or make specific objections to the court\u2019s failure to include defendant\u2019s proposed instructions. In fact, after the jury heard the charge and retired, defense counsel was asked if he had any objections to the instructions as given; he responded that he did not. In light of the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 30,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> such failure to place in the record specific objection to the alleged omissions precludes our review of the district court\u2019s refusal to include the six proposed instructions absent a determination that the omissions constituted plain error. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>542 F.2d 975, 981-82 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1073, 97 S.Ct. 810, 50 L.Ed.2d 790 (1977);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>539 F.2d 244, 249 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Honneus, </em>508 F.2d 566, 571 (1st Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1677, 44 L.Ed.2d 101 (1975). And we do not believe that this is an instance of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-14\">Defendant Watson\u2019s proposed instruction No. 2 on the elements of the offense and on the government\u2019s burden of proof was adequately covered by the court\u2019s instruction No. 14.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, Watson\u2019s proposed instruction No. 5 on the consideration to be given the testimony of accomplices was essentially a restatement of instruction No. 6 on the same subject which was given by the court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>was under no obligation to adopt the language requested in the proposed instruction since the charge given to the jury clearly and correctly stated the substance of the law. <em>United States v. Zarattini, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">In charging the jurors on the evaluation of testimony, the court gave a general, though abbreviated, instruction on witness credibility,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> an instruction on impeachment by prior inconsistent statements,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and an instruction on impeachment by prior conviction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendant urges reversal because of the omission of an additional proposed instruction on the weight to be given the testimony of immunized witnesses.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While inclusion of that instruction would have been desirable,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we believe the general instruction on credibility, the instruction on accomplice testimony, and defense counsel\u2019s development of the immunity issue in cross-examination and summation adequately alerted the jury to the caution necessary in weighing the testimony of immunized witnesses. <em>Cf. United States v. Rucker, </em>586 F.2d 899, 904 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>555 F.2d 238, 242-43 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Curry, </em>512 F.2d 1299, 1303 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 832, 96 S.Ct. 55, 46 L.Ed.2d 50 (1975). The two witnesses who testified under grants of immunity, Henry Eppel and Leonard Tobey, were both accomplices in the alleged bid-rigging scheme. Thus, the testimony which an immunized witness instruction would have told the jurors to view with care was the same testimony covered by the cautionary instruction on accomplice testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Our conclusion on the need for an immunity instruction might be different if the jury had not already received a warning covering the identical testimony. <em>Compare United States v. Morgan, supra, </em>555 F.2d at 243; <em>with United States v. Leonard, </em>494 F.2d 955, 959-62 (D.C.Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Watson also charges error in the omission of his requested instruction on the weight to be given the testimony of witnesses who have been convicted of perjury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Again, we find that the court\u2019s instructions \u2014 specifically those on impeachment by prior inconsistent statements and by evidence of prior convictions \u2014 were sufficient to apprise the jury of the considerations they were to give to the testimony of government witness Leonard Tobey. <em>Cf. United States v. Polizzi, </em>500 F.2d 856, 878 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1120, 95 S.Ct. 802, 42 L.Ed.2d 820 (1975); <em>United States v. Evanchik, </em>413 F.2d 950, 954 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>322 F.2d 306, 307 (4th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 970, 84 S.Ct. 490, 11 L.Ed.2d 418 (1964). The failure to grant defendant\u2019s requested instruction on perjury is not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">The last two instructions which Watson contends should have been included in the court\u2019s charge concern the element of knowledge. As noted above, conviction under \u00a7 1623(a) requires a finding that the defendant made a false statement to the grand jury, knowing the declaration to be false. In addition to describing the elements of the offense to the jury,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the court instructed the jury on the definitions which they were to apply to the words \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant urges error in the court\u2019s refusal to include the following requested instruction No. 1 in the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-12\">To establish intent in the case the government must prove that the defendant <em>deliberately </em>and <em>purposely </em>violated his oath to tell the truth by testifying to the truth of a fact which defendant did not believe to be true. Such intent may be determined from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-13\">An act is \u201cknowingly\u201d done, if done voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason, (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX6\">Obviously, the second paragraph of this requested instruction is repetitious of the court\u2019s charge on the definition of knowledge. To the extent that the first paragraph requires proof of a mental state different than that characterized by \u201cknowledge,\u201d we believe the request represents a misstatement of the law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-14\">Watson objects to the court\u2019s refusal to give the following proposed instruction No. 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-15\">The defendant may not be found guilty of perjury simply because he gave testimony which is factually incorrect. He may have given incorrect testimony because of surprise, confusion, haste, inadvertence, honest mistake as to facts, carelessness or negligence. As has been said, you may not find him guilty unless you find beyond reasonable doubt that the giving of false testimony was <em>willful, </em>and that the other elements of the offense are present, (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-16\">There is no evidence, nor do we understand Watson to have contended at trial, that he made incorrect statements to the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>jury because of misunderstanding, surprise, confusion, haste and so forth. We believe the court\u2019s instruction that \u201cknowingly\u201d does not include acts made \u201cbecause of mistake or accident or other innocent reason\u201d was, in this respect, more than adequate. <em>See United States v. Pommerening, </em>500 F.2d 92, 100 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1088, 95 S.Ct. 678, 42 L.Ed.2d 680 (1974). The final sentence of the proposed instruction, which would require the jury to find the violation \u201cwillful\u201d as a prerequisite to conviction, is an incorrect statement of the law; while conviction under the federal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, requires a showing of willfulness, that element is not required to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. <em>See United States v. Lardieri, </em>497 F.2d 317, 319-20 (3d Cir. 1974). We find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to give this requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1260-13\">.

Slawik, </em>548 F.2d at 79 &amp; 87, merely states that materiality, as an essential element of the crime of making false declarations before the grand jury, is a question of law to be determined by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-14\">Congress enacted \u00a7 1623 as part of the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act, 84 Stat. 922 <em>et seq., </em>to facilitate perjury prosecutions. H.Rep.No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4007, 4008. The House Judiciary Committee report recognized materiality as an essential element of the crime established by the new section. <em>Id. </em>at p. 4023. In noting that \u00a7 1623(e) abandons the two-witness rule previously applied in all perjury prosecutions, the committee report stated that \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt [is] . . sufficient for conviction [under this section].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 4024. There is no indication, however, that this reference applies to more than just the elements of the crime which are to be submitted for jury determination. Nowhere does the report manifest a legislative intent to alter the traditional rule that the element of materiality is a question of law for the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">.

His testimony may be received in evidence and considered by the jury even though not corroborated or supported by other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-17\">Such testimony, however, should be examined by you with greater care than the testimony of an ordinary witness. You should consider whether the testimony may be colored in such a way as to further the witness\u2019s [sic] own interest, for a witness who realizes that he may procure his own freedom by incriminating another has a motive to falsify. After such consideration, you may give the testimony of the immunized witness such weight as you feel it deserves.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1265-18\">.
