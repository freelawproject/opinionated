Commission Review Board No. 1, evaluating the evidence in light of the criteria set out in Section 209(b) of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> determined that a grant \u201cwould almost certainly divert traffic\u201d from Benmar and that the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate that the changing nature of Jubilee\u2019s requirements was a significant factor. Accordingly, Consolidated\u2019s application was denied by order dated May 12, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Consolidated filed a petition for reconsideration. Division 1, acting as an Appellate Division, reversed the order of the Review Board and granted the application, stating, in an order served October 14, 1977, that the changing character of Jubilee\u2019s requirements <em>was </em>a significant factor and that a denial of Consolidated\u2019s application would have an adverse effect upon Jubilee by burdening its product line expansion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Benmar\u2019s petition for reconsideration of the order of Division 1 was denied, Ben-mar filed a petition for judicial review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Subsequent to that filing in this Court the Commission reopened the proceeding on its own motion to consider the issue of dual operations by Consolidated as both a common carrier and a contract carrier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such dual operations were approved in a modified order served January 27, 1978. After its petition for reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s modified order was denied on April 18, 1978, Benmar filed an amended petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Ruling that only the initial October 5th order of Division 1 was properly before us, we granted Benmar\u2019s petition, vacated the October 5th order and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed, holding that we had erred in refusing to consider the two Commission orders served on January 27, 1978, and April 18, 1978. <em>United States v. Benmar Transport and Leasing Corp., </em>444 U.S. 4, 100 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed.2d 5 (1979) (per curiam). Pursuant to the directions of the Supreme Court we now shift our focus from the timing of the Commission\u2019s orders to their merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The only issue now remaining in the case is the propriety of the Commission\u2019s grant of Consolidated\u2019s application for contract carrier authority. Consolidated<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Commission<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> take the position that the grant was reasonable, lawful and supported by substantial evidence and therefore must be upheld. Because we regard Benmar\u2019s claims to the contrary as lacking in merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Our scope of review is narrow.

The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-20\">The test here is primarily one of rationality. If the Commission based its order on substantial relevant evidence, fairly ascertained, and if it has made no clear error of judgment, this court is not authorized to overturn that order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anp-dedup-0\"><em>Cross-Sound Ferry Services, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 729-30, <em>quoting </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., supra, </em>419 U.S. at 285-86, 95 S.Ct. at 441-442 (citations omitted). <em>Cf. International Detective Service, Inc. v. I. C. C., </em>613 F.2d 1067, 1073 n. 13 (D.C.Cir. 1979). With this standard in mind, we consider Benmar\u2019s attack on the Commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">\n<em>The Scope of Benmar\u2019s Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Benmar contends that the Commission\u2019s action in regard to Consolidated was premised on an arbitrary construction of the permits under which Benmar had been serving Jubilee since 1972. At the time of the Commission\u2019s decision in regard to Consolidated, Benmar\u2019s existing authority as described in its permits embraced \u201csuch commodities as are dealt in by ready-to-wear apparel stores and supplies used in the conduct of such business.\u201d The Commission concluded, based on the shipper\u2019s uncontradicted presentation, that Jubilee wished to ship several types of merchandise which are beyond the scope of \u201cready-to-wear apparel\u201d authority, such as sporting goods and lamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Benmar argues that the evidence shows that Jubilee and Benmar had always intended the generic \u201cready-to-wear apparel\u201d rubric \u201cto embrace the complete line of Jubilee\u2019s merchandise, and to obviate the need to modify or expand the commodity description each time a new line or product was added to shipper\u2019s store inventory.\u201d Brief at 16. Not surprisingly, Benmar has offered no authority for the proposition that the intent of the parties to a permit overrides the plain language selected as an expression of that intent. <em>Cf. Sims Motor Transport Lines, Inc. </em>\u2014 Revocation <em>of Certificate, </em>72 M.C.C. 355, 359 (1957) (where no patent ambiguity in certificate, no need to go behind it to ascertain intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Although many retailers have diversified their operations in recent years \u2014 and consumers have become accustomed to finding food sold in pharmacies and drugs sold in grocery stores, for example \u2014 we cannot say that the Commission has acted improperly in determining that a distinction yet remains between ready-to-wear apparel stores and department stores. The cases relied on by Benmar demonstrate only that in the face of this trend the Commission has attempted to be both flexible and realistic in interpreting the authority of contract carriers to provide expanded transportation services for shippers undergoing growth or diversification at a rate typical of such enterprises. These cases do not indicate that the distinctions among various types of merchandisers or generic commodity descriptions have been abolished. Nor do they indicate, more particularly, that the Commission has on other occasions declared sporting goods and lamps, for example, to be within the authority of a permit restricted to ready-to-wear apparel. <em>Compare </em>Docket No. MC-115212, <em>H. M. H. Motor Service Petition for Interpretation of Permit, </em>served August 4, 1964 (unpublished) and <em>Renner Motor Lines, Inc. Declaratory Order, </em>94 M.C.C. 605 (1964), <em>with Russell Transfer, Inc. </em>\u2014 Petition <em>for Declaratory Order, </em>118 M.C.C. 862 (1973). Benmar has failed to demonstrate the arbitrary nature of the Commission\u2019s performance of its line drawing responsibility in the case at bar. Under the circumstances, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Cf. Andrew G. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 554, 558, 78 S.Ct. 496, 499, 2 L.Ed.2d 484 (1958); <em>Hilt Truck Line, Inc. v. United States, </em>605 F.2d 1080 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>Pre-Fab Transit Co. v. United States, </em>595 F.2d 384 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>Chem-Haulers, Inc. v. I. C. C., </em>594 F.2d 166 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Dart Transit Co. v. United States, </em>567 F.2d 818, 820 (8th Cir. 1977) (\u201cThe Commission was specifically created for issuing carrier permits and is the body best suited to determine the extent and coverage of those permits.\u201d); <em>Ballentine Produce, Inc. v. United States, </em>209 F.Supp. 679, 683 (W.D.Ark.1962) (\u201cIt is our opinion that in an action such as this, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission with respect to the question of the scope or coverage of a permit which the Commission has issued to a motor carrier, if that question is at all doubtful,\u201d <em>quoting Dart Transit Co. v. I. C. C., </em>110 F.Supp. 876, 880 (D.Minn.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>(three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>345 U.S. 980, 73 S.Ct. 1138, 97 L.Ed. 1394 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"AV-\">\n<em>Application of Section 209(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Benmar also contends that the Commission improperly applied the criteria of Section 209(b) because it failed to consider the effect of its decision upon Benmar. Yet Division 1 explicitly stated that it was weighing the evidence in light of <em>all </em>the criteria listed in Section 209(b), as it is indeed required to do. <em>I. C. C. v. J-T Transport Co., </em>368 U.S. 81, 88-89, 82 S.Ct. 204, 209, 7 L.Ed.2d 147 (1961). It was not disputed that Benmar would suffer a diversion of traffic if Consolidated\u2019s application were granted,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Division 1 did not reject the Board\u2019s finding to that effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">Although section 209(b) requires consideration of the factors, neither it nor the Administrative Procedure Act [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] requires a detailed analysis of each and an explicit weighing of each against the other. The Commission\u2019s determination is adequate if logical processes in reaching that decision are reasonably discernible and the essential basic findings are revealed. ... In a comparable context this court has held that it should uphold agency findings of \u201cless than ideal clarity\u201d if satisfied from the determination that the administrators gave a \u201chard look\u201d at the relevant issues and if \u201cthe agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\"><em>International Detective Service, supra, </em>613 F.2d at 1077 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">It is well settled that a finding of adverse effect on protesting carriers is not determinative when other factors bearing on the public interest and national transportation policy are deemed to outweigh it. <em>See, e. g., International Detective Service, supra, </em>613 F.2d 1067 (shipper\u2019s need held to outweigh possible harm to existing carriers). <em>Cf. Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., supra, </em>419 U.S. at 298, 95 S.Ct. at 448 (common carrier case) (\u201cOur decisions have dispelled any notion that the Commission\u2019s primary obligation is the protection of firms holding existing certificates.\u201d). Furthermore it is clear from the cases that the Commission may \u201cconsider future needs and changes in commerce even when they are uncertain.\u201d <em>Miller Transporters, Inc. v. United States, </em>594 F.2d 463, 466 (5th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted). \u201cThe weight and credibility of the shipper testimony was a matter for the Commission; it was free to believe that the contemplated needs of the shippers who testified were genuine and significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a \u201cfuture needs\u201d case, the ICC\u2019s judgment is to be accorded great weight. <em>Appleyard\u2019s Motor Transportation Co. v. I. C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>C., </em>592 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1979), <em>citing United States v. Detroit &amp; Cleveland Navigation Co., </em>326 U.S. 236, 241, 66 S.Ct. 75, 77, 90 L.Ed. 38 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">\n<em>Procedural Propriety</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Benmar\u2019s remaining contentions are also lacking in merit. First, we do not regard the Commission\u2019s refusal to reopen its proceedings for the submission of additional evidence as a ground for setting aside the challenged orders because the new evidence proffered by Benmar is immaterial to the determinative questions in this case: whether Jubilee was planning to expand significantly its lines of merchandise, whether Benmar was authorized by permit to transport these new commodities, and whether Consolidated\u2019s permit would further the public interest and national transportation policy. Benmar\u2019s failure to claim that Jubilee has sold lamps or sporting goods in the past, or that Benmar has ever shipped such items for Jubilee, or that Jubilee has no intention of selling such items in the future cannot be cured by the proffer of inconclusive documents for the purpose of raising doubt about collateral, nondispositive questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Second, the Commission\u2019s failure to discuss the authorities cited by Benmar, while disappointing to Benmar, is of no legal significance in light of our conclusion that these cases simply do not stand for the propositions urged by Benmar. Where an agency has not been shown to have repudiated its own rules or norms, there is no \u201cdeparture\u201d in need of explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Third, although the Administrative Procedure Act requires an agency to include in its decision a statement of \u201cfindings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c), we are not disposed to overturn a sound decision if the agency\u2019s path, although not ideally clear, may reasonably be discerned. <em>Cross-Sound Ferry Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 730; <em>International Detective Service, supra, </em>613 F.2d at 1077; <em>Hilt Truck Line, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>605 F.2d at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Benmar has failed to show that the orders of the Commission were arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, an abuse of discretion or unsupported by substantial evidence. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\">. The orders Benmar seeks to have set aside were served October 14, 1977, January 27, 1978, and April 18, 1978.

While this is true, now when we are a \u201cready-to-wear apparel store,\u201d it does not fit into our future picture. Our company is expanding into new lines of merchandise. Our line of merchandise ... is now in the department store field rather than the \u201cready-to-wear apparel store\u201d field. For example, we are now ready to handle a line of toys, juvenile furniture, and sporting goods. We are now ready to transport equipment for these stores in addition to supplies.

Section 209(b) directed that permits be issued to qualified and able applicants only if the Commission determined that the operation thus authorized would be consistent with the public interest and national transportation policy. The statute specified five factors to be considered by the Commission in making such a determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR9\">In determining whether issuance of a permit will be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy declared in this Act, the Commission shall consider the number of shippers to be served by the applicant, the nature of the service proposed, the effect which granting the permit would have upon the services of the protesting carriers and the effect which denying the permit would have upon the applicant and/or its shipper and the changing character of that shipper\u2019s requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(b) (repealed October 17, 1978; recodified in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(2)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-13\">. The Division\u2019s order read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aj2-dedup-0\">We conclude that the review board erred in evaluating the fourth and fifth criteria of section 209(b). The board implied that a denial would have no adverse affect [sic] on the supporting shipper. The board also concluded that the changing character of shipper\u2019s requirements was not a significant factor. These two conclusions largely ignore the thrust of shipper\u2019s criticism of existing service. Shipper (a) asserts that it is attempting to alter the nature of its business by changing from ready-to-wear apparel stores to department stores, and (b) argues that the limited nature of Benmar\u2019s authority burdens product line expansion. Considering shipper\u2019s presentation, we find a rather detailed listing of goods shipper wishes to merchandise which are beyond the scope of Benmar\u2019s \u201cready-to-wear apparel\u201d authority, such as infants\u2019 furniture, lamps, sheets, sporting goods, and toys. It is clear that the changing character of shipper\u2019s transportation needs is a significant factor and equally clear that a denial of this application will have a substantial adverse affect [sic] on the shipper\u2019s expansion efforts. Weighing the evidence in light of [the] five criteria of section 209(b) we conclude that the application should be granted to the extent set forth in the appendix to this order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">Order served October 14, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\">. At the time of the proceedings before the Commission, Section 210 of the Interstate Commerce Act provided that the Commission could authorize dual operations (the holding of both a certif\u00edcate as a common carrier and a permit as a contract carrier within the same territory) only upon a determination that such dual operations were consistent with the public interest and national transportation policy. Consequently, the absence of such a finding by the Commission rendered the Division\u2019s initial order granting Consolidated\u2019s application defective under \u00a7 210. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 310 (repealed October 17, 1978); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10930.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-22\">.

Although Benmar claims that it will suffer a diversion of traffic, it stops short of asserting that its ability to compete will be destroyed. <em>Cf. May Trucking Co. v. United States, </em>593 F.2d 1349, 1356 (D.C.Cir. 1979). Indeed, in Order No. MC-112016 (Sub. Nos. 6, 9, 11, 12 (MI)), <em>Benmar Transport &amp; Leasing Corp., Petition for Modification, </em>served June 15, 1978, the Commission granted Benmar\u2019s petition to modify its operating authority to allow the carriage of commodities dealt in or used by discount department stores, thereby enabling Benmar to compete on an equal footing with Consolidated for Jubilee\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">We see no merit in Benmar\u2019s argument to the effect that the subsequent modification of its authority has undercut the only basis for the Commission\u2019s grant of Consolidated\u2019s permit. First, there is no basis for retroactively invalidating on the basis of subsequent events a Commission decision which was proper at the time it was rendered. Second, the decision of the Commission modifying Benmar\u2019s permits reaffirmed the ruling that Benmar\u2019s earlier permits did not encompass authority to meet all of Jubilee\u2019s future needs. Finally, the Commission\u2019s modification of Benmar\u2019s permits which has not been appealed by any party, constitutes an implicit recognition that it is in the public interest to have two competing contract carriers serving Jubilee. The statutory criteria for granting permits \u2014 the public interest and national transportation policy \u2014 both allow consideration of competition. <em>See International Detective Service, Inc. v.
