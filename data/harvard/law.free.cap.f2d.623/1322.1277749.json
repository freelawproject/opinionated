We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-15\">On November 27, 1974, the Provision House Workers Local 274 held its nomination meeting for local union elections, to be held on January 25, 1975. At this meeting, before nominations were accepted, the union\u2019s executive secretary read a set of proposed rules governing the conduct of the forthcoming elections. The meeting was noisy; it was difficult to hear the secretary\u2019s reading; and several union members who spoke Spanish could not understand the reading in English. The rules were adopted, however, without discussion, by voice vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-16\">The election rules included a provision that any candidate who wished the union to distribute his or her campaign literature must file a request for distribution with the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer within ten days after the nomination meeting. The purpose of this rule, which had not been imposed in previous elections, was to give the union\u2019s management sufficient lead time to make arrangements for handling mailing requests before the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-17\">Among the union members who attended the nomination meeting were Silverio Rivas, Gabriel Gastelum, and Rosalva Coronel (\u201cthe challengers\u201d). Rivas, Gastelum, and Coronel were nominated and campaigned for union office as members of an \u201canti-incumbent\u201d slate. Each of these candidates requested that the union distribute campaign materials, and the union denied these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>requests as untimely under the \u201cten-day rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">Rivas and Coronel wrote to the local requesting copies of the election rules on November 28, the day after the nomination meeting. The union\u2019s executive secretary received these requests on December 2 and responded to them on December 4. The candidates, including Gastelum, received their copies of the rules on December 7. Rivas and Gastelum both immediately requested union distribution of literature in letters received by the union on December 10 and December 11, respectively, 13 and 14 days after the nomination meeting, three and four days after the ten-day deadline. Coronel requested distribution in a letter received on December 27, twenty days after the deadline. The union denied each of these requests as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">Rivas and Gastelum, after the denial of their distribution requests, also asked the union to provide them with a list of employers having collective bargaining agreements with the union. The union denied this request. No incumbent candidate requested union distribution of campaign materials or sought to obtain lists of union employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">The incumbent slate defeated the challengers by large margins in the election of January 25, 1975. After protesting the fairness of the election and exhausting union post-election remedies, the challengers filed complaints with the Secretary of Labor under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482. The Secretary subsequently filed this action, seeking to set aside the election results, and Rivas, Coro-nel, and Leo Flores, a candidate who cooperated with their slate, were granted leave to intervene as plaintiffs. The district court granted summary judgment for Local 274, finding that the union had not breached its duty to distribute campaign materials and that the union was not required to provide candidates with lists of union employers. The appeal challenges both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">In relevant part, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c) provides that \u201cevery local labor organization, and its officers, shall be under a duty * * to comply with all reasonable requests of any candidate to distribute by mail or otherwise at the candidate\u2019s expense campaign literature in aid of [any] such person\u2019s candidacy to all members in good standing of such labor organization * * The Secretary contends that Local 274 violated this section by denying the challengers\u2019 requests for distribution that were made after the ten-day deadline imposed by the union\u2019s election rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">The district court made a finding of fact that the union \u201cdid not fail to comply with reasonable requests [by Rivas, Gastelum, and Coronel] to distribute by mail campaign literature in aid of their candidacies * If, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the challengers, this fact was not reasonably in dispute, then the union was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-17\">Neither the legislative history of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor the academic commentary on that act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defines a standard of \u201creasonableness\u201d in this context. The Supreme Court has, however, considered the meaning of the term \u201creasonable qualifications\u201d under \u00a7 481(e) and found that \u201creasonableness\u201d in that context must be \u201cmeasured in terms of * * * consistency with the Act\u2019s command to unions to conduct \u2018free and democratic\u2019 union elections.\u201d <em>Steelworkers v. Usery, </em>429 U.S. 305, 309, 97 S.Ct. 611, 614, 50 L.Ed.2d 502 (1977), quoting with approval, <em>Wirtz v. Hotel Employees, </em>391 U.S. 492, 499, 88 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 20 L.Ed.2d 763 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>(1968). Because rules governing distribution of campaign materials, like qualifications for candidacy, implicate the fairness of union elections, Local 274\u2019s failure to mail the challengers\u2019 literature should be tested against the <em>Hotel Employees </em>standards. <em>See Marshall v. Local 478, Laborers\u2019 Int'l, </em>461 F.Supp. 185, 188-90 (S.D.Fla. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">The Secretary, while not contending that the union\u2019s ten-day rule is not per se unreasonable, contends that its application in these circumstances unreasonably limited Local 274\u2019s distribution duty under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c). Because the rule was applied unreasonably, the Secretary argues, distribution requests that did not satisfy the rule were not necessarily unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">The Secretary asserts that the union\u2019s enforcement of the ten-day rule was unreasonable in three respects. First, because the rule had not been previously imposed and because conditions at the nomination meeting prevented candidates from understanding the reading of the rules, the challengers were effectively without notice of the ten-day requirement. Second, once the challengers learned of the new rule, they attempted to comply with it. Rivas and Gastelum mailed written requests for distribution of campaign materials immediately after receiving copies of the election rules on December 7, the union\u2019s deadline date under the ten-day rule for receiving such requests. The Secretary contends, finally, that the union\u2019s enforcement of the rule was unnecessary, that Local 274 could have complied with distribution requests received six weeks before the election without compromising the administrative lead time justifications for the ten-day rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">These arguments, and the factual evidence presented to support them, do not persuade us that a factual dispute was raised as to the reasonableness of the denials. Nor do they dissuade us that, as a matter of law, Local 274, consistent with considerations of union democracy, did not fail to comply with reasonable requests for the distribution of campaign materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">The challengers may not have had perfect notice of the ten-day rule. Nevertheless, the trial court received credible evidence that this ignorance was attributable to the challengers\u2019 inattention to the nomination meeting rather than to any failure of the union to adequately communicate the election requirements. Indeed, the union, by announcing the ten-day rule at the nomination meeting, was complying with the Department of Labor\u2019s regulations governing union elections. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 452.67.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">The Secretary\u2019s second contention, that the challengers made every effort to satisfy the ten-day rule, is similarly unconvincing. The challengers\u2019 attempts to comply with the deadline date are immaterial if their own negligence caused the initial noncompliance. Furthermore, the record demonstrates that, although the challengers received copies of the election rules on the tenth day after the nomination meeting and could have satisfied the ten-day rule by personally delivering their requests for distribution to the union secretary on the same day, they chose, instead, to mail their requests which, consequently, arrived after the deadline date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">Finally, contrary to the Secretary\u2019s assertions, enforcement of the ten-day rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>may have been necessary. Making exceptions to the rule, by complying with the challengers\u2019 late distribution requests, could have undercut the purpose of the election rules \u2014 to eliminate the potential for discrimination among candidates by establishing a uniform set of standards governing all candidates. Candidates challenging incumbent union officers normally expect to do some homework and to comply with rules. We conclude that the district court could properly find that, because strict enforcement of the ten-day rule was necessary, distribution requests violating that requirement were unreasonable and the union had no duty to comply with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">The Secretary next contends that the union further violated \u00a7 481(c) by refusing to provide the challengers with lists of union employers. This argument is advanced on two levels. First, because the union refused to mail the candidates\u2019 materials, it incurred an affirmative obligation to help them distribute campaign literature in another fashion \u2014 directly, at job sites. The Secretary also argues that the union, by refusing to furnish employer lists, was discriminating against the nonincumbent candidates because the incumbents had access to those lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">These arguments would expand 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c) beyond its plain meaning. The section defines candidates\u2019 rights to membership lists very narrowly: each candidate has the right to inspect a list of union members\u2019 names and addresses once within thirty days of an election. There is no statutory right to obtain a list of union employers. A nonstatutory right is not lightly to be inferred. The legislative history of the LMRDA demonstrates a congressional intent that the use of membership lists be severely limited and that such lists be kept out of the hands of partisans in union campaigns to avoid coercion of members. <em>See Legislative History of Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, </em>1240-41 (1959 ed.); Note, <em>Union Elections and the LMRDA: Thirteen Years of Use and Abuse, </em>81 Yale L.J. 407, 457 (1972). <em>But cf. </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>at 457 n. 227 (criticizing congressional purposes in limiting use of lists). The same policies apply to employer lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">The Secretary\u2019s contention that a right to employer lists was recognized in <em>Schultz v. Radio Officers\u2019 Union, </em>344 F.Supp. 58 (S.D. N.Y.1972), is inapposite. There, many of the union\u2019s members were at sea for long periods, and the only way members could be contacted was through mailings to their \u201cemployer\u2019s address,\u201d the ship. The court found that candidates had no general right to the ship\u2019s lists, but that, because use of the lists would afford a candidate a distinct advantage over opponents, once one candidate used the lists, all candidates must be given copies. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69. <em>Schultz, </em>then, was an anti-discrimination case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-12\">Here, while the union incumbents had access to the office and thus to employer lists, there is no evidence that they made campaign use of the lists.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because unequal access alone does not warrant a finding of \u201cdiscrimination * * * with respect to the use of lists of members,\u201d there was no violation of \u00a7 481(c). <em>See Schultz v. Radio Officers\u2019 Union, supra, </em>at 69; <em>Wirtz v. American Guild of Variety Artists, </em>267 F.Supp. 527, 543 (S.D.N.Y.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-13\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">. <em>Legislative History of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 </em>(1959 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1384-10\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Cox, <em>Internal Affairs of Labor Unions Under the Labor Reform Act of 1959, 58 </em>Mich.L.Rev. 819, 844 (1960); Note, <em>Union Elections and the LMRDA: Thirteen Years of Use and Abuse, </em>81 Yale L.J. 407, 457 (1972) (recognizing that the definition of \u201creasonable\u201d is the crucial question under \u00a7 481(c), but offering no guidance in developing such a definition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">. The district court might have found that the challengers\u2019 requests were unreasonable for reasons other than the violation of the ten-day rule, but nothing in the record supports such an assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.67 reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-8\">\u201cIn order to avoid charges of disparity of treatment among candidates, it is advised that a union inform all candidates in advance of the conditions under which distribution will be made and promptly advise them of any change in those conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1385-14\">. The Secretary\u2019s reliance on <em>Marshall v. Local 478, Laborers\u2019 International, </em>461 F.Supp. 185 (S.D.Fla. 1978) is misplaced. In that case, the union refused to comply with all distribution requests, stating that its office staff was too busy with its regular work to assist any candidate. Here, Local 274 was willing to comply with any distribution request that did not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>late its campaign rules. The record before us supports the conclusion that the challengers could have satisfied these rules, including the ten-day requirement, but failed to do so because of their own negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1386-15\">.
