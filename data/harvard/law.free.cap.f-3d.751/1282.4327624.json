A nation of pragmatists, we tend to forget our history until necessity revives our memory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To resolve this contract claim by Shell Oil Co. (\u201cShell\u201d), Atlantic Richfield Co. (\u201cARCO\u201d), Texaco, Inc. (\u201cTexaco\u201d), and Union Oil Co. of California (\u201cUnion Oil\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Oil Companies\u201d), we must recall and place into its appropriate context the atmosphere of stark determination for victory at all costs, which drove our war effort after the Japanese Empire attacked the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor on December 7,1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">Each of the Oil Companies entered into contracts with the United States to provide high-octane aviation gas (\u201cavgas\u201d) to fuel military aircraft as part of the national war effort (\u201cthe avgas contracts\u201d). The production of avgas resulted in waste products such as spent alkylation acid and \u201cacid sludge.\u201d The Oil Companies disposed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>such acid waste by contracting with Eli McColl, a former Shell engineer, to dump the waste at real property in Fullerton, California (\u201cthe McColl site\u201d). Over fifty years later, California and the United States obtained compensation from the Oil Companies pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq., for the costs of cleaning up the McColl site. The Oil Companies filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, arguing the avgas contracts require the Government to indemnify them for the CERCLA costs. The Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment in favor of the Government and denied the Oil Companies\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. United States, </em>108 Fed.Cl. 422 (Fed.Cl.2013) <em>(\u201cShell Remand Decision </em>\u201d). Because the avgas contracts require the Government to reimburse the Oil Companies for their CERCLA \u201ccharges,\u201d this court reverses with respect to breach of contract liability. The Court of Federal Claims correctly determined, however, that material factual disputes preclude granting summary judgment on damages, and that issue is accordingly remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">I. World War II and the Need for Avgas</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Compared to other available fuels, high-octane avgas enabled aircraft to fly faster and higher, with improved rates of climb and higher payload carrying capacity. It was \u201cthe most critically needed refinery product\u201d during World War II and was essential to the United States\u2019 war effort.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. 477 \u00b6 4. It was still a new technology in the late 1930s, however, and production was nowhere near sufficient for the massive quantities the United States and its allies would need to prosecute the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">In 1942 and 1943, the Government, acting through the Defense Supplies Corporation (\u201cDSC\u201d) entered into the avgas contracts with the Oil Companies. The avgas contracts were long-term (primarily three-year) contracts to purchase avgas from the Oil Companies\u2019 refineries in Southern California, and enabled the Oil Companies to build the new refining facilities needed to produce the high levels of avgas vital to the war effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">At the time the contracts were signed, the Government exercised substantial wartime regulatory control over almost every aspect of the petroleum industry. It had authority to impose obligatory product orders on private companies, with noncompliance subject to criminal sanctions or Government takeover. <em>See </em>Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, Pub.L. No. 76-783, ch. 720, \u00a7 9, 54 Stat. 885, 892 (1940). Facilities that accepted such obligatory product orders had to prioritize government military contracts above all other contracts. Act of May 31, 1941, Pub.L. No. 77-89, ch. 157, 55 Stat. 236 (1941). To the extent facilities relied on scarce raw materials, the Government could regulate supply chains to ensure continuing production. <em>Id.; see also </em>Second War Powers Act of 1942, Pub.L. No. 77-507, eh. 199, \u00a7 301, 56 Stat 176, 178 (1942) (authorizing the President to allocate any material or facility as necessary \u201cin the public interest and to promote the national defense\u201d whenever the country\u2019s defense needs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>would create a shortage in such materials or facilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The Government regulatory entities most relevant to the avgas contracts were (1) the Office of Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense (\u201cOPC\u201d), later replaced by the Petroleum Administration for War (\u201cPAW\u201d), and (2) the Office of Production Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), later run by and then replaced by the War Production Board (\u201cWPB\u201d). The WPB and PAW were created in January and December 1942, respectively. The WPB had primary authority over war procurement and production, and cooperated with the PAW to determine petroleum requirements and set national priorities for supplying the petroleum industry. Subject to the direction of the WPB, the PAW was charged with ensuring \u201cadequate supplies of petroleum for military, or other essential uses\u201d and \u201c[e]ffect[ing] the proper distribution of such amounts of materials.\u201d Exec. Order No. 9276, 7 Fed.Reg. 10,091, 10,092 (Dec. 4, 1942). The \u201cPAW told the refiners what to make, how much of it to make, and what quality.\u201d John W. Frey &amp; H. Chandler Ide, <em>A History of the Petroleum Administration for War </em>219 (1946), <em>available at </em>J.A.1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Days after Pearl Harbor, the Government recognized the need to quickly mobilize avgas production, with the OPC stating: \u201c \u2018It is <em>essential, </em>in the national interest that the supplies of all grades of aviation gasoline for military, defense and essential civilian uses <em>be increased immediately to the maximum.\u2019\u201d </em>J.A. 498-99 (quoting OPC Recommendation No. 16) (emphases added). Then-existing facilities could not produce the required levels of avgas, necessitating construction of additional facilities. However, the Government\u2019s substantial authority to control production only extended to <em>existing </em>facilities; it could not force companies to invest in new ones. <em>See, e.g., </em>An Act to Expedite National Defense and for Other Purposes, Pub.L. No. 76-671, ch. 440, \u00a7 8(b), 54 Stat. 676, 680 (1940) (authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to nationalize and operate \u201cany <em>existing </em>manufacturing plant or facility necessary for the national defense\u201d when certain conditions were met) (emphasis added). A further stumbling block for the Government was that contracts with the Army and the Navy were subject to annual Congressional appropriations and thus limited to a one-year term. Such one-year contracts did not provide the long-term security necessary to justify the Oil Companies\u2019 investment in new facilities. In light of these limitations, the Government turned to the DSC, a government-owned corporation authorized to acquire critical and strategic materials, including avgas.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The DSC was a subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (\u201cRFC\u201d), another government-owned corporation. The designation in 1941 of avgas as a critical material enabled the RFC and its subsidiaries to buy, sell, and produce avgas and to make loans to companies to construct avgas production facilities. <em>See </em>Act of June 25, 1940, Pub.L. No. 76-664, ch. 427, \u00a7 5(1), 54 Stat. 572, 573 (codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 606b (1940)). After purchasing avgas from the Oil Companies, the DSC resold it to the Army and the Navy at the national price established by the PAW (or its predecessor, the OPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Between 1942 and 1943, the Oil Companies entered into contracts with the DSC agreeing to sell vast quantities of avgas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>The contracts set forth a base price for each barrel of avgas, which was negotiated individually with each refiner based on the refiner\u2019s production costs. The base price was calculated with the goal of permitting an estimated profit of between 6% and 7%. Profits were further subject to the Renegotiation Act of 1942, which required contractors to repay excess profits to the Government. Pub.L. No. 77-528, ch. 247, \u00a7 408, 56 Stat. 226, 245 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Given the low profit margin, the avgas contracts contained various concessions to the Oil Companies. They were three-year contracts, thus providing some measure of certainty that the newly-constructed avgas production facilities would pay off over time. They also contained cost-allocation measures to limit the Oil Companies\u2019 risk in producing avgas. For instance, the agreed-upon base price of avgas was subject to adjustment depending on the Oil Companies\u2019 costs, including the price of crude and other raw materials, and the transportation of raw materials. The contracts also required the Buyer, DSC, to pay \u201cany <em>now existing </em>taxes, fees, or charges ... imposed upon [the Oil Companies] by reason of the production, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of [av-gas].\u201d <em>E.g., </em>J.A. 111 (1942 Shell contract) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Relevant to the CERCLA charges in this case, another subsection required DSC to reimburse the Oil Companies for \u201cany <em>new or additional </em>taxes, fees, or <em>charges, ... </em>which [the Oil Companies] may be required by any municipal, state, or federal law in the United States or any foreign country to collect or pay by reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery of the [avgas]\u201d (\u201cthe new or additional charges provision\u201d). <em>E.g., </em>J.A. Ill (emphases added). These price-adjustment mechanisms ensured the Oil Companies would not be forced into loss-making activities by factors outside their control, such as the costs of materials and transportation, or unforeseen Government-imposed charges. The avgas contracts thus \u201cassured the manufacturer of his costs, plus a fair but moderate profit.\u201d J.A. 1996 (statement of the Chief Legal Counsel for the PAW to the House Appropriations Committee).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">During contract negotiation and the years that followed, the Government\u2019s primary concern was maximum avgas production. The Government directed the Oil Companies to \u201cundertake extraordinary modes of operation which were often uneconomical and unanticipated at the time of refiners\u2019 entry into their [avgas] contracts.\u201d J.A. 514. For example, the PAW sometimes ordered companies to purchase raw materials outside their normal supply chain to achieve maximum avgas production. The Aviation Gasoline Reimbursement Plan required the Government to assume the costs of such uneconomical operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The arrangement between the Oil Companies and the Government was a cooperative endeavor in which the Oil Companies worked to achieve the Government\u2019s goal of maximizing avgas production and the Government assumed the risks of such increased production. The Oil Companies held up their end of the bargain: avgas production increased over twelve-fold from approximately 40,000 barrels per day in December 1941 to 514,000 barrels per day in 1945, and was crucial to Allied success in the war.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>II. Avgas Production and Waste Products</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Avgas consists of an ordinary gasoline base, blended with petroleum distillates and chemical additives. Alkylate is the most prevalent additive (at an amount of 25% to 40%) and is produced by alkylation, a process that uses 98% purity sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Because of the importance of avgas to the war effort, the WPB directed most available sulfuric acid to av-gas production.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Spent alkylation acid is a byproduct of alkylation, and has a lower acid content than sulfuric acid. During the relevant time period, spent alkylation acid could be (1) reprocessed to its former 98% acid percentage, (2) used to process other petroleum products, like motor gasoline and kerosene, or (3) discarded as waste. Treating other petroleum products with spent alkylation acid further diluted its acid content until it became \u201cacid sludge,\u201d which had acid levels of between 35% and 65%.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Predictably, the Oil Companies\u2019 success in increasing avgas production resulted in a corresponding increase in sulfuric acid consumption, which increased five-fold from 1941 to 1944.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Facilities to reprocess the spent alkylation acid did not increase apace, however. The Government twice refused applications to construct new acid processing facilities, and one of the facilities that did exist failed to operate at its design capacity. Moreover, the scarcity of available railroad tank cars (and the WPB\u2019s refusal to make transportation of acid waste a priority) meant the Oil Companies were unable to transport acid sludge for reprocessing or other uses. <em>See </em>J.A. 565-66 (acid sludge could be used as fertilizer, but the scarcity of railroad tank cars prevented transporting acid sludge to the fertilizer plant). By late 1944 and 1945, the Oil Companies were unable to reuse the vast amounts of spent alkylation acid at their own refineries, and ultimately dumped much of it at the McColl site. Although dumping and burning acid waste were common before the war, the lack of reprocessing facilities and transportation options (and resulting bottleneck of acid waste) necessitated dumping and burning larger quantities of acid waste than ever before.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The Oil Companies dumped waste at the McColl site from 1942 until shortly after the war ended. Approximately 12% of the waste was spent alkylation acid, and another 82.5% was acid sludge resulting from chemical treatment of other petroleum products. The remaining 5.5% was acid sludge arising from treatment of Government-owned benzol, for which the Government was held hable in the CERCLA litigation. Only the non-benzol waste (i.e., the spent alkylation acid and the remaining acid sludge) is at issue in this case. Shell contributed most of the acid waste at the McColl site\u2014at least 60%. ARCO contributed 10% to 20%, and also relied on other disposal methods, such as burning. Texaco dumped no waste until almost the end of the war, and instead burned its acid sludge waste until late 1944. Some of Union Oil\u2019s sludge was reprocessed rather than dumped.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The Allies achieved victory in Europe on May 8, 1945. Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945. The United States Government no longer required huge quantities of avgas, and terminated the avgas contracts in 1945 or soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">III. McColl CERCLA Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Over 45 years later, in 1991, the United States and California brought a CERCLA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>action against the Oil Companies to recover the costs of cleaning up the McColl site. The district court held the Oil Companies, among other parties, were jointly and severally liable for the acid waste they dumped at the McColl site, <em>United States v. Shell Oil Co. (Shell I), </em>841 F.Supp. 962, 976 (C.D.Cal.1993), but then allocated 100% of the cleanup costs to the Government as an \u201carranger\u201d of the disposal, <em>United States v. Shell Oil Co. (Shell </em>II), 13 F.Supp.2d 1018, 1030 (C.D.Cal.1998); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(3) (1994) (extending CERCLA liability to \u201cany person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances\u201d). The Ninth Circuit affirmed the Oil Companies\u2019 liability, but reversed the allocation to the United States, holding the United States was not an \u201carranger\u201d for the non-benzol acid waste. <em>United States v. Shell Oil Co. (Shell III), </em>294 F.3d 1045, 1056, 1058 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cNo court has imposed arranger liability on a party who never owned or possessed, and never had any authority to control or duty to dispose of, the hazardous materials at issue.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Following remand, the district court transferred the Oil Companies\u2019 breach of contract counterclaim to the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. The Oil Companies voluntarily dismissed the transferred Complaint without prejudice, exhausted their administrative remedies with the General Services Administration pursuant to the Contract Settlement Act of 1944 (\u201cCSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 78-395, ch. 358, 58 Stat. 694 (1944) (codified at 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 113, et seq. (2006)), and filed a new Complaint in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking reimbursement for the CERCLA costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">IV. Court of Federal Claims Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The Court of Federal Claims entered summary judgment in favor of the Oil Companies with respect to breach of contract liability and damages, holding the Government was required to reimburse the Oil Companies for 100% of their nonbenzol CERCLA costs. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 439, 442 (2010); <em>Shell Oil Co. v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 153 (2010). On appeal, this court found the presiding trial judge had a conflict of interest arising from his wife\u2019s stock ownership of Chevron Corp., the parent company of plaintiffs-appellants Texaco and Union Oil. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. United States, </em>672 F.3d 1283, 1294 (Fed.Cir.2012). Because the judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself was not harmless error, this court vacated and remanded with instructions that the case be reassigned to a different judge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">On remand, the Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment in favor of the Government. <em>Shell Remand Decision, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 422. It held there were three independent reasons why the Oil Companies were not entitled to reimbursement under the avgas contracts. First, it held the CERCLA costs incurred by the Oil Companies were not \u201ccharges\u201d within the meaning of the new or additional charges provision in the avgas contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 434. Second, even if the contracts required reimbursement, the court found the Oil Companies released.any valid claim when the contracts were terminated and \u201call other issues\u201d were settled in the mid-to-late 1940s. <em>Id. </em>at 436. Finally, the court held that even if the Oil Companies had otherwise valid indemnification claims based on the avgas contracts, the Anti-Deficiency Act barred such indemnification. <em>Id. </em>at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">The Court of Federal Claims denied the Oil Companies\u2019 motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>ment for the additional reason that there were disputed facts over how much of the non-benzol waste at the McColl site was dumped \u201cby reason of\u2019 the Oil Companies\u2019 \u201cproduction, manufacture, sale or delivery\u201d of avgas. <em>Id. </em>at 446-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The Oil Companies filed this timely appeal. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">On appeal, the Oil Companies challenge each of the three independent bases for the trial court\u2019s decision. They further contend there is no genuine dispute that they are entitled to recover 100% of the non-benzol CERCLA costs. Each argument is addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">This court reviews the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 contract interpretation de novo. <em>Ford Motor Co. v. United States, </em>378 F.3d 1314, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2004). \u201cSummary judgments also receive plenary review, the appellate tribunal applying the same criteria as did the trial court, with all justifiable factual inferences drawn in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">I. The Avgas Contracts Require Reimbursement of the Oil Companies\u2019 CERCLA Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The parties dispute the meaning of \u201ccharges\u201d as it appears in the new or additional charges provision. The Oil Companies contend it is a broad indemnification provision designed to reimburse the Oil Companies for all Government-imposed \u201cexpenses\u201d or \u201ccosts,\u201d including CERCLA response costs. The Government claims that the plain language of the contract and other contemporaneous wartime contracts show that environmental cleanup costs are not \u201ctaxes, fees, or charges\u201d as contemplated by the avgas contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The avgas contracts promise reimbursement for \u201cany new or additional taxes, fees, or charges\u201d imposed on the Oil Companies, with certain exceptions not relevant here. <em>E.g., </em>J.A. 111. The two paragraphs following this provision require the Government to pay \u201cany now existing taxes, fees, or charges,\u201d and describe the Government\u2019s obligation in the event of a disagreement regarding the contractor\u2019s entitlement to an exemption. <em>E.g., </em>J.A. 111-12. The avgas contracts provide (with some insignificant wording variations marked in brackets):</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Taxes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-12\">[ (a) ] Buyer shall pay in addition to the prices as established in [Sections IV and V] hereof [\u201cPrice and Payment\u201d and \u201cPrice Escalation\u201d clauses], any new or additional taxes, fees, or <em>charges, </em>other than income, excess profits, or corporate franchise taxes, which Seller may be required by any municipal, state, or federal law in the United States or any foreign country to collect or pay by reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery of the commodities delivered hereunder. Buyer shall also pay any such taxes on crude petroleum, or the transportation thereof, to the extent such taxes result in increased cost of the commodities delivered hereunder not compensated for by [Section V] hereof.

In light of the common meaning of \u201ccharges\u201d as \u201ccosts or expenses,\u201d and because the Government\u2019s own proposed definition accords with that meaning, this court interprets \u201ccharges\u201d to mean \u201ccosts.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The Government nevertheless argues that \u201ccharges\u201d cannot include CERCLA costs, because \u201cthe word \u2018charge\u2019 appears nowhere in CERCLA, with the exception of its use in the context of \u2018person in charge,\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9603, 9604, and one discussion of a party \u2018sought to be charged\u2019 for \u2018natural resource damage.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(f)(1).\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 29. The Government further observes that \u201cthe district court and appellate CERCLA cases underpinning this matter wholly lack the word \u2018charge\u2019 \u201d (with exceptions not relevant here), and argues that \u201cone need look no further than those cases to determine that the CERCLA response costs here have not been held to be \u2018charges\u2019 under any definition of that term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s arguments, CERCLA costs are \u201ccharges\u201d within the meaning of the relevant contract provision: The avgas contracts promise reimbursement of <em>\u201cany </em>new or additional ... charges\u201d the Government imposes on the Oil Companies \u201cby reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery of [avgas].\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 111 (emphasis added).

The plain language of the new or additional charges provision thus requires the Government to indemnify the Oil Companies for CERCLA costs incurred \u201cby reason of\u2019 the avgas contracts. The Government\u2019s search for exactitude in the CERCLA context is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The Government argues that other textual indicators in the avgas contracts require limiting the scope of indemnification. For instance, it argues the new or additional charges provision only extends to charges imposed by \u201cduly constituted and authorized governmental tax authorities].\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 35 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (modification in original). The \u201cduly constituted ... tax authority\u201d language is located two paragraphs after the new or additional charges provision, and addresses when \u201cthe parties cannot agree ... whether or not Buyer or Seller is entitled to exemption ... by virtue of Buyer\u2019s governmental status\u201d (\u201cthe exemption provision\u201d). <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 112. In such cases, \u201cthe burden shall be upon Buyer to obtain a ruling in writing from a <em>duly constituted and authorized governmental tax authority </em>as to such exemption.\u201d J.A. 112 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The exemption provision is not relevant to the proper meaning of \u201ccharges.\u201d Only two of the contracts\u2019 exemption provisions (the ARCO contracts) refer to exemption from a \u201cgiven tax, fee or charge,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>J.A. 207; the remaining contracts refer only to \u201cexemption from a given tax,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>J.A. 112. The Government argues that the association in the ARCO contracts between \u201ctaxes, fees, or charges\u201d and a \u201cgovernmental tax authority\u201d necessitates finding that \u201ccharges\u201d is limited to taxes imposed by such bodies. The other six contracts, however, refer only to <em>taxes </em>imposed by a \u201cgovernmental tax authority,\u201d omitting fees and charges. To the extent any conclusion can be drawn from such language, the express exclusion of \u201cfees or charges\u201d in most of the contracts suggests that the parties recognized fees and taxes were riot limited to taxes imposed by tax authorities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Moreover, no contrary conclusion could be reconciled with the new or additional charges provision at issue, which expressly applies to charges \u201crequired by <em>any municipal, state, or federal law in the United States or any foreign country,\u201d </em>and is clearly not limited to laws enforced by tax authorities. J.A. 111 (emphasis added). \u201cWe must interpret the contract in a manner that gives meaning to all of its provisions and makes sense.\u201d <em>McAbee Constr., Inc. v. United States, </em>97 F.3d 1431, 1435 (Fed.Cir.1996). It would make little sense to give determinative weight to a phrase that appears in a separate provision, in a minority of the contracts, and which contradicts the plain scope of the relevant language. After proposing a broad meaning of \u201ccharges\u201d that includes CERCLA costs, the Government has not shown that other portions of the contract exempt the Government from indemnifying the Oil Companies for CERCLA costs imposed as a result of the avgas contracts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>The Government nevertheless argues that indemnification is improper because the promise to pay for new or additional charges cannot encompass environmental liability. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. 18 (\u201c[T]he \u2018Taxes\u2019 clause lacks any language that could be construed to cover environmental remediation resulting from the oil companies\u2019 own decisions to dump acid waste.\u201d). It argues the avgas contracts are distinguishable from the World War II procurement contracts in <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>where this court required CERCLA indemnification. <em>See E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1367 (Fed.Cir.2004); <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>378 F.3d at 1314. The indemnification provision in <em>DuPont, </em>for example, agreed \u201c \u2018to hold [DuPont] harmless against any loss, expense (including expense of litigation), or damage (including damage to third persons because of death, bodily injury or property injury or destruction or otherwise) of any kind whatsoever,\u2019 \u201d as long as the loss resulted from performance under the contract and did not result from the negligence of DuPont corporate officers or representatives. <em>DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1372 (citation omitted) (emphases removed). This court held <em>DuPont\u2019s </em>\u201chold harmless\u201d provision \u2018\u201cshow[ed] an intent to allocate all possible liabilities among the parties,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018CERCLA liability must be included among the future unknown liabilities which the parties allocated between themselves.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1373 (quoting <em>Elf Atochem N. Am. v. United States, </em>866 F.Supp. 868, 870 (E.D.Pa.1994)). The procurement contract in <em>Ford</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><em>Motor Co. </em>required reimbursement of \u201callowable costs,\u201d including \u201c \u2018loss or destruction of or damage to property as may arise out of or in connection with the performance of the work under this contract,\u2019 \u201d which this court held covered CERCLA liability. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>378 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The Government argues the avgas contracts contain neither a \u201chold harmless\u201d provision, as in <em>DuPont, </em>nor an \u201callowable costs\u201d provision, as in <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>As the Government concedes, however, \u201cno \u2018special words\u2019 are required to create a promise of indemnification.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 37 (quoting <em>Corbitt v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., </em>654 F.2d 329, 334 (5th Cir. 1981)). While it is true that the language in the avgas contracts differs from the contract language in <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>the relevant portions of the latter contracts also differed from one another. The proper question is whether the avgas contracts require the Government to pay the Oil Companies\u2019 CERCLA charges. Indemnification is required by the contracts\u2019 promise to pay for \u201cany\u201d government-imposed \u201ccharges\u201d incurred \u201cby reason of\u2019 the avgas contracts, and it is immaterial whether the new or additional charges provision is identical to the provisions in <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The Government further argues the new or additional charges provision \u201cdoes not contemplate indemnity for damages sounding in tort,\u201d and therefore cannot require CERCLA indemnification. Appellee\u2019s Br. 34. It relies on a statement in <em>DuPont </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>that \u201cCERCLA evolved from the doctrine of common law nuisance.\u201d <em>DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1373. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, <em>DuPont </em>supports requiring CERCLA indemnification in this case. In <em>DuPont, </em>the Government argued the contract\u2019s \u201chold harmless\u201d provision did not require reimbursement for CERCLA liability because CERCLA was not foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into. <em>Id. </em>This court rejected that argument, holding there was \u201cno basis in the law for reading a limitation of foreseeability\u201d into the contract, which \u201cevidence[d] ... that indemnification was available for all claims, foreseeable or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the alternative, the <em>DuPont </em>court noted the Government\u2019s concession that nuisance liability would have been foreseeable, and observed that \u201cCERCLA evolved from the doctrine of common law nuisance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">As in <em>DuPont, </em>the avgas contract\u2019s new or additional charges provision requires reimbursement for even unforeseeable charges. The relevant provision in <em>DuPont </em>made no mention of new or additional charges, yet was nonetheless found to encompass unforeseeable CERCLA liability. The avgas contracts\u2019 promise to reimburse for \u201cnew or additional\u201d charges must similarly extend to \u201call claims, foreseeable or not.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The <em>DuPont </em>court\u2019s alternative reasoning, based on nuisance liability, is irrelevant to the interpretation of the new or additional charges provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The Government offers other contemporaneous contracts as extrinsic evidence that the new or additional charges provision does not require CERCLA indemnification. It relies on Government contracts with Humble Oil and DuPont that contain both a \u201chold harmless\u201d clause and a promise to reimburse for applicable taxes and charges. <em>See </em>J.A. 889-90, 898-99 (Humble Oil contract June 1, 1944); J.A. 845, 850 (DuPont contract Nov. 28, 1940). The Government argues these contracts provide \u201cpowerful evidence\u201d that the new or additional charges provision \u201c[was] never intended to provide the sort of indemnity that the oil companies seek.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The Government has not established ambiguity in the relevant provision, in the absence of which it is improper to rely on extrinsic evidence. <em>See Coast Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1035, 1040 (Fed.Cir.2003) (en banc) (\u201cIf the provisions are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and we may not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret them.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government\u2019s argument is also unpersuasive since the taxes clauses in the DuPont and Humble contracts are not the same as the new or additional charges provision in the avgas contracts. The Humble and DuPont contracts promise reimbursement for \u201c[a]ll applicable taxes, and other proper charges,\u201d J.A. 850, and \u201cany applicable Federal, State or local taxes, assessments or charges,\u201d respectively. J.A. 889. They do not extend to \u201cnew or additional\u201d government-imposed charges, and are, in fact, more analogous to the avgas contract\u2019s promise to pay for \u201cany now existing taxes, fees, or charges.\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. 111. The Humble and DuPont contracts thus provide no reason to narrow the otherwise plain meaning of the new or additional charges provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Even assuming the taxes provision in the Humble and DuPont contracts extends to CERCLA liability, it is not coextensive with the \u201chold harmless\u201d clause. The latter applies to losses arising from destruction of property, whether or not it is Government imposed, whereas the former applies to Government-imposed charges, whether or not loss to property was otherwise incurred. Because the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>es provision and the \u201chold harmless\u201d provision require indemnification for different types of risks, the fact that both appear in the same contract does not render either provision \u201c \u2018superfiuous[ ] or redundant,\u2019 \u201d as the Government contends. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. 28 (quoting <em>Medlin Constr. Grp., Ltd. v. Harvey, </em>449 F.3d 1195, 1200 (Fed.Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Finally, to the extent extrinsic evidence is considered, it confirms that the parties intended \u201ccharges\u201d to mean \u201ccosts.\u201d <em>See TEG-Paradigm Envt\u2019l, Inc. v. United States, </em>465 F.3d 1329, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citing <em>Coast Fed. Bank, </em>323 F.3d at 1040) (\u201cAlthough extrinsic evidence may not be used to interpret an unambiguous contract provision, we have looked to it to confirm that the parties intended for the term to have its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d). Communications between the parties used \u201ccharges\u201d interchangeably with \u201ccosts,\u201d referring to, inter alia: (1) \u201cthe estimated <em>charge </em>for raw materials,\u201d (2) \u201c[investment <em>charges,\u201d </em>(3) \u201cinterest <em>charges,\u201d </em>and (4) \u201coverhead <em>charges.\u201d </em>J.A.1955-56 (emphases added); <em>see also </em>J.A.1964 (a letter from Standard Oil to the PAW stating \u201cthis proposed additional <em>charge </em>for tank car or tank truck shipping reflects quite accurately the additional <em>cost </em>to Seller and its Suppliers of tank car or tank truck shipping as compared with barge and tanker shipping\u201d) (emphases added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This usage confirms that the parties intended the new or additional charges provision to extend to Government-imposed costs, such as CERCLA liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The context in which the contracts were formed simply further confirms that the new or additional charges provision requires reimbursement of the Oil Companies\u2019 CERCLA costs. <em>See Metric Constr., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Aeronautics &amp; Space Admin., </em>169 F.3d 747, 752 (Fed.Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States, </em>351 F.2d 972, 975 (Ct.Cl.1965)) (\u201c \u2018[T]he language of a contract must be given that meaning that would be derived from the contract by a reasonably intelligent person acquainted with the contemporaneous circumstances.\u2019\u201d). World War II and the stark necessity of increased avgas production are the circumstances surrounding the formation of the avgas contracts. The Government was in a position of near-complete authority over existing refineries, but needed the Oil Companies\u2019 cooperation to construct <em>new </em>production facilities to meet the extraordinary demand for avgas. The Oil Companies agreed to the avgas contracts\u2019 low profits in return for the Government\u2019s assumption of certain risks outside of the Oil Companies\u2019 control. <em>See supra </em>Background Part I. The CERCLA charges in this case are one such risk. The Oil Companies could not have contemplated such CERCLA charges at the time they entered into the contracts; indeed, dumping the acid waste at the McColl site was expressly permitted. <em>See </em>J.A. 605 \u00b6 492 (Eli McColl had a permit from the City of Fullerton to dump the waste.). These circumstances confirm that the new or additional charges provision must be interpreted to require reimbursement for the Oil Companies\u2019 CERCLA costs arising from avgas production. The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 holding to the contrary is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">II. The Court of Federal Claims Erred in Holding the Oil Companies\u2019 Contractual Claims Were Released</p>\n<p id=\"ATO\">The Court of Federal Claims denied the Oil Companies\u2019 reimbursement claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>for the additional reason that they were released when the avgas contracts were terminated and settled in the mid-to-late 1940s. The parties stipulated in the CERCLA litigation that the avgas contracts \u201cwere terminated in 1945 or, in the case of [ARCO], shortly thereafter. Matters relating to profits from these contracts, termination costs, and all other issues concerning these contracts were settled between the parties in the late 1940s.\u201d J.A. 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The Court of Federal Claims relied on <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>in reasoning that the Oil Companies\u2019 claims did not survive the termination and settlement of the underlying avgas contracts. In both <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>this court held there was no release of the contractor\u2019s indemnification claim because the agreement terminating the underlying World War II contract expressly reserved future indemnification claims. <em>DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1370; <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>378 F.3d at 1318. In this case, neither party could locate the Oil Companies\u2019 termination agreements, and the Court of Federal Claims reasoned that \u201cthe Oil Companies have offered no evidence or argument that this \u2018termination\u2019 and \u2018settle[ment]\u2019 differed in any material way from a general release.\u201d <em>Shell Remand Decision, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On appeal, the Oil Companies argue that \u201c[t]he stipulation says nothing at all about whether the Oil Companies executed a release (general or otherwise) as part of [the] settlement, or if they did execute such a release, whether it encompassed or excepted future reimbursement claims for \u2018taxes, fees, or charges.\u2019 \u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 34. The Oil Companies contend this uncertainty is fatal to the trial court\u2019s finding of a general release, because the Government (as the defendant) bore \u201c \u2018the burden of proving the validity and applicability of a release,\u2019 \u201d and failed to meet that burden. <em>Id. </em>at 35 (quoting <em>A.R.S.

The contract was terminated in 1946, and the contractor \u201cpaid $420,212.46 more in [unemployment insurance] contributions because of its experience under [the contract] than it would have if its contribution rate was based only on the operations of its three normal peacetime plants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. The <em>Houdaille </em>court rejected the Government\u2019s argument that \u201cthere [was] no authority\u201d to reimburse costs <em>\u201cafter </em>the contract had expired,\u201d finding the expenses were reimbursable because they \u201carose on account of plaintiffs operation under the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. The court also held the contractor\u2019s indemnification claim was not barred by release, <em>id. </em>at 310, making it clear that a contract termination is not the same as a general release. In this ease, the CERCLA costs for which the Oil Companies now seek indemnification arose, at least in part, from the production of avgas pursuant to the avgas contracts. The fact that the costs were not imposed until after the contracts were terminated does not bar the Oil Companies\u2019 CSA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The Government nonetheless argues that the parties\u2019 settlement of all issues concerning the avgas contracts amounts to a general release of claims for reimbursement. It contends this case is distinguishable from <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>where the Termination Agreements expressly preserved the contractor\u2019s indemnification claims. <em>See DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1373-74 (The Termination Supplement preserved all indemnification claims and \u201capparently included no termination or expiration date.\u201d); <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>378 F.3d at 1319 (\u201cThe Termination Agreement ... includes all claims \u2018not now known\u2019 arising from performance of the War Contract.\u201d). The Government maintains there is no indication that the settlement agreements in this case include any analogous promises to allow future indemnification claims. Just as the contract in <em>DuPont </em>was \u201cno longer in effect, having been supplanted by the Termination Supplement,\u201d <em>DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1373, the Government maintains the avgas contracts in this case are \u201cno longer in effect,\u201d having been supplanted by the settlement agreements of \u201call other issues.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 42-44. According to the Government, the terminated and settled avgas contracts cannot support any new indemnification claim; such a claim would have to be based on the settlement agreements, which are not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The parties\u2019 stipulation that \u201call other issues\u201d were settled does not satisfy the Government\u2019s burden to prove a general release. <em>See </em>J.A. 640. A settlement between two parties may resolve all then-existing issues without discharging any and all obligations between the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number><em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 284(1) (\u201cA release is a writing providing that a duty owed to the maker of the release is discharged immediately or on the occurrence of a condition.\u201d). In <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>for example, all issues had been settled, but not all rights were released; the parties agreed to allow future indemnification claims under the contract. 378 F.3d at 1319-20. It is the Government\u2019s burden to prove the settlement agreements released future claims under the avgas contracts, <em>A.R.S. Inc., </em>157 Ct.Cl. at 76, and the Government has failed to establish the content of those settlement agreements. The Government has not shown that the termination and settlement in this case amount to a general release of the Oil Companies\u2019 claims for reimbursement of new or additional charges. The Court of Federal Claims therefore erred in holding the Oil Companies\u2019 contract claims were released.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">III. The Court of Federal Claims Erred in Holding the Anti-Deficiency Act Barred the Oil Companies\u2019 Indemnification Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The final independent basis for the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment in favor of the Government was that any indemnification promise broad enough to encompass future CERCLA liability was an unenforceable violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (\u201cADA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The ADA provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">No executive department or other Government establishment of the United States shall expend, in any one fiscal year, any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in any contract or other obligation for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations <em>unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 665 (1940) (now revised and codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) (emphasis added). \u201c[A]bsent an express provision in an appropriation for reimbursement adequate to make such payment, [the ADA] proscribes indemnification on the grounds that it would constitute the obligation of funds not yet appropriated.\u201d <em>Cal.-Pac. Utils. Co. v. United States, </em>194 Ct.Cl. 703, 715 (1971). In <em>Chase v. United States, </em>for example, the plaintiff sought damages under a building lease entered into with the Postmaster General. 155 U.S. 489, 490, 15 S.Ct. 174, 39 L.Ed. 234 (1894). The Supreme Court held the Postmaster General was authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of the United States only if \u201cauthorized by law, or ... under an appropriation adequate to its fulfil[l]ment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 15 S.Ct. 174. Because \u201c[t]here is no claim that the lease in question was made under any appropriation whatever, ... the only inquiry is whether the contract of lease was \u2018authorized by law,\u2019 within the meaning of the [ADA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding the contract was not authorized by law).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">The inquiry at the Court of Federal Claims likewise centered on whether the indemnification provisions at issue were \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d Before this court, however, the parties and amicus disagree on a preliminary question: whether the DSC was subject to the ADA in the first place. The Oil Companies argue that \u201cDSC\u2019s contracts were not funded through appropriations,\u201d and contend the ADA thus does not apply. Appellants\u2019 Br. 39 (citing GAO, Reference Manual of Government Corporations, S. Doc. No. 86 (1945); J.A. 420 (DSC \u201cdid not receive direct annual appropriations.\u201d)).

The Oil Companies and AFPM therefore contend that the new or additional charges provision in the av-gas contracts is not subject to the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">This preliminary question\u2014whether the DSC is subject to the ADA\u2014was not raised before the Court of Federal Claims, where both parties assumed the applicability of the ADA and only disputed whether the indemnification provision was <em>authorized </em>pursuant to the ADA. <em>See Shell Remand Decision, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 438. By failing to raise this issue below, the Oil Companies waived their argument that the ADA is inapplicable to the DSC. <em>See Harris Corp. v. Ericsson Inc., </em>417 F.3d 1241, 1263 (Fed.Cir.2005). Like the Court of Federal Claims, this court assumes the ADA applies and limits the inquiry to whether the relevant indemnification provision was \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Oil Companies argued before the trial court that the ADA did not bar recovery, because the new or additional charges provision was \u201cauthorized by\u201d the First War Powers Act and implementing Executive Orders 9024 and 9001. The Court of Federal Claims held \u201cthat none of these sources provided the requisite ADA waiver that would have allowed the Government to indemnify the Oil Companies.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Shell Remand Decision, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 437. On appeal, the Oil Companies contend the Court of Federal Claims wrongly required them to prove an ADA \u201cwaiver\u201d when the ADA only requires <em>authorization </em>for the relevant provision. They maintain the authority granted to the President in the First War Powers Act, and delegated to the DSC through implementing Executive Orders 9024 and 9001, authorized the av-gas contracts\u2019 new or additional charges provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Both parties agree that Title II of the First War Powers Act, enacted in 1941, granted the President the power to \u201cauthorize any department or agency\u201d to enter into contracts that would otherwise violate the ADA, \u201cwhenever he deems such action would facilitate the prosecution of the war.\u201d Pub.L. No. 77-354, ch. 593, \u00a7 201, 55 Stat. 838, 839 (1941). The parties disagree, however, whether the President delegated this authority to the DSC in Executive Orders 9024 and 9001. In Executive Order 9024, President Roosevelt invoked the \u201cauthority vested in [him] by the Constitution and statutes of the United States,\u201d to establish the WPB and grant the WPB Chairman the power to, inter alia, \u201c[d]etermine the policies, plans, procedures, and methods of the several Federal departments, establishments, and agencies in respect to war procurement and production, including purchasing, contracting, specifications, and construction.\u201d 7 Fed. Reg. 329, 330 \u00b6 2(b) (Jan. 17, 1942). In a February 13, 1942, letter, the WPB Chairman then delegated to the OPC the authority \u201cto determine ... the price at which [avgas] is to be purchased, the capacity of the particular refiner to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>and the technical details of the particular contract,\u201d and delegated to the DSC the authority \u201cto determine ... the other terms and the form of such [avgas] contracts.\u201d J.A. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">By invoking authority from the \u201cstatutes of the United States,\u201d Executive Order 9024 delegates to the WPB the authority under the First War Powers Act to authorize indemnification provisions otherwise barred by the ADA. Moreover, the Chairman\u2019s letter to the DSC delegating the authority to determine \u201cthe other terms and the form of such [avgas] contracts\u201d transfers that authority to the DSC. Contrary to the Government\u2019s objection that Executive Order 9024 does not mention contracting, it clearly directs the WPB Chairman to direct \u201cthe policies, plans, procedures, and methods\u201d with respect \u201cto war <em>procurement </em>and production, including purchasing, contracting, specifications, and construction.\u201d This delegation is sufficient to authorize the indemnification provisions at issue under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Indeed, the <em>DuPont </em>court found that a similar provision in the CSA was sufficient to authorize otherwise prohibited indemnification agreements. The relevant portion of the CSA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">Each contracting agency shall have authority, <em>notwithstanding any provisions of law other than contained in this chapter, </em>(1) to make any contract necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter; (2) to amend by agreement any existing contract, either before or after notice of its termination, on such terms and to such extent as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter; and (3) in settling any termination claim, to agree to assume, or indemnify the war contractor against, any claims by any person in connection with such termination claims or settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">41 U.S.C. \u00a7 120(a) (1946) (emphasis added). The CSA did not expressly mention the ADA, but this court nonetheless reasoned that the \u201cbestowal of contracting authority \u2018notwithstanding <em>any </em>provisions of law other than contained in this chapter\u2019 \u201d was sufficient to authorize indemnification pursuant to the ADA. <em>DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1375. Similarly, although Executive Order 9024 does not expressly state that the Chairman of the WPB (and, in turn, the DSC) can expend unappropriated funds otherwise in violation of the ADA, it is a broad delegation of contracting authority that impliedly invokes the President\u2019s authority under the First War Powers Act to bypass the ADA\u2019s restrictions. The Court of Federal Claims therefore erred in holding that the ADA rendered the indemnification provision unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The Government nevertheless argues the DSC was at all times subject to prior Executive Order 8512, which stated: \u201cNo agency shall make expenditures or involve the Government in any contract or other obligation for the future payment of money in excess of the amount currently available therefor under the apportionments so approved or revised.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 46 (quoting 5 Fed.Reg. 2,849 (Aug. 15, 1940)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Executive Order 9024 provides that all prior \u201cconflicting\u201d Executive Orders \u201care hereby superseded,\u201d the Government argues the terms of Executive Order 9024 do not conflict with Executive Order 8512, whose prohibition thus remained in effect. To the contrary, however, Executive Order 9024 delegates the President\u2019s general contracting authority to the WPB \u201c[b]y virtue of the authority vested in [the President] by the ... statutes of the United States.\u201d Such statutes include the First War Powers Act\u2019s authority to enter into contracts that would otherwise violate the ADA. Delegating authority to bypass the ADA con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>fliets with Executive Order 8512, which prohibited contracts in excess of then-current appropriations. Executive Order 8512 thus does not control in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Because the new or additional charges provision was authorized by the First War Powers Act, as delegated to the DSC through Executive Order 9024 and the WPB Chairman\u2019s letter, there is no need to consider whether the President also delegated such authority under Executive Order 9001. The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 holding that the ADA prohibited reimbursement of new or additional charges is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Each of the three independent bases for denying the Oil Companies\u2019 reimbursement claims has been reversed, making it appropriate to enter summary judgment in favor of the Oil Companies with respect to breach of contract liability. The sole remaining issue is whether the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that genuine disputed facts prevented granting summary judgment with respect to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">IV. The Court of Federal Claims Correctly Held That Disputed Facts Prevent Granting the Oil Companies\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The Court of Federal Claims found there were \u201cfactual questions\u201d regarding \u201cwhat portion of the non-benzol waste [ (i.e., the spent alkylation acid and the non-benzol acid sludge) ] was created \u2018by reason of the avgas program.\u201d <em>Shell Remand Decision, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 448. On appeal, the Oil Companies argue this court should award 100% of their CERCLA costs on the ground that the Government is collaterally estopped from arguing that anything less than 100% of the non-benzol acid waste was due to the avgas contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The Oil Companies rely on the decision of the district court in the CERCLA litigation, which found \u201cthat 100 percent of the non-benzol waste at the McColl Site is attributable to the avgas program.\u201d <em>Shell II, </em>13 F.Supp.2d at 1026. The Oil Companies argue the district court\u2019s attribution \u201cfinding is binding on the Government as a matter of issue preclusion.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 56 (quoting <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>464 U.S. 154, 158, 104 S.Ct. 568, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984) (\u201c[Ojnce a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision is conclusive in a subsequent suit based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.\u201d)). The district court\u2019s finding was not final, however, but rather was reversed by the Ninth Circuit. <em>Shell III, </em>294 F.3d at 1048-49. The Ninth Circuit instead held the Government was not an \u201carranger\u201d for the non-benzol waste, and thus did not reach the question of how much non-benzol waste was attributable to the avgas program. <em>Id. </em>The final decision in <em>Shell III </em>thus did not resolve the attribution issue and cannot serve as the basis for issue preclusion. <em>See Laguna Hermosa Corp. v. United States, </em>671 F.3d 1284, 1288 (Fed.Cir.2012) (issue preclusion requires, inter alia, that \u201cresolution of the issue was essential to a final judgment in the first action\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">The Oil Companies contend the district court\u2019s nonbenzol attribution analysis <em>was </em>necessary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding because the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s apportionment analysis with respect to the benzol waste. This argument confuses the district court\u2019s <em>attribution </em>holding (based on the factual question of how much acid waste was caused by the avgas program) with its <em>apportionment </em>holding. In the latter, the district court identified multiple reasons why 100% of the waste for which the Government was an \u201carranger\u201d (both the benzol <em>and </em>non-benzol waste) should be equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>tably apportioned to the Government: (1) it would properly place the costs of war on society as a whole, and (2) it would reflect the Government\u2019s role in limiting reprocessing facilities and access to tank cars. <em>Shell II, </em>13 F.Supp.2d at 1027. The Ninth Circuit affirmed this apportionment analysis with respect to the benzol waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">This equitable apportionment holding is distinct from the issue of attribution relevant in this case: how much of the acid waste dumped at the McColl site was \u201cby reason of\u2019 the avgas program. The Ninth Circuit did not rely on or incorporate the district court\u2019s attribution holding with respect to the non-benzol waste, and instead stated \u201c[t]he undisputed facts indicate that the Oil Companies ... dumped acid waste <em>from operations other than avgas production </em>at the McColl site.\u201d <em>Shell III, </em>294 F.3d at 1062 (emphasis added). In short, the prior CERCLA litigation does not preclude the Government from challenging the amount of acid waste attributable to the avgas contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Absent collateral estoppel, the Oil Companies do not contest the trial court\u2019s finding of a genuine dispute regarding how much of the acid waste at the McColl site resulted from the avgas contracts, nor does this court discern any error. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 569 (\u201cKerosene and lubricating oils were also acid treated\u201d and \u201cproduced acid sludge.\u201d); J.A. 572 (The McColl site \u201ccontains acid sludge resulting from the treatment of civilian and military petroleum products.\u201d). The case is remanded for the Court of Federal Claims to determine how much acid waste at the McColl site was \u201cby reason of\u2019 the avgas contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">For the foregoing reasons, this court reverses the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment with respect to breach of contract liability, and remands for a trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">. \u201c 'There are no new problems in the law, only forgotten solutions[,] and the issues which arose yesterday will always arise again tomorrow.\u2019 \u201d Jeremy Rabkin &amp; Ariel Rabkin, <em>Navigating Conflicts in Cyberspace: Legal Lessons from the History of War at Sea, </em>14 Chi.

I do not interpret the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause as a general indemnification clause that captures production-related costs. For this and the other reasons set forth below, I respectfully <em>dissent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">This appeal arises following the Oil Companies\u2019 failure to recover the McColl site clean-up costs through the CERCLA litigation that took place in California. The CERCLA regime allows a party that is financially responsible for the clean-up costs of environmental contamination to seek contribution from other responsible parties. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1). District courts thus have broad discretion to resolve contribution claims \u201cusing such equitable factors as [they] determine[ ] are appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Boeing Co. v. Cascade Corp., </em>207 F.3d 1177, 1187 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that CERCLA \u201cgives district courts discretion to decide what factors ought to be considered, as well as the duty to allocate costs according to those factors\u201d). After failing to achieve a satisfactory outcome under CERCLA\u2019s equitable considerations, the Oil Companies now seek recovery through a different avenue\u2014a breach of contract action. In doing so, they breach the four corners of their avgas contracts by asking this court to interpret the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause as a catch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>all indemnification provision. Such an interpretation, in my view, has no basis in the plain language of the clause or the overall scope of the contract. I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Federal Claims and hold that the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause was intended by the parties to be nothing more than a price-adjustment mechanism covering additional or unanticipated tax-related burdens assessed by reason of avgas production.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">\u201cContract interpretation is a question of law, which [the court] review[s] without deference.\u201d <em>1st Home Liquidating Trust v.

U.S. Postal Serv., </em>816 F.2d 1562, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1987). Contract interpretation begins with the language of the written agreement, which must be given \u201c[its] ordinary meaning unless the parties mutually intended and agreed to an alternative meaning.\u201d <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998). We may not resort to extrinsic evidence \u201cto create an ambiguity where a contract was not reasonably susceptible of differing interpretations at the time of contracting.\u201d <em>Metric Constructors, Inc. v.

Shell Oil Company\u2019s contract, dated April 10, 1942, is representative of all the avgas contracts at issue here and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">XII. <em>Taxes</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-9\">a) Buyer shall pay in addition to the prices as established in Sections IV and V hereof, <em>any new or additional taxes, fees, or charges, </em>other than income, excess profits, or corporate franchise taxes, which Seller may be required by any municipal, state, or federal law in the United States or any foreign country to collect or pay by reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery of the commodities delivered hereunder. Buyer shall also pay any such taxes on crude petroleum, or the transportation thereof, to the extent such taxes result in increased cost of the commodities delivered hereunder not compensated for by Section V hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0n\">J.A. 111-12 (Shell Oil Co. Contract, Apr. 10,1942) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that CERCLA liability is covered by this clause hinges on an isolated interpretation of the word \u201ccharges.\u201d The majority engages in a lengthy discussion of the plain meaning of \u201ccharges\u201d and concludes that it is synonymous with \u201ccosts.\u201d Maj. Op. at 1291-93. The majority then proceeds to hold that the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause requires the Government to reimburse the Oil Companies for costs of any and all type, regardless of how they were incurred, as long as those costs arise \u201cby reason of\u2019 the production and delivery of avgas.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Such an interpretation ignores the contractual character and import of the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause. When read as a whole, the contract signals that the parties, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>time they entered into the contract, intended the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause to be read as a price-adjustment mechanism covering unexpected tax-related burdens. First, the clause is titled \u201cTaxes.\u201d Second, the clause uses the term \u201csuch taxes\u201d several times to refer back to the broader category of \u201ctaxes, fees, or charges.\u201d Third, the specific exclusions from \u201ctaxes, fees, or charges\u201d are all income and related taxes, including \u201cincome, excess profits, [and] corporate franchise taxes.\u201d Finally, the clause provides that the payment of \u201cnew or additional taxes, fees, or charges\u201d will be in addition to the prices established in the \u201cPrice and Payment\u201d (Section IV) and \u201cPrice Escalation\u201d (V) clauses of the contract. The term \u201ccharges\u201d should thus be interpreted consistently and in harmony with the broader operation of the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause as a price-adjustment mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The majority summarily dismisses these textual signals in favor of an isolated and overly-broad interpretation of the singular term \u201ccharges\u201d to conclude that \u201c[t]he plain language of the new or additional charges provision\u201d must encompass CERCLA liability. Maj. Op. at 1298. In doing so, the majority ignores the trial court\u2019s use of the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>canon of interpretation, which \u201cis just an erudite (or some would say antiquated) way of saying what common sense tells us to be true: \u2018[A] word is known by the company it keeps.\u2019\u201d <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 222, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Jarecki v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961)). Indeed, contract terms must be construed, not in isolation, but as a whole and in a way that gives effect to the surrounding context. <em>NVT Techs., Inc. v. United States, </em>370 F.3d 1153, 1159 (Fed.Cir.2004) (noting that a contract must \u201cbe considered as a whole and interpreted so as to harmonize and give reasonable meaning to all of its parts\u201d); <em>Metric Constructors, </em>169 F.3d at 752 (\u201cBefore arriving at a legal reading of a contract provision, a court must consider the context and intentions of the parties.\u201d). \u201cThe context and subject matter of a contract may indicate that an ordinary word or phrase has an unusual meaning in a given sentence.\u201d 11 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 32:6 (4th ed. 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2009). \u201c[I]t is questionable whether a word has a meaning at all when divorced from the circumstances in which it is used.\u201d E. Allen Farnsworth, Contracts 454 (4th ed.2004). Here, the majority\u2019s interpretation ignores the plain meaning of the text, fails to give harmony to the contracts as a whole, and is overall unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">For example, the majority dismisses, in a footnote, any reliance on the title of the clause (\u201cTaxes\u201d) as evidence of the clause\u2019s fairly narrow <em>tax-related </em>meaning. Maj. Op. at 1293-94 n. 9. The majority notes that the Supreme Court tends to \u201cplacet ] less weight on\u201d captions, headings and titles when construing statutory provisions. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lawson v. FMR LLC, </em>No. 12-3,-U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1158, 1169, 188 L.Ed.2d 158 (2014)). This principle, which is often used when \u201cthe [statutory] text is complicated and prolific,\u201d nevertheless recognizes that a heading can be a helpful \u201c \u2018short-hand reference to the general subject matter\u2019 of the provision.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1169 (quoting <em>Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>331 U.S. 519, 528, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947)). Hence, Supreme Court precedent supports a finding that the parties intended for the \u201cgeneral subject matter\u201d of this clause to cover \u201cTaxes\u201d and tax-related items.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The majority rejects the Government\u2019s comparison of the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause to the terms of other contemporaneous contracts as an improper reliance on extrinsic evidence in the absence of an \u201cestablished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>ambiguity.\u201d Maj. Op. at 1295. At the same time, the majority itself informs its broad interpretation of the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause by heavily relying on extrinsic evidence. As the majority notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\">World War II and the stark necessity of increased avgas production are the circumstances surrounding the formation of the avgas contracts. The Government was in a position of near-complete authority over existing refineries, but needed the Oil Companies\u2019 cooperation to construct <em>new </em>production facilities to meet the extraordinary demand for av-gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Maj. Op. at 1296 (emphasis original). The majority concludes that \u201c[tjhese circumstances confirm that the new or additional charges provision must be interpreted to require reimbursement for the Oil Companies\u2019 CERCLA costs arising from avgas production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority thus justifies its broad interpretation of the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause not on the language of the clause itself but on a weighing of the equities in light of the wartime circumstances, subject matter not in the record before us and certainly not reflected by the terms of the contract. I believe that reliance on unsupported historical and social anecdotes should not trump the plain meaning of the contract terms and, in this case, transform a straightforward \u201cTaxes\u201d clause into a catch-all indemnification provision. <em>See, e.g., City of Oxnard v. United States, </em>851 F.2d 344, 347 (Fed.Cir.1988) (noting that the contract language is the best evidence of the parties\u2019 intent and should take precedence over any \u201csubjective intent of one of the parties, if contrary to the unambiguous and reasonable text of the written contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Even if the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause could be interpreted to encompass certain non-tax-related costs, the majority does not adequately explain why the clause should be extended to indemnify CERCLA liability. As we have previously noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">In order for a pre-CERCLA indemnification clause to cover CERCLA liability, courts have held that the clause must be either [1] specific enough to include CERCLA liability or [2] general enough to include any and all environmental liability which would, naturally, include subsequent CERCLA claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-10\"><em>E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Elf Atochem N. Am. v. United States, </em>866 F.Supp. 868, 870 (E.D.Pa.1994)). As we noted in DuPont, \u201cCERCLA evolved from the doctrine of common law nuisance\u201d and is thus similar to tort-based liability claims. <em>DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1373. CERCLA gives the President broad power to direct the Government to clean up a hazardous waste site itself or to command the responsible parties to do so. <em>See Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Aviall Servs., Inc., </em>543 U.S. 157, 160, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004). Responsible parties may thus satisfy their CERCLA liability by means other than cash payments to governmental entities. Had the Oil Companies self-performed the clean-up efforts at the McColl Site, they would have even less of a basis to argue that the clean-up costs are encompassed by the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause because the clause covers only \u201ccharges\u201d the contractor was required by a government entity \u201cto collect or pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Here, nothing in the plain language of the avgas contracts indicates that the parties intended for the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause to \u201callocate [generally] all possible liabilities\u201d among themselves, much less to allocate specifically the risks of environmental liability. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cTaxes\u201d clause is devoid of any language that resembles the broad indemnification provisions considered by our decisions in <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co. See DuPont, </em>365 F.3d at 1367; <em>Ford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number><em>Motor Co. v. United States, </em>378 F.3d 1314, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2004). In <em>DuPont, </em>we held that the Government\u2019s agreement \u201cto hold [DuPont] harmless against any loss, expense ... or damage ... <em>of any kind whatsoever </em>\u201d was sufficient to include CERCLA liability. 365 F.3d at 1372 (emphasis added). In <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>we similarly held that CERCLA liability was covered by a provision requiring reimbursement of all \u201callowable costs,\u201d including <em>\u201closs or destruction of or damage to property </em>as may arise out of or in connection with the performance of the work under this contract.\u201d 378 F.3d at 1319 (emphasis added). No such provision exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Yet, the majority\u2019s entire analysis rests on the conclusion that a term requiring payment of \u201ccharges\u201d or \u201ccosts\u201d is sufficient to require broad indemnification. Maj. Op. at 1294. But the \u201cTaxes\u201d clause lacks any reference to concepts indicating that the parties intended to enter into a broad indemnity provision; terms like \u201closs,\u201d \u201cdamage,\u201d \u201cliability,\u201d \u201cdestruction,\u201d \u201cindemnify,\u201d \u201chold harmless,\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d are nowhere to be found. Although I agree with the majority that no \u201cspecial words\u201d are required to give effect to a promise of indemnification, <em>id., </em>that does not mean that the contract can be devoid of any objective indicia of the parties\u2019 intent to generally allocate liability between them. <em>See, e.g., City of Oxnard, </em>851 F.2d at 347. In my view, the avgas contracts lack any evidence of such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">If history serves a purpose in this case, it is to show that in the 1940s, as today, avgas production results in byproducts, some of which are wastes. Waste created in the production of petrochemicals represents a cost on the producer, in this case the Oil Companies. That the contracts are silent on who bears the cost related to the production and disposal of avgas-related byproducts indicates that the parties intended the cost to be borne by the Oil Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Indeed, the plaintiffs in this case are sophisticated companies that \u201cs\u00farely would know how to [negotiate and] draft broad hold harmless indemnification clauses extending in perpetuity if that were their intent,\u201d even during wartime. <em>Shell Remand Decision, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 425. Our previous decisions in <em>DuPont </em>and <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>provide evidence of this very fact. The Oil Companies\u2019 best opportunity to recover their clean-up costs from the Government was through the CERCLA litigation in California, and they should not now be allowed to recover by fitting a square peg into a round hole. The majority errs by interpreting a straightforward \u201cTaxes\u201d clause as a catch-all indemnification provision. Therefore, I must <em>dissent.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\">. I do not interpret the \"Taxes\u201d clause as allowing the Oil Companies to recover their CERCLA costs, I do not address the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s conclusion that recovery is also precluded by general release and the Anti-Deficiency Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
