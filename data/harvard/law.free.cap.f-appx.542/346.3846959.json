In this appeal, he challenges only the term of supervised release, arguing that it is unreasonable and amounts to plain error because it is more than needed to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and because the district court failed to properly weigh his prior offenses, the abuse he suffered as a child, and his ignorance concerning his obligation to register. Under Shepherd\u2019s view, the 30-year term of supervised release exaggerates the severity of his offenses and the danger he presents to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">As Shepherd acknowledges, his failure to raise his reasonableness challenge in the district court results in application of the plain error standard in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 405 (5th Cir.2006). Under this standard, one must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court has discretion to correct a plain error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-22\">The record reflects that the district court properly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense as well as Shepherd\u2019s history and characteristics in determining his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). There is no indication that the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight to an \u201cirrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing [the] sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Shepherd\u2019s arguments amount to no more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the pertinent factors and the propriety of the sentence imposed, which does not suffice to show error, plain or otherwise, in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
