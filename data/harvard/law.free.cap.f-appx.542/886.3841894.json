The state court denied Steffen\u2019s amended motion for post-conviction relief, and the state appellate court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-28\">In the federal habeas proceeding, a magistrate judge recommended the denial of Steffen\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition because, applying <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the magistrate judge concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>state court\u2019s denial of post-conviction relief was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied Steffen\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We granted Steffen a certif\u00edcate of ap-pealability on the following issue: \u2018Whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that Steffen\u2019s statements to the police should have been suppressed because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that Steffen received were inadequate?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">On appeal, Steffen argues that he was not advised in a \u201ccatchall phrase\u201d that he had the right to use any of the rights outlined in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), at any time during his police interview. Accordingly, he understood the given <em>Miranda </em>rights to limit the right to have counsel present to the time before he made any statement and was not advised that he had the right to have an attorney present during questioning. Steffen argues that no competent attorney would have concluded that filing a motion to suppress his statements would be a meritless endeavor, and that his trial counsel\u2019s failure in this regard was not the result of an alternate trial strategy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review \u201cquestions of law and mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, <em>de novo, </em>and review findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Pardo v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 587 </em>F.3d 1093, 1098 (11th Cir.2009). However, the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), imposes a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings ... and demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 773, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1862, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (internal quotations marks omitted). Thus, we review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>but we review the state court\u2019s decision with deference. <em>Reed v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>593 F.3d 1217, 1239 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">A federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus for a state prisoner where the claim was adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the state court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-13\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-14\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2); <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (holding that the state court decision need not be accompanied by an explanation or a statement of reasons, so long as the judgment is on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>The phrase \u201cclearly established\u201d refers to the holdings of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state court decision. <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). A state court decision can be contrary to established law in two ways: \u201c(1) it applies a rule contradicting the governing law as set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) the state court, in a case with facts indistinguishable from those in a decision of the Supreme Court, arrives at a different result.\u201d <em>Washington v. Crosby, </em>324 F.3d 1263, 1265 (11th Cir.2003). If there is no Supreme Court precedent on point, a state court\u2019s conclusion cannot be contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>A state court decision also represents an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal rule from Supreme Court cases and unreasonably applies the established law to the facts of a case. <em>Id. </em>Even if we conclude that the state court applied federal law incorrectly, relief is only appropriate if that application is also objectively unreasonable. <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The Supreme Court decision applicable in an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel case is <em>Strickland. See Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 733, 739, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011). \u201cThe standards created by <em>St\u00f1ckland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 788 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To succeed on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim under <em>St\u00f1ck-land, </em>a petitioner must show that (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Under \u00a7 2254(d), \u201cthe question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable [but] whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">With respect to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deficient-performance prong, \u201ca defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms at the time the representation took place.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>588 F.3d 1331, 1356 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s representation was \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. \u201cA fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">To prove prejudice, a defendant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, \u00cd04 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d but \u201csome conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding\u201d is not a reasonable probability. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. at 2067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Before being questioned by the police, an individual in custody must be \u201cclearly informed\u201d that he has, among other rights, \u201cthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 471, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>S.Ct. at 1626. <em>Miranda </em>prescribed that an individual must be given the following warnings: (1) \u201cthat he has the right to remain silent\u201d; (2) \u201cthat anything he says can be used against him in a court of law\u201d; (3) \u201cthat he has the right to the presence of an attorney\u201d; and (4) \u201cthat if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In <em>Roberts v. State, </em>874 So.2d 1225 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2004), the state appellate court declared the Broward County Sheriffs Office <em>Miranda </em>warnings inadequate because, while they stated an attorney may be present before questioning, they did not inform a defendant that he has the right to have counsel present during interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 1226, 1228. Under <em>Roberts, </em>the use of \u201cbefore\u201d misleads a defendant into believing that an attorney could not be present during questioning. However, a subsequent decision by the United States Supreme Court holds that \u201cthe term \u2018before\u2019 merely conveyed when [an individual\u2019s] right to an attorney became effective \u2014 namely, before he answered any questions at all. Nothing in the words used indicated that counsel\u2019s presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.\u201d <em>Florida v. Powell, </em>559 U.S. 50, 63, 130 S.Ct. 1195, 1205, 175 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2010). Thus, temporal language such as \u201cbefore\u201d does not render <em>Miranda </em>warnings inadequate if the warnings are \u201csufficiently comprehensive and comprehensible when given a commonsense reading.\u201d <em>Id.; see id. </em>at 60, 130 S.Ct. at 1204 (\u201c[T]his Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.\u201d). The <em>Miranda </em>rights at issue in <em>Powell </em>included a catchall phrase that the defendant had the \u201cright to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 130 S.Ct. at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Here, we conclude from the record that Steffen has not overcome the doubly deferential standard of review required by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) to establish that the state court\u2019s rejection of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was objectively unreasonable. <em>See Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 788. There is a reasonable argument that Steffen\u2019s counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard. <em>See id. </em>At trial, Steffen\u2019s attorney advocated Steffen\u2019s position that he never received any <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Counsel\u2019s decision not to argue also that Stef-fen actually received warnings, but that they were inadequate, was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. This is especially true given that, under the <em>pre-Roberts </em>law as it existed at the time of Steffen\u2019s 2003 trial, it appeared that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were constitutionally adequate, and the constitutionality of those warnings finds support in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Powell </em>decision. <em>See id.; Cummings, </em>588 F.3d at 1356. Accordingly, because Stef-fen has not met the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the state court\u2019s rejection of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Steffen\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-8\">. Steffen also contends that, under the doctrine of estoppel, the state should not be allowed to now argue that Steffen's trial counsel did not move for suppression based on inadequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings because of a trial strategy. The state correctly notes that issues of estoppel are beyond the certified question on appeal. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding that \"in an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the [certificate of appealability].\u201d). Accordingly, we do not review Steffen\u2019s arguments regarding estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
