After reviewing the record and considering the arguments presented in the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-22\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b869-23\">This case concerns the scope of coverage under a professional liability insurance policy that Defendant-Appellee Axis Surplus Insurance Company (\u201cAxis\u201d) issued to Plaintiffs-Appellants the Zodiac Group, Inc., David Felger, and Daniel Felger (collectively referred to as \u201cZodiac\u201d). The Zodiac Group offers \u201cpsychic\u201d hotline telephone services. David Felger and Daniel Felger own and operate the Zodiac Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-24\">The parties dispute whether the insurance policy provides coverage for the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses that Zodiac incurred defending against a federal lawsuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>brought by Zodiac\u2019s ex-business partner, Linda Georgian.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">A. Georgian\u2019s Endorsement Agreement with Zodiac</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In November 2001, the Zodiac Group entered into an agreement wherein Georgian, a renowned psychic and co-host of the Psychic Friends Network,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> agreed to endorse the Zodiac Group\u2019s services (the \u201cEndorsement Agreement\u201d). The Endorsement Agreement required Georgian to \u201cprovide endorsement services to Zodiac relating to the telephone psychic entertainment services offered by Zodiac to its affiliates.\u201d In March 2007, the Endorsement Agreement ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">B. Georgian\u2019s State Court Litigation Against the Zodiac Group</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">In April 2008, Georgian sued Plaintiff-Appellant the Zodiac Group in Florida state court. Georgian\u2019s state court complaint alleged generally that the Zodiac Group improperly used Georgian\u2019s name and likeness after the Endorsement Agreement ended to falsely imply that she endorsed the Zodiac Group\u2019s services. The complaint provided specific details supporting its allegations, including that the Zodiac Group (1) \u201crepeatedly and continuously used Georgian\u2019s name and likeness to promote its psychic services\u201d; (2) \u201cincorrectly promote[d] Georgian\u2019s endorsement of [the] Zodiac Group\u2019s services\u201d; (3) used Georgian\u2019s name and likeness on its websites; (4) used Georgian\u2019s name and image on its advertisements in national print media; (5) used Georgian\u2019s name in its national call solicitations; and (6) maintained telephone advertising under the name \u201cPsychic Friend Linda Georgian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">The complaint also alleged that the Zodiac Group extensively advertised its psychic services in various media, including the Internet, national magazine publications, telephone call lines, and yellow page services. The complaint then alleged that the Zodiac Group \u201cpublished and printed for trade, commercial and proprietary advertising purposes\u201d the photographic likeness and name of Georgian without her permission and in direct contravention of her express demands to stop. Attachments to the complaint contained numerous advertisements from the Zodiac Group with Georgian\u2019s name, likeness, and references to Georgian\u2019s affiliation with the Psychic Friends Network.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Based on these allegations, Georgian sought damages and injunctive relief. In November 2009, the state court dismissed Georgian\u2019s complaint, without prejudice, for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">C.Georgian\u2019s Federal Court Litigation Against Zodiac</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Two months later, in January 2010, Georgian sued Zodiac (i.e., the Zodiac Group, David Felger, and Daniel Felger) in federal court. Georgian\u2019s federal complaint sought damages and equitable relief. In January 2011, Georgian amended her federal complaint. The amended complaint removed two claims but was otherwise substantially similar to Georgian\u2019s prior complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">Georgian\u2019s federal complaint was predicated on the same wrongful conduct as her state court complaint \u2014 namely, that Zodiac improperly used Georgian\u2019s name and likeness after the Endorsement Agreement ended to falsely imply that she endorsed the Zodiac Group\u2019s services. As with her state complaint, Georgian\u2019s federal complaint provided specific details supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>its allegations, including that Zodiac (1) repetitively used Georgian\u2019s name and made false claims on its website that Georgian endorsed Zodiac\u2019s psychic readers; (2) published scores of Internet directory and advertising listings falsely promoting and advertising its phone number as Georgian\u2019s number; (3) published \u201chard paper periodical advertising\u201d that improperly used Georgian\u2019s name, image, and likeness to promote its business; (4) directed its psychic telephone workers to falsely inform callers that Georgian had a line with, was affiliated with, or owned that telephone network; (5) directed its psychic telephone workers to falsely inform callers that they were Georgian; (6) fostered a misbelief that Georgian endorsed or was affiliated with Zodiac; (7) established a misleading paper trail by placing terms like \u201cPsychic Friend\u201d on customers\u2019 credit card statements to create the appearance that Georgian, rather than Zodiac, provided and charged for the psychic telephone services; and (8) used various unauthorized techniques, such as creating false Ancestry.com and Facebook.com accounts, to \u201coptimiz[e] the appearance and linkage\u201d between Zodiac and Georgian on the Internet. The federal complaint alleged that these acts continued through at least September 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The district court dismissed most of the counts in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint. The parties settled the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">D. The Insurance Policy Between Zodiac and Axis</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In October 2008, insurer Axis issued Zodiac a professional liability insurance policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d). The Policy\u2019s inception date was October 1, 2008; its expiration date was October 1, 2009; and its retroactive date was March 6, 1998. In 2009, the parties renewed the Policy. The renewed Policy continued coverage through October 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Plaintiff-Appellant the Zodiac Group was a \u201cNamed Insured\u201d under the Policy. As officers and directors of the Zodiac Group, Plaintiffs-Appellants David Felger and Daniel Felger were both \u201cIndividual Insureds\u201d under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The Policy stated that Axis would insure against claims arising from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cinterference with rights of privacy or publicity, including ... commercial appropriation of name or likeness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Approximately one week after Georgian filed her federal court complaint, Plaintiff-Appellant David Felger notified Axis of the litigation and sought coverage and a defense under the Policy. Axis denied coverage and a defense because, <em>inter alia, </em>the claims in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint were \u201cfirst made\u201d before the policy period began in October 2008 because they \u201cstem[med] from misuse of her image without authorization,\u201d as alleged in Georgian\u2019s April 2008 state court complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">After Georgian amended her federal complaint, Zodiac renewed its request for coverage and a defense under the Policy. Again, Axis declined coverage. After the federal litigation was resolved, Zodiac sought indemnification for its legal fees. Axis did not respond to this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">After Axis denied coverage, Zodiac filed a two-count complaint against Axis in the district court, seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract. Axis asserted that the Policy did not apply to claims related to Georgian\u2019s federal litigation and moved to dismiss Zodiac\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">The district court granted Axis\u2019s motion and, subsequently, denied Zodiac\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>to reconsider its decision. Zodiac now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of its complaint against Axis.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we \u201caccept[] the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and con-stru[e] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">In ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the court is generally confined to considering the complaint and any attachments thereto. <em>See SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC, </em>600 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2010). However, the \u201ccourt may consider an extrinsic document if it is (1) central to the plaintiffs claim, and (2) its authenticity is not challenged.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Maxcess, Inc. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., </em>433 F.3d 1337, 1340 &amp; n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The interpretation of provisions in an insurance contract is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. ERA Oxford Realty Co. Greystone, LLC, </em>572 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Technical Coating Applicators, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>157 F.3d 843, 844 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">A. Florida Law</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">\u201cIn a contract action, a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction applies the substantive law of the forum state unless federal constitutional or statutory law compels a contrary result.\u201d <em>Technical Coating Applicators, </em>157 F.3d at 844. This Court must follow the decisions of the forum state\u2019s highest court when that court has addressed the relevant issue. <em>Id. </em>In this contract action, we apply Florida\u2019s law because Florida is the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Under Florida law, \u201c[i]nsurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning, with any ambiguities construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. J.S.U.B., Inc., </em>979 So.2d 871, 877 (Fla.2007). \u201cIf the language used in an insurance policy is plain and unambiguous, a court must interpret the policy in accordance with the plain meaning of the language used so as to give effect to the policy as it was written.\u201d <em>Geico Gen. Ins. Co. v. Virtual Imaging Servs., Inc., </em>No. SC12-905, \u2014 So.3d-, 2013 WL 3332385 (Fla. July 3, 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">B. Terms of the Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">The district court properly granted Axis\u2019s motion to dismiss because the plain language of the Policy precluded coverage of Georgian\u2019s claims against Zodiac.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">Unless specific conditions precedent were met, the Policy did not cover claims arising from wrongful acts committed pri- or to the Policy\u2019s date of inception. The claims in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint alleged wrongful acts by Zodiac beginning in March 2007. Such acts predate the Policy\u2019s October 2008 inception date. Consequently, the Policy did not cover the claims arising from the wrongful acts alleged in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint unless certain specific conditions precedent in the Policy were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>One of those specific conditions precedent for coverage based on prior wrongful acts was that the claims have been <em>\u201cfirst made </em>against an[ ] Insured <em>during </em>the Policy Period\u201d from October 2008 to October 2010. (Emphasis added.) Thus, we must analyze whether \u2014 under the terms of the Policy \u2014 the claims in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint were \u201cfirst made\u201d when Georgian filed her federal complaint in January 2010 (which was during the policy period) or when Georgian filed her state complaint in April 2008 (which was before the policy period).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">C. \u201cFirst Made\u201d and \u201cSame Wrongful Act\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The Policy expressly provided a method for determining when a claim was \u201cfirst made.\u201d Under the Policy, \u201call Claims arising from the <em>same Wrongful Act\u201d </em>are deemed to have been made on the same date. Under the Policy, a \u201cwrongful act\u201d is \u201cconduct or alleged conduct by an Insured.\u201d The Policy treats all wrongful acts \u201crelated by common facts, circumstances, transactions, events and/or decisions ... as <em>one Wrongful Act.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Here, the many wrongful acts alleged in Georgian\u2019s state and federal actions are clearly related by common facts, circumstances, transactions, events and/or decisions. Specifically, those wrongful acts all related to Zodiac\u2019s alleged efforts to falsely imply that Georgian endorsed or was associated with its psychic services after the Endorsement Agreement ended in March 2007. Consequently, under the Policy\u2019s plain language, the acts alleged in Georgian\u2019s state and federal actions were \u201cone Wrongful Act\u201d for purposes of determining coverage under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Zodiac asserts that, because Georgian\u2019s state complaint was brought against the Zodiac Group only and Georgian\u2019s federal complaint was brought against the Zodiac Group and the Felgers, the Felgers\u2019 alleged misconduct constituted a \u201cnew wrongful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">The Policy does not draw this distinction. In fact, the Policy states that \u201call wrongful acts ... related by common facts, circumstances, transactions, events and/or decisions\u201d are treated as \u201cone Wrongful Act.\u201d The Policy does not limit this broad language to only those acts committed by a single actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Because all claims in Georgian\u2019s state and federal complaints arose from the \u201csame Wrongful Act,\u201d the Policy treats those claims as having been made on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">D. Date That the Claims Were \u201cFirst Made\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">The Policy also provided a formula for determining that date. Specifically, the Policy deemed \u201cclaims arising from the same Wrongful Act\u201d to have been made on the <em>\u201cearlier of\u201d </em>(1) the date that \u201cthe first of those claims [was] made against any Insured\u201d <em>or </em>(2) the \u201cfirst date [that Axis] receive[d] the Insured\u2019s written notice of the Wrongful Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">In this case, the first claim was made in April 2008 when Georgian filed her state complaint against the Zodiac Group. The first date that Axis received notice of claims arising from this Wrongful Act was in January 2010 \u2014 when Plaintiff-Appellant David Felger notified Axis of Georgian\u2019s federal complaint and sought coverage and a defense under the Policy. The earlier of these dates is April 2008, which is before the Policy\u2019s inception in October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">Because the Policy treated Zodiac\u2019s alleged effort to use Georgian\u2019s name and likeness without permission and to create a false impression that Georgian was associated with or endorsed Zodiac\u2019s services as a single \u201cWrongful Act\u201d and because the first claim related to that Wrongful Act occurred well before the Policy\u2019s inception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>date, the Policy did not cover the claims in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In summary, a condition precedent to coverage under the Policy was that the claims have been <em>\u201cfirst made ... </em>during the Policy Period\u201d from October 2008 to October 2010. Because all claims in Georgian\u2019s state and federal complaints \u201caros[e] from the same Wrongful Act\u201d and because the Policy deemed the claims for that same Wrongful Act to have been first made in April 2008, the claims in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint were not \u201cfirst made\u201d during the policy period. Therefore, the claims in Georgian\u2019s federal complaint were excluded from the Policy\u2019s coverage, and Zodiac was not entitled to indemnification or a defense against Georgian\u2019s federal court litigation. Thus, the district court properly granted Axis\u2019s motion to dismiss Zodiac\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">.
