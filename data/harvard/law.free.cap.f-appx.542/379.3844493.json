The district court enhanced Linarez Jer-ez\u2019s sentence based upon its finding that his prior California conviction for lewd acts with a child under the age of 14 was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Linarez Jerez argues that the offense for which he was convicted did not qualify as a crime of violence because the statute under which he was convicted was overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-24\">Linarez Jerez did not object on this basis in the district court. Accordingly, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 411-12 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2374, 185 L.Ed.2d 1091 (2013). In 2006, Linarez Jerez was convicted under CalPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 288(a). Under a common sense approach, his conviction was for the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(b)(iii)); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Zavalar-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 603-04 (5th Cir.2000). Lina-rez-Jerez cannot demonstrate that the district court committed a clear or obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
