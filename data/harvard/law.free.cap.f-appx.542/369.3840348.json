Brooks asserts generally that the district court erred in finding that he did not provide substantial assistance and in finding that he made misrepresentations in his previous motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-23\">\u201c[A] federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 628, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002); <em>United States v. Lightfoot, </em>724 F.3d 593, 595 (5th Cir.2013). Section 3742, 18 U.S.C., authorizes this court to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of an otherwise final sentence when the defendant argues that the sentence was imposed in violation of law; was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; was greater than the advisory guidelines range; or was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable. \u00a7 3742(a). We must consider Brooks\u2019s arguments regarding the denial of the Government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion to determine our jurisdiction. <em>See Lightfoot, </em>724 F.3d at 595. Brooks does not raise any argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ments that fall within the parameters of \u00a7 3742(a). Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See Lightfoot, </em>724 F.3d at 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
