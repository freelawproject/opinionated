The BIA concluded that Aladesanmi was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because she had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b863-18\">At an unknown time and place, Alade-sanmi, a Nigerian citizen, entered the United States without inspection. In 2004, Aladesanmi was convicted in Georgia of giving a false name, address, or date of birth to a law enforcement officer, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-25. After the Department of Homeland Security charged her as removable, Aladesanmi conceded removability and filed an application for cancellation of removal. Aladesan-mi\u2019s application stated that her removal to Nigeria would constitute an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her child, who is a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">The IJ denied Aladesanmi\u2019s application, concluding that her 2004 conviction constituted a crime involving moral turpitude, making her statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 240A(b)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). The BIA dismissed Aladesanmi\u2019s appeal, concluding that violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-25 is categorically a crime of moral turpitude because an intent to deceive is an essential element of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-20\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">Pursuant to INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, the Attorney General has the discretion to cancel removal of a nonperman-ent resident who, among other things, es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>tablishes she has not been convicted of an offense under \u00a7 212(a)(2). INA \u00a7 240A(b)(1)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C). Under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2), an alien is inadmissible if she was convicted of acts that constitute the essential elements of a crime involving moral turpitude. INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). INA \u00a7 212(a)(2) does not define moral turpitude.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We have said that moral turpitude involves \u201c[a]n act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u201d <em>Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215 (11th Cir.2002). In deciding whether a particular offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude, we apply the categorical approach, looking at \u201cthe inherent nature of the offense, as defined in the relevant statute, rather than the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s particular conduct.\u201d <em>Fajardo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>659 F.3d 1303, 1305 (11th Cir.2011). In doing so, we look at whether the least culpable conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute meets the standard of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Keungne v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1281, 1284 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Crimes of dishonesty or false statement are considered generally to involve moral turpitude. <em>Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1215. For example, we concluded that misprision of a felony is a crime involving moral turpitude because the offense conduct was \u201cbehavior that runs contrary to accepted societal duties and involves dishonest or fraudulent activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Section 16-10-25 of the Georgia Code provides that \u201c[a] person <em>who gives a false name, address, or date of birth </em>to a law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of his official duties <em>with the intent of misleading </em>the officer <em>as to his identity or birthdate </em>is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-25 (emphasis added). The statute has as an element an \u201cintent to deceive.\u201d <em>Rajappa v. State, </em>200 Ga.App. 372, 374, 408 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ga.App. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Thus, two essential elements of Alade-sanmi\u2019s \u00a7 16-10-25 offense were providing false information and the intent to deceive. Because Aladesanmi\u2019s offense involved both dishonesty and the making of a false statement, the BIA properly concluded that the offense categorically was a crime involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Aladesanmi contends that her \u00a7 16-10-25 offense did not involve moral turpitude because her false statement was not material. This argument ignores that \u00a7 16-10-25 specifies what the false information must be about \u2014 \u201ca false name, address, or date of birth\u201d \u2014 with the intent to mislead the officer as to \u201cidentity or birthdate.\u201d Thus, the Georgia statute itself makes a false name, address or date of birth material to the officer\u2019s inquiry about \u201cidentity or birthdate.\u201d <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In any event, this Court has not required a false statement to be material in order to qualify as a crime of moral turpitude. Further, the BIA has concluded that false statements made to mislead a government official performing his official functions need not be material to constitute a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See In re Jurado-Delgado, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 29, 34 (BIA 2006) (involving a Pennsylvania conviction for deliberately making written false statements with the intent to mislead a public servant in performing his official function). Because the INA is silent on the issue and the BIA has reasonably interpreted the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d to include making false statements to government officials with the intent to mislead them, regardless of materiality, the BIA\u2019s interpretation is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 1445, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">For these reasons, the BIA did not err in dismissing Aladesanmi\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s order denying cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. We review only the BIA's decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (\"When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d). When an alien seeking review of a removal order has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, our jurisdiction to review the petition is limited to constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), (D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). Thus, we have jurisdiction to review the legal question of whether an alien's conviction constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude, but we will defer to the BIA's interpretation if it is reasonable. <em>Sosa-Martinez v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>420 F.3d 1338, 1340-41 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-13\">. Because all violations of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16 \u2014 10\u2014 25 include making a false statement with an intent to deceive, there is no merit to Alade-sanmi's claim that the BIA should have applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether her offense was a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Fajardo, </em>659 F.3d at 1305 (explaining that the modified categorical approach is used when the statutory language \"encompasses some conduct that categorically would be grounds for removal as well as other conduct that would not.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\">. <em>Chevron U.S.A.
