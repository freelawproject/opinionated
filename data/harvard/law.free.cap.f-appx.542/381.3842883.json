He contends that because a supervised release violation implicates only a breach of the court\u2019s trust and because he is not a danger to the community, his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">Because Rodriguez-Banda did not object to his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2013). In this case, the sentencing court noted Rodriguez-Banda\u2019s recidivism when it imposed the sentence. The need for a sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct is a proper factor for consideration. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a)(2)(A). As Rodriguez-Banda has not demonstrated plain error, we AFFIRM the district court order revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to 12 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
