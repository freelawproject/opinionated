Vandenbrink appeals the dismissal with prejudice of her third amended complaint for failure to state a claim against her insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and Jeremy Joseph Voneschen. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Vandenbrink sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction against State Farm that would protect the proceeds of a settlement that resolved Vandenbrink\u2019s personal injury claim against Voneschen. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 86.011. Vandenbrink received medical payment benefits from State Farm that were subject to repayment after Vanden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>brink was \u201cmade whole.\u201d State Farm notified Vandenbrink that it intended to seek reimbursement if she were made whole, but State Farm did not take any action to collect its payments and later disclaimed any present intent to obtain any of the proceeds of Vandenbrink\u2019s settlement. Because Vandenbrink\u2019s complaint presents a controversy not ripe for judicial review, we vacate the order that dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Vandenbrink was injured in an automobile accident caused by Voneschen. Van-denbrink paid some of her medical expenses using medical payment benefits disbursed by State Farm. Voneschen\u2019s insurance company refused to settle, and Vandenbrink sued Voneschen.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">State Farm notified Vandenbrink\u2019s attorney that it intended to seek reimbursement if Voneschen fully compensated Van-denbrink for her losses. On August 3, 2011, State Farm sent Vandenbrink a letter stating that it \u201cintend[ed] to pursue a subrogation claim for ... Medical Payments Coverage in the amount of $6,584.50.\u201d On March 7, 2012, State Farm sent Vandenbrink a second letter stating that it \u201cintend[ed] to seek recovery for the [$8,509.54] paid under the Medical Payments Coverage (MPC) portion of the policy as allowed under Florida Sources Statute 768.76.\u201d The March letter stated that State Farm \u201cunderstood] that [its] right to recovery [was] contingent upon [Van-denbrink] being made whole by the settlement ... negotiate^] with the tortfeasor or [his] insurance carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Vandenbrink settled her dispute with Voneschen, paid her attorney\u2019s fees and outstanding medical bills, and deposited the remainder in a trust account. Vanden-brink amended her complaint against Vo-neschen to add a putative class action against State Farm, and State Farm removed the amended complaint to the district court. Later, Vandenbrink filed a second amended complaint that added new claims against State Farm and named Richard Berg as a co-plaintiff. The district court dismissed the second amended complaint and allowed Vandenbrink to re-plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Vandenbrink filed a third amended complaint that requested, on behalf of herself and other similarly situated residents of Florida, a declaration under the Florida Declaratory Judgment Act that State Farm was \u201cnot entitled to seek reimbursement or subrogation for medical benefits [it had] paid.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 86.011. Vandenbrink alleged that she \u201c[had] not [been] made whole because she did not recover the full value of her case, which, <em>at a minimum, </em>was at least $40,000\u201d and that State Farm knew it \u201chad no right to [seek reimbursement or subrogation for medical benefits it had paid] if [Vandenbrink] had not been made whole.\u201d Vandenbrink also alleged that State Farm had \u201cpressed its standard and commonly followed practice and course of conduct seeking reimbursement or subrogation,\u201d as revealed in its letters dated August 3, 2011, and March 7, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">State Farm moved to dismiss Vanden-brink\u2019s third amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (b)(6), and to strike her request for class certification, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(d)(1)(D). State Farm argued that Vandenbrink\u2019s allegations were inadequate to \u201csupport a claim for declaratory relief.\u201d State Farm argued that \u201cno controversy or doubts [existed] as to the rights of the parties because the Policy complies with [the requirement under] Florida law ... [that there was no right of reimbursement until an insured was made whole] and because State Farm [had] not taken any action contrary to the Policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The district court ruled that Vanden-brink had standing to seek a declaratory judgment because she risked injury \u201cif State Farm pursue[d] its subrogation claim before Vandenbrink [was] made whole,\u201d but that she had failed to state a claim that she faced an imminent injury as required under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The district court ruled that the complaint failed to allege a \u201cpresent controversy about\u201d the right of State Farm to reimbursement when the parties agreed that \u201cany subrogation right [was] subject to [Vandenbrink] being \u2018made whole by the settlement negotiated\u2019 \u201d with Voneschen. The district court also ruled that Vanden-brink failed to \u201csufficiently allege that an actual need for [a] declaration is imminent because she did not allege that she [had] paid any money to State Farm, that State Farm actually [had] received a portion of [Vandenbrink\u2019s] settlement from [Vones-chen], or that State Farm [had] initiated any action against [Vandenbrink] seeking to recover payments.\u201d The district court dismissed Vandenbrink\u2019s third amended complaint and dismissed as moot the motion to strike her request for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>issues involving subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Digital Props., Inc. v. City of Plantation, </em>121 F.3d 586, 589 (11th Cir.1997). The jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to actual cases and controversies. \u201cArticle III of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to cases and controversies of sufficient concreteness to evidence a ripeness for review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For a controversy to be ripe for review, \u201cthe complained-of injury must be immediate or imminently threatened.\u201d <em>Wilderness Soc\u2019y v. Alcock, </em>83 F.3d 386, 390 (11th Cir.1996). In other words, it must be \u201cthe correct <em>time </em>for the complainant to bring the action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Vandenbrink\u2019s third amended complaint because she did not face an \u201cinjury imminent enough for purposes of judicial decisionmaking.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 390. State Farm asserted a right to reimbursement, but it also acknowledged that it could not recover its medical payments until Vandenbrink was \u201cmade whole\u201d for her injuries. <em>See Schonau v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co., </em>903 So.2d 285, 287 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.2005). State Farm has not exercised its right to reimbursement since Vanden-brink collected her settlement proceeds, and State Farm avows that it \u201cdoes not seek recovery of [the] funds\u201d that Vanden-brink placed in a trust account. Because Vandenbrink does not face even the threat of an injury, her complaint is nonjusticia-ble.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We VACATE the order that dismissed Vandenbrink\u2019s third amended complaint for failure to state a claim and REMAND with instructions for the district court to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
