No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010) (FSA). The district court denied Goddard\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced as a career offender and his conviction and sentence occurred prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date. On appeal, Goddard argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion), called into question our precedent holding that career offenders were not eligible for sentence reductions based on Amendment 750 because their sentences were based on the career offender guidelines rather than the crack cocaine guidelines. He further contends that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under the FSA because Congress intended for the FSA to be applied retroactively. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Any reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission and must be based on a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable by Amendment 759, made permanent an amendment revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 750, 759. The FSA amended the sentencing provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), the statute under which Goddard was convicted, by raising the amount of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the five-year mandatory minimum sentence and forty-year maximum sentence from five grams to twenty-eight grams. <em>See </em>FSA, Pub.L. No 111-120, 124 Stat. 2372. Under the FSA, where a defendant has distributed less than twenty-eight grams of crack cocaine, a maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment applies. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The Supreme Court recently held in <em>Dorsey v. United States </em>that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after the date the FSA went into effect. 567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The FSA is not retroactive because its provisions apply to sentences entered after its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">A career offender\u2019s offense level is determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b), rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court lacks the authority to grant \u00a7 3582(c) relief to a career offender where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into plea agreements under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. 564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. The plurality opinion in Freeman concluded that a defendant who enters into a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement should be eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was informed by the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2693-95. In Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence, she determined that the defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the express terms of his Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement based his sentence on a guideline sentencing range applicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>charged offense. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, notwithstanding the fact that his sentence was based on the career offender guideline. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319-21. We further determined that neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1321. Unlike the plea agreement at issue in <em>Freeman, </em>which explicitly referenced the sentencing guidelines which informed the agreed-upon sentence, the career offender guidelines do not reference the underlying offense and its base offense level. In other words, even if Goddard had been sentenced after the adoption of Amendment 750, his sentence would not be change because it was based on the career offender sentencing guidelines. Thus, we held that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule our holding in <em>Moore. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Similarly, the FSA does not provide Goddard with retroactive sentencing relief. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we held that a career offender was not entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory minimum sentences, concluding that the FSA was a statutory change, not a guidelines amendment, and therefore could not provide a basis for reducing a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). 701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam). We noted that even if the defendant could bring a FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, he would not be eligible for a reduction in sentence because his conviction and sentence occurred prior to the effective date of the FSA, and the FSA did not apply retroactively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">In <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>we held that a defendant was not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 750 and the FSA because Amendment 750 did not alter the mandatory m\u00ednimums in effect at the time of his sentencing, and the FSA did not apply retroactively to defendants who were convicted and sentenced prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date. 712 F.3d 535, 541-42 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 12, 2013) (No. 12-10828).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The district court did not err in denying Goddard\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Goddard was initially assigned a base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, his total offense level and guideline range were calculated pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1 because he is a career offender. Thus, Goddard is not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Goddard\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s plurality decision in <em>Freeman </em>is unpersuasive because in <em>Lawson </em>we noted that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence is the holding in <em>Freeman, </em>and that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule our holding in <em>Moore. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">As to Goddard\u2019s FSA argument, the FSA is a statutory change, rather than a guidelines amendment, and thus, it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Even if Goddard could raise his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, it would fail because Goddard was sentenced in 2002, long before the FSA\u2019s effective date, and the FSA does not apply retroactively. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377; <em>Hip-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>polyte, 712 F.3d at 542. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Uz\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
