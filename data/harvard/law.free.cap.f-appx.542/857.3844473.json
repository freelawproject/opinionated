The magistrate judge determined that Deonarinesingh\u2019s appellate counsel had provided deficient performance by failing to raise the enhancement on direct appeal, but that Deo-narinesingh was not prejudiced by this deficient performance because there was no indication in the record that Deonarine-singh would have received a sentence other than the ninety-seven-month sentence that was imposed. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation over Deonarinesingh\u2019s objections and denied the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">After denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion, Deo-narinesingh sought a certificate of appeala-bility (COA), which the district court denied. On appeal, we granted a COA to address only the following issue: Whether Deonarinesingh\u2019s appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise on direct appeal a claim that the district court erred in applying a two-level increase to Deonarinesingh\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.1(b)(10)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Deonarinesingh argues that the district court erred by concluding that he was not prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance. Deonarinesingh argues that there is a reasonable probability that, on direct appeal, we would have remanded his case for resentencing. In its response, the government concedes both that Deonarine-singh\u2019s appellate counsel performed defi-ciently by failing to challenge the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) enhancement on direct appeal and that Deonarinesingh was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Because both prongs of the test enumerated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), present mixed questions of law and fact, we review both prongs de novo. <em>Dell v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1267, 1272 (11th Cir .2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The petitioner bears the burden of proof on both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1176 (11th Cir. 2001). Courts need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. Strickland\u2019s two-part test also governs claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>Clark v. Crosby, </em>335 F.3d 1303, 1310 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">Under the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant must establish prejudice by showing a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201c[A] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must affirmatively prove prejudice because attorney errors \u201care as likely to be utterly harmless ... as they are to be prejudicial.\u201d <em>Gilreath v. Head, </em>234 F.3d 547, 551 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Relevant to determining the probability that the result of the proceeding would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>have been different but for counsel\u2019s errors is whether the objection to the enhancement was preserved for appellate review. <em>See Dell, </em>710 F.3d at 1274 (stating that, on \u00a7 2255 motion collateral review, we judged whether the defendant had a reasonable probability of success on direct appeal, keeping in mind that a plain error standard would have applied to the claim on direct appeal). If it was preserved, on direct appeal \u201c[w]e [would have] reviewed] de novo [the] district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the established facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1283 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2375, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2012). If it was not, we would have reviewed for plain error. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 565 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1648, 182 L.Ed.2d 242 (2012). Thus, if the objection had been preserved for review, it is more likely that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different;\u201d that is, it is more likely that we would have vacated Deonarinesingh\u2019s sentence on direct appeal under a de novo standard than a plain error standard. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The unique circumstances of this case make it unclear whether a de novo or a plain error standard would have applied on direct review. Deonarinesingh did not object to the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) enhancement; rather, the government noted that the enhancement was improper. Deonarine-singh\u2019s counsel never adopted the government\u2019s objection to the enhancement, but Deonarinesingh did file a pro se letter adopting the government\u2019s objection. The United States Probation Office responded to both the government\u2019s and the pro se objection, and the district court addressed the issue directly in rejecting Deonarine-singh\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">The contemporaneous objection rule does not exist for its own sake but \u201cto protect judicial resources, in particular by ensuring that the trial courts will have an opportunity to avoid errors that might otherwise necessitate time-consuming retrial\u201d and \u201cto prevent counsel from sandbagging the courts by withholding a valid objection from the trial court in order to obtain a new trial when the error is recognized on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the objection must be specific and of the same kind raised on appeal so that the district court has an opportunity to address the precise issue. <em>United States v. Gallo-Chamorro, </em>48 F.3d 502, 507-08 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Here, the objectives of the contemporaneous objection rule have been met. The government\u2019s objection, specific to the sentencing enhancement, combined with Deonarinesingh\u2019s pro se letter and the United States Probation Office\u2019s argument, allowed the district court to consider the propriety of the enhancement, giving it the opportunity to avoid error at sentencing. Importantly, the district court recognized and addressed the argument against enhancement, so that it had the opportunity to avoid error. Moreover, although counsel did not voice any objection to the enhancement, Deonarinesingh adopted the government\u2019s objection, so it can hardly be argued that there was any attempt by Deonarinesingh at \u201csandbagging.\u201d <em>See Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276. Therefore, because the objectives of the contemporaneous objection rule were met, the objection was preserved for direct review, and it would have been subject to de novo review had appellate counsel raised the argument. <em>Cf. United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1493 n. 1 (11th Cir.1990) (applying \u201cnormal appellate review\u201d to claims of both co-defendants despite the fact that counsel for only one of the defendants objected).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Because there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that we would have vacated Deonarine-singh\u2019s sentence on direct review under a de novo standard, Deonarinesingh has established prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A defendant receives a two-level increase to his offense level if the offense involved the production or trafficking of any (i) unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device, or (ii) authentication feature. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B). The Commentary to the Guidelines provides that the terms \u201cunauthorized access device\u201d and \u201ccounterfeit access device\u201d both have the meaning established in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 9(A). \u201c[Unauthorized access device\u201d is defined as \u201cany access device that is lost, stolen, expired, revoked, canceled, or obtained with intent to defraud.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(8). A \u201ccounterfeit access device\u201d is \u201cany access device that is counterfeit, fictitious, altered, or forged, or an identifiable component of an access device or a counterfeit access device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1029(e)(2). The statute defines an \u201caccess device\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-6\">any card, plate, code, account number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other telecommunications service, equipment, or instrument identifier, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds <em>(other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument </em>).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1029(e)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">We have not considered whether a fraudulent check constitutes an access device, as defined by \u00a7 1029(e) or under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(B). However, in a case challenging the sufficiency of the indictment, we cited legislative history that stated that \u00a7 1029(e)\u2019s definition of \u201caccess device\u201d was \u201cbroad enough to encompass future technological changes and <em>the only limitation ... </em>excludes activities such as passing forged checks.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabbs, </em>134 F.3d 1071, 1081 (11th Cir.1998) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u00a7 1029(e)(1) expressly states that it excludes any \u201ctransfer originated solely by paper instrument.\u201d Legislative history and the unanimous determination of those of our sister circuits to have considered the issue that \u201caccess device\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1029(e) does not include fraudulent checks would have lent appellate counsel further support for the argument that the district court incorrectly calculated the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 98-368, at 10 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3647, 3656 (stating that the definition of \u201caccess devices\u201d under \u00a7 1029(e) \u201cdoes not cover activities such as passing bad checks);\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 98-894, at 19 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3689, 3705 (stating that the definition of \u201caccess devices\u201d under \u00a7 1029(e) \u201cexcludes activities such as passing forged checks);\u201d <em>United States v. Butler, </em>646 F.3d 1038, 1041 (8th Cir.2011) (\u201cThus, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) cannot be applied to ... a scheme limited to fraudulent check-cashing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Tatum, </em>518 F.3d 769, 770-72 (10th Cir.2008) (holding that neither checks themselves nor the account numbers printed on them qualified as \u201caccess devices\u201d for \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) purposes); <em>United States v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 434 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that, for 1029(e) purposes only, the statute \u201cunambiguously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>places the passing of bad checks ... outside [its] scope\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In cases on direct appeal, \u201c[a]n error in the district court\u2019s calculation of the Sentencing Guidelines range warrants vacating the sentence, unless the error is harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Barner, </em>572 F.3d 1239, 1247 (11th Cir.2009). The guideline error is harmless if the district court unambiguously expressed that it would have imposed the same sentence, even without the erroneous calculation. <em>Id. </em>at 1248. If the error is harmless, we need only inquire whether the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). For example, in <em>United States v. Dean, </em>517 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir.2008), we noted that, \u201c[a]t sentencing, the district court judge also stated that he still would have imposed [the same imprisonment term] as a reasonable sentence, regardless of any guidelines miscalculation, because of the facts of the case and defendant\u2019s misleading and shifting testimony offered in an effort to hide the truth.\u201d In <em>Keene, </em>the district court stated that \u201ceven if the guideline calculations are wrong, my application of the sentencing factors under Section 3553(a) would still compel the conclusion that a 10-year sentence ... is reasonable and appropriate under all the factors that I considered.\u201d 470 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">In contrast, where the district court has emphasized that the guideline range influenced the sentence, we have held that a calculation error was not harmless. <em>See United States v. Paley, </em>442 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). In <em>Paley, </em>our conclusion regarding the harmlessness of the sentencing error was based largely on the district court\u2019s statement that it had been \u201ca difficult sentencing\u201d and that it had been \u201cgreatly influenced by the Advisory Guidelines.\u201d <em>See id. </em>We found that the erroneous calculation was not harmless in spite of the fact that the district court emphasized that a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment \u201cadequately reflected] the seriousness of the offense and provide[d] just and reasonable punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Here, then, the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Keene </em>on collateral review is misplaced. During sentencing, the district court repeatedly stated that it relied on the guidelines range and the government\u2019s \u201cearlier announced position that they would not be recommending more than the low end of the guideline range.\u201d The district court mentioned the precise length of the sentence it would eventually impose only as an explanatory aside to its declaration \u201cthat the government ... recommends the low end.\u201d Although the court stated that \u201cit ha[d] the authority to sentence anywhere within the range or without the range,\u201d such a statement does not negate the court\u2019s reliance on the guidelines. Even though the court noted its <em>authonty </em>to disregard the guidelines in reaching a sentence, it also emphasized that the guidelines would be \u201chighly suggestive of the appropriate and proper sentence that should be imposed.\u201d Under these circumstances, it is clear that the erroneous calculation \u201caffectfed] the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Paley, </em>442 F.3d at 1278 (internal quotation marks omitted). The erroneous calculation here is therefore not harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Accordingly, because we would have found that (1) the district court erred in calculating the guidelines, and (2) the error was not harmless, Deonarinesingh has established prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 1278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Because Deonarinesingh has established prejudice, we must now examine whether counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable\u2014 that is, whether \u201cparticular and identified acts or omissions of counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Our review of counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and we apply a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and that all significant decisions were made in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (internal quotation marks omitted). We conduct an objective inquiry into the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, such that \u201ca petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. We evaluate counsel\u2019s effectiveness based on counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 1316 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Appellate counsel is not required to raise all nonfrivolous issues on appeal, and, as a result, it is difficult for a defendant to show that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise certain issues on appeal, especially where counsel raised other strong issues. <em>Payne v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <em>see also Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 288, 120 S.Ct. 746, 765, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) (stating that \u201conly when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented, will the presumption of effective assistance of counsel be overcome\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Appellate counsel does not render deficient performance by failing to raise an issue on appeal if the legal principle is unsettled. <em>Black v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 1140, 1144 (11th Cir.2004). However, counsel\u2019s ignorance of a well-defined legal principle could be inexcusable and demonstrate ineffective performance. <em>Id. </em>Further, we have held that \u201cthe mere absence of authority does not automatically insulate counsel\u2019s failure\u201d to raise the issue. <em>Gallo-Chamorro v. United States, </em>233 F.3d 1298, 1304 (11th Cir.2000) (concerning counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial). Rather, the fact that other circuits have addressed the issue on the merits may indicate that a challenge \u201con such grounds [is] not wholly without precedent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Here, Deonarinesingh argues, and the government concedes, that Deonarinesingh\u2019s appellate counsel performed deficiently. The district court likewise found that appellate counsel was deficient. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Deonarinesingh does not argue the strength of the ignored \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) claim relative to that of the claims actually raised. Nevertheless, the government argues, and we agree, that the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(B) claim was \u201cclearly stronger than\u201d the claims actually raised on direct appeal: number of victims enhancement, aggravating role enhancement, sophisticated means enhancement, and substantive reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Under the number of victims enhancement claim, Deonarinesingh previously asked this court to adopt the rule, established by the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States v. Yagar, </em>404 F.3d 967, 971 (6th Cir.2005), that reimbursed victims of bank fraud are not victims for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B). However, our decision in <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 895 (11th Cir.2005) foreclosed this argument by expressly refusing to apply the <em>Yogar </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">On direct appeal, we reviewed the decisions of the district court regarding the aggravating role and sophisticated means enhancements under a clear error standard. <em>United States v. Deonarinesingh, </em>411 Fed.Appx. 245, 247 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). We will not find clear error \u201cunless, in view of the entire record, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Glassroth v. Moore, </em>335 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under clear error review, this court cannot reverse the district court where it \u201chas chosen one of two plausible views of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, because there was substantial evidence to support the enhancements, Deonarinesingh faced a small likelihood of success on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Deonarinesingh\u2019s substantive reasonableness claim likewise faced a substantial hurdle on direct appeal. We reviewed the sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Deonarinesingh, </em>411 Fed.Appx. at 249. The party challenging the sentence on appeal bears the burden of showing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We ordinarily expect a within-the-guidelines sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>With such an exacting standard on review, any defendant challenging a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range is unlikely to be successful. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that we had found only four out of \u201chundreds of sentences ... to be substantively unreasonable\u201d). In particular, Deo-narinesingh\u2019s sole argument supporting the substantive unreasonableness claim\u2014 that his co-defendants received lower sentences \u2014 did not articulate a cognizable challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence. <em>Deonarinesingh, </em>411 Fed-Appx. at 249 (explaining that \u201cdisparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">On the contrary, a \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) claim would have carried a substantial likelihood of success on direct appeal. Although we have determined that such a claim would have faced de novo review, we nonetheless examine its merit under a plain error standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To obtain reversal under plain error review, \u201c(1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The error must also \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">As stated, the district court committed error by applying the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>enhancement at Deonarinesingh\u2019s sentencing. In addition, that error was plain because the plain language of the statute \u201cunambiguously places the passing of bad checks and similar conduct outside the scope of the federal statute.\u201d <em>Tatum, </em>518 F.3d at 771 (internal quotation marks omitted). The error also affected Deonarinesingh\u2019s substantial rights as well as \u201cthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d at 1239 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Antonietti, </em>86 F.3d 206, 209 (11th Cir.1996) (finding that an incorrect calculation of a guidelines range constituted plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">In sum, the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) claim was \u201cclearly stronger\u201d than the claims appellate counsel raised on direct appeal, and appellate counsel was thus deficient in failing to raise the claim. Deonarinesingh has therefore established the first <em>Strickland </em>prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Upon review of the record and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we hold that the district court erred by determining that appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance did not prejudice Deonarinesingh. Accordingly, Deonarinesingh\u2019s appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance under <em>Strickland </em>by failing to appeal the application of the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) enhancement. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision denying Deonarinesingh\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, vacate Deonarinesingh\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">REVERSED, VACATED, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">. In the current version of the Sentencing Guidelines, this provision is located at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\">. Deonarinesingh pled guilty to one count of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; to make utter, and possess counterfeited securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a); and to transfer an implement designed for making a counterfeit security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(b).

We note that the burden of proving that an erroneous Sentencing Guidelines calculation is harmless is on the government. <em>See Paley, </em>442 F.3d at 1278. Not only does the government not contest Deonarinesingh\u2019s appeal of the district court's denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion or the issue of harmless error, it has affirmatively argued that the error was not harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">. The record does not make clear the precise reason why appellate counsel decided not to raise the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) claim. It appears that he believed such a claim to be \"frivolous,\u201d though the record does not expound on whether uncertainty about the applicable standard of review impacted the decision. In order to follow the maxim \"that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at that time,\u201d <em>Eagle v. Linahan, </em>279 F.3d 926, 940 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2065), we will examine the likelihood of success on a \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B) claim under a plain error standard in order to determine whether that claim was \"clearly stronger than those presented.\u201d <em>Robbins, </em>528 U.S. at 288, 120 S.Ct. at 765 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
