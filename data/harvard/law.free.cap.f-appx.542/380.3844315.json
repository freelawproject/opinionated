To the extent that Cantu contends that there is no proof in the record that the property was subject to forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853 and that neither the indictment nor the plea agreement provides for the forfeiture, the superseding indictment contained a notice of forfeiture that specified \u00a7 982(a)(6) as the basis for the forfeiture\u2014 not \u00a7 853. Cantu\u2019s conclusory allegations of error, which lack citation to the record or appropriate legal authority, do not demonstrate that the district court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous or that the district court erred in ordering the forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Juluke, </em>426 F.3d 323, 326 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Gasanova, </em>332 F.3d 297, 300-01 (5th Cir.2003); <em>cf. United States v. Ballard, </em>779 F.2d 287, 295 (5th Cir.1986) (determining that a party who offered only a bare listing of alleged errors without referencing supporting authorities or the record abandoned those claims on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-23\">Moreover, after a forfeiture hearing in which the government presented physical and testimonial evidence, the district court found that \u201cthe defendant ... intended to use the property to facilitate the commission of the offense of which he has been found guilty.\u201d The district court\u2019s conclusion was founded upon evidence that over several months, Cantu was paid $100 per illegal alien for the use of the Brooks County Property which, as argued by the government in response to Cantu\u2019s appeal, \u201callowed the organization to circumvent the United States Border Patrol eheck-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>point, conceal the illegal aliens in an area covering hundreds of acres to avoid detection by law enforcement, and harbor the illegal aliens until drivers could pick them up for transport north of the checkpoint. The use of the Brooks County Property enabled the alien smuggling organization to conceal their ... activities and obstruct and hinder law enforcement ...\u201d The district court\u2019s finding that the government established by a preponderance of the evidence that the Brooks County property was used to facilitate the crime of conspiracy to transport illegal aliens, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s final order of forfeiture is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
