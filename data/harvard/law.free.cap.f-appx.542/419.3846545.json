He received an 84-month prison sentence. On appeal, Looman challenges his conviction on the grounds that the factual basis for his plea was insufficient and that the Commerce Clause did not grant Congress the authority to enact the statute he was convicted under. The Government moves for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-23\">A defendant can be guilty of possessing a firearm as a felon only if, as relevant here, there is proof that the \u201cfirearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Meza, </em>701 F.3d 411, 418 (5th Cir.2012); <em>see </em>\u00a7 922(g)(1). Looman does not dispute that the factual basis contained this element. Instead, he argues that the factual basis was insufficient because it did not state that by possessing the gun he was actively participating in economic activity or that he was engaged in the gun market at the time of his arrest. Moreover, he contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is invalid to the extent that it attempts to criminalize a felon\u2019s possession of a firearm that is not directly related to ongoing commerce. In support of these assertions, he relies on his interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012), which he contends es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tablishes that the Commerce Clause permits Congress to regulate only ongoing economic activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">We recently rejected the argument that <em>National Federation </em>overrules our prior precedent holding \u00a7 922(g)(1) constitutional. <em>United States v. Alcantar, </em>No. 12-10909, 733 F.3d 143, 145-46, 2013 WL 5524731, at *2 (5th Cir.2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, this issue is now foreclosed, making summary affirmance appropriate. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AR7\">. In that case, we determined that the standard of review applicable to Alcantar\u2019s argument was not case determinative because even under de novo review, there was no error. <em>See Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d at 146, 2013 WL 5524731, at *2 n. 4. Thus, we need not determine the standard of review applicable here because <em>Alcantar </em>forecloses Looman\u2019s argument even under the least deferential standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
