The district court also revoked Gallardo-Bejarano\u2019s term of supervised release on a prior conviction and imposed a sentence at the top of the advisory guidelines range of 14 months, to run concurrently to the illegal reentry sentence. His appeals from those judgments were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On appeal, Gallardo-Bejarano concedes that precedent forecloses his argument that the lack of an empirical basis for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 precludes an appellate presumption that his 71-month sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). However, he contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the Sentencing Guidelines account for a prior conviction both to increase his offense level and to calculate his criminal history score. He also asserts that his crime of conviction was a type of trespass and the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and circumstances. Gallardo-Bejarano raises no challenges in this court to the revocation proceeding or sentence; thus, he has abandoned any challenge that he could have raised. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We have rejected the argument that illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense that is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). The argument that \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and constitutes double counting is also foreclosed. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Gallardo-Bejarano\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). The fact that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Gallardo-Bejarano has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentences of 71 months. <em>See id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
