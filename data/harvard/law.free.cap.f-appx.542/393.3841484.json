His offense level was increased for a Texas conviction for attempted sexual assault that was deemed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d (\u201cCOV\u201d) under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He contends that his Texas conviction was not a COV because some of the offenses codified as sexual assault in Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.011 do not qualify as COVs under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-25\">We review for plain error because the issue is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Andino-Ortega, </em>608 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir.2010). To establish plain error, Bonilla Guerra must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-26\">We recently rejected, on <em>de novo </em>review, an indistinguishable argument in <em>United States v. Castro-Gonzalez, </em>No. 11-41090, 530 Fed.Appx. 285, 285-90, 2013 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>2421677, at *1-4 (5th Cir. Jun. 4, 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished), in which we held that a conviction under Section 22.011 is a forcible-sex offense and therefore a COV under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, <em>Castro-Gonzalez, </em>though unpublished, is on point and sufficient to show that there was no obvious or plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Also, Bonilla Guerra contends that the district court plainly erred in convicting, sentencing, and entering judgment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because he was not deported following a conviction for an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). He maintains that the sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing or, in the alternative, for reformation of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As Bonilla Guerra acknowledges, his claim is reviewed for plain error because he did not raise it in the district court. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.2009). The Texas conviction does not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>See Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 215-16 (5th Cir.2013). As he concedes, however, Bonilla Guerra cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights given that his sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368. Because Bonilla Guerra cannot overcome plain-error review and because the government does not concede that the judgment should be reformed, Bonilla Guerra has not shown that we should remand for resentencing or that the judgment should be reformed. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 368-69; <em>see also Castro-Gonzalez, </em>530 Fed.Appx. at 291, 2013 WL 2421677, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
