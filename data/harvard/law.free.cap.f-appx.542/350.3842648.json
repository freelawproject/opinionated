Mullins challenges the district court\u2019s denial of relief on his claims that (1) trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to investigate his mental health history and in abandoning the insanity defense at trial, (2) trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to present any mitigating evidence at the punishment phase, (3) he was denied due process when the trial court did not appoint a psychiatrist for the defense, and (4) his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to raise on appeal the issue that the trial court abused its discretion in not appointing a psychiatrist for the defense. To the extent that Mullins also raises the issues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to challenge his confession and in failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct, the issues are beyond the scope of the certif\u00edcate of ap-pealability, and this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Simmons v. Epps, </em>654 F.3d 526, 535 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2374, 182 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">In reviewing the denial of \u00a7 2254 relief, this court reviews issues of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error, applying the same deference to the state courts\u2019 decision as the district court under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. <em>Ortiz v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.2007). Because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 rejection of Mullins\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel was not contrary to and did not involve an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and did not involve \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d the district court did not err in denying Mullins habeas relief on these claims. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 787-89, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). The district court also did not err in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>relief on Mullins\u2019s claim that the state trial court violated due process in not appointing a psychiatrist for the defense pursuant to <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 76, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d); <em>Woodward v. Epps, </em>580 F.3d 318, 332 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
