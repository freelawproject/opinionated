He contends the evidence indicated that he was not engaged in the business of selling firearms, and he did not need the money from the sale of firearms to support himself. He contends that he sold some firearms on one occasion to purchase a vehicle for his son, but maintains that selling a gun collection is legal and does not constitute engaging in the business of dealing in firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">A review of the evidence indicates that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Pegg was engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>666 F.3d 905, 907 (5th Cir.2012). The jury rejected Pegg\u2019s testimony that he merely collected firearms and sold them occasionally, and this court may not substitute its own views on the credibility of witnesses for those of the jury. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 353 (5th Cir.2009). Pegg frequently bought firearms from the Barksdale Air Force Base Exchange and gun shows, he sold firearms for a profit, he did not keep records on these sales, and he sometimes advertised firearms for sale in the local newspaper. The evidence indicated that Pegg\u2019s principal motivation for selling firearms was economic and that he made repetitive purchases and sales of firearms. The Government was not required to prove that Pegg\u2019s primary business was the sale of firearms or that he sold a specific number of firearms. For these reasons, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Pegg was engaged in the business of selling firearms without a license. <em>See Harris, </em>666 F.3d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"Ati\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
