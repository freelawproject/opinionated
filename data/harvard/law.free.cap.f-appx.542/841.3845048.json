After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Mr. Youngblood engaged in a number of crack cocaine sales transactions with an undercover police officer over the course of several months. On November 8, 2012, Mr. Youngblood pled guilty to four counts of distributing and possessing crack cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Because he was charged with controlled substance offenses and had previously been convicted of two charges of possession of cocaine with intent to sell, Mr. Youngblood was classified as a career offender, with a corresponding advisory range under the Sentencing Guidelines of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, explaining that it based its sentence, in large part, on Mr. Youngblood\u2019s previous criminal conduct, history, and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">On appeal, Mr. Youngblood argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because (1) the sentence did not comport with the \u201cparsimony clause\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (2) public policy considerations render the career offender guideline unsound; (3) the government\u2019s comment at sentencing that a 188-month sentence would be \u201cmore than enough to get [Mr. Youngblood\u2019s] attention\u201d led to the application of the wrong sentencing standard; and (4) the district court\u2019s statement at sentencing expressing concern that it would \u201cbe reversed by the 11th Circuit for failing to follow the advisory guidelines\u201d demonstrated that the district court erroneously analyzed and applied the advisory guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Even if the district court\u2019s sentence is more severe or more lenient than the sentence we would have imposed, we will only reverse if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">First, Mr. Youngblood contends that his sentence was longer than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a) and thereby violated the so-called \u201cparsimony principle.\u201d We ordinarily expect, but do not automatically assume, that a sentence within the applicable advisory guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Victor, </em>719 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2013) (citing <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008)). The district court\u2019s sentence in this case fell at the low end of the guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court considered Mr. Youngblood\u2019s personal and criminal history and concluded that a sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment comported with the Section 3553(a) factors. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Second, Mr. Youngblood argues that a policy disagreement over the application of the career offender guideline to a \u201clow-level, non-violent drug addict/dealer\u201d renders his sentence substantively unreasonable under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) and <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009). Although <em>Kimbrough </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>and <em>Spears </em>held, at most, that a district court may vary from a guidelines range where it disagrees with a particular guideline, application of this principle necessarily requires that the district court actually disagree with the guideline at issue. Here, the district court declined Mr. Youngblood\u2019s suggestion that it vary from the career offender advisory guideline, and the record offers no indication that the district court did, in fact, take issue with the policy underlying that guideline. <em>See Dell v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1267, 1279 (11th Cir.2013) <em>(\u201cKimbrough </em>empowered the district courts with this discretion, but it did not command them to exercise it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Third, Mr. Youngblood maintains that the government\u2019s comment at sentencing that a 188-month sentence would be \u201cmore than enough to get [Mr. Young-blood\u2019s] attention\u201d set forth an erroneous sentencing standard. The record, however, reflects that the district court applied the correct sentencing standard, having stated on the record that \u201cthe sentence imposed is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This argument therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Finally, Mr. Youngblood asserts that the district court\u2019s statement that it would \u201cbe reversed by the 11th Circuit for failing to follow the advisory guidelines\u201d demonstrated an improper unwillingness to grant a downward variance for fear of reversal. Coming as it did following Mr. Youngblood\u2019s objection to imposition of the career offender guideline and before the district court entertained argument on a downward variance and made final guideline findings, we' construe this comment merely to reflect the district court\u2019s recognition that it was required to calculate Mr. Youngblood\u2019s guideline range correctly. <em>See United States v. Balentine, </em>106 F.3d 404 (7th Cir.1997) (Table) (rejecting argument that district court\u2019s mere \u201cfear of being overturned\u201d reflected the belief that it could not grant a downward variance).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Mr. Youngblood\u2019s 188-month sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
