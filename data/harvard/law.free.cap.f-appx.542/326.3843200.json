California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Theriot has filed a response. He has also moved to file a pro se brief, which motion is GRANTED. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>record reflected therein, as well as Theri-ot\u2019s response and brief. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Theri-ot\u2019s motion to strike counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is DENIED. Likewise, Theriot\u2019s motion to consolidate his case with No. 12-20683 is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
