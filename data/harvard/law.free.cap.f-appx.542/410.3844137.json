On May 16, 2013, this court granted the motion by two of the defendants-appellees, Eric Smith and Kimberly Brown, to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">With respect to the remainder of Anderson\u2019s appeal, we affirm the judgment, as Anderson has failed to adequately brief the arguments he wishes to raise on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (recognizing that even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
