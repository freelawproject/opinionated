Mr. Giles argues that summary judgment was improper because sufficient evidence showed that BellSouth discriminated on the basis of his age, race, and sex by (1) denying him a promotion to the position of services technician, (2) subjecting him to a hostile work environment, (3) imposing intolerable working conditions that led to his constructive discharge, and (4) violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by defrauding customers and engaging in racial discrimination. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Mr. Giles began working for BellSouth in 1971. He held various positions until he retired as a testing technician in 2001. Mr. Giles soon regretted his decision. He eventually reapplied to BellSouth, and was hired as a sales associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">As a sales associate, Mr. Giles was responsible for recommending and selling a variety of telecommunications products and services over the phone. He quickly became disenchanted with his position. Managers would announce over speakers which employees had, and which had not, made sufficient sales for the day. They would also counsel employees on their performance in areas of the office where other employees could listen to the conversations. Mr. Giles found this environment stressful, and testified that his job was only made worse by the repeated counseling by his managers due to Mr. Giles frequently being late to work. Unhappy with his position as a sales associate, Mr. Giles diligently applied to other positions using BellSouth\u2019s formal bidding process, but failed to apply to any services technician positions from November to December of 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">After being disciplined numerous times for his poor performance and chronic tardiness, Mr. Giles voluntarily resigned on December 18, 2008. In his resignation meeting with BellSouth he was repeatedly asked whether he was sure he wanted to resign, but Mr. Giles testified he was \u201cfed up\u201d and had \u201cmade up [his] mind.\u201d Upon execution of the resignation paperwork, BellSouth agreed to, among other things, provide Mr. Giles 79 weeks termination pay and to keep him on the payroll until he exhausted his vacation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">On April 9, 2009, Mr. Giles filed an intake form and verified charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The charge of discrimination alleged only that BellSouth\u2019s failure to promote Mr. Giles to services technician from \u201cNovember 2008 up to December 31, 2008\u201d and his \u201cdischarge\u201d violated Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). We consider all evidence and reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Rojas v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Bus. &amp; Prof'l Regulations Pari-Mutuel, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). <em>See also Wilson v. B/E/ Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). The moving party bears the burden of production. Fic<em>kling v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). If the moving party meets this burden, \u201cthe nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFor factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record,\u201d <em>Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. Of Educ., </em>93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted), and mere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. <em>Bald Mountain Park, Ltd. v. Oliver, </em>863 F.2d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment on Mr. Giles\u2019 claims. In doing so, though the court correctly rejected the majority of Mr. Giles\u2019 claims on the merits, it erred by addressing his hostile workplace claim because it was not administratively exhausted with the EEOC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Under both Tile VII and the ADEA, as a condition precedent to filing a law suit an individual must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge of unlawful discrimination with the EEOC. <em>See Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2001) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b)) [Title VII]; <em>Bost v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2004) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(2)) [ADEA]. The filing of a charge of discrimination marks the beginning of a regulatory scheme involving \u201c \u2018an integrated, multi-step enforcement procedure\u2019 that enables the EEOC to detect and remedy various discriminatory employment practices.\u201d <em>Bost, </em>372 F.3d at 1238-1239 (quoting <em>E.E.O.C. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>466 U.S. 54, 62, 104 S.Ct. 1621, 80 L.Ed.2d 41 (1984)). In order to ensure that individuals do not circumvent this regulatory process and that \u201cthe settlement of grievances be first attempted through the office of the EEOC,\u201d <em>Wu v. Thomas, </em>863 F.2d 1543, 1548 (11th Cir.1989) (citation omitted), a plaintiffs federal complaint is \u201climited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Mulhall v. Advance Sec., Inc., </em>19 F.3d 586, 589 n. 8 (11th Cir.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Prior to reaching the merits of Mr. Giles\u2019 claims of discrimination, we must first determine whether the district court properly addressed only those claims that Mr. Giles exhausted through his verified charge of discrimination. We have said that judicial claims are exhausted if they are \u201clike or related to, or grew out of\u2019 allegations in an EEOC charge, and that a plaintiff may assert claims that merely \u201c \u2018amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus\u2019 \u201d allegations raised before the EEOC. <em>Gregory v. Ga. Dept. of Human Res., </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279-1280 (11th Cir.2004). Although we are \u201cextremely reluctant to allow procedural technicalities to bar claims\u201d and \u201cthe scope of an EEOC complaint should not be strictly interpreted,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280, a plaintiff is nevertheless barred from raising new acts of discrimination in his complaint. <em>Wu, </em>863 F.2d at 1547 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Here, the district court correctly held Mr. Giles exhausted his failure to promote and constructive discharge claims, but erred by addressing his hostile workplace claim on the merits. Mr. Giles\u2019 charge speaks for itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">Beginning on or about November 2008 up to December 31, 2008 I have been denied a promotion to Service Technician. I complained formally to Human Resources on December 10, 2008 that I felt that I was being denied a promotion based on my race and age. No investigation was performed. On February 23, 2009 I was discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">No reason was given for denial of my promotion. The reason given for my termination was that: \u201cI had a poor attendance record and that I did not meet sales goals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">I believe I have been discriminated against based on my race (African-American) and in retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and because of my age (56) in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment act of 1967, as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Mr. Giles\u2019 allegations pertain only to his failure to promote and constructive discharge claims. Because his hostile workplace claim is a \u201cnew act of discrimination\u201d not exhausted in his administrative charge, Mr. Giles was barred from raising the claim in his complaint. <em>Wu, </em>863 F.2d at 1547 (citation omitted). The district court should therefore have only addressed Mr. Giles\u2019 failure to promote, constructive discharge, and RICO claims, which we examine in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">We conclude that the district court properly dismissed the failure to promote, constructive discharge, and Georgia RICO claims on the merits. Those claims are squarely foreclosed by circuit precedent because (1) Mr. Giles never applied for the promotion he contends he should have received, (2) his alleged workplace conditions are insufficient to prove he was compelled to resign, and (3) his Georgia RICO claim is not cognizable under the express terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">Under both Title VII and the ADEA, a plaintiff may show a company\u2019s failure to promote was discriminatory through either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Kragor v. Takeda Pharm. Am., Inc., </em>702 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2012) (examining allegations of discrimination in ADEA context); <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, Inc., </em>220 F.3d 1263, 1286 (11th Cir.2000) (exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ining allegations of discrimination in Title VII context). \u201cDirect evidence is evidence that establishes the existence of discriminatory intent behind the employment decision without any inference or presumption.\u201d <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). <em>See also Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1086 (noting that \u201c \u2018only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could mean nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of some impermissible factor constitute direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d). Circumstantial evidence, on the other hand, may be proven under the framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Kragor, </em>702 F.3d at 1308 (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to ADEA claim); <em>Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, Inc., </em>220 F.3d at 1286 (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to Title VII claim). A plaintiff proves a prima facie case of discrimination under this framework by showing that: (1) he belongs to a protected class, (2) he both applied and was qualified for a promotion, (3) he was rejected despite his qualifications, and (4) other equally or less-qualified employees outside his class were promoted. Br<em>own v. Ala. Dept. of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1174 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). If, however, \u201can employer has a formal system of posting vacancies and allowing employees to apply for such vacancies, an employee who fails to apply for a particular position cannot establish a prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote.\u201d <em>Williams v. Giant Food Inc., </em>370 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). <em>See also Smith v. J. Smith Lanier &amp; Co., </em>352 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.2003) (reaching the same conclusion in a reduction-in-force context).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Mr. Giles\u2019 failure to promote claim could not survive summary judgment. Mr. Giles offered no direct evidence of discrimination, and was unable to prove his claim by pointing to circumstantial evidence. In light of the allegations exhausted in his charge of discrimination filed with the EEOC, Mr. Giles is limited to arguing that his rights were violated for failing to receive a promotion to services technician from \u201cNovember 2008 up to December 31, 2008.\u201d Confined to these factual bounds, his claim fails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The undisputed facts below state that \u201c[ajlthough Giles bid on a number of Services Technician titles from January 2008 forward, he did not have a bid on file for any of the Services Technician vacancies which were filled between November 2008 and April of 2009.\u201d Mr. Giles\u2019 failure to submit an application for a services technician position through his employer\u2019s formal system of posting vacancies dooms his claims. Generally, a plaintiff cannot claim an employer discriminatorily failed to give a promotion when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the employee never applied for the position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Turning our attention next to Mr. Giles\u2019 constructive discharge claim, we conclude that it too lacks merit. The burden of proving a claim of constructive discharge under both Title VII and the ADEA is high, requiring the plaintiff to show that an employer, on account of the plaintiffs statutorily protected status, imposed working conditions \u201cso intolerable\u201d that a reasonable person in such a position \u201cwould have been compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Hipp v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., </em>252 F.3d 1208, 1230-1231 (11th Cir.2001) (discussing constructive discharge in ADEA context) (citation omitted); <em>Fitz v. Pugmire Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>348 F.3d 974, 977 (11th Cir.2003) (discussing constructive discharge in Title VII context) (citation omitted). We evaluate the nature of these conditions under an objective standard, and do not take the \u201csubjective feelings\u201d of the plaintiff into account. <em>Doe v. Dekalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d 1441, 1450 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Applying this standard, we conclude that Mr. Giles failed to prove his constructive discharge claim. Viewing Mr. Giles\u2019 described workplace conditions from an objective standpoint, they were not so intolerable that a reasonable person in his position would have been compelled to resign. <em>Hipp, </em>252 F.3d at 1233 (noting employees are not guaranteed \u201ca stress-free working environment.\u201d). The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">We address finally the claim that BellSouth violated Georgia\u2019s RICO statute. Mr. Giles argues on appeal that BellSouth violated the statute by adding duplicate charges and features to customers\u2019 bills and by discriminating against African-Americans. Under the statute, it is unlawful to engage in a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-14-4. A pattern of racketeering activity is defined as engaging \u201cin at least two acts of racketeering activity in furtherance of one or more incidents, schemes, or transactions,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 16-14-3(8)(A), and racketeering activity, in turn, is defined as committing, or attempting to commit, certain predicate acts consisting of violent crimes, drug crimes, and fraud. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 16-14-3(9). The statute also provides a cause of action for any person injured by a violation of the statute, which requires proving two or more predicate acts were committed and that the plaintiffs injury was the proximate cause of those acts. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 16-14-6(c); <em>see also O\u2019Neal v. Garrison, </em>263 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim. The record contains no evidence that Mr. Giles was injured by BellSouth\u2019s commission of any predicate acts. Despite Mr. Giles\u2019 apparent argument to the contrary, racial discrimination is not listed under the statute as a predicate act. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-14-3(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">We conclude the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Mr. Giles\u2019 exhausted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-5\">. We reject as meritless Mr. Giles' argument on appeal that the district court erred by dismissing AT &amp; T Inc. and BellSouth Corporation as parties. These corporations presented a declaration from payroll analyst Devin Meier, who explained there was no record of Mr. Giles ever working for either company. And although Mr. Giles testified that over his career he worked for \"every company that is out there that was under the AT &amp; T umbrella,\u201d he admitted that between 2005 and 2009 he only worked as a sales associate for Bell-South Telecommunications. Review of the evidence shows there is no doubt the district court properly dismissed AT &amp; T Inc. and BellSouth Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-4\">. Although Mr. Giles filed an unverified EEOC intake form that provided more detailed and temporally broader allegations of discrimination than the verified EEOC charge of discrimination, the district court ruled that the intake form could not serve as a basis for exhaustion. Mr. Giles does not challenge the district court\u2019s exhaustion analysis on appeal. Even if he had, we would reach the same conclusion as the district court. At least under the circumstances of this case, allowing Mr. Giles' unverified EEOC intake form to exhaust allegations of discrimination would defeat the aim of an administrative scheme designed, in part, to swiftly settle claims of discrimination through non-legal means. <em>See Fed. Exp. Corp. v. Holowecki, </em>552 U.S. 389, 395-407, 128 S.Ct. 1147, 170 L.Ed.2d 10 (2008) (examining whether EEOC intake form should serve as a charge of discrimination for ADEA claim); <em>Pijnenburg v. West Ga. Health Sys., Inc., </em>255 F.3d 1304, 1305-1307 (11th Cir.2001) (examining whether EEOC intake form should serve as a charge of discrimination for Title VII claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">. We note that a plaintiff alleging discrimination need not show he applied for a job or promotion if doing so would have been futile, <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 367, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), and that this principle applies to cases where the employer has a \"consistently enforced discriminatory policy\u201d that will deter applicants who are aware of the policy from applying because they know they face \"certain rejection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 97 S.Ct. 1843. We need not consider this point because Mr. Giles did not raise this argument before us or the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
