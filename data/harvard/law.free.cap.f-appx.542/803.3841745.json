Dawson makes a multitude of arguments for why his sentence should be overturned. Specifically, Dawson argues that (1) his plea was not entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>erred in denying his request for a mitigating role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b); (3) the district court should have granted a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) because Dawson\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history and likelihood of recidivism; and (4) his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court erred in denying Dawson\u2019s request for a downward variance pursuant to the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After reviewing each of Dawson\u2019s arguments in turn, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Dawson asserts that his guilty plea was not entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently because he was not properly informed of the rights he relinquished as required under Rule 11(b). <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b). As conceded by Dawson, our standard of review is plain error since he failed to previously raise this issue. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover,</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1276 (citations omitted) (internal quotations marks omitted). There is no plain error present in this case. The record shows the district court went through the germane requirements of Rule 11(b). Additionally, in no way was the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation\u201d of the proceeding affected by any omission of the rights Dawson renounced. Thus, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">Turning to his sentence, Dawson argues he should have received a mitigating role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b), which would decrease his base-offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). Dawson was correctly sentenced as a career criminal due to his second-degree murder conviction for which he was released within the past 15 years and for 2 drug-related offenses in 2001. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1, 4A1.2. Defendants sentenced as career offenders are ineligible for mitigating role reductions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Jeter, </em>329 F.3d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.2003). Therefore, the district court was correct to refuse Dawson\u2019s request for a mitigating role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Dawson next asks this Court to overturn the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). Section 4A1.3(b) states, \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). However, Dawson does not assert the district court incorrectly believed it lacked authority to grant a downward dep\u00e1rtame. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> decision to not grant a downward departure. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to review the decision of the district court not to apply a downward departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Finally, Dawson posits he should have received a downward variance because the district court failed to properly consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which constitutes a lack of substantive and procedural reasonability. Specifically, Dawson argues the district court less than adequately considered the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of his offense, his \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d and \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We determine the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). To determine procedural reasonability, we examine whether the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, based the sentence on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d and gave a sufficient explanation for the sentence to permit \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 128 S.Ct. 586. When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonability, a sentence is substantively unreasonable if, considering the totality of the circumstances, the court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unreasonably and imposed a sentence that did not achieve the purposes of sentencing outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving the sentence enforced was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Dawson\u2019s sentence. Dawson\u2019s Guidelines range was properly calculated, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory, included no \u201cclearly erroneous facts\u201d in its determination, and gave a sufficient explanation for the imposition of Dawson\u2019s 129-month sentence. Further, the sentence was substantively reasonable. The district court stated that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors were considered and sentenced Dawson at the low end of the Guidelines range while also granting the Government\u2019s 15% reduction via their \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The district court weighed the totality of the circumstances in addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and felt that 129 months was necessary due to Dawson\u2019s repeated criminal behavior. Moreover, the district court is not required to discuss each factor during sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 786. Nothing more was required to impose his sentence. Dawson has failed to prove any absence of reasonableness by the district court. Therefore, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-13\">. Dawson argues in his brief that the district judge failed to advise him he was waiving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>right to an appeal by accepting the plea agreement. This argument is meritless. As the Government notes, there was no appeal waiver contained in Dawson's plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">. In his reply brief Dawson asserts the district court could still have awarded him a mitigating role reduction as a variance to his sentence. This argument is misplaced. The district court has full discretion to consider whether a lesser role in the offense warrants a variance under the \"nature and circumstances of the offense.\" <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (2010). To assert this qualifies as a mitigating role reduction is incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\">. The record supports the district court\u2019s decision to not award a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). Further, there is no circumstance in which a district court <em>must </em>grant a downward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3(b). Therefore, Dawson's assertion of an abuse of discretion by the district court is unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
