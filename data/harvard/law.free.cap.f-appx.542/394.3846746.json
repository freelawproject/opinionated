In his plea agreement he waived his right to appeal, but he argues that the waiver is invalid because he was not sufficiently advised of the breadth and effect of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The district court accurately explained the terms and consequences of the waiver in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(b)(l)(N), and Gladney stated on the record, under oath, in open court that he understood the waiver. His contention now that he did not really understand the waiver does not invalidate it. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir.2011). Gladney\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s fully adequate explanation of the waiver is frivolous because it involves no \u201clegal points arguable on their merits\u201d and fails to make any colorable showing of error, plain or otherwise. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see </em>5th Cir. Rule 42.2 (providing that an appeal \u201cwill be dismissed\u201d if it \u201cis frivolous and entirely without merit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Because the waiver is valid, we do not consider Gladney\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d at 783. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
