We review sentences for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010). McCarther\u2019s complaint that the drug offense guideline, U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1, is not empirically based is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528-29 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Pointing out that he received a 36-month revocation sentence to run consecutively to his instant sentence, McCarther contends that a shorter sentence provides adequate deterrence. He also asserts that his personal history supports a lesser sentence, noting that he had a close relationship with his mother and siblings, struggled with substance abuse, and is attempting to find ways to support his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The record shows that the district court heard counsel\u2019s argument on McCarther\u2019s behalf regarding his substance abuse problems and the lack of aggravating circumstances. The court\u2019s remarks also reflect that it gave greater weight to McCarther\u2019s long and serious criminal history, his continual recidivism, his apparent need for greater deterrence, and the goal of protecting the public from his wrongdoing. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and gave individualized, case-specific reasons for its sentence. The upward variance was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson, </em>619 F.3d at 471-72; <em>United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 338 (5th Cir.2011). The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
