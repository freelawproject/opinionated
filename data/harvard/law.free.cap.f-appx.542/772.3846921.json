He argues that: (1) 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d), which guides the IJ and BIA\u2019s use of discretion in granting or denying waivers of inadmissibility, is unconstitutional as applied to him; (2) the IJ and BIA violated the doctrine of separation of powers by conflating 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d)\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent or dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>gerous\u201d crimes with the standard for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(F); and (3) the IJ and BIA erred as a matter of law in weighing the hardship factors mitigating in favor of relief from removal. The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review Cobos\u2019s petition. After thorough review, we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In 2008, Cobos was convicted of false imprisonment, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02, and aggravated assault with a firearm, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021. He pled guilty to both offenses and was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The police report indicates that Cobos forced his victim, who was a friend, into a car at gunpoint, then threatened him and forced him to drive to another location. As a result of these crimes, the Department of Homeland Security issued Cobos a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings before an IJ. The IJ declared Cobos removable pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as a legal permanent resident convicted of an aggravated felony; and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as a legal permanent resident convicted of a crime of violence for which the statutory term of imprisonment was at least one year. The IJ denied Cobos a waiver of inadmissibility, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), after considering the heightened hardship requirements needed to grant a discretionary waiver under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d), and denied Cobos an adjustment of status. The BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopted the opinion of the IJ. K<em>azemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Because the BIA in this case did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>We determine our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Alvarado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">We do not have jurisdiction to review denials of discretionary relief, including the Attorney General\u2019s decision to grant or deny a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), and \u201cany other decision or action of the Attorney General ... the authority for which is specified under this title to be in [his] discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(2); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). We also lack jurisdiction to review removal orders involving aliens who are convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude (\u201cCIMTs\u201d) or aggravated felonies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A), (C). However, these jurisdiction-stripping provisions do not preclude us from reviewing constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). \u201cWhere a constitutional claim has no merit, however, we do not have jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2003); see <em>Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1197 (11th Cir.2008) (requiring an alien to raise a \u201csubstantial,\u201d meaning nonfrivolous, constitutional claim); Arias <em>v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1284 n. 2 (11th Cir.2007) (describing a \u201ccolorable\u201d constitutional claim as one with \u201csome possible validity\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Arguments that the agency applied incorrect legal standards present legal questions under the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). See <em>Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1197. \u201cQuestions of law\u201d also include challenges to the \u201capplication of an undisputed fact pattern to a legal standard.\u201d <em>Jean-Pierre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>500 F.3d 1315, 1322 (11th Cir.2007). An argument that the IJ or BIA failed to properly weigh an alien\u2019s factual scenario presents a \u201cgarden-variety abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>tion argument \u2014 which can be made by virtually <em>every </em>alien subject to a final removal order \u2014 [that] does not amount to a legal question.\u201d <em>Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1196-97. Similarly, an alien\u2019s argument that the IJ erred in balancing positive and negative factors does not raise a question of law. <em>See Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1223 (11th Cir.2003). We do not retain jurisdiction \u201cover abuse of discretion claims merely couched in constitutional language.\u201d <em>Arias, </em>482 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Aliens who commit CIMTs are inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). The Attorney General may, in his discretion, and \u201cpursuant to such terms, conditions and procedures as he may by regulation prescribe,\u201d waive inadmissibility of the CIMT if, among other requirements, \u201cthe alien\u2019s denial of admission would result in extreme hardship\u201d to the alien\u2019s U.S. citizen spouse or child. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1) \u2014 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">By regulation, the Attorney General will ordinarily</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">not favorably exercise discretion under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(2) ] to consent to an application ... [for] adjustment of status, with respect to immigrant aliens who are inadmissible under section [1182](a)(2) of the Act in cases involving violent or dangerous crimes, except in extraordinary circumstances, such as ... cases in which an alien clearly demonstrates that the denial of the application for adjustment of status ... would result in exceptional and unusual hardship. Moreover, depending on the gravity of the alien\u2019s underlying criminal offense, a showing of extraordinary circumstances might still be insufficient to warrant a favorable exercise of discretion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d). \u201c[A]n application for discretionary relief, including a waiver under section [1182](h), may be denied in the exercise of discretion without express rulings on the question of statutory eligibility.\u201d <em>In re Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 296, 301 (B.I.A.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">First, we lack jurisdiction over Cobos\u2019s claim that the IJ and BIA unconstitutionally applied 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d) by conflating the \u201cviolent or dangerous\u201d standard in that regulation with the \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d standard in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), because his argument is simply not colorable given the plain language of the rule. But even assuming this interpretation would constitute constitutional error, the BIA\u2019s order \u2014 which is the order we must review, <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350 \u2014 is in fact bereft of any reference to the term \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The BIA recounted the specific factual circumstances of Cobos\u2019s convictions \u2014 and expressly considered Cobos\u2019s assertions that he was intoxicated and did not actually intend to kill or injure the victim \u2014 and concluded that the crimes were \u201cviolent or dangerous\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d), or indeed under any reasonable standard. Thus, Cobos raises no colorable constitutional claim that the BIA erred by concluding that Cobos\u2019s crimes were of the \u201cviolent or dangerous\u201d variety, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">We also lack jurisdiction over Cobos\u2019s arguments relating to how the IJ and BIA evaluated the hardship evidence. Although Cobos says that the IJ and BIA erred as a matter of law, his contentions amount to an argument that the IJ and BIA abused their discretion. The BIA considered the hardships Cobos would face away from his family in Mexico, his family\u2019s hardship in the United States with and without Cobos, his family\u2019s living situation and his children\u2019s medical needs, and his son\u2019s behavioral issues; the ten allegedly overlooked factors identified by Cobos on appeal are of a similar nature. Cobos\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>argument against the BIA\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the serious hardships facing the Cobos family were not exceptional and extremely unusual is essentially an argument against the way in which the BIA weighed the evidence. <em>See Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1196-97. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to address the BIA\u2019s determination that Cobos did not show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship so as to merit a favorable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">However, we do retain jurisdiction over Cobos\u2019s singular colorable constitutional claim: that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d), as applied to him, is unconstitutional because it modifies the showing necessary to be statutorily eligible for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Regardless, the claim is without merit. Here, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d), as applied, was not contrary to the statutory eligibility standard for the \u00a7 1182(h) waiver because the BIA did not apply the regulation to modify Cobos\u2019s statutory eligibility for a waiver or categorically bar him from receiving one. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), the Attorney General may use his discretion to waive inadmissibility only if certain circumstances, including extreme hardship to a family member, are present. The statute does not guarantee that an alien who statutorily qualifies for a waiver of inadmissibility will receive one, and in fact specifically contemplates that the grant of a waiver is still a discretionary determination by the Attorney General. As for 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d), it was not applied so as to categorically bar Cobos from a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver of inadmissibility in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The BIA did not find Cobos ineligible for a 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(2) waiver, only that he was not entitled to receive one in the exercise of its discretion. Accordingly, the regulation is not unconstitutional as applied to Cobos, and we deny his petition as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">DENY PETITION IN PART AND DISMISS IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
