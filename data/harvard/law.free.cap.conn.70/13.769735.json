County and tried to the court, <em>Peck, Associate Judge-; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the defendant, and appeal by the plaintiff for alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AD9h\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-11\">The material facts are as follows: The plaintiff, who was the owner of the hay horse described in the complaint, had for several years permitted his father-in-law, Jeremiah Sullivan, who resided in Burlington in this State, to keep and use it on his farm with his own horses. The plaintiff during this time made his home with said Sullivan, though he only occasionally visited Burlington, passing most of his time in Boston where he was in business. In the early part of February, 1897, Sullivan exchanged the horse in question with the defendant for a black horse and $85. Defendant did not know that Sullivan was not the owner of the horse he so traded. Plaintiff\u2019s horse was worth from $100 to $150, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the black horse about $50. On returning home the following evening, and having learned from Sullivan of the trade, and he and Sullivan having discovered that the horse received from the defendant was blind, the plaintiff was dissatisfied, and told Sullivan he must \u201c fix it up \u201d with the defendant. A few days later plaintiff went to defendant\u2019s home to ascertain if he still had the bay horse, and talked with the defendant about the horse, saying it was a good horse; but did not tell defendant that he, the plaintiff, owned it, nor in any manner disavow the trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ay\">Sullivan afterward went to the defendant and complained that he had \u201c stuck him,\u201d and asked him to trade back, which the defendant refused to do; and on the 19th of February, at the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, Sullivan caused a writ and complaint to be drawn against the defendant and placed in the hands of an officer for service, in which Sullivan was described as the plaintiff and as the owner of the bay horse, and which alleged that he had been induced to trade by fraudulent representations, and demanded $200 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">The plaintiff Curnane was present at a conversation with .the officer about serving the writ, and accompanied the officer part way to defendant\u2019s house. The officer did not serve the .writ, but told defendant its nature and advised him to settle \u25a0 the matter; and the plaintiff, Curnane, was present at a conversation at Sullivan\u2019s house where the officer and the defendant had gone, and in which conversation defendant offered to trade back the horse for $10, but Curnane said nothing about owning the horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AD\">The plaintiff and Sullivan afterwards together demanded of the defendant the $35 to be paid by defendant, and on defendant\u2019s claiming that it was not to be paid until March 15th, Curnane urged defendant to pay the money at once, saying: \u201c Give him the $35 and.it will be all right; \u201d and that Sullivan wanted the money to buy another horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-\">On the 26th of February the plaintiff commenced the present action, and at the time of service of the writ brought back to the defendant the black horse, which defendant refused to receive. Previous to the service of the replevin writ plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tiff made no demand upon defendant for the horse, nor had either he or Sullivan informed the defendant, nor had the defendant any knowledge, that the plaintiff owned the horse. On March 15th the defendant tendered to Sullivan the $35, which the latter refused to receive, saying that defendant owed him nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">During the trial the defendant offered deputy sheriff Morse as a witness, and asked: \u201c Did you have a writ in your possession in which Sullivan was plaintiff and S cheidel was defendant, with which you went to Scheidel\u2019s house, and which you read to him ? \u201d To tins question the plaintiff objected, on the ground that it was immaterial and irrelevant. Prior to this both Curnane and Sullivan had testified that Curnane owned the horse (which was a controverted question in the ease), and also that Sullivan procured the writ in question, and that Curnane knew of the existence and intended service of the writ. The court admitted the question as tending to contradict Sullivan\u2019s testimony that the horse belonged to Curnane, and also as tending, in connection with the other evidence, to show a ratification by Curnane of Sullivan\u2019s act in trading the horse. To the admission of this question the plaintiff excepted. The answer was: \u201c I did. I read it in part, and told him what the rest was.\u201d Morse produced the writ, and the defendant offered it in evidence. The same objection and ruling were made, and the plaintiff excepted to the admission of the writ. This was the writ procured by Sullivan at the suggestion of the plaintiff, before referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">Upon the above facts the plaintiff claimed that the title and right of possession was in the plaintiff, and that he was entitled to judgment in his favor; but the court held that the acts of the plaintiff and Ms failure to disavow Sullivan\u2019s trade of the horse, or to assert Ms title, constituted a ratification by Mm of Sullivan\u2019s act in trading the horse, and rendered judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-8\"><em>Roger S. Newell, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-9\">Upon the facts found the trial court erred m holding that the plaintiff had ratified the act of Sullivan in disposing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the horse; and also erred in admitting in evidence the writ in which Sullivan was described as plaintiff. <em>Ellison </em>v. <em>Jackson Water Co., </em>12 Cal. 542; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Hartford &amp; W. H. R. Co., </em>43 Conn. 434; <em>Hammerslough </em>v. <em>Cheatham, </em>84 Mo. 13; <em>Hamlin </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>82 N.

Taft, </em>for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">\u201c When the principal is informed of what has been done, he must dissent, and give notice of it in a reasonable time; and if he does not, his assent and ratification will be presumed.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Comm. 616. On three occasions subsequent to the trade, and prior to the bringing of this action, the plaintiff was present when the matter of the trade was discussed by Sullivan and the defendant. On none of these occasions did he disavow the trade or assert his ownership to the horse in question, which silence on his part, when so apt an opportunity was given him to speak, and when it was his duty to speak, was a confirmation of the trade. <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>10 N. H. 538; <em>Johnson </em>v. Jones, 4 Barb. 369. The evidence of deputy sheriff Morse was properly received. <em>Searing </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>69 Ill. 575; <em>Cairncross </em>v. <em>Lorimer, </em>7 Jur. N. S. 149; <em>Trusdale </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>24 Mich. 117; <em>Hayne </em>v. <em>O'Hagen, </em>60 id. 150.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-8\">Hall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">Under the^answer of a general denial the plaintiff was required to prove his title to the horse described in the complaint, or Ms right of immediate possession. General Statutes, \u00a7 1330 ; <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>69 Conn. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">To establish such ownership both he and Sullivan testified that the horse belonged to the plaintiff. For the purpose of discreditmg these witnesses, as well as to show a ratification by the plaintiff of the sale made by Sullivan, the evidence offered by the defendant, that with the knowledge and at the suggestion of the plaintiff Sullivan had procured the complaint for fraud to be drawn in which he was himself described as plamtiff and as the owner of the horse, and that the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>had read it to the defendant, was properly received. This evidence strongly indicated, either that the testimony of the plaintiff and Sullivan that the former was the owner of the horse, was not true, or that the plaintiff had adopted the contract of exchange made by Sullivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The facts found by the court were sufficient to constitute a ratification by the plaintiff of the sale made by Sullivan. The following definition of ratification given by Akdkews, C. J., in delivering the opinion of this court in the case of <em>Ansonia </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>64 Conn. 536, 544, is especially applicable to the ease before us: \u201c Ratification means the adoption by a person, as binding upon himself, of an act done in such relations that he may claim it as done for his benefit, although done under such circumstances as would not bind him except for liis subsequent assent; as where an act was done by a stranger having at the time no authority to act as his agent, or by an agent not having adequate authority. The acceptance of the results of the act with an intent to ratify, and with full knowledge of all the material circumstances, is a ratification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The plaintiff learned from Sullivan himself all the circumstances of the exchange the day after it was made. He was dissatisfied with the results of Sullivan\u2019s bargain, but he expressed, even to him, no disapproval of his assumption of authority to make it. Until the commencement of this action the plaintiff had not only failed by any act or word to disapprove Sullivan\u2019s authority or to repudiate his contract, but he had both by language and conduct expressed his acquiescence in Sullivan\u2019s action and Ms intention to adopt the trade which Sullivan had made. When he learned that the horse which Sullivan had received was blind, he directed him to \u201c fix it up \u201d with the defendant. In conversation with the defendant about the horse Sullivan had sold him, he neither disaffirmed the trade, nor denied Sullivan\u2019s ownership, but told the defendant it would be all right if he would pay Sullivan the \u201c boot \u201d money. He permitted, if he did not authorize, the institution of the action for damages against the defendant, hr which Sullivan was plaintiff and in which he was alleged to be the owner of the horse sold to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ant. The commencement of this action at the direction of the plaintiff, or with his approval, based upon Sullivan\u2019s authority to make the exchange, was a positive affirmance of Sullivan\u2019s contract. <em>Shoninger </em>v. Peabody, 57 Conn. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">There is no finding that Sullivan intended to defraud the plaintiff, nor that he did not suppose he was authorized to make the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We think the relations of Sullivan and the plaintiff, as shown by the facts found, were such as permitted the plaintiff to adopt his act.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
