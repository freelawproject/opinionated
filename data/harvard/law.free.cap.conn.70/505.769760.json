Stein, Justice of the Peace.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Abc\">The only witnesses called for the plaintiff, were the plaintiff Nathan Cohen, and his son-in-law, the said Michael Tovorovsky. These witnesses testified that the consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>of the sale to the plaintiff was a previous indebtedness of Tovorovsky to Cohen of $25, and $100 in cash paid by Cohen to Tovorovsky on the day of the transaction; that the goods were hi the cellar of the building where Tovorovsky carried on the ice cream and soda water business, that the plaintiff there examined them, and that after the execution of Exhibits A and B they were permitted to remain in the possession of Tovorovsky as before. Both witnesses testified that subsequently, and before the commencement of the present suit, Tovorovsky, being unable to carry on the business, delivered up the goods to Cohen, the plaintiff; that the goods were then in the cellar; that Tovorovsky took the key of the cellar to the plaintiff, and told him in effect that he surrendered the goods to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff thereupon locked up the goods in the cellar and kept the key in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">The plaintiff testified that the attachment in the suit of Schneider against Tovorovsky was made before the surrendering, of the goods to him, and while Tovorovsky was in possession of the goods, under the contract of conditional sale. Tovorovsky testified that he surrendered the goods to the plaintiff the day before the attachment by Schneider. Tovorovsky also testified that within a few weeks after the goods were replevied from the officer, McNerney, the plaintiff Cohen Avent into the ice cream business, and that he, Tovorovsky, was employed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">The plaintiff having offered this evidence, the court, upon defendants\u2019 motion, granted a nonsuit, and denied plaintiff\u2019s Avritten motion, duly filed under the statute, to set aside the nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-8\">The errors specified in the plaintiff\u2019s appeal are the granting of the nonsuit by the court, and the refusal of the court to set aside the nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-9\"><em>Richard S. </em>Tyner, for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-10\"><em>Benjamin </em>Slade, for the appellees (defendants).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b518-11\">Haul, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7a\">It does not appear from the record upon what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ground the defendants\u2019 motion for a nonsuit was granted. From the hriefs of counsel we assume that the ground of the motion for a nonsuit was that the plaintiff had not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, since it appeared from the evidence that the goods in question, which prior to the execution of the bill of sale (Exhibit A) had been in the possession of Tovorovsky as his own property, were suffered to remain hi his possession after the execution of the contracts A and B, and that Tovorovsky did not give the key to the plaintiff and surrender the goods to him, until after the attachment had been made by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">A careful examination of the evidence reported to us shows that the plaintiff should not have been nonsuited upon that ground. The evidence contained in the record does not clearly show when, with reference to the attachment, the property was so surrendered to the plaintiff by Tovorovsky. It is true that the plaintiff himself testifies that it was after the attachment, but Tovorovsky swears that it was before the attachment. It was for the jury to decide under these circumstances what the fact was. Counsel for the plaintiff should have been permitted to claim to the jury that the plaintiff was mistaken upon that point and that the testimony of Tovorovsky should be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">If the nonsuit was not granted upon the ground we have suggested, but because the court was of the opinion that the evidence showed that the transactions between the plaintiff and Tovorovsky were in fact fraudulent, it should be set aside. Though the court may have had sufficient reason to be satisfied that the testimony of the plaintiff and Tovorovsky was false or wholly unreliable, and that they were engaged in a scheme to defraud the creditors of Tovorovsky and to prevent the defendant Schneider from collecting his just claim, the case should nevertheless have been submitted to the jury. It was the province of the jury and not of the court to weigh the testimony of witnesses, and to pass upon the question whether the transaction between the plaintiff and Tovorovsky was in fact honest or fraudulent. General Statutes, \u00a7 <em>1101; Cook </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>66 Conn. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>It is suggested that since the contract of conditional sale (Exhibit B) conformed to the requirements of the Act of 1895 concerning conditional sales (Public Acts of 1895, Chap. 212) and was duly recorded, the plaintiff, under that contract, had a good title against the attaching creditors of Tovorovsky, although the plaintiff did not receive the key and possession of the goods before the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">This claim cannot be upheld. The purpose of the Act of 1895 was not to enable vendors to make conditional sales which they could not have made before the passage of the Act, but to protect creditors and purchasers from the evils which had before resulted from the existence of lawful and valid conditional sales, but of which the public had no notice. <em>In re Wilcox and Howe Co., ante, </em>p. 220. Conditional sales made in good faith, and which provided that the title to. property should remain hi the vendor until payment and that possession should go with the sale, were good, against creditors of the vendee before the Act of 1895; but the reasoning of our courts, in sustaining such conditional sales, has been that the vendee in such contracts did not come into the possession of goods which he had owned before, and that hi that respect they differed from the cases in which property owned by the possessor had been sold by him and possession retained by the vendor. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>49 Conn. 141. The effect of the Act of 1895 was to render conditional sales which should thereafter be made and which should not be made, acknowledged and recorded in conformity with the provisions of the Act, absolute sales as to creditors and <em>bona fide </em>purchasers of the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">From the evidence hi the case at bar it appears that Tovorovsky was the owner and possessor of the property in question, up to the day of the execution of the contracts A and B. On the 24th of June he executed a bill of sale of the goods to the plaintiff, and the latter, on the same day and as a part of the same transaction, executed the contract of conditional sale (Exhibit B) of the same goods to Tovorovsky, Tovorovsky at all times retaining possession until the time of the alleged surrender of the property to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>in July. To construe the Act of 1895 as rendering a contract of conditional sale made under these circumstances, valid as against creditors of the vendee who had attached before any delivery of the g\u2019oods to the plaintiff, would be to cause greater evils to creditors and purchasers than those against which the Act was designed to furnish protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Had the evidence in this case clearly shown that there was no delivery of the goods in question to the plaintiff before the attachment in the suit of Schneider, that would have been a sufficient ground for granting a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">As the record shows that both the plaintiff and Tovorovsky testified that the latter, before the present action was commenced, surrendered any interest he may have had in this property to the plaintiff, the nonsuit could not have been properly granted, as suggested in the brief of defendants\u2019 counsel, upon the ground that Tovorovsky and not Cohen should have been made the party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">There was error, the nonsuit is set aside and the case is to stand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
