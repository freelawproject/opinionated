This, motion was denied, for the reasons stated in <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>McNamara, post, </em>332.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">The appeal to this court, filed by the appellants on January 6th, 1898, states that the parties appeal \u201c to the' Supreme Court of Errors,\u201d and does not state an appeal to any spe cific term, nor state any time or place for holding the court, and the plea alleges these defects as ground of abatement. The appellants demur for the reasons: 1. The plea does not show that the appellee did not have actual knowledge from the proceedings below, that the appeal was taken to this term of court. 2. That the \u201c notice of appeal \u201d filed in the court below, states the term to which the appeal will be taken. 3. That the record does not show the appeal to be taken to any term other than the present term of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-9\">The appellants also read in court an answer, alleging, in bar, a general appearance by the appellee and other facts appearing in the record, and stated that they wished to file this answer in case their demurrer should be overruled. The appellee stated they should demur to the answer, if filed. By agreement of parties the sufficiency of the plea was argued as if the questions had been raised by the appellant\u2019s answer to the plea, as well as by their demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-10\"><em>Goodwin Stoddard </em>and <em>William D.

These provisions must be strictly complied with in order to properly perfect an appeal. <em>White </em>v. <em>Howd, </em>66 Conn. 264, 266. The statute says that the appeal must state the time and place of holding the court to which the appeal is taken. Public Acts of 1897, Chap. 194, \u00a7 13. This appeal states neither time nor place; it is taken to \u201c the Supreme Court of Errors,\u201d without any specification of a term.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The appellants, however, claim that this requirement of the statute is a mere matter of form; that it is apparent from the record that the present term of this court is the only one to which the appeal could by law be taken, and therefore it must be regarded as in fact taken to this term; and that the defect is cured by \u00a7 1000 of the General Statutes. This claim rests on the assumption that the term of court to which this appeal should have been taken, is determined by \u00a7 2 of the Act and not by \u00a7 22. The provisions of these sections are distinct and different. The former affects appeals from judgments rendered at a regular session of the Superior Court, and requires the appeal to be taken to the term to be held next after the filing of the appeal in the j udicial district or county where the judgment was rendered; while the latter affects appeals from judgments rendered by a judge exercising the power of that court in chambers, and requires the appeal to be taken to the term \u201cnext to he held in the judicial district or county where the parties or any of them reside.\u201d This appeal is controlled by the provisions of \u00a7 22. No other Act authorized it. The parties resided in different counties. The statute is so phrased as to give some ground at least, for the claim that the appeal might have been taken to the next term held in New Haven county, or to the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>term held in Fairfield county. The appellee in a case of this description is not hound to construe the statute at his peril; that duty rests on the appellant. ISTo appeal could he taken in this cause until the appellants designated the term to which they appealed. The failure to state the time and place of holding the court in this appeal is therefore a substantial defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">That a defect of this nature may be taken advantage of by a plea in abatement, is not an open question. <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>35 Conn. 327; <em>Redfield </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>ibid. 328, 333; <em>Comstock\u2019s Appeal, </em>54 id. 116; <em>Pitkin </em>v. <em>New York &amp; N E. R. Co., </em>67 id. 19; <em>Montville Street Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>New London N. R. Co., </em>68 id. 418. See also <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>59 id. 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Section 31 of the Act, and Chap. 135 of the Public Acts of 1897, relate to the manner of perfecting appeals taken under \u00a7 22, but do not control the term to which such appeals shall be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The plea in abatement is sustained and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
