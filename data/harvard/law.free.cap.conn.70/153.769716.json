The first count alleged in substance: (1) that in May, 1895, the plaintiffs contracted with the defendants to furnish them with stone for use at Portchester, New York, as set forth in the bill of particulars filed under this count; (2) that the defendants agreed to pay for said stone $7,067; (3) that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>furnished said stone as agreed; and (4) that the defendants had paid the plaintiffs \u00a76,300 on account, but had refused to pay the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">The second count alleged that during the time the plaintiffs were furnishing stone as set forth in the first count, the defendants requested them to supply certain extra stone over and above the quantity described in the first count; and that the plaintiffs had furnished said extra stone to the amount of \u00a7915. An itemized bill of particulars was filed under this count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">The defendants filed the following answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">\u201c <em>First defense to first count.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">\u201c 1.

The defendants agreed to pay for said stone the sum of seven thousand and sixty-seven (\u00a77,067) dollars, delivered f. o. b. at Portchester, N. Y. 4. The plaintiffs delivered said stone upon the cars at Portchester, but did not pay the freight thereon-amounting to \u00a7430.18, which the defendants were obliged to pay; and a portion of said stone was not cut as agreed, and the defendants were obliged to have the same recut at a cost of \u00a781.34.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-10\">\u201c <em>First defense to second count.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-11\">\u201c 1.

In this connection the paper marked Exhibit 1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>, for identification, was offered in evidence. The purpose of the offers was to prove that the suit was begun prematurely, and that nothing was due under the first count at the time the suit was begun. To these offers the plaintiffs objected, because the evidence, for such a purpose, was not admissible under the pleading; they had had no notice that this defense would be made and no opportunity to meet such a defense. The court ruled that all that transpired between the parties was admissible in evidence, but that the offer to prove the suit was prematurely brought was not admissible as a defense under the pleadings, and excluded the offers and Exhibit 1, for identification, for such a purpose, and the defendants duly excepted to the ruling. The above offer related exclusively to the first count.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">The errors assigned relate solely to the rulings as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-7\"><em>Daniel </em>Davenport, for the appellants (defendants).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-8\"><em>John W.

At common law, matter of this kind, not appearing upon tire face of the pleadings, was clearly matter in abatement. Matter which merely defeats the <em>present </em>proceeding and does not show that the plaintiff is <em>forever </em>con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>eluded, should in general he pleaded in abatement. 1 Chitty\u2019s PL 446; 1 Swift\u2019s Dig. s. p. 606. The proceedings will abate \u201c if it appear that the suit was commenced before the cause of action had accrued.\u201d 1 Swift\u2019s Dig. s. p. 610; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 453; Gould\u2019s Pl. Chap. Y. \u00a7138.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">It was, however, unusual to plead such matter in abatement, because if it appeared upon the face of the pleadings it could be taken advantage of by demurrer, and if it appeared by the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence it was ground for a non-suit. 1 Chitty Pl. 453; Gould\u2019s Pl. Chap. Y. \u00a7\u00a7137, 138. Whether under the later practice at common law, under the general issue in an action of assumpsit, the defendant could offer evidence to show that the suit had been prematurely brought, is not perhaps quite clear. Under the issues of <em>\u201cnon </em>assumpsit\u201d and <em>\u201cnil debet\u201d </em>proof of almost every defense that would defeat the action was admissible. Judge Swiet says: \u201cIn assumpsit, everything that proved there was no right or debt when the action was commenced, might be given in evidence under the general issue, for they were consistent with that plea.\u201d 1 Swift Dig. s. p. 614. In another place, p. 705, he says: \u201cEvery special matter of defense may be given in evidence under the general issue, excepting alienage after suit brought, tender, and the statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">It is upon statements of this kind, in text books and reports, that counsel for the defendants seem to rely in support of their claim upon this appeal; but the question here is not whether at common law the offered evidence would have been admissible under the general issue, but whether under our present system such evidence was admissible under the pleadings in this case ; and we are of opinion that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Under that system of pleading the defendant, in his answer, is required to state special matters of defense, and is not permitted to \u201c give in evidence matter in avoidance, or of defense, consistent with the truth of the material allegations of the complaint, unless in his answer he states such matter specially.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 874. The rules un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>der the Practice Act (Rule IV. \u00a7 6) also, provide as follows : \u201c No facts can be proved under either a general or special denial, except such as show that the plaintiff\u2019s statements of fact are untrue. Pacts which are consistent with such statements, but show, notwithstanding, that he has no cause of action, must be specially alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Under the pleadings in this case, leaving out of view the answer of set-off and counterclaim, the issues were, in effect: (1) how much have the defendants paid for freight; (2) what sum, if any, have the defendants paid for recutting stone; (3) what is the correct amount due for extra stone furnished. The defense that the suit had been prematurely brought, was clearly not within the issues. Whether, if the defendants had desired to make that defense, they should have set it up in a plea in abatement or in an answer, is a question which we need not discuss nor decide now; for it was not stated nor set up either by plea or answer. Clearly it was \u201c matter in avoidance, or of defense, consistent with the truth of the material allegations of the complaint,\u201d within the meaning of the statute and the rule, and it was not stated at all. To allow the defendants, under these pleadings, to avail themselves of a defense of this kind, would be contrary both to the letter and the spirit of our present system of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Under systems of pleading in other States, substantially similar to our own, it has been, so far as we know, uniformly held that a defense of this kind, which the defendant attempts to prove by evidence, is not available to him, unless he has in some way set it up in his pleading. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Atlanta B. &amp; L. Asso., </em>96 Ga. 803; <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>68 Wis. 428; <em>Iselin </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>62 Minn. <em>128; Elder </em>v. <em>Rourke, </em>27 Or. <em>363; </em>Pomeroy\u2019s Rem. <em>&amp; </em>Remedial Rights, \u00a7 \u00a7 673, 691, <em>698; </em>1 Ency. Pl. &amp; Pr. pp. 839, 849, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
