Whoever were, at that time, her heirs, in the sense in wlrich he employed that word, are to take, without regard to whether they did or did not answer that description at her decease. <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>21 Conn. 616, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The word \u201c heirs,\u201d in its strict and primary meaning, signifies those entitled by law to inherit by descent the real estate of a deceased person. It is also popularly used to denote those entitled by the statute of distributions to succeed beneficially to the personal estate of a deceased person. The will now before us, while purporting to dispose of both real and personal estate, contemplated a conversion of the whole into money; and the -provision for the heirs of Mrs. Ennis, even assuming that under the residuary clause they are to share in the proceeds of real estate, should therefore be treated as a bequest of personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">As a general rule its primary legal meaning should be given to every word in a will, unless the context, when read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the testator, shows clearly that it was used in a different sense. <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>60 Conn. 498, 506, 508. The fact that the word now in question occurs in a disposition of personal estate is to be given due weight; but it is not conclusive. <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>64 Conn. 240, 248. Resort will ordinarily be had to secondary meanings, in cases of testamentary construction, only when adherence to the primary meaning would make the provision under consideration hieffectual or plainly unreasonable. No such result follows from assigning to the term \u201cheirs of my niece, Minerva Ennis,\u201d its proper legal signification. On the contrary, it is MgMy improbable that the testator would prefer to her lineal descendants those who might be the statutory successors to her personal estate under the laws of New Jersey, with which it is not to be presumed that he was acquainted. It is also worth remark that in \u201c Item 2 \u201d his contingent bequest to the heirs of another niece living in the same State, was to be equally divided between them; a fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>rule being thus imposed, without regard to any statutory mode of distribution. The word \u201c heirs,\u201d therefore, is to be taken in its primary meaning, under the laws of Connecticut, this being the State where the testator had his domicil, and executed his will. It follows that the children of David R. Ennis together take one fourth of the legacy in question, and that his widow takes nothing. <em>Morris </em>v. Bolles, 65 Conn. 45, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Martha Kimball and her husband were each entitled to $250, under \u201c Item 9 \u201d of the will. The reference to \u201c said sum so intended for her,\u201d cannot avail either to double her legacy, or to deprive her insane husband of that which had been expressly given to him. While he, no doubt, was thus remembered only because of Ms marriage to her, the testator intended to benefit her by benefiting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The provision for the heirs of Minerva Ennis and Amanda Jewett, each of whom had died leavmg descendants who survived the testator, enured solely to the benefit of such descendants, and the husbands of these nieces took nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">For the reasons already stated in discussmg the legacy to the heirs of Mmerva Ennis, the \u201c heirs of Mary Gibbs, deceased,\u201d were her brothers and sister and those of the descendants of her deceased brothers who were living when the testator died; sharing <em>per stirpes. </em>What would have fallen to William J. Gibbs, had he survived the testator, is to be divided mto six parts, of which each of his children takes one, and that remainmg goes to the children of Ms deceased son. <em>Cook </em>v. Catlin, 25 Conn. 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The death of Amanda Rockwell before the testator, brought into operation the clause of the will intended to be for the benefit of her heirs. While inartificially expressed, it is sufficient to send the legacy to them, and insufficient to multiply it by their number. Each takes an equal share in $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The residuary clause empowers the executor to convert the whole estate into money in such manner \u201c as he shall judge to be for the best interest of all the legatees named,\u201d and \u201c to pay the legatees named their respective sums \u201d as soon as may be, and directs that if the estate should prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>insufficient to \u201c pay the legacies in full,\u201d a proportionate deduction is to be made \u201c from each legacy named,\u201d but that if there be \u201cmore than sufficient to pay the several legacies herein named,\u201d the surplus shall go \u201c to all the legatees named in this will, to be equally divided among them all, all to share and share alike, and in equal amounts of the same.\u201d This use of the word \u201c named \u201d as descriptive of all the legacies, that were to be paid, shows that he meant it, when employed to designate legatees, to have the same application, and include all to whom these legacies were to be paid. He had directed that certain sums should be paid under the twenty-five preceding \u201c items \u201d of his will, and the sums so named were the \u201c legacies herein named.\u201d Those who were to receive them were equally \u201cnamed,\u201d whether described by their proper individual names, or as members of a class like \u201c heirs \u201d or \u201c children,\u201d or as occupying a certain relation to another, such as a \u201c husband.\u201d <em>Bromley </em>v. Wright, 7 Hare, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">It is equally evident that while he meant that those who might suffer by an abatement, in case of a deficiency of the estate, should be the ones to profit by a surplus, in case a <em>residuum </em>were formed, he did not intend that in that event they should have a precisely corresponding benefit. Any abatement was to be proportional, as respects each legacy; but any increase was to be the subject of equal distribution among \u201c all the legatees named.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Following the interpretation already assigned to the term \u201c all the legatees named,\u201d by which it is to be understood to include those named by any class description, we think that the class receiving any legacy, however numerous, should be treated as a unit, as respects the division of the surplus. The right to share in it was an incident of each of these legacies, and it is more reasonable to suppose that the testator intended the number of shares to be that of the different legacies that took effect, than that of the individuals between whom these legacies might, by the accident of death and consequent substitution, happen to be divided. It was uncertain, in the testator's mind, whether there would be any residuary estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>There were, in all, twenty-seven legacies given to as many individuals or classes, and of these eighteen were subject to lapse. The number of residuary shares, therefore, under the construction of the will which we adopt, could not exceed twenty-seven, and might be only nine, while if the division were to be made <em>per </em>capita, among all the individuals who shared in any legacy, the portion of each might be a mere trifle. It is to be presumed that the testator intended that his residuary legatees should receive, if anything, what would be of substantial benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Superior Court is advised to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
