In this record it appeared that the licensee had been charged with and had pleaded guilty to the commission of two offenses: one of- violating the provisions of the Act of 1895, which prohibited giving away liquor in saloons on Sunday, and the other of keeping open on Sunday in violation of the provisions of \u00a7 3097. The defendants admitted all the allegations of the complaint, and thereupon the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff. Held:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b78-13\">1. That the Act of 1895 did not amend \u00a7 3097 of the General Statutes, but created a new and distinct offense, a conviction of which did not work a forfeiture of the license bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b78-15\">2.

A copy of the record of said conviction will be filed in said court at its first opening upon the return day hereof, and marked Exhibit B.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">Exhibit B is the record of a prosecution against Holgenson, the complaint in which contains two counts. The first count was for selling and exposing for sale, dispensing, disposing of and giving away certain intoxicating liquors, between the hours of 12 o\u2019clock on Saturday the 24th of October, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>1896, and 5 o\u2019clock on the Monday morning next following; and the second was for keeping open a certain place in which intoxicating liquors were sold and exposed for sale, between the hours of 12 o\u2019clock on Saturday night, the 24th of October, 1896, and 12 o\u2019clock on the Sunday night next following. To tins complaint Holgenson pleaded guilty. The judgment recites that the court \u201c finds that the accused is guilty in manner and form as alleged in said complaint,\u201d and imposes a fine of $10 and costs of prosecution. From that judgment no appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">The defendants\u2019 answer to the complaint in the present case, is as follows: \u201c Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (being all the paragraphs of the complaint) are admitted.\u201d The judgment of the court below recites that the court \u201c finds the issue for the plaintiff,\u201d and adjudges that the plaintiff recover of the defendants $300 damages and his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">From this judgment the appeal is taken, on the ground (set forth in various forms in the reasons of appeal) that the judgment is erroneous, because it legally appears from the record of the case that the only conviction, if any, alleged and proved, is a conviction for violating the provisions of the Public Acts of 1895; and no conviction for the violation of any provision of \u00a7\u00a7 3087 to 3101 inclusive of the General Statutes, is alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">Section 3064 of General Statutes provides that each person receiving a license for the sale of intoxicating liquors, shall give a bond with sufficient surety \u201c conditioned for the due observance of all the provisions of sections 3087 to 3101 inclusive.\u201d\u2019 Section 3097 of the General Statutes, and Chap. 251 of the Public Acts of 1895, are given in the foot-note.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Albert D.

The obligations of the bond are determined by the statute law as it was on January 1st, 1896. At that time, by force of \u00a7 8064 of the General Statutes, the bond would be forfeited if the licensee should be convicted \u201c of a violation of any of the provisions of sections 8087 to 3101 inclusive.\u201d No one of these sections then contained a provision forbidding the giving away intoxicating liquors between the hours of 12 o\u2019clock on Saturday night and five o\u2019clock on Monday morning next following; but Chap. 251 of the Public Acts of 1895 creates such an offense, which is similar to one of the offenses defined in \u00a7 3097; and it is claimed by the plaintiff that this Act should be construed as if it said: \u201cSection 3097 is amended so as to read as follows \u201d (incorporating therein the new offense in place of the similar offense defined in the section as originally enacted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Such construction is not allowable. The Act of 1895 is an independent Act; it does not purport to be in addition to, or amendment of, or repeal of, any prior Act or part thereof. Whether the new offense is so defined as, by implication, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>repeal the provision relative to the similar offense contained in \u00a7 3097, is immaterial; that section is not amended by including the new offense within its provisions, and therefore a conviction of that offense cannot work a forfeiture of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The complaint, however, does allege Holgenson\u2019s conviction of a different offense, to wit, keeping open, between the hours of 12 o\u2019clock on Saturday night and 12 o\u2019clock on Sunday night next following, a place where intoxicating liquors are sold. This is admittedly a conviction of the violation of one of the provisions contained in \u00a7 3097, and within the condition of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The defendant urges that in paragraph 3 of the complaint this conviction is defectively alleged. The record of the conviction is a part of paragraph 3, and by including that record in the paragraph the pleader alleges, inferentially at least, that Holgenson was charged in one prosecution with two offenses, to wit: the offense of violating the provisions of the Act of 1895 in the first count, and of violating one of the provisions of \u00a7 3097 in the second count; and that by his plea of \u201c guilty \u201d he was convicted of each of these distinct offenses. The pleader also in general terms defines the offense of which Holgenson was so convicted, inaccurately and in language of doubtful meaning,' especially in connection with the legal conclusion alleged, that the Act of 1895 was an amendment to \u00a7 3097. Paragraph 3 is plainly open to demurrer. We think, however, that the defects are matters of form rather than of substance, and that the paragraph as a whole does substantially allege that Holgenson was convicted of the violation of the provisions of \u00a7 3097 specified in the record of conviction, which is made a part of the paragraph. Such formal defects are healed by verdict. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>3 Conn. 513, 515; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>68 id. 512, 517. And the finding of the court below, recited in the judgment, that \u201c the court having heard the parties finds the issue for the plaintiff,\u201d must operate in the same manner. The defendants might have demurred, and in that case the defects could have been cured by amendment. In answering by a specific ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>mission of each allegation in the complaint, they have waived their right of objecting to formal defects as effectually as if they had answered by denial; they cannot now limit the effect of their admissions as evidence upon winch the court may act in finding the issues for the plaintiff. <em>Conn. Hospital for Insane </em>v. <em>Brookfield, </em>69 Conn. 1, 5. The law requires all demurrers to distinctly specify the reasons why the pleading demurred to is insufficient, and cannot be evaded by treating an answer admitting each allegation as a demurrer to formal defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The defendants further urge that the record of conviction indicates that the Police Court regarded the complaint before it as charging a single offense; and that the sentence is illegal if treated as a punishment for more than one offense. The formal finding of the judgment is \u201c that the accused is guilty in manner and form as alleged in said complaint.\u201d This is conclusive. It is immaterial to the present case whether the sentence was imposed on one or both counts, or is illegal. The bond was forfeited by the conviction, unless an appeal was taken. By the terms of \u00a7 3064 the forfeiture took place after the plea of guilty was entered, when the time limited for giving notice of appeal expired. <em>Quintard </em>v. <em>Knoedler, </em>53 Conn. 485, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">There is no error in the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">In this opinion the\u00bbother judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
