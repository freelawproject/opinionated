The defendant admits the passage of the order referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the plaintiffs\u2019 first and second counts. 3. It is the duty of the plaintiffs to plank said crossings, and said city intends to take all legal steps to compel the planking of said crossings, and it is admitted that said city did intend to place planks between the rails on said crossings within the limits of the said highways, taking all necessary precautions for the safety of the public and those traveling on the trains of the plaintiffs, in case the plaintiffs failed to fulfill their duty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-6\">' The plaintiffs demurred to this answer, upon the ground that \u201c even if Hazel and Ivy streets, respectively, are highways, and it is the duty of said plaintiffs to plank said crossings, it does not appear that the city has the right to construct or order the construction of a passage-way across said layout, or to place planks between the rails on said crossings within the limits of said highways, even though in so doing it take all necessary precautions for the safety of the public and those traveling on the trains of the plaintiff, The Hew York, Hew Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, until it shall first have exhausted all legal means for compelling said plaintiff, The Hew York, Hew Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company, to construct said passage-ways as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-7\">The court sustained this demurrer, and rendered judgment permanently restraining the defendant from entering upon the roadbed of the plaintiffs for the purpose of laying any plank or placing any substance between the rails or upon the ties of the railroad tracks or roadbed of the plaintiffs.

Clearly under these circumstances an injunction should not be issued at the demand of the railroad company. <em>Pittsburg, etc., Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>42 N. E. Rep. 783.

Gen. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 3499, 2673. The city of New Haven has no right to construct a crossing and lay planking upon the layout and tracks of the appellees. The specific means of compelling the construction of crossings, resides wholly in the railroad commissioners. The statute which creates this obligation excludes all other means. Endlich Interp. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 154, 465; <em>Camden </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>26 N. J. L. 398; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>1 Mason, 481; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>15 Conn. 526; <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Mayhew, </em>3 N.

The provisions of a subsequent specific statute or charter are to be complied with, to the exclusion of the provisions of a prior general statute. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Little, </em>109 U. S. 504; <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Central Car &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>42 Mich. 399; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>25 N. J. L. 54; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morristown, </em>33 id. 57. The city was, at least, premature in attempting to plank a crossing over the tracks of the appellees; it should have first made a request of the railroad company to construct said crossings, and if said request had been refused, should have applied to the railroad commissioners as required by \u00a7 3499 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b404-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Hall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8Y\">The complaint alleges that neither Ivy nor Hazel street has ever been constructed across the layout and rails of the plaintiffs, and that that portion of each of said streets -within the limits of the layout of the railroad is, and for a long time has been, impassable in vehicles, by reason of ditches and embankments and the absence of planking. The defendant answers that said streets for more than thirty years have been highways, and as such have existed across the railroad tracks of the plaintiffs, open to public travel and used for the purposes of public travel. The plaintiffs demur to this answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">There seems to be some doubt from the pleadings whether grade crossings have ever been constructed over the plaintiffs\u2019 tracks at the places in question, nor is it entirely clear from the record what the contention of the defendant is as to the power of the city of New Haven in the construction of these crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The order of the court of common council of New Haven, which the answer admits to have been passed, directs the board of public works \u201c by grading and planking \u201d to \u201c construct crossings within the lines of the layout of said Ivy street and Hazel street, so as to make a way over the tracks of said railroad at grade passable for vehicles and travelers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">If it be the defendant\u2019s claim that because Ivy and Hazel streets were laid out as highways thirty years ago across the plaintiffs\u2019 tracks, and that though the crossings have at no time been actually completed across the rails of the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad, and have never been constructed so as to be passable by vehicles, yet because these streets have been open across the tracks and have been used to some extent for the purposes of public travel during- that period, the city may now construct grade crossings at these points, or may by grading and planking complete the partially constructed crossings so as to render them passable in vehicles, \u2014such claim is, in our opinion, untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Section 3481 of our General Statutes prohibits the construction of a highway, or a new portion of a highway, across a railroad at grade. This section does not mean that high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ways wMch have been laid out as such across the tracks of a railroad at grade, before the passage of the Act, can after the enactment of the law be constructed across the rails at grade. It is not the laying out, but the construction of the highways across a railroad, which is required by statute to be over or under the railroad. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 59 Conn. 203, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Even though these highways were laid out across the plaintiffs\u2019 tracks many years before the passage of the Act of 1883, and though the construction of the highways across the tracks had been partially finished, and so as to admit of their use in some of the ordinary methods of public travel, but not in others \u2014as for foot travelers, but not for vehicles \u2014 neither the court of common council nor the railroad commissioners had authority after this law had gone into operation, to order the completion of the construction of the crossings at grade. If such partial construction of the highway is to be completed, it must be over or under the railroad, as may be directed by the railroad commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">This court in the case of the <em>New York &amp; N. E. R. Co. </em>v. Waterbury, 55 Conn. 19-24, in speaking of the purpose of this Act said: \u201c It means that although a highway may have been previously laid out,' partially constructed and even built upon, if it has not actually been completed for public use across the rails of the railway, such crossing shall not thereafter be made.\u201d And again: \u201c If it (referring to the highway then under discussion) had been legally laid out, the construction of any portion of it across the. plaintiff\u2019s railway at grade became illegal before it was accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">But the record before us does not furnish a complete history of the construction of these crossings, nor full information as to their present condition. We must, therefore, consider the case in another of its possible aspects. Let us assume that the construction of these crossings had been fully completed for public travel in all its ordinary forms, before the passage of the Act of 1883; but that at the present time, in order to render public travel across the railroad at these points safe and convenient, it is necessary that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>rails should he protected or guarded by planks or timbers placed between and immediately outside of the tracks. May the agents of the city, under an order of the court of common council, enter upon the layout of the railroad and construct or repair the crossing by laying such planks and timbers ?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We think it clear that they cannot; and that the city can neither do this work by its own agents, nor authoritatively order it to be done by the railroad company, even after the refusal of the latter to perform it. This work, though for the benefit of those who use the highways, should be performed so that neither the act nor the method of construction will unnecessarily interfere with the operation of the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad, and so as in the least degree possible to endanger life and property. Manifestly, it can best be so performed by and under the direction of the experienced employees and officers of the railroad company. Section 3499 of the General Statutes expressly requires this work to be done by the company operating the railroad crossed by such highway. The city of New Haven would not be liable for an injury to person or property caused by the unprotected and unguarded condition of these railroad tracks. Section 2673 of the General Statutes providing an action for injuries sustained by reason of defective roads and bridges, enacts that \u201c when the injury is caused by a structure legally placed on such road by a railroad company, it, and not the party bound to keep the road in repair, shall be liable therefor.\u201d The tracks of a railroad are a structure, within the meaning of this provision. <em>Lee </em>v. Barkhampsted, 46 Conn. 213-218.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">It is claimed by the defendant that \u00a7 31 of its charter, giving the court of common council sole and exclusive authority and control over all streets and highways within the limits of said city, and sole and exclusive power to lay out, make or order and repair such highways (9 Special Laws, p. 287), empowers the city to construct these crossings. The plaintiffs contend that under \u00a7 3499 of the General Statutes this work must be done by the railroad company and not by the city, and that upon the refusal or failure of the railroad company its performance can be compelled only by the order of the railroad commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>By the law of this State the railroad commissioners and not the municipal authorities, have sole original jurisdiction of questions relating to changes in highways at grade crossings, when the determination of such questions affects the safety of the public. <em>State\u2019s Atty. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Branford, </em>59 Conn. 402-411. In view of the public statutes giving the railroad commissioners the control over highways at grade crossings, which were in force at the time of the passage of the Act of 1881 amending the defendant\u2019s charter, and of the public laws upon that subject which have been since enacted, the language of \u00a7 31 of the city charter should not be interpreted literally. It must be construed with reference to these general laws; and the general laws concerning the control of highways at grade crossings, in so far as they conflict with the provisions of \u00a7 31, must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The subject of the relative powers, over highways at railroad crossings, of the court of common council of New Haven, as defined by \u00a7 31 of its charter, and those of the railroad commissioners, under the general laws of the State, has been recently considered by this court in the cases of <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. et al., </em>and <em>Tallmadge </em>v. <em>Same, </em>66 Conn. 211-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">It is our conclusion that the city authorities of New Haven have neither the power to order the railroad company to construct or repair these crossings by planking or timbering them, nor to perform this work of construction or repairing by the agents of the city; that if this work may now be lawfully done and this crossing be made passable at grade, the only remedy of the city, upon the refusal or neglect of the railroad company to perform the duty imposed upon it by statute, is by application to the railroad commissioners under the provisions of \u00a7 3499 of the General Statutes,</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
