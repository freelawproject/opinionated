Healy made his will on October 26th, 1896, and died January 1st, 1897. The will, which has been duly proved, is as follows: \u201c 1st. I give and bequeath to the two children of my nephew Bertrand (daughters), Edna and Sada, five hundred dollars each. 2d. I give and bequeath to the daughters of my deceased sister, Betsey Allen (name forgotten), or her legal heirs, one thousand dollars. 3d. I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Jane Coe Healy, ten-twentieths of the remainder of my estate, real and personal. 4th. I give and bequeath to my brother, John Healy, the use of one-twentieth of remainder of my estate, real and personal, at his decease to go to his legal heirs. 5th. I give and bequeath to my brother, Wm. C. Healy, the use of one-twentieth of remainder of my estate, real and personal, at his decease to go to my brother John Healy\u2019s children, share and share alike. 6th. I give and bequeath to my brother, M. L. Healy, the use of one-twentieth of remainder of my estate, real and personal, at his decease to go to his legal heirs. 7th. I give and bequeath to my sister, Julia Warner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>one-twentieth of the remainder of my estate, real and personal, at her decease to go to her legal heirs. 8th.

I ordain and appoint my wife, Jane Coe Healy, executrix, and my nephew, Anson W. Healy, executor of this my last will and testarment, without bonds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">Upon settlement of the estate there remains to be distributed some $50,000 of personal estate, with real estate to the amount of $</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">The complaint asks the Superior Court to construe the will in the following particulars: \u201c First, whether, under section 4, the children of John Healy are entitled to one twentieth of remainder after his decease, or whether said remainder is intestate estate. Second, whether, under section 6, M. L. Healy\u2019s children are entitled to receive, or whether said estate, subject to said life use, is intestate. Third, whether, under section 7, Julia Warner takes absolutely, or her children take subject to her life estate; or if there will remain intestate estate. Fourth, whether, under section 8, Paul Healy\u2019s children or their representatives take, or said remainder is intestate estate. Fifth, whether, under section 9, the children or grandchildren of John take, or the estate given in the ninth clause is intestate. Sixth, whether, under the tenth clause, the children of M. L. Healy take, or the two-twentieths purporting to be given by said clause is intestate estate. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">The court finds that the testator was eighty years old at the date of the will, which was written by one Rollin Humphey, who was at the time about seventy years old; and neither the testator nor Humphrey were lawyers. The court also finds that the defendant Bertrand N. Healy is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the heirs at law of the testator, being the only son of Nathaniel Healy deceased, brother of the testator; that Thomas G. Healy, a brother of the testator not named as legatee, was a man of large wealth, and has died since the commencement of this action, leaving children surviving him; that the defendants Charles J. and Mabel Healy, Lucretia Barnes and Mary and Clara Beckwith, are the children and all the children of the testator\u2019s brother, John Healy, who died after the execution of the will and before the testator; that Herbert S. Beckwith is a son of Mary Beckwith, and Raymond and Louis Beckwith are sons of said Clara Beckwith (all being minors), and are all the grandchildren of John Healy deceased; that said John Healy lived a near neighbor to the intestate, who was intimate with John and his family and knew well his children and his grandchildren; that the defendants, Emma, Edith, Wallace and Willis Healy, Effa Curtis, Ellen Welton, Hattie Hyde, Winifred Hayes, Egbert N., Elmer and Henry Healy, were the children, and all the children of the testator\u2019s brother, M. L. Healy, and they were all well known to the testator at the time he executed said will; that the testator\u2019s brothers, Wm. C. and M. L. Healy, and his sister Julia Warner, still survive; that Paul Healy died before the testator, and three of his children and three representatives of children survive.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>Charles H.

Apparently this demurrer, although sustained by the court, is waived by the reservation; hut if not, we deem it unnecessary to pass upon the action of the court in sustaining the demurrer, as the facts averred, in view of the plain meaning of the will, could only serve to support a construction sufficiently clear without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The clauses we are asked to construe are valid. A bequest of \u201c the use of one-twentieth of the remainder of my estate to A. B., at his decease to go to his legal heirs,\u201d is certainly not obnoxious to the common law rule against perpetuities. It is immaterial whether it would he valid under our late statute of perpetuities. Tins will was executed since the repeal of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The gift in the fourth clause vests in the legal heirs of John Healy at the death of the testator. The prior death of the life tenant does not invalidate the gift over.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The'seventh clause,which gives \u201cto my sister, Julia Warner, one-twentieth of the remainder of my estate, real and personal, at her decease to go to her legal heirs,\u201d\u2014gives to Julia a life estate only. The language used, in connection with that of other parts of the will and its whole scheme, clearly expresses this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The ninth clause gives the legacy named to the legal heirs of John. When a clause can he read so as to be consistent with a testator\u2019s evident intent and avoid uncertainty, it should he so read. By supplying the omission of a comma, any doubt as to the meaning of this clause disappears. It then reads: \u201c I give and bequeath to the legal heirs of my brother, John\u2019s children, two-twentieths,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">In the tenth clause the legacy is given \u201c to the legal heirs of my brother, M. L. Healy.\u201d It appears from the will itself that the testator knew that his brother was living, for he gives him a legacy in the sixth clause. It is therefore certain that he here uses the words \u201c legal heirs \u201d in the popular sense, as indicating the persons entitled to inherit if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>brother were dead. Where the legal heirs include children and the representatives of children, as appears to be the case with those named in the eighth clause, of course they take <em>per stirpes. Jackson </em>v. <em>Alsop, </em>67 Conn. 249, 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The Superior Court is advised: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\"><em>1. </em>The legal heirs of John Healy living at the death of the testator, are entitled to the bequest under the fourth section.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">2. The bequest under section six is to M. L. Healy for life, and upon his death to those who in that event are his legal heirs then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">3. The bequest under section seven goes to Julia Warner for life, and upon her death to her legal heirs then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">4. The bequest under section eight goes to the legal heirs of Paul Healy living at the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">5. The bequest under section nine goes to the legal heirs of John Healy living at the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">6. The bequest under section ten goes to those persons living at the testator\u2019s death who would be the legal heirs of M. L. Healy if he were dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">7. All the above gifts are valid, and where the legal heirs consist of children and representatives of deceased children, they take <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
