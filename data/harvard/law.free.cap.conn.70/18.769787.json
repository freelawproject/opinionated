Risley, as treasurer of said board, to indorse and negotiate the same, and for want of power in the defendant Merriman, as treasurer of said defendant town, to accept the same with five per cent, interest on behalf of defendant town. <em>Tenth. </em>Because it is not alleged in paragraph 18 of said amended answer that the warning of the town meeting of the defendant town which accepted the reports of the town officers mentioned in said paragraph for the year ending September 11th, 1896, or the warning of airy town meeting which accepted any like reports, contained any notice that any unauthorized act or acts of the first selectman and town agent, or of the town treasurer of the defendant town, would be brought before such town meeting for ratification. <em>Eleventh. </em>Because there is no allegation in said paragraph 18 that any unauthorized act of the first selectman and town agent, or of the treasurer of the defendant town, was, in fact, submitted for ratification to any town meeting of the defendant town with a statement of the material facts, sc that the defendant town might take lawful action in the premises. <em>Twelfth. </em>Because the facts alleged in said paragraph 18 are wholly insufficient in the law to constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ratification on the part of the defendant town, of the unauthorized acts of the defendant Merriman, as treasurer of the defendant town, in accepting with five per cent, interest the orders purchased and held by the defendants Wells and Cowles, as set out in paragraph 16 of the amended answer, and of the unauthorized acts of the first selectman and town agent of defendant town in employing persons and incurring expenses for the purposes set out in paragraph 19 of the amended answer. <em>Thirteenth. </em>Because the defendant town had no power to employ persons or incur expenses to relieve and absolve it from liability and obligation respecting the said highway, and the care, repair and maintenance thereof, a duty imposed on the defendant town by the State of Connecticut, and no power to ratify any unauthorized acts of its officers or agents in employing persons or incurring expenses for such purposes.\u201d ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-6\"><em>Henry </em>Stoddard, with whom was <em>William 0.

Derby, 58 Conn. 234, and <em>Dibble </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>56 id. 199, 202. Both of these cases proceed upon the principle that in tins State the town, in reference to the management of its prudential affairs, may, at its discretion, pay any debt or obligation incurred by any agency, whether authorized primarily or not. The town of East Hartford having received the benefit of the employment and services of the agents and attorneys in question, and intending and desiring to pay the obligation, it is unnecessary to consider whether the town is strictly liable at law upon the orders in question. <em>Norwalk Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>63 Conn. 522; <em>East Hartford </em>v. <em>American Nat. Bank, </em>49 id. 553. The defendant town is liable at law upon the orders in question, and is so liable in either of two views of the case. In the first place the orders were drawn in payment of claims arising from the care, maintenance, and repair of the highway in question. It is novel doctrine in Connecticut that a town cannot pay the necessary and legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>expenses connected with obtaining proper legislation in respect to the highways winch it is hound to maintain. And, secondly, the authority constituted by law to determine the question has determined that the claims are for the care, maintenance, and repair of the highway. The orders in question are negotiable in character and in the hands of the defendants, Wells and Cowles, who are <em>bona fide </em>owners, the town is liable upon the orders. In this State such orders have been treated and regarded to a large extent as negotiable, and have circulated as such. <em>Bethlehem </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>51 Conn. 493. But the orders in question further contain a substantial recital of fact upon which the purchaser in the open market is entitled to rely. <em>Andes </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>158 U. S. 324; 2 Dan\u2019l on Neg. Instr. (3d ed.), 537, 538. The application to the legislature of 1893, and obtaining the repealing Act of that year, was not an unlawful act, and the Superior Court erred in ruling that it was. It is neither resistance to, nor an attack upon, the sovereignty of the State of Connecticut. The cases cited by the plaintiff to support his contention are not in point. Cases in which the town had no duty, and no right in respect to the subject-matter in question, have no application to the case at bar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-6\"><em>Francis E. Parker, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">The orders in question, drawn for the purposes set out in paragraph 19 of the answer, were <em>ultra vires </em>and void. \u2022 These orders were not drawn for the expenses of repairs and maintenance, nor were they drawn in payment of damages arising from defects. The defendant town had no greater power to do the acts set out in the answer than the bridge board had. Section 7 of the Bridge Act of 1887 imposes upon the town the duty of paying orders drawn for lawful purposes, and no statute authorizes the town to pay any orders drawn for other purposes. The act of one selectman, even if he be first selectman, is ineffectual. He cannot hind the town. The addition of the words \u201c town agent,\u201d is immaterial. There is no such officer, and no statute prescribing the duties of such an officer. Again, the treasurer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>town had no power to accept the orders in question, with interest at 5 per cent, or in any form. A town treasurer cannot bind his town by making or accepting commercial paper of any kind, nor has he any power to accept town orders. His powers are strictly limited by statute, and he has no power to pay any illegal demand upon the town. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 84, 85, 86 ; <em>East Hartford </em>v. <em>Amer. Nat.

The cases of <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>58 Conn. 234, and of <em>Dibble v. New Haven, </em>56 id. 199, are not in point. Here the public corporations are not defending their corporate rights against the aggressions of interested parties. They are the aggressors in a movement against the sovereignty of the State, and if they could not resist the State, they certainly could not attack it. There can be no ratification by mere implication; it must be by direct action, and with a full understanding of the facts. Here there is nothing to show such understanding or any intent on the part of the town to ratify any <em>ultra vires </em>acts of its officers. Gen. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 33, 64, 84, 85, 86; <em>Turney </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>55 Conn. 418; <em>Brooklyn Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hebron, </em>51 id. 29; <em>Dibble v.

But if the orders in. question were <em>ultra vires </em>and void, then they were incapable of ratification by the defendant town. 1 Dill, on Mun. Corp. \u00a7 463.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATz\">The plaintiff is a citizen and tax-payer of the town of East Hartford. The judgment of the Superior Court enjoined that town, perpetually, from paying four certain orders of like tenor with the one recited in the sixteenth paragraph of the defendants\u2019 answer. If the law is so that the town is, in no event, lawfully under obligation to pay those orders, then the demurrer was properly sustained and the judgment is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">It will simplify the discussion if we keep distinctly in mind from the outset, that the town is not liable as the maker or drawer of the orders. An inspection of the order so recited shows that no agent of the town, as such, took part in the making of it. The obligation of the town to pay those orders, if it exists at all, must arise from one of the three, or possibly four, following conditions: First, because the said highway board had authority by law to issue orders for the purpose for which it appears by the record these orders were issued, and so to make them binding on the town; or, second, assuming that the orders were invalid when issued, because the town has ratified them; or third, because the orders were negotiable, and so their validity cannot be questioned in the hands of the present holders. The possible fourth condition is the acceptance of the bonds by the town treasurer. But this may be wholly disregarded. A town treasurer has no authority to bind a town by his acceptance of an illegal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Let us, then, first inquire as to the authority of the said board. At its January session in the year 1887, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ture passed an Act entitled, \u201c An Act to establish Free Public Highways across the Connecticut River in Hartford County,\u201d\u2014by subsequent legislation made to apply only to the Hartford Bridge,\u2014by which it was provided that the State\u2019s Attorney in Hartford county should bring a complaint to the Superior Court in that county ag\u2019ainst the proprietors of the said Hartford bridge, then being a toll bridge; that said court, upon such complaint, should appoint commissioners who should lay out and establish a highway across the Connecticut river where the said toll bridge was, and along and across the causeway and approaches appurtenant to and connected therewith, and should appraise the damages and benefits; that \u201c said highway when laid out and established as herein provided, shall be a free public highway; \u201d that said commissioners should determine what towns were specially benefited by the layout and establishment of said highway, and should assess to them such benefits as they should find equitable. The said Act, in its seventh section, then provided that \u201c when said highway, so established as aforesaid, shall have become a free public highway as aforesaid, the same shall thereafter be maintained by the said towns so assessed in proportion to the assessment upon said towns as hereinafter provided. The first selectmen of the said several towns shall meet on the second Monday after said highway shall have become a free highway as aforesaid, at the office of the selectmen in Hartford, and annually thereafter and at such other times as they shall deem necessary, and said several first selectmen shall constitute a board for the care, maintenance, and control of said highway. Said board shall appoint a- chairman, secretary, and treasurer, and said board shall apportion the expense of repairing and maintaining said highway upon the said several towns in proportion to the assessment against said towns as aforesaid, and said chairman shall draw his order on the respective treasurers of said towns to the order of the treasurer of said board for the proportional amount payable by said towns as aforesaid for such repairs and maintenance. Any damages resulting from the defective condition of said highway or the bridges upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>same shall be paid by said towns in proportion to the said assessment. For the purpose embraced in this section the said board shall be a body politic and corporate by the name of The Board for the Care of Highways and Bridges across the Connecticut River in Hartford County, and actions may be brought against said board by service upon its secretary, and any judgment recovered therein shall be paid by said towns in said proportions and in the same maimer as herein provided for the payment of the expenses of repairs and maintenance as aforesaid. Said board shall annually report to said several towns the expenses incurred and paid by them during the preceding year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Pursuant to the provisions of that Act the State\u2019s Attorney for Hartford county brought a complaint to the Superior Court in that county at its October term, 1887, and thereupon commissioners were appointed and such proceedings were had, that said Superior Court by its decree laid out and established a free public highway across the Connecticut River at the place where the toll bridge of the Hartford Bridge Company then was, and along and across the causeways and approaches appurtenant to and connected therewith, and found that the towns of Hartford, East Hartford, Glastonbury, South Windsor and Manchester were especially benefited by said layout, and assessed the benefits to each, the proportion of said expense imposed on the town of East Hartford being eleven thirty-fifths of the entire expense; so that the said town of East Hartford became and was liable to pay in the manner set forth in the said Act, eleven thirty-fifths of the expense of repairing and maintaining said free public highway, and eleven thirty-fifths of any damage resulting from the defective condition of said free public highway or the bridges thereon; and so far as the terms of said Act express, for no other expense whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Afterwards, in September, 1889, the first selectmen of the said towns met, as is provided in said Act, and organized the corporation therein created, by the name of \u201cThe Board for the Care of Highways and Bridges across the Connecticut River in Hartford County,\u201d by electing George W. Fowler, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>then the first selectman of Hartford, its chairman, and John S. Risley, then the first selectman of Manchester, as its treasurer ; and said corporation, so organized, immediately assumed the care and control of said free public highway, repairing and maintaining the same until the 29th day of June, 1893. On said last mentioned day, as it is alleged in the tenth paragraph of the complaint, the General Assembly, being then in session, passed an Act which was made to take effect on its passage, by which the said Act of 1887 was repealed, and the State itself assumed and undertook the duty of repairing and maintaining thereafter the said free public highway. The purposes for which the said orders were issued, is set forth in the nineteenth paragraph of the defendants\u2019 answer, as follows:\u2014 \u201c The said orders were made, accepted, endorsed, and negotiated in payment for services of persons' employed and expenses incurred by said first selectman and town agent of the defendant town, and by said \u2018 Board for the Care of Highways and Bridges across the Connecticut River in Hartford County,\u2019 to relieve and absolve the defendant town from obligation and liability respecting the said highway and bridge, and the care, repair, and maintenance thereof; and said services and expenses were, in part, rendered and expended in respect to, and in the preparation of, the Act of the General Assembly refereed to in the tenth paragraph of the amended complaint, and in respect to the proceedings before the committee of the General Assembly in respect to said legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We have already seen that the said orders on their face indicate that the first selectman and town agent of the defendant town did not, as such, take any part in the making or drawing of the orders. The first selectman and town agent of the defendant town was a member of said board. He took no part in the making or issuing the orders as such member. If said board might lawfully issue the said orders in the payment of such employment and expenses, and so make them a charge on the town, then the orders should be paid, but otherwise not. And this brings us directly to the question of whether or not the said \u201c Board for the Care of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Highways and Bridges across the Connecticut River in Hartford County\u201d could lawfully issue these orders for such purposes and mate them, obligatory on the town of East Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">It has been noticed that the terms of the Act which created the board made it the duty of said board to care for, maintain and control the said highways, and gave it authority to apportion the expense of repairing and maintaining the same, as well as any damages resulting from the defective condition of the said highway and bridge, upon the several towns named in the decree of the Superior Court. The terms of the Act give that board no power to impose on the towns the expense of anything else. The terms of the Act gave that board no authority to employ agents to appear before the legislature, for any purpose whatever; least of all to employ agents to procure legislation which would terminate its own existence. And it seems to us that said board did not have such power by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">If we regard the board simply as a device to enable the representatives of the five towns to perform a municipal duty imposed on the town jointly with the other towns, it is clear that the powers of such a board should not be extended by implication beyond the performance of the joint municipal duty which made some such device necessary. If, on the other hand, we regard the board as a municipal corporation, it is one with very limited powers, created for a specified duty only, and must be judged by the rule applicable to such a corporation. Public or municipal corporations are not associations, but are sub-divisions of the State. The charter of such a corporation is not a contract between the corporation and the State, nor between the corporators themselves. The effect of an Act of the legislature incorporating a municipality is to invest the governing authorities of the municipality\u2014 either a majority of the voters, or such officers as are prescribed\u2014with the power of local government over the inhabitants of that district. Such an Act, strictly speaking, confers powers which did not exist before; it confers on the governing authority the power of laying taxes, and passing local laws for the purposes named in the Act, without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>previous consent of the people of the district. The governing authorities possess no powers or faculties not conferred upon them either expressly or by fair implication by the law which creates them, or by other statutes applicable to them. Dillon on Mun. Corp. \u00a7 21; Morawetz on Corp. \u00a7\u00a724, 649, 1046; <em>Coler </em>v. Cleburne, 131 U. S. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">A municipal corporation has no power by implication, unless it is one that may be necessary to the successful carrying out of those powers which are expressly given. It is more reasonable to suppose that the legislature, in creating a corporation, intended that it should succeed rather than that it should fail. Hence the courts hold that such necessary powers were really intended to be granted. If the powers expressly given can be exercised without aid from implication, then nothing can be implied. And there can be no implication of a power existing in a corporation inconsistent with those which are expressly granted. Obviously a power destructive of those expressly granted, cannot be implied. Perpetual continuance is ordinarily an essential ingredient in the idea of a corporation. A corporation cannot put an end to its own existence; it certainly cannot unless the power to do so is expressly given to it. The said board had no power to make the orders in question obligatory on the defendant town, unless it had the implied power to employ agents to appear before the legislature to procure legislation to terminate its own existence. Such an implication cannot be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">A large part of the defendants\u2019 argument is devoted to the claim that the town of East Hartford might \u2014\u25a0 as could any other town in the State\u2014lawfully employ counsel or agents to appear before the legislature to procure any legislation in which the town conceives itself to be interested. They cite <em>Farrel </em>v. Derby, 58 Conn. 234. That case, however, goes no further than to hold that a town may lawfully expend money it has raised by taxation, to protect its corporate integrity, privileges, or property, from adverse legislation. The doctrine of that case is one that is not to be carried further. It cannot be stretched into an authority justifying a town to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>embark in legislative attacks on other corporations, because the town might think itself benefited thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In one aspect of this case it is entirely immaterial whether the town has or has not power to employ agents to appear before the legislature. If the town of East Hartford has power to employ agents or attorneys for that purpose, it has not done so in this case. In another aspect of the case the question of the power of the town to employ agents for such purpose, is material, and that is on the claim of a ratification. The defendants say that the town of East Hartford has ratified these orders. The averments in the pleadings from which ratification is claimed, are these: In the eighteenth paragraph of the complaint it is alleged that \u201c the said defendants, the said town of East Hartford and the said Merriman as treasurer of said town of East Hartford, intend to pay the said four illegal orders amounting to the sum of $5,000 now outstanding and unpaid as hereinbefore set forth.\u201d And in the eighteenth paragraph of the answer it is alleged as follows : \u201c In the annual report of the selectmen and treasurer and other officers of said town of East Hartford to the town of East Hartford, in the year ending September 11th, 1889, and in other such reports, there was contained, as a liability, a statement that said orders were still outstanding as an immediate liability to the amount of $5,000, bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent., and said report, with said statement of said orders as liabilities, was accepted by said town of East Hartford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The claim as stated is like this: The town itself might have employed the agents and attorneys to appear before the legislature to procure the legislation by which it was released from contributing towards the expense of the free highway; the said board did employ attorneys who went before the legislature and procured such legislation and which benefited the town; in payment for the services so rendered the board issued the orders in question, and now the town, by the action so above alleged, has ratified those orders; and as there can be no ratification of a contract unless there was power to enter into that contract originally, the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the power of a town to employ agents to appear before the legislature might be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">It would be material, if the disposition of this case depended on it. We have no occasion, however, to pass upon that question, for the reason that the allegations of the pleadings do not show a ratification. There is no ratification unless the party has full knowledge of all the facts, nor unless there is the intent to ratify. <em>Dibble </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>56 Conn. 199, 202; <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>New York &amp; H. R. Co., </em>59 id. 272, 281; <em>Ansonia </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>64 id. 536, 544. The allegations here fail to show that the town had full knowledge, and fail to show that there was an intent to ratify. We think there was no ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The orders were not negotiable so as to estop the plaintiff or the town of East Hartford from showing their illegality in the hands of the present holders. Municipal orders or bonds are not ordinarily negotiable. The orders in this case are similar to, and in effect precisely like, the orders discussed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>19 Wall. 468, 477,-a case in which the city of Nashville, Tenn., had issued orders for the payment of money borrowed by the city. There was no express authority in its charter for the city to borrow money for any purpose. Mr. Justice Bradley, in giving the opinion of the court, said: \u201cVouchers for money due, certificates of indebtedness for services rendered or for property furnished for the use of the city, orders or drafts drawn by one city officer upon another, or any other device of the kind, used for liquidating the amounts legitimately due to public creditors, are of course necessary instruments for carrying on the machinery of municipal administration, and for anticipating the collection of taxes. But to invest such documents with the character and incidents of commercial paper, so as to render them in the hands of <em>bona fide </em>holders absolute obligations to pay, however irregularly or fraudulently issued, is an abuse of their true character and purpose. It has the effect of\u2019 converting a municipal organization into a trading company, and puts it into the power of corrupt officials to involve a political community in irretrievable bankruptcy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>No such power ought to exist, and in our opinion no such power does legally exist, unless conferred by legislative enactment, either express or clearly implied. . . . But where the power has not been given, parties must take municipal orders, drafts, certificates, and other documents of the sort, at their peril. Custom and usage may have so far assimilated them to regular commercial paper as to made them negotiable, that is, transferable by delivery or indorsement. This quality renders them more convenient for the purposes of the holder, and has, undoubtedly, led to the idea so frequently, but, as we think, erroneously, entertained, that they are invested with that other characteristic of commercial paper\u2014freedom from all legal and equitable defenses in the hands of a <em>bona \u25a0tide </em>holder. But every holder of a city order or certificate knows, that to be valid and genuine at all, it must have been issued as a voucher for city indebtedness. It , could not be lawfully issued for any other purpose. He must take it, therefore, subject to the risk that it was lawfully and properly issued. His claim to be a <em>bona fide </em>holder will always be subject to this qualification. The face of the paper itself is notice to him that its validity depends upon the regularity of its issue. The officers of the city have no authority to issue it for any illegal or improper purpose, and their acts cannot create an estoppel against the city itself, its taxpayers, or people. Persons receiving it from them know whether it is issued, and whether they receive it, for a proper ptupose and a proper consideration. Of course they are affected by the absence of these essential ingredients; and all subsequent holders take <em>cum onere, </em>and are affected by the same defect.\u201d It was holden that the order was invalid and that there could be no recovery against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">These considerations exactly apply to the present case, and show that the orders enjoined against were not negotiable. 1 Daniel on Neg.
