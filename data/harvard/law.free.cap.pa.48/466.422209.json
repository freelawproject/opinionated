Guillou, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqX7\">\u2014 The testator\u2019s intentions are to be found within the four corners of the will: Hunter\u2019s Estate, 6 Barr 107. No rule of law has a more ancient origin than that if a testator expresses his intention defectively, by not using technical and artificial terms, yet, if his intention can be collected from his will, the law, however defective the language may be, will construe his words according to his intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-12\">Can there be any doubt as to M. Jauretche\u2019s wishes ? The third article is a clear prohibition against her parting with the property in any way during her life, and the fourth is equally clear in forbidding any testamentary disposition, since, at her death, the property passes to the children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-13\">The 19th section of Act of 8th April 1833 (Brightly\u2019s Purd. Dig. 1017), provides that \u201c all devises of real estate shall pass the whole of the testator\u2019s estate without words of inheritance, unless it appear by a devise over, or by words of limitation, or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.\u201d The plaintiff submits that it does appear by the devise over and otherwise of the will (viz., by 3d article), that the testator did not intend to give the fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-14\">The word \u201c residue,\u201d in 4th article, is synonymous with <em>\u201c </em>surplus,\u201d as defined in Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 Harris 268, and designates whatever may be left unconsumed or undisposed of by the widow under the previous devise to her, and her lawful restricted enjoyment of the property thereunder. It does not enlarge the devise, nor in any way remove the restrictions imposed. In ascertaining what \u201c residue\u201d the testator intended that his children should receive, the first element of consideration is the prohibition against any alienation from them by deed or by will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-15\">The law does not lean towards, but resists a construction by which the inheritance is to be taken from the heirs: French <em>v. </em>McIlhenney, 2 Binn. 19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Devise of all testator\u2019s property, real and personal, to his wife, during her natural life, to do and dispose of as she may think best, only confers a life estate: Fisher <em>v. </em>Herbell, 7 W. &amp; S. 63.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-6\">G. <em>W. Biddle, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9IT\">\u2014 The judgment in favour of the plaintiff is right, for the following reasons: \u2014 The whole plan of the will shows the intention of the testator to confer the absolute ownership of his estate upon his wife. In the 1st article he names her the sole and only heir of all his property, present and future, as well realty as personalty, of which he may be the owner at the time of his death. Even before the Act of 1833, this language would have conferred a fee upon Mrs. Jauretche: Ferguson <em>v. </em>Zepp, 4 W. C. C. R. 645; Dice <em>v. </em>Sheffer, 3 W. &amp; S. 419. Of course, as to wills written since the Act of 1833, such words would be construed much more strongly in favour of the devisee: Culbertson <em>v. </em>Daly, 7 W. &amp; S. 195.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-7\">What is there, in the subsequent passages of the will, to impair the effect of this general devise ? In the 2d article the testator expresses a desire that his estate at Cambo should not be sold, if his wife can do otherwise. So far from being restrictive, this plainly recognises the absolute proprietorship of the wife, and merely expresses a preference, to be followed or not, as she may think best under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-8\">The 3d article is obscure; but in its plain reading, it is not only compatible with the absolute ownership of the wife, but incompatible with any other meaning. It is as if he had said, \u201c I give you all my estate, but don\u2019t divest yourself of it until after your death, when you can leave it as you think proper.\u201d He seems to have been apprehensive that his widow might be induced to part with some of the estate to her disadvantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-9\">That this language was merely directory, and not mandatory, is plain from the 2d article. Had he meant to restrict his wife positively from selling, he would not have expressed a wish that the Cambo plantation should not be sold if she could do otherwise. Again: in the 4th article, at the death of his wife, what he might have left her, that is to say, the residue, was to be divided equally among the children. What is the import of residue? Surely that which should be left after she had spent and used what she wanted. On this point we have high authority in our own state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-10\">In Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 Harris 268, the construction of Mr. Pennock\u2019s will was before the Supreme Court for the third time, and finally settled. It was there held that, where a testator devised to his wife his real estate for life, and his personalty absolutely, \u201c having full confidence she will leave the surplus to be divided at her decease justly among my children,\u201d the widow took the absolute ownership in the personalty, overruling Me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Konkey\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 253, and Coates\u2019s Appeal, 2 Barr 129. The word surplus, it was decided, meant what was left of personal estate unconsumed, or undisposed of by the widow in her lifetime, and not the balance left after payment of testator\u2019s debts. The following English cases may be consulted on this point: Lechmere <em>v. </em>Lavie, 2 Mylne &amp; Keen 197; Pope <em>v. </em>Pope, 10 Sim. 1; Knight <em>v. </em>Knight, 3 Beav. 148; Pushman <em>v. </em>Pilliter, 3 Ves. Jr. 7; Horwood <em>v. </em>West, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">In the present will, residue has the same meaning as surplus. It could mean nothing but what was left, after the widow had spent what she might think proper to do. It is therefore argued that no design is anywhere apparent on the face of the will to impair the fulness of the devise and bequest made to the wife in the 5th article; on the contrary, there is strong evidence on its face that the testator desired to impose no restriction of absolute ownership, or to imply it. He would have preferred that a certain piece of property should be kept until after his wife\u2019s death ; but this wish was not to be carried into effect unless with her consent, and without derogation to her absolute rights. Any residue left he wished divided among his children equally \u2014 a wish quite consistent with absolute ownership in the wife. If, however, legally inconsistent with the wife\u2019s paramount rights, the latter must prevail. Nowhere is intention shown to cut down the absolute fee-simple interest, given to the wife, to a life estate. The comprehensive terms of gift, used in the 1st article, should therefore prevail, and the widow, it is submitted, is entitled to the whole estate, and can sell to a purchaser in fee simple.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACY\">January 25th 1865,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b470-8\">Woodward, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ark\">\u2014 It is a conceded point that the 1st article of the testator\u2019s will gave to his wife a fee simple in his real estate, and an absolute estate in his personalty, and the question is, whether the subsequent clauses must be so construed as to cut down her interest to a life estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The words of the 2d article, taken separately from the context, are manifestly merely precatory, and not mandatory. He <em>desired </em>her not to sell the plantation at Cambo, if she could do otherwise, but he did not, by these words, expressly forbid a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">But the 3d article applies to the whole estate, as well that at Cambo as elsewhere; and its words necessarily qualify those of the 2d article. According to the idiom of our language, there can be no doubt that the expression \u201cshe is not to divest herself,\u201d &amp;c., is an imperative prohibition, and means that she shall not divest herself, or that power is withheld from her to divest herself, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">And though the will was written by a Frenchman, in French, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>and we may not be able to catch precisely the shade of thought which his words would convey to a French eye, yet, from the several translations with which we have been favoured, we think it pretty apparent that, by the idiom of the French, no less than by that of our own language, his words in the 3d article are not to be taken in a precatory sense, as expressive of desire, but in a mandatory sense, as expressive of will.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">What is it, then, but the devise of a fee simple, with a denial of the power of alienation ? \u201c She is not to divest herself of what I may leave her, until after her death,\u201d implies that she may dispose of the estate by will, which can only take effect after death, but that she shall not dispose of it by deed, which must take effect during her life. The paramount thought in the testator\u2019s mind was to make his wife absolute owner of his estate, and he expressed this thought by sufficient words; but the particular thought was to take away from her one of the incidents of absolute ownership \u2014 in other words, that he would grant a fee, with power of testamentary disposition, but would withhold the power of alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">That this was his meaning is further apparent from the 4th article, which, in giving the \u201cresidue\u201d over to the children, implied the right of consumption in the wife. This word residue, as used in this place, does not imply a residuum of estate or interest like a remainder, but a residuum of the property \u2014 or, in the testator\u2019s own language, of \u201cwhat I may have left her,\u201d and in this sense is exactly equivalent to \u201c surplus,\u201d a word which was fully considered and expounded in Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 Harris 282. It was there said, upon the authority of several English cases, that where it c.an be implied from the will that a discretion is left to withdraw any part of the subject of the devise from the object of the wish or request, or to apply it to the use of the devise, no trust is created, but an absolute right to use and consume exists. As the word surplus in the devise over in that case was held to imply a right in the first taker to consume the whole, so the word residue here implies that the testator\u2019s wife was to enjoy his estate with no other restraint than that of alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Such, then, is this will \u2014 the devise of an absolute estate to the wife, with all the rights of a tenant in fee, except the power of alienation, and with direction that what may remain of the property at her death may be equally divided among the children. Now, a power of alienation is necessarily and inseparably incident to an estate in fee, and therefore if lands be devised to A. and his heirs, upon condition that he shall not alien, the condition. is void: 4 Kent 131; McWilliams <em>v. </em>Nisely, 2 S. &amp; R. 513; Schummacher <em>v. </em>Negus, 1 Denio 448. And this principle is not peculiar to persons entitled to the inheritance of lands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>but applies also to the entire or absolute interest in personalty: 1 Jarman on Wills 688. A <em>partial </em>restriction, such as not to alien to a particular person or for a limited time, may be supported, but a <em>general </em>restraint of alienation, when annexed to an absolute estate, is void, upon the familiar principle that conditions repugnant to the estate to which they are annexed, bind not.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">To the same effect is that other rule in interpreting wills which sacrifices the particular to the general intent, where they are inconsistent. Here the testator\u2019s general intent was, that his wife should enjoy his whole estate absolutely, and that only the unconsumed residue should go to the children, and as his desires and expectations, however expressed, did not make her a trustee for the children, so neither can the expressions of his secondary intent, however imperative, restrict her enjoyment of the estate granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judgment is afiirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
