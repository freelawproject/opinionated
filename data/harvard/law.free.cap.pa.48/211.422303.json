Hawkins, guardian and trustee of John McMasters, Jr., for himself and the said John McMasters, Jr., by Charles Shaler, his attorney, demurs to the said bill, because he says the said complainant seeks to charge the ward of this defendant as the devisee of John McMasters, the testator in the said bill named, under whose will, as the complainant alleges, the estate of the said John McMasters, Jr., became charged with the same. But it does not appear by the said bill that the said John McMasters, Jr.,-as such devisee, is bound in, by, or under the said devise to pay or discharge said debt, or that the same is a charge upon the estate of the said devisee, under and by the will of John McMasters, the testator. And for further cause alleges that the said complainant has not, by his said bill, made or stated such a case as doth or ought to entitle him to any such recovery or relief as is thereby sought and prayed for, from, or against this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">And for further ground of demurrer to complainant\u2019s bill, alleges that the said complainant is not entitled to the prayer of the said bill, because he says that if the facts, circumstances, and documents be properly averred, the District Court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of complaint, but that the same is vested in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">The court below, on hearing the case, sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill, at the costs of the complainant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-8\">N. <em>P. Fetterman </em>and <em>S. A. Purviance, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJD\">\u2014 The main and indeed only question argued and decided below was, whether John McMasters, Jr., upon the death of his father, held the property discharged of the lien of Larimer\u2019s debt. We contend that, by a fair and liberal construction of the will, he can only take subject to the payment of this debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">Mrs. Larimer was the daughter of the testator, and it is obvious the security of this debt was intended for her upon this property. The property becoming valuable, the testator did not intend John McMasters, Jr., should be the owner of it, except upon the condition that he paid the $7000 to Mrs. Larimer, or to her use. The debt was just; the old man knew it and intended to secure it; but John \u2014 the father of John, Jr. \u2014 was to have the entire management of the rents and profits for his and his family\u2019s support. He applied the rents in this way, and in the improvement of the property. He, out of the rents, supported this boy in his minority, and improved the property so as to increase the rents when the property came into the young man\u2019s hands. Is there any equity now in his repudiating this debt, and does it not follow the land in his hands ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">The court below seemed to think Larimer might have gone into court and taken the rents from John\u2019s support. This would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>have been a clear violation of the intention of the testator. John was hopelessly insolvent, and dependent upon the bounty of his father. To require the payment of Larimer\u2019s debt out of the rents would have turned John and family out of house and home besides, John had the control of these, and was the judge of what was necessary for this support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">The devise is made to the trustees, who, it is conceded in the argument and by the court, have the fee simple in trust for payment of this debt. A devise to trustees and their heirs for life of certain persons, remainder over, the fee passes unless contrary intent be clearly manifested: 13 E. C. L. Rep. 213. Was it intended by the testator that if John, the son, had died in a month after making the will, that John, the grandson, should have the property discharged of the debt ? And yet this would be the case if the position of appellees be correct. In such a case would not the fee still remain with the trustees until the purpose of the trust should be fully discharged ? and was not that the intention of the testator ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">To show that Larimer had a lien upon the lands, we say he might have obtained an order for the sale of part of it to pay the debt; and that, if this could be done, the land continues chargeable until the debt be paid, no matter into whose hands or possession it may fall. The trustees holding the legal title, and having the right to call for a sale of a part of the property, could maintain ejectment against John McMasters, the grandson, and oust him unless he should pay the money in dispute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">In Gibson <em>v. </em>Lord Montford, 1 Ves. 485, property given to trustees to pay legacies out of rents, issues, and profits arising by the real estate, Lord Hardwicke ruled that, as the legacies could not be satisfied out of the annual profits, they must be raised by a sale of the real estate, for which purpose the trustee must take the legal inheritance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">Again : And though the trust is to raise the portions by means of the rents and profits, yet if a particular time be fixed for the payment of the whole amount, that will be considered inconsistent with the intention that the sum should be raised only by the gradual perception or the annual income, and a sale will be directed: 2 Vernon 310; 1 Chan. Cases 175; 1 Atkinson 551. Here time was fixed; and besides, the trustees were trammelled by John\u2019s right to handle and appropriate the funds. They could therefore ask the court to sell; and John, the grandson, in equity should no't be allowed to gainsay it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">The trust in this case was of a very peculiar character. John during his natural life was to receive the profits for himself and family, not subject to his debts, but subject to the payment of this debt in annual instalments of $1000 a year, and at the same time allowing John to make such improvements as he thought proper. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>John, as the bill shows, consumed the whole in his and his family\u2019s support, and improvements made; and no court could have decreed the payment of this debt out of the rents, and thus deprived John of a support. The trust being for the use of-John and his family, subject to the payment of this debt, devolves it upon the grandson in equity, as he gets the property out of which it is to be paid. This grandson\u2019s support was as much provided for as that of his father\u2019s, and the payment of the debt was to be subject to his support. Can he, with any equity, say that because he consumed the rents in his support, and in the improvement of the property whereby the rents are increased, that he gets it discharged of this lien? We ask for no decree that will in the least disturb the harmony of the will; but that John McMasters, the grandson, be required to pay in instalments, which will not in any way infringe upon his living \u2014 which, we believe, was evidently the iiftention of the testator.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-6\"><em>Shaler, Kirkpatrick </em>&amp; <em>Mellon, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdO\">November 3d 1864,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b216-8\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYy\">\u2014 We cannot adopt that construction of the will of John McMasters, Sr., for which the complainant contends. It is too plain for controversy that the legacy given to William Larimer, Jr., was charged exclusively upon those rents, issues, and profits of the land devised to John McMasters the second, which might accrue during his life. Neither expressly nor by any possible implication was it charged upon the fee devised in remainder to the defendant, John McMasters the third. The will gave the lands to trustees named to hold in trust to permit the testator\u2019s son John to have and receive the rents, issues, and profits thereof during his natural life, for his own and his family\u2019s support, without being subject to the power or control of his creditors, subject, however, to the payment of the sum of $7000, with its interest, to William Larimer, Jr., it being a debt due from the testator\u2019s son John to Larimer. The will then directed that this debt of $7000 should be paid by his said trustees and his son John out of the said rents, issues, and profits, in annual instalments of $1000 each, the first instalment to be paid at the expiration of one year after the testator\u2019s decease. The devise was in further trust to permit John, the son, to make such improvements as he might think proper, giving him power to manage the property, and to receive the rents for the uses and purposes aforesaid. The testator then devised the remainder, after the death of his son John, to John McMasters the third, the defendant, in fee simple. The legacy having been thus charged expressly upon the rents, issues, and profits of the life estate given to the first devisee, there is no room for an implication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>a charge upon the remainder. Even more, if there were any room for it, any implication of a charge would be repelled by what is expressed. It has been insisted by the appellant that the payment of the legacy was made subordinate to the support of John, the son of the testator, and to that of his family, and to the cost of the improvements which he might think proper to put upon the lands. Hence it is inferred that if the rents were not more than sufficient to support the devisee for life and his family, and also to make the improvements which he chose to make, the legacy must be payable out of another fund; that is, out of the remainder devised to John McMasters the third. Neither this conclusion nor the premises upon which it is based can be maintained. Both are directly in conflict with the directions of the will. What was given to John the second, for his support and for improvements, was the rents, issues, and profits, subject to the payment of the legacy. It was not the legacy which was made servient, but the support and the improvements were directed to be secondary. Probably it was expected that the fund would prove sufficient for both. But every disposition which the testator made relative to the rents that might accrue during the continuance of the particular estate of his son, shows that only what should be left after meeting the claims of the legatee was given to the son. Thus the legacy was ordered to be paid in annual instalments of $1000 each, the first one year after the testator\u2019s death. How was it possible to meet this order if John the second had a right to appropriate the whole fund to his support, and to such improvements as he might choose to make ? Undoubtedly the testator was not unmindful of his son\u2019s necessities, and hence instead of making the whole legacy payable at once, he directed its payment in annual gales. But fixing the times of payment is irreconcilable with the position that either improvements or the support of the devisee for life were superior to the rights of the legatee; and the complainant\u2019s bill shows that-the fund, made subject to the payment of the legacy, was more than sufficient to pay it. The testator died in 1847, and the devisee for life in 1858, eleven years thereafter. During all those years the rents were applied to the support of the devisee and his family, besides $10,000 expended in improvements. It was a misapplication, but it will not justify a resort to the remainder devised to the defendant, upon which' the legacy was not charged. The legatee can look only to the estate of John McMasters, Jr. For these reasons the court was right in sustaining the demurrer, and dismissing the bill as against the demurrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We need not therefore consider the other question raised by the demurrer, namely, the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The bill as against the trustees was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
