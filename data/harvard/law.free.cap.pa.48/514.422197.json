Hence, where a partner in two firms drew and endorsed in the name of one of them a note payable to its own order, and then added the endorsement of the other firm, the fact that the note and endorsements were all in the handwriting of that partner is not an indication of such a want of good faith, as to make it the duty of the bank discounting it, to inquire into his authority for this act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-13\">Error to the District Court of <em>Philadelphia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-14\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>by The Consolidation Bank against August C. Miller and John P. Persch, late partners trading as Miller &amp; Persch. The plaintiff declared .on a promissory no.te for $6500, dated Philadelphia, August 29th 1863, at two months, signed Miller &amp; Persch, payable to their own order. Endorsed, Miller &amp; Persch, and Persch &amp; Steeb.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-15\">To this the defendant Miller filed an affidavit of defence, in which he averred that neither he nor the said firm of Miller &amp; Persch received any value for or on account of the note of which a copy is filed in this case; that the said note was made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>signed by John P. Persch, then a member of the firm of Miller &amp; Persch, without the knowledge, consent, or subsequent ratification of the affiant; that the said note was then endorsed by the said John P. Persch in the name of Miller &amp; Persch, and Persch &amp; Steeb, and taken by the said John P. Persch to the plaintiffs, by whom it was discounted for the said Persch &amp; Steeb and carried to their credit, and the proceeds were drawn out by the check of the said John P. Persch in the name of Persch .&amp; Steeb, and appropriated to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">That the plaintiffs knew well the handwriting of the said John P.

Mon. 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">If the action be brought by a subsequent endorsee against the partnership, and defendants show that the note was executed in fraud of the firm, as between the partner executing it and the payee, this will throw the burden of proof Upon the plaintiff to show that he came by the note fairly and without knowledge of the fraud: 1 Parsons on Bills 128; Monroe <em>v. </em>Cooper, 5 Pick. 412; Bank <em>v. </em>Gilliland, 23 Wend. 311; Bank <em>v. </em>Cameron, 7 Barb. 143; 3 Kent 42,* Ed. 1851.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">In England it has been held otherwise in some cases.

The affidavit of defence upon which the question arises does not allege that the bank discounted the note under any unusual circumstances, or with any notice of the alleged fraudulent use of the name of Miller &amp; Persch for the individual benefit of each. The only fact to show want of good faith is, that the note and endorsement are in the handwriting of Persch, which was known to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">One who is a member of several firms has presumptively the same power in each that his partners have. To say he cannot draw and endorse the same paper, as the representative of different firms, is simply to negative his power to act in the second firm because he has acted in the first. Having in each the power of a partner presumptively as to the public, and acting in that apparent right, it is no ground of suspicion that his endorsement of the name of one firm is in bad faith to the other as makers of the note. The case of Tanner <em>v. </em>Hall and Easton, 1 Barr 417, differs widely from this. There Hall drew his separate note for his own accommodation to the order of another firm, who endorsed it. Then he endorsed the name of his own firm, and procured it to be discounted. It was held that the form of the note and the circumstances sufficiently indicated to the bank that the note was for his individual accommodation, and thus put the bank upon notice. But here there is nothing out of the usual course of business, and nothing in the face of the paper to indicate that the note was not drawn by the firm of Miller &amp; Persch, in their usual course of business, in a partnership transaction with Persch &amp; Steeb. The bank taking it of Persch &amp; Steeb in good faith cannot be affected by the naked fact, that the handwriting of the note and of the endorsement was that of Persch the common partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
