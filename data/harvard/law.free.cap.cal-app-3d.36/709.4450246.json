His license, and all right to renew or reinstate it, were ordered revoked by the state\u2019s Real Estate Commissioner under the authority of Business and Professions Code section 10177, subdivison (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Section 10177, subdivision (b), authorizes such a revocation when a licensee has entered a plea of guilty to \u201ca felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">The record on which the commissioner\u2019s order was based established the following. Jennings pleaded guilty to a charge of violating Penal Code section 288 a, proscribing oral copulation of the mouth of one person with the sexual organ of another. He was thereafter placed on conditional probation. The subject of the offense was an 8-year-old daughter of Jennings with whom he had committed such offenses over a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">The instant appeal is from a superior court judgment denying Jennings\u2019 petition for a writ of mandate by which he sought to set aside the commissioner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The threshold question presented to us is whether the offense to which Jennings pleaded guilty was a \u201cfelony or a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Certainly the offense was a felony. It was punishable by imprisonment in the state prison and it was not reduced to a misdemeanor by any act of the court. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 288a and 17, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">An accepted definition of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is \u201c \u2018an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Higbie, 6 </em>Cal.3d 562, 569 [99 Cal.Rptr. 865, 493 P.2d 97].) Under this definition Jennings\u2019 conduct with his daughter clearly was a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude.\u201d The commissioner made such a finding.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Jennings\u2019 main reliance is on certain language of <em>Tushner </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 71, 76 [33 Cal.Rptr. 247], as follows; \u201cIn order for the Real Estate Commissioner to have jurisdiction to revoke a real estate broker\u2019s license, the licensee must have been guilty of misconduct connected with his activities as a real estate broker. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">But <em>Tushner </em>v. <em>Savage </em>assigned as authority for its holding, <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>184 Cal.App.2d 18, 26 [7 Cal.Rptr. 328] [cert. den. 366 U.S. 910 (6 L.Ed.2d 235, 81 S.Ct. 1086)], and <em>Schomig </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>189 Cal. 596, 598 [209 P. 550]. Those authorities dealt with statutes not at issue in <em>Tushner </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>or in the case before us. They concerned Business and Professions Code section 10176 and its predecessor statute (Stats. 1919, ch. 605, \u00a7 12, p. 1256), which provided for licensee discipline <em>for acts done in the capacity of a licensee. </em>In such situations, it necessarily followed that jurisdiction attached only when the licensee\u2019s acts were \u201cconnected with [their] activities as real estate [licensees].\u201d And we note that <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Savage, supra, </em>made it clear (p. 31) that section 10177, with which we are here concerned, \u201callows disciplinary action against real estate brokers for their conduct in other fields of endeavor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Other California cases have held that the Real Estate Commissioner\u2019s licensees may be disciplined for <em>misconduct unrelated to their activities as such licensees. </em>License revocation has been upheld, as to such unrelated activities, where the licensee was guilty of \u201cpersonal dishonesty\u201d <em>(Small </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Cal.App.3d 450 [94 Cal.Rptr. 136]); fraud in obtaining personal loans <em>(Borror </em>v. <em>Department of Investment </em>(15 Cal.App.3d 531 [92 Cal.Rptr. 525]); violation of Corporate Securities Act <em>(Watkins </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commissioner, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 397 [6 Cal.Rptr. 191]); and improper acts before issuance of the license <em>(Grand </em>v. <em>Griesinger, </em>160 Cal.App.2d 397 [325 P.2d 475]; <em>Karrell </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 769, 775-776 [254 P.2d 651]; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Scudder, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 433, 437 [168 P.2d 990]).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Similar determinations have been made as to state licensees in other fields of endeavor. Thus, an attorney was suspended upon his plea of guilty to violating the federal marijuana transfer tax law, i.e., smuggling marijuana <em>(In re Higbie, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 562), and a teacher\u2019s credentials were revoked for homosexual conduct in a public restroom <em>(Moser </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Education, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 988 [101 Cal.Rptr. 86]).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Apart from <em>Tushner </em>v. <em>Savage, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 71, which we find not to be controlling, Jennings places his principal reliance on <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>1 Cal.3d 214 [82 Cal.Rptr. 175, 461 P.2d 375], <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>5 Cal.3d 656 [97 Cal.Rptr. 320, 488 P.2d 648] [cert. den. 404 U.S. 1038 (30 L.Ed.2d 729, 92 S.Ct. 710)], <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>68 Cal.2d 67 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553], <em>Comings </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Education, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 94 [100 Cal.Rptr. 73, 47 A.L.R.3d, 742], and <em>Mindel </em>v. <em>United States Civil Service Commission, </em>312 F.Supp. 485. But we find these authorities also to be inapposite. In none, <em>except </em>perhaps <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>was the subject charged under a statute, as here, authorizing discipline upon conviction of \u201ca felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Municipal Court\u2019s </em>holding rested principally on First Amendment considerations not present here. The court, however, did say (p. 663); \u201cEven in the absence of First Amendment considerations, an ordinance regulating the right to engage in a lawful occupation or business [there, bookselling] must, bear a rational relationship to a valid governmental purpose. . . .\u201d But there is \u201ca valid governmental purpose\u201d in limiting licensees of the Real Estate Commission to persons with the qualifications of honesty, truthfulness and <em>good </em>- <em>reputation (Riley </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>181 Cal. 589, 593-594 [185 P. 855, 8 A.L.R. 418]), or as we said in <em>Borror </em>v. <em>Department of Investment, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 531, 540 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>[92 Cal.Rptr. 525], those who are not \u201cdishonest, <em>immoral, disreputable, </em>or incompetent.\u201d By any standard, in the perpetration of the crime to which Jennings pleaded guilty, he showed traits of \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d \u201cimmorality,\u201d and \u201cdisreputability.\u201d The facts here are vastly different from those of <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 214, which is heavily emphasized by Jennings. In that case, the court voided discipline of a schoolteacher who in a time of \u201csevere emotional stress\u201d engaged with another in a private \u201climited, <em>non-criminal </em>physical relationship . . . described as being of a homosexual nature.\u201d (Italics added; pp. 218-219; see also fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Also relevant to our problem is the case of <em>Otash </em>v. <em>Bureau of Private Investigators, </em>230 Cal.App.2d 568 [41 Cal.Rptr. 263]. There another statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7551, subd. (d)), in the identical language of the statute with which we are here concerned (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10177, subd. (b)), permitted revocation of a private investigator\u2019s license upon his conviction of \u201ca felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d It was held (p. 574) that upon proof of such a conviction \u201cno further showing of a lack of fitness of a licensee is required. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the superior court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Business and Professions Code section 117 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, in a proceeding conducted by a board within the department pursuant to law to deny an application for a license or to suspend or revoke a license or otherwise take disciplinary action against a person who holds a license, upon the ground that the applicant or the licensee has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, the record of conviction of the crime shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the conviction occurred, but only of that fact, and the board may inquire into the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime in order to fix the degree of discipline or to determine if the conviction is of an offense involving moral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
