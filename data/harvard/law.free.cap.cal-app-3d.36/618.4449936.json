J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1A\">Appellants Turell, and others, appeal an order quashing a writ of execution and vacating a levy on property of respondent Basic Investments, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">On 20 August 1970 appellants leased to respondent for one year a building and lot at 915 W. 5th Street, Azusa, at a rental of $3,450 a month payable in advance. Respondent deposited $6,900 as security for performance of the terms of the lease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent later exercised an option to renew the lease for the period 20 August 1971 to 19 August 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Respondent failed to pay the rent due on 20 August 1971. Appellants gave notice to pay rent or quit, and when payment was not made they filed an unlawful detainer action on 17 September 1971. Their complaint sought forfeiture of the lease, restitution and possession of the premises, damages of $3,450 for rent due and of $115 for each day respondent should continue in possession after 19 September 1971, plus interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. On 19 October 1971 the trial court granted appellants\u2019 motion to strike respondent\u2019s answer, to enter summary judgment, and to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Thereafter respondent\u2019s motion to be relieved from forfeiture of the lease was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Respondent remained in possession of the leased premises until 7 December 1971. A judgment was finally signed on 21 December 1971 and entered the next day, which provided the following relief for appellants: \u201c1. Possession of the premises ... 2. The sum of $6,900.00; and 3. Attorneys\u2019 fees in the sum of $750.00 . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">On 28 July 1972 appellants obtained a writ of execution on the judgment and levied on \u201cAll property of the Defendant, Basic Investments, Inc., d.b.a. Premier Shelter of California, located at 1922 Barranca, Santa Ana, California.\u201d Respondent moved to quash the writ of execution and vacate the levy on the ground it was entitled to offset against the judgment the security deposit of $6,900. On 19 September 1972 the court granted respondent\u2019s motion and quashed the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In our view the court erred in quashing the writ and vacating the levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">First, all intendments favor the validity of the original judgment, and it is readily inferable that the court\u2019s judgment of 21 December 1971 had already given respondent credit for its security deposit. Respondent remained in actual possession of the property until 7 December 1971. Its obligation to pay rent continued until the lease was terminated by the judgment of forfeiture signed on 21 December. (See <em>Dorcich </em>v. <em>Time Oil Co., 103 </em>Cal.App.2d 677, 683-684 [230 P.2d 10].) Thus, by the date of the judgment, respondent owed four months rent, $13,800. The court was entitled to allocate the amount of the security deposit ($6,900) against particular amounts of rent due and enter judgment for the unpaid balance, as for example, to allocate the $6,900 deposit to rent due in October and November, and enter judgment of $6,900 for rent due in August and September. <em>(Wickstrom </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>86 Cal.App. 651, 656 [261 P. 326]; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Swiryn, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 619, 630 [213 P.2d 740]; <em>Garfinkle </em>v. <em>Montgomery, 113 </em>Cal.App.2d 149, 153, 157 [248 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>52].) In the absence of any findings to the contrary we are entitled to infer that the trial court made such an allocation in arriving at the amount of its judgment. Accordingly, to permit respondent to offset the security deposit against the amount of the judgment would allow it two credits where only one was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Second, even if we assume that respondent was entitled to offset the security deposit against the amount of the judgment, the security deposit of $6,900 did not fully offset the amount of the judgment, which was for $7,650 and costs ($6,900 plus $750 attorneys\u2019 fees). Clearly, appellants were entitled to execute on their judgment until the judgment was fully satisfied. (33 C.J.S., Executions, \u00a7 143(e), p. 328; <em>Homans </em>v. <em>Tyng, </em>56 App.Div. 383 [67 N.Y.S. 792, 794]; <em>Pflanz </em>v. <em>Pflanz, </em>237 Mo.App. 873 [177 S.W.2d 631, 636]; see also, <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Loucks, </em>38 Cal. 372, 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The appeal from the minute order is dismissed. The order quashing the writ of execution and vacating the levy on respondent\u2019s property is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Compton, J., and Beach, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 5, 1974.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\">The lease provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\"><em>\u201cArticle 5. </em>Security Deposit</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">\u201cLessee has deposited with Lessors the sum of Six Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($6,900) as security for the performance by Lessee of the terms of this Lease.
