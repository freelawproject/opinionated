A.), J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOd\">County of Fresno employees are covered by the provisions of the 1937 County Employees Retirement Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31450 et seq.), including, as of January 1, 1970, safety membership by certain persons employed by the sheriff\u2019s office. Set forth in the margin are three sections of the Government Code germane to the determination of persons who fall in the category of safety members.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>In addition to other distinctions from persons in the regular public service, an employee who is classified as a safety member is entitled to earlier eligibility for retirement (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 31662.4, 31671) and a person who is older than 35 years at the time he is hired cannot be initially employed as a safety member. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Respondents are two persons employed in the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s office with a civil service classification of Identification Technician II. The appellant, Board of Retirement of the County of Fresno (hereinafter \u201cBoard of Retirement\u201d), after a hearing denied their applications for classification as safety members for the purposes of the retirement law. Respondents thereupon petitioned the superior court in administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 for review of the Board of Retirement\u2019s decision. The cause was submitted to the lower court upon the record of proceedings before the Board of Retirement. The court granted a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the Board of Retirement to declare respondents to be safety members. The Board of Retirement has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Findings of fact and conclusions of law were not requested and were thereby waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Attached as Appendix \u201cA\u201d is the job description of Identification Technician II, and as Appendix \u201cB\u201d are the descriptions of duties actually performed by respondents Neeley and Barnes, respectively, as they set them forth in a county-wide classification survey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Both respondents were initially employed as deputies sheriff, Barnes in 1942 and Neeley in 1949. Each was sworn as a deputy sheriff and each carried a badge. Each became involved in criminal identification work and each attained the rank of sergeant. In 1963 their civil service classification was changed from sergeant to Identification Technician II. However, despite that change, each remains sworn as a deputy sheriff and each continues to carry a badge and identification card as a deputy sheriff, though their duties as identification technician have continued unaffected by the change in classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Their work is done inside, it not being necessary to go outside to gather evidence which they analyze and classify. Their work is highly technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>and each has been graduated from numerous training schools. Their job description does not require that they come in personal contact with the prisoners, and in fact they rarely do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Though respondents cannot be put back into patrol cars on a permanent basis absent a complete reclassification, they are required to take the same physical examination as safety members, and they are subject to 24-hour emergency call and have to qualify each year with handguns, rifles, shotguns, batons and other weapons. Respondents have been called out in emergencies in the past, such as the 1968 Fresno riots and the July 4, 1970, riots in Yosemite when \u201cbus loads of hippies\u201d were brought in from Yosemite for booking.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In reviewing the decision of the Board of Retirement by administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, the trial court and this court are bound by the substantial evidence rule <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 149 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; <em>Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 575, 592 fn. 11 [100 Cal.Rptr. 16, 493 P.2d 480]), the function of the trial and appellate courts being to determine if the record is free from legal error <em>(Griggs </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 93, 96 [37 Cal.Rptr. 194, 389 P.2d 722]). In this instance, however, as the trial judge noted, there was no substantial conflict in the evidence regarding the duties of the respondents and the relationship of those duties to law enforcement. Accordingly, the proper interpretation of the statutory language is a question of law for the court and we are not constricted in this regard by the conclusions of the trial court. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 310; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 17 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839], cert, den., 365 U.S. 823 [5 L.Ed. 2d 700, 81 S.Ct. 708]; <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 567, 576-577 [108 Cal.Rptr. 293]; <em>Noroian </em>v. <em>Department of Administration </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 651, 654 [89 Cal.Rptr. 889].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In construing the statute, the primal principle of statutory construction requires the ascertainment of the intent of the legislative body. <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].) When, as here, there is no direct evidence of the legislative intent, the court turns first to the words of the enactment for the answer' and may also rely upon extrinsic aids. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182-183 [217 P.2d 1], cert, den., 340 U.S. 879 [95 L.Ed. 639, 71 S.Ct. 117]; <em>In re Miller </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 191, 198-199 [187 P.2d 722].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Referring to the applicable statutory provisions (see fn. 1, <em>supra), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>it is readily apparent that the key phrase is \u201cactive law enforcement.\u201d Section 31469.3, subdivision (b), uses the phrase in defining a safety member, and section 31470.3 excludes deputies sheriff<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whose \u201cprincipal duties clearly do not fall within the scope of active law enforcement, even though such a person is subject to occasional call, or is occasionally called upon, to perform duties within the scope of active law enforcement . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The Board of Retirement decided respondents are not engaged in active law enforcement, and the trial court held they are.  Great weight should be given to the administrative interpretation of the Board of Retirement unless clearly erroneous. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31470.8; <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 132, 140 [98 Cal.Rptr. 281, 490 P.2d 793].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">At the time the learned trial judge rendered his decision he did not have the benefit of any judicial guidance. This court, however, is more fortunate in that two recent cases have interpreted the phrase \u201cactive law enforcement\u201d in connection with analogous provisions in other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 567, the court interpreted the meaning of the phrases \u201cactive law enforcement\u201d and \u201cwhose functions do not clearly fall within the scope of active law enforcement service\u201d under the Public Employees Retirement System (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 20019, 20020). In that case the respondent employees were animal control officers whose principal duties involved the enforcement of state and local laws pertaining to the licensing control and maintenance of animals. In performing these duties, they sometimes used marked police vehicles with police radios and were occasionally called on to serve as backup units at the scenes of crimes. They were issued identification cards and badges, wore policemen\u2019s uniforms and were required to carry and be trained in the use of firearms. After a hearing, the Board of Retirement determined that they were not entitled to safety member status and accordingly had them reclassified into \u201cmiscellaneous membership.\u201d They sought a writ of mandate in the superior court. The writ was granted and the board appealed. The court of appeal reversed, holding that the applicants\u2019 principal duties did not fall within the scope of active law enforcement. The court stated: \u201cThe provision of a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>category of retirement membership for policemen relates to the hazardous nature of their occupation. [Citation.] The phrase \u2018active law enforcement service\u2019 as used in section 20020 was no doubt intended to mean law enforcement services normally performed by policemen. As the Attorney General has suggested, it means the active enforcement and suppression of crimes and the arrest and detention of criminals. [Citation.] In a loose sense animal control officers are engaged in active law enforcement but so are a myriad of other public employees such as building inspectors, health officers, welfare fraud investigators and the like but their duties can hardly be said to constitute \u2018active law enforcement service\u2019 as contemplated by the statute. The crimes with which policemen normally deal are those against persons and property and not violations of police regulations. Petitioners\u2019 duties as animal control officers cannot be said to \u2018clearly fall within the scope of active law enforcement service\u2019 as that term is used in section 20020. The board\u2019s determination that petitioners were improperly classified as local safety members must be upheld.\u201d (32 Cal.App.3d at pp. 578-579; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 780 [101 Cal.Rptr. 353], a correctional officer at the county jail applied for disability benefits as a safety member under Labor Code section 4850. That section, like the ones here involved, excluded employees whose principal duties \u201cdo not clearly come within the scope of active law enforcement service. . . .\u201d It was uncontroverted that the applicant\u2019s principal duties involved the supervision of inmates, the detection of criminal activities within the facility, the confiscation of contraband materials, the arresting of criminal offenders inside the facility, prevention of escapes and related functions which put him in daily, continuous contact with the prisoners. The court held that the applicant\u2019s duties were well within the scope of active law enforcement since his duties were as equally hazardous as those of regular policemen who serve the general public. In so holding, the court adopted the following language from 51 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 32, 34: \u201c \u2018The reason for such exceptional treatment for policemen and firemen is obvious: not only are their occupations particularly hazardous, but they undertake these hazards on behalf of the public. The Legislature undoubtedly sought to ensure that policemen and firemen would not be deterred from zealous performance of their mission of protecting the public by fear of loss of livelihood.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d The court then said: \u201cIt cannot be seriously contended that the supervision of prison inmates is any less hazardous than the supervision of the general public by policemen. Detection of criminal activity within the walls of a prison cannot be functionally distinguished from the detection of criminal activity in society. Fellow correctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>officers and prison inmates are entitled to the same expectation as the general public with respect to protection against criminal attack. It follows that correctional officers should not be deterred from zealous performance of their mission by fear of loss of livelihood. It would therefore serve the apparent intent of the Legislature ter find that plaintiff is entitled to the benefits provided by section 4850.\u201d (24 Cal.App.3d at p. 785.) (See also 22 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 227; 56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">These authorities are decisive of the principal issue in this case. While respondents\u2019 activities are related to and essential to law enforcement, they are not active law enforcement. Respondents are technical, administrative and support personnel for those officers who are on the firing line. Active law enforcement implies hazardous activity. Respondents\u2019 duties are not hazardous, do not place them in contact with prisoners on any regular basis and, aside from infrequent emergency service which is specifically excepted under section 31470.3, consist of classifying and researching fingerprints and photograph files and involvement in other highly technical identification techniques; These duties do not expose them to hazards from prisoner conduct or risks of injury from such sources or the necessity of being physically able to cope with potential dangers inherent in the arrest, detention and handling of prisoners. The age limitation for service as a safety member (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31662.4) clearly suggests a legislative intent that such members be young, agile and able to respond to violence and danger (see 56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 369, 372) and that their principal duties concern physically active work, such as the arrest and detention of criminals, which exposes such officers and employees to physical risk in the law enforcement field. (See 22 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 224, 229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We are not unmindful of the well-established rule that pension legislation, such as that here involved, should be liberally construed, resolving all ambiguities in favor of the applicant. <em>(Gorman </em>v. <em>Cranston </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 441, 444 [50 Cal.Rptr. 533, 413 P.2d 133]; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>City of Modesto </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 833, 840 [3 Cal.Rptr. 561, 350 P.2d 529]; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 508, 513 [86 Cal.Rptr. 569].) However, this rule of liberal construction is applied for the purpose of effectuating the obvious legislative intent <em>(McKeag </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Commrs. </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 386, 390 [132 P.2d 198]) and should not blindly be followed so as to eradicate the clear language and purpose of the statute and allow eligibility for those for whom it was obviously not intended. (See <em>Firemen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 765, 768 [336 P.2d 273]; <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 242, 244 [181 P.2d 687]; <em>Wade </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number><em>Board of Administration </em>(1945) 67 Cal.App.2d 745, 751 [155 P.2d 394]; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>McNichols </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 448, 452 [112 P.2d 675]; <em>Klench </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Fd. Commrs. </em>(1926) 79 Cal.App. 171, 187 [249 P. 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to deny respondents\u2019 petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Gargano, J., and Franson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 20, 1974.
