Latimer (deceased), against Joseph L. Connolly, Forde C. Seward, Mildred Louise Latimer (decedent\u2019s wife), Mike Kelber and Judith Ann Schloessmann (decedent\u2019s daughter), to determine the rights and obligations of the parties under a written agreement between Latimer, Connolly and Seward to share profits from the sale of two parcels of land owned by Latimer and Kelber. Defendants Connolly, Seward and Schloessmann cross-complained against the Bank and each other setting forth their respective contentions concerning the meaning and legal effect of the agreement. Basically, Connolly and Seward contended it was a joint venture or partnership agreement, was a valid profit sharing agreement, or that it constituted a valid gift. It was further their contention that defendant Kelber should be held to be a trustee for them for their share of the profits. Schloessmann contended that the agreement was invalid for lack of consideration, that it was unenforceable insofar as Seward was concerned because of his breach, and that Connolly was foreclosed from maintaining an action on the agreement because of alleged irregularities in the presentation of his creditor\u2019s claim against the estate. Mildred Latimer contended that Latimer\u2019s interest in the properties described in the profit-sharing agreement was community property and that the agreement was invalid as to her community interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Connolly and Seward had filed creditors\u2019 claims against the estate based upon the agreement. The claims were denied and each brought an action against the Bank as administrator of the estate. Pursuant to stipulation those two actions were consolidated with the declaratory relief action for purpose of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The court decided, in substance, that the profit sharing agreement was enforceable only as- \u201can assignment of an equitable interest\u201d in the profits, if any, from the sale of the lands and then only to the extent of the reasonable value of services rendered to Latimer by Connolly and Seward \u201cin connection with \u2018The Agreement,\u2019 \u201d such amount to be determined in future proceedings in the pending actions on the rejected creditors\u2019 claims. Separate but virtually identical findings, conclusions and judgments were entered in the three actions. Connolly and Seward filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in the declaratory relief action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but took no appeal from the judgments entered in the actions on the creditors\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Deferring for the moment a detailed review of the evidence as it pertains to specific issues, the facts and circumstances giving rise to the controversy between the parties may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Latimer had been a real estate broker in the City of Ontario for many years. Apart from his business interest, he was active in city affairs, having served as Councilman and Mayor of Ontario. He married Mildred Latimer on September 23, 1963, and they remained husband and wife until his death on January 5, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Connolly joined Latimer\u2019s real estate office in 1957 or 1958. During his association with Latimer, gross commissions from real estate sales were shared equally. Since Latimer used his office to handle business interests unrelated to real estate brokerage as well as to conduct his civic and political activities, he paid all office overhead. Seward joined the office in 1963. Thereafter commissions were divided equally among the three. Latimer continued to pay office overhead. All firm advertisements'were carried in the name of Latimer, Connolly and Seward and the office bore the sign \u201cLatimer, Connolly &amp; Seward Real Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Mike Kelber was a long-time friend and business associate of Latimer. They both had interests in the Ontario Savings and Loan Association and had been associated in real estate ventures. In 1964 Kelber and Latimer acquired a 10-acre parcel in the City of Upland referred to as the 7th and Mountain property and a 67.744-acre parcel adjacent to the Ontario Airport referred to as the airport property. Record title to the properties is in Kelber\u2019s name. The 7th and Mountain property was purchased with the proceeds of a $239,000 loan from United California Bank evidenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>an unsecured note signed by Kelber and Latimer. Acquisition of the airport property was financed by two loans from the United California Bank, one for $420,000 secured by the airport property and the other for $360,000 secured by property in Alta Loma acquired by Latimer and Kelber in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Connolly and Seward did not contribute any money toward the purchase of the properties but there was evidence that they rendered some service in connection with the acquisitions. The airport property had at one time been listed with Latimer\u2019s office but the owner later took it off the market. In August 1964 Kelber learned that the property was again on the market so he alerted Latimer who in turn instructed Connolly to contact the owner. Connolly and Seward made several extended trips to see the owner and \u201cbird dogged\u201d him as to the price. With respect to the 7th and Mountain property, Connolly learned from friends in Minnesota that the first trust deed held by a Minneapolis lending institution was for sale. He called Kelber\u2019s and Latimer\u2019s attention to the availability of the trust deed and recommended its purchase. Kelber and Latimer bought the trust deed and obtained title to the property by foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The escrow on the 7th and Mountain property closed in August 1964 and the one on the airport property on or about October 5, 1964. On October 6, 1964, Latimer, Connolly and Seward entered into the profit sharing agreement which is the subject of this litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">According to Connolly, Latimer had discussed such an agreement for years, stating he was grateful for all that Connolly and Seward had done for him and wanted to help them; one of the reasons for the agreement was to induce Connolly and Seward to remain and run the real estate business; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Latimer came into the office one morning with a handwritten draft of the proposed agreement which he read to Connolly and Seward and instructed them to take it to Bernard Kelber, Latimer\u2019s attorney; Bernard Kelber prepared the agreement in its final form and Connolly and Seward met Latimer at the Ontario Savings &amp; Loan Association where the three signed. Bernard Kelber\u2019s testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the agreement was only slightly at variance with Connolly\u2019s version. Bernard Kelber testified that Connolly and Seward came to his office stating that Latimer sent them over to have the profit sharing agreement prepared; Kelber telephoned Latimer and prepared the agreement in accordance with Latimer\u2019s instructions. Kelber had previously heard Latimer discuss such an agreement and was familiar with its background.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Connolly testified that prior to the October 6 agreement, he, Latimer and Seward had discussed buying and selling land for capital gains tax advantage, Latimer to furnish the capital and Connolly and Seward their skills, and that they had looked at specific properties, including property at Morro Bay, as possible investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Connolly testified that he and Seward were expected to promote the sale of the properties described in the agreement; the two discussed with Latimer and Kelber possible sales and the strategy to be pursued; he (Connolly) made trips to eastern cities at his own expense to interest airlines in the airport property and Seward assisted in the preparation of sales brochures to present to prospective purchasers; he and Seward made attempts to interest chain stores and other potential buyers in the 7th and Mountain property.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">During Connolly\u2019s association with Latimer, it was understood that Connolly would \u2018work on sales of properties owned by Latimer and his family without commission. Connolly testified that after Seward joined the firm, Latimer decided they should receive commissions for sale of Latimer properties but that, with one exception, they received no commissions for such sales and that after the October 6 agreement, he and Seward gave up substantial commissions on sales of Latimer properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">After the October 6 agreement, Connolly and Seward borrowed large sums from the United California Bank; Connolly borrowed approximately $81,000 and Seward $63,000. In each instance the loan was arranged by and guaranteed by Latimer. The proceeds were used personally by Seward and by Connolly; none of the funds went to the real estate firm. Connolly testified that neither he nor Seward would have borrowed the monies had it not been for the anticipated profits from the profit sharing agreement and Latimer\u2019s repeated assurances that there was going.to be plenty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>money for all concerned. Connolly also testified that because of the October 6 agreement, both he and Seward turned down attractive offers to go with other realty firms, but on cross-examination stated he felt he was under no legal obligation to remain with Latimer and that even had he left he would have still been entitled to the benefits of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">After the October 6 agreement, Latimer spent very little time on his real estate business. Mike Kelber testified that when Latimer delivered a copy of the October 6 agreement to him, he told Kelber the agreement assured him his real estate office would be maintained whether he was there or not. A few months before Latimer\u2019s death, Kelber visited him at the hospital. Latimer told Kelber that upon his release from the hospital he was going to close his real estate office and requested Kelber to inform Connolly and Seward to make arrangements to affiliate with some other realty firm. At that meeting the subject of the October 6 agreement was again discussed. Latimer told Kelber he \u201cknew what he was doing and this was precisely what he wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Seward left Latimer in- October 1968 shortly after he was informed of Latimer\u2019s plan to close the office. Connolly remained until Latimer\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In July 1968 the City of Ontario commenced eminent domain proceedings to acquire 20.014 acres of the airport property. The matter went to trial and the jury fixed just compensation at $1,150,000.\u00ae In Kelber\u2019s opinion the value of the entire airport property (including the part condemned) was $3,590,000 and the 7th and Mountain property $500,000, making the total value of the two parcels $4,090,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The trial court impliedly rejected the various theories advanced by Connolly and Seward respecting the enforceability of the profit sharing agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It concluded that profits to be derived from the sale of the lands were \u201ca mere possibility, not coupled with an interest\u201d and that the agreement was enforceable \u201conly on the theory of assignment of an equitable interest and then only to the extent there was \u2018adequate consideration.\u2019 \u201d It then found that \u201cConnolly and Seward rendered \u2018adequate consideration\u2019 to decedent Latimer\u201d in certain itemized particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Based upon the findings and conclusions, the court decreed that Connolly and Seward were each \u201centitled to that perc\u00e9ntage of one-third (VS) of decedent Latimer\u2019s share of the net profits to be derived from the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of the real properties referred to in \u2018The Agreement,\u2019 which equals, in value, the value of the services rendered by him, as itemized . . . above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The court further decreed that defendant Kelber was not responsible, as trustee or otherwise, to Connolly and Seward for their share of the profits under the profit sharing agreement; that Connolly\u2019s and Seward\u2019s rights could only be asserted as contingent claims against the estate of Latimer; that the \u201cvalue of the services rendered\u201d by Connolly and Seward \u201cas itemized above\u201d shall be determined in their pending actions on the rejected creditors\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The court found that Latimer\u2019s interest in the properties described in the profit sharing agreement constituted community property of Latimer and his wife and prescribed a formula for charging their respective community interests for any amounts to which Connolly and Seward would be entitled under the profit sharing agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Connolly and Seward appeal from the judgment. They contend the court erred (1) in concluding the profit sharing agreement was only enforceable as an equitable assignment in that (a) the evidence established as a matter of law the existence of a partnership or joint venture relationship between Latimer, Connolly and Seward, (b) the agreement was enforceable on the theory of promissory estoppel, (c) the agreement was a valid profit sharing agreement enforceable according to its terms; (2) in concluding that their rights under, the agreement can only be asserted as contingent claims against the estate of Latimer; (3) in concluding that Kelber was not.a trustee for their benefit for their share of the profits; and (4) in failing to decree the agreement enforceable in full as to Mrs. Latimer\u2019s community interest in the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The Bank (as administrator) and Judith Ann Schloessmann respond that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the evidence fails to support any of the theories of enforceability advanced by Connolly and Seward and that the court correctly concluded the agreement was only enforceable as an equitable assignment and then only to the extent of any \u201cadequate consideration\u201d flowing from Connolly and Seward to Latimer. They further urge that the present appeal has become moot because the judgments entered in the actions on the rejected creditors\u2019 claims from which no appeal has been taken are now final.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Mildred Latimer contends that while the court properly found that Latimer\u2019s interest in the property was community, it should have decreed that the profit sharing agreement constituted an attempted transfer by the husband of an interest in community real property and as such was enforceable, if at all, only as to Latimer\u2019s community interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Defendant Mike Kelber filed responsive pleadings in the court below but has not filed a brief on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The threshold issue pertains to the effect of the failure to appeal from the judgments entered in the actions on the rejected creditors\u2019 claims. The Bank suggests that the finality of those judgments renders the present appeal moot since they resolved the same issues presented in the instant declaratory relief action. The contention is non-meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The actions on the creditors\u2019 claims were consolidated for trial with the declartory relief action on the representation that the issues were the same in all three cases. The same findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgments were entered in each case.  Where two lawsuits are ordered consolidated for trial and actually tried together, there should be but one set of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment, and if duplicate sets have been entered in each case, they will be considered for all purposes as but one. <em>(Bechtold </em>v. <em>Bishop &amp; Co., Inc., </em>16 Cal.2d 285, 287 [105 P.2d 984]; <em>Israel </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>163 Cal.App.2d 806, 820 [330 P.2d 83]; <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Beatty, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 392, 398 [257 P.2d 1017]; <em>Clinton </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 815, 821 [183 P.2d 50].)  The appeal from the judgment in the declaratory relief action must, therefore, be treated as an appeal from the duplicate judgments entered in the actions on the creditors\u2019 claims. (Cf. <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Beatty, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 392, 398.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">On the merits, we first consider the contention that the court erred in failing to find that the agreement created a partnership or joint venture relationship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Although a partnership ordinarily involves a continuing business, whereas a joint venture is usually formed for a specific transaction or a single series of transactions, the incidents of both relationships are the same in all essential respects. (3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (7th ed. 1960) pp. 2271-2272.)  A joint venture exists where there is an \u201cagreement between the parties under which they have a community of interest, that is, a joint interest, in a common business undertaking, an understanding as to the sharing of profits and losses, and a right of joint control.\u201d <em>(Holtz </em>v. <em>United Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>49 Cal.2d 501, 506-507 [319 P.2d 617]; <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Great Western Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., 69 </em>Cal.2d 850, 863 [73 Cal.Rptr. 369, 447 P.2d 609, 39 A.L.R.3d 224].)  An essential element of a partnership or joint venture is the right of joint participation in the management and control of the business. <em>(Spier </em>v. <em>Lang, 4 </em>Cal.2d 711, 716 [53 P.2d 138].) Absent such right, the mere fact that one party is to receive benefits in consideration of services rendered or for capital contribution does not, as a matter of law, make him a partner or joint venturer. <em>(Spier </em>v. <em>Lang, supra; Zorich </em>v. <em>Petroff, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 806, 810 [313 P.2d 118]; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Societa di Unione etc. Italiana, </em>62 Cal.App.2d 842, 848 [145 P.2d 694].)  An agreement by a landowner to share with another profits to be derived from the sale of land does not, without more, create a partnership or joint venture relationship. <em>(Fritz </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>8 Cal.2d 68, 70-71 [63 P.2d 291]; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Wilson, 94 </em>Cal.App.2d 286, 291-292 [210 P.2d 526]. See <em>Coward </em>v. <em>Clanton, </em>122 Cal. 451, 454 [55 P. 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Whether a partnership or joint venture exists is primarily a factual question to be determined by the trier of fact from the evidence and inferences to be drawn therefrom. <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Abraham, </em>29 Cal.2d 745, 750 [177 P.2d 931]; <em>Spier </em>v. <em>Lang, supra, 4 </em>Cal.2d 711, 716; <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Stahl, </em>176 Cal.App.2d 53, 57 [1 Cal.Rptr. 143].)  While there was evidence in the case at bench that Latimer, Connolly and Seward may have enjoyed a partnership or joint venture relationship with respect to the real estate brokerage business, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s implied finding that the relationship did not extend to investment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>properties covered by the profit sharing agreement. During their years of association, Latimer, Connolly and Seward had never been involved in such a joint undertaking. Kelber, with whom Latimer acquired the properties, was not a partner in or otherwise associated with Latimer\u2019s real estate business; the capital and all other expenses for the acquisition of the properties were furnished by Kelber and Latimer and they alone were to share any losses. Finally, on the evidence adduced, the court was justified in finding that the essential element of <em>right </em>to joint control was absent. Although Connolly testified he and Seward discussed marketing strategy with Kelber and Latimer, the court could have reasonably inferred that the two were invited to participate in those discussions, not because they had a voice in management decisions concerning the properties, but because they were expected to provide their skills and services in promoting the sale of the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">There was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s implied rejection of the partnership and joint venture theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The contention that the agreement was enforceable as a matter of law on the theory of promissory estoppel must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts states: \u201cA promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\u201d The doctrine as expressed in the Restatement is the law of this state. <em>(Drennan </em>v. <em>Star Paving Co., </em>51 Cal.2d 409 [333 P.2d 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Connolly and Seward contend the detriment suffered in reliance on Latimer\u2019s promise consisted of borrowing large sums from the Bank and foregoing lucrative offers to join other realty firms. The borrowed funds, however, were for the personal use of Connolly and Seward. The record does not disclose what they did with the proceeds of the loans, but the fact, if it be a fact, that the funds were lost through imprudent investments or speculation cannot be attributed to Latimer\u2019s promise. While Connolly testified to attractive offers from other realty firms, the evidence was conflicting whether his financial position would have been enhanced by accepting the offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Generally, whether estoppel exists is a factual question and ordinarily the determination of the trier of fact is binding on appeal unless the contrary conclusion is the only reasonable one to be drawn from the facts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>(Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>62 Cal.2d 250, 266 [42 Cal.Rptr. 89, 398 P.2d 129]; <em>Landberg </em>v. <em>Landberg, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 742, 759 [101 Cal.Rptr. 335]; <em>In re Mercantile Guaranty Co., </em>263 Cal.App.2d 346, 356 [69 Cal.Rptr. 361].)  The burden is on the one asserting estoppel to prove its essential elements, \u201cleaving nothing to surmise or questionable inference.\u201d <em>(Landberg </em>v. <em>Landberg, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 742, 759.)  On the record, there was no estoppel as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We proceed to the central issue on this appeal and that is whether the agreement was a valid profit sharing agreement enforceable according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In his memorandum opinion, the trial judge held that the profit to be derived from the sale of the lands was a \u201cmere possibility, not coupled with an interest\u201d and non-transferable at law and that consequently the agreement was only enforceable as an equitable assignment and \u201cthen only to the extent that there was adequate consideration for said assignment.\u201d He noted that evidence of consideration for the agreement was \u201cnot of the strongest,\u201d but stated: \u201c. . . There is no question, but that the decedent was satisfied with the pending business relationship wherein he was free to pursue his \u2018other\u2019 activities. Also it can be found that the decedent relied upon these individuals to actively promote his property as well as the property included in the agreement of October 6, 1964. To this extent then, the Court will find adequate consideration for the equitable assignment. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">At common law a mere possibility, such as the expectancy of an heir, was not regarded as such an existing interest as to be capable of sale or assignment. <em>(Bridge </em>v. <em>Kedon, </em>163 Cal. 493, 495 [126 P. 149]; <em>In re Garcelon, </em>104 Cal. 570, 584 [38 P. 414]; 4 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) \u00a7 1285, p. 819.) An expectancy or possibility, however, was deemed transferable when coupled with an interest, whether with real or personal estate. (4 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1285, p. 819.) The common law rules have been codified in California. Civil Code section 700 provides: \u201cA mere possibility, such as the expectancy of an heir apparent, is not to be deemed an interest of any kind.\u201d Civil Code section 1045 provides: \u201cA mere possibility, not coupled with an interest, cannot be transferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Although a mere possibility not coupled with an interest was nontransferable at common law, assignments of things which have no present existence but rest in possibility were treated as contracts which equity will enforce upon the happening of the contingency if the agreement was fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>made, supported by valuable consideration, and not against public policy. <em>(Bridge </em>v. <em>Kedon, supra, </em>163 Cal. 493, 498; <em>In re Garcelon, supra, </em>104 Cal. 570, 584; <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>Farmers etc. Nat. Bank, </em>14 Cal.App.2d 176, 179 [57 P.2d 1325]; 4 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1287, pp. 821, 822; Note 22 Cal.L.Rev. 446, 447. See <em>In re Goodson, </em>208 F.Supp. 837, 843-845.) Valuable consideration to support an assignment of an expectancy is the same as that required for the formation of a contract. (See <em>First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Pomona Title Mfg. Co., </em>82 Cal.App.2d 592, 603 [186 P.2d 693]; 6 C.J.S., \u00a770, pp. 1121-1123.) Despite Civil Code section 1045, courts in California have continued to enforce assignments of contingent expectancies. <em>(Dougherty </em>v. <em>California Kettleman, etc., 9 </em>Cal.2d 58, 89 [69 P.2d 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In holding that the profit sharing agreement in the case at bench was enforceable only as an equitable assignment, the court relied upon <em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Kedon, supra, </em>163 Cal. 493, 496, and <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>11 Cal.2d 356, 364 [79 P.2d 1059, 119 A.L.R. 71]. <em>Bridge </em>involved an assignment of the expectancy of an heir and <em>Kelly </em>an assignment by a beneficiary of a spendthrift trust of the corpus of the trust. The transferor in those cases had nothing more than a hope of acquiring funds or property in the future with no present interest in the source of the expectancy. But the right of a landowner to profits from the sale of his land is more than naked hope; it is an expectancy based upon his present ownership of the land. As stated in 4 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, <em>supra, </em>at page 820: \u201c. . . Of course, the mere hope of acquiring future property without any present source from which it may be obtained is neither an interest nor right, nor anything which has value or can be made the subject of legal relations. But when a party has entered into a contract or arrangement by the ordinary and legitimate and natural operation of which he will acquire property, his existing right thereunder is certainly not a <em>mere </em>naked hope; <em>it is </em>a possibility of acquiring property coupled with a legal interest in the contract.\u201d (Original italics.) Anticipated profits by a landowner from the sale of his land would thus appear to be an expectancy which would have been transferable at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">However, we need not pursue further the esoteric refinements of equitable assignments. In California the distinction between assignments of expectancies coupled with an interest and those which were formerly only enforceable in equity has largely been reduced to a matter of historical interest. <em>(H. S. Mann Corp. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 310, 318 [301 P.2d 28]; 5 Cal.Jur.2d, Assignments, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5. See <em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Kedon, supra, </em>163 Cal. 493, 497-498.) As stated in 5 California Jurisprudence, Second Edition, at page 375: \u201c[T]he formal separation of courts of law and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>equity has never prevailed in California; a single court enforces the substantive law derived from both sources; and the modern rules of practice and procedure have largely eliminated the distinctions which were of great importance in determining and enforcing assigned rights in an earlier period. Also, the modern law of assignments under which the assignability of intangible rights is taken for granted in the business and commercial world is in large part entirely of equitable origin; few modem assignments would have been enforceable in the law courts which originally had exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the common law....\u201d (Fns. ommitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Furthermore, the case at bench does not involve the validity of a present assignment of anticipated profits from the sale of the lands. We are not concerned with the question whether the claim of Connolly and Seward to profits from the land is entitled to priority over that of a creditor or other assignee of Latimer. The question before the court below was simply whether there was a valid profit sharing agreement according to normal contract principles. Agreements by landowners to share profits from the sale of their land in consideration of capital contribution or for services to be rendered have been held to be valid and enforceable according to their terms. <em>(Coward </em>v. <em>Clanton, supra, </em>122 Cal. 451, 454; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 286, 291. See <em>Bergson </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>300 Mass. 340 [15 N.E.2d 196, 198, 116 A.L.R. 951]; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Wylie </em>(9th Cir.) 242 F.2d 435, 445.) There is no suggestion that the agreement in question was unfairly made or that it is against public policy. If it was supported by valuable consideration and otherwise satisfied the legal requirements for the formation of a contract, it was valid and enforceable according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">One of the crucial issues below was whether there was valuable consideration for the agreement. However, we cannot determine from the findings how that issue was resolved. In composing the findings, counsel for prevailing parties lifted verbatim from the judge\u2019s memorandum opinion his informal comments on the evidence. The formal findings of fact (H 22) recite: \u201cConnolly and Seward rendered services to decedent Latimer in connection with \u2018The Agreement\u2019 limited to the following only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201ca) Decedent Latimer was satisfied with the pending business relationship between himself, Connolly and Seward wherein he was free to pursue his \u2018other\u2019 activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cb) Connolly and Seward, after the October 6, 1964, Agreement, at Latimer\u2019s request or with his approval, did almost all the active work in their association in the real estate business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u201cc) Decedent Latimer relied upon Connolly and Seward to actively promote his property and, in that connection, services rendered by Connolly and Seward to decedent Latimer relative to sales of decedent Latimer\u2019s properties prior to October 6, 1964, may be persuasive as to the nature of the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 services to be rendered in the future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">\u201cd) Decedent Latimer relied upon Connolly and Seward to promote the properties that are the subject matter of \u2018The Agreement.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cServices rendered by Connolly and Seward in connection with \u2018The Agreement,\u2019 are solely limited to the above. (Taken from Memorandum of Opinion, page 2, lines 5 through 14.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The \u201cConclusions of Law,\u201d state, inter alia, that Connolly and Seward \u201crendered \u2018adequate consideration\u2019 to decedent Latimer in connection with \u2018The agreement,\u2019 limited to the following: . . .,\u201d the \u201cfollowing\u201d being a repetition of the findings of fact pertaining to services rendered by Connolly and Seward.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The foregoing findings and conclusions on the issue of consideration lack the certainty essential to a proper review of the contentions of the parties.  Findings must be sufficiently definite and certain so that a reviewing court can arrive at a just determination of the merits of the appeal. <em>(Estate of Ramsey, </em>107 Cal.App.2d 372, 374-375 [237 P.2d 20].)  Connolly and Seward contend the evidence establishes the existence of valuable consideration for the agreement whereas respondents, despite the court\u2019s \u201cConclusion\u201d that there was \u201cadequate consideration\u201d to the extent \u201citemized\u201d by the findings, urge that there was no evidence of valuable consideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The resolution of the competing contentions turns on the court\u2019s findings and whether they are supported by the evidence. However, it is impossible to determine whether or not the court found valuable consideration for the agreement. The findings fail to reveal what promises, if any, were given in exchange for the agreement, whether and to what extent the promises were performed. For example: What is the significance of the finding that \u201cLatimer was satisfied with the pending business relationship between himself, Connolly and Seward wherein he was free to pursue his \u2018other\u2019 activities\u201d and of the finding that after October 6, 1964 the two, at Latimer\u2019s request or with his approval \u201cdid almost all the active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>work in their association in the real estate business\u201d? Did the court intend, by those findings, to find that a consideration for the agreement was the implied promise to remain with Latimer and assume all responsibility for the operation of the real estate office? What is meant by the finding that services rendered to Latimer respecting the sale of decedent\u2019s properties prior to October 6, 1964 \u201cmay be persuasive as to the nature of the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 services to be rendered in the future\u201d? Does the finding that \u201cLatimer relied upon Connolly and Seward to promote the properties\u201d mean that there was an implied promise on the part of Connolly and Seward to find a purchaser, ready, willing and able to buy at a price satisfactory to Kelber and Latimer, or merely to make a good faith effort to find buyers, or simply to perform such services as requested by Latimer in connection with the sale of the properties? A finding on a material issue which is fatally uncertain is equivalent to a failure to find. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) \u00a7 338, p. 3140.) The judgment must be reversed for lack of definite and certain findings on the issue of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In passing, we note that the judgment, in effect, decreed that Connolly and Seward are limited to a quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of services rendered to Latimer under the agreement. If the contract was void, voidable, or otherwise ineffective, recovery on a quantum meruit theory for reasonable value of services rendered thereunder might have been appropriate. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Crown Gold Milling Co., </em>150 Cal. 376, 383 [89 P. 86] [employment contract void for uncertainty].) However, if, as the trial court concluded, the contract was enforceable as an equitable assignment, recovery may not be so limited. If the agreement was fairly made, was not against public policy, and was supported by valuable consideration, it would have been enforceable according to its terms. On the present state of the findings, we cannot uphold the judgment on a quantum meruit theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Although we have concluded that the judgment must be reversed for lack of proper findings on consideration, we shall discuss other contentions raised by the parties because they will no doubt arise on any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The trial court determined that Connolly\u2019s and Seward\u2019s interests under the profit sharing agreement can only be asserted as claims against the estate of Latimer when the properties are sold and profits realized. Connolly and Seward contend that Kelber should have been adjudged a trustee accountable to them for their share of the profits, subject to a lien for any sums the two may owe the estate. They contend the tral court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>concluding that Kelber incurred no responsibility as trustee or otherwise to carry out the terms of the profit sharing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The Bank (as administrator) and decedent\u2019s daughter concede, as they must, that since there was no indebtedness under the agreement during Latimer\u2019s lifetime, Connolly and Seward were not required to file creditors\u2019 claims.  The word \u201cclaim\u201d 'in Probate Code section 707 refers to debts or demands against the decedent which might have been enforced against him during his lifetime by personal actions for the recovery of money and upon which only a money judgment could have been rendered. <em>(Newberger </em>v. <em>Rifkind, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 1070, 1077 [104 Cal.Rptr. 663]; <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Boothe, </em>79 Cal.App.2d 266, 277 [179 P.2d 611].) They contend nevertheless that Connolly\u2019s and Seward\u2019s interests under the agreement were but contingent contractual claims assertible only against the estate after the contingency had occurred. They urge there was no evidence that Kelber agreed to hold himself accountable as trustee or otherwise to Connolly and Seward for their share of the net profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">On the premise that the profit sharing agreement created a partnership or joint venture, Connolly and Seward contend that one-half the net profits from the sale of the properties would constitute partnership assets and not assets of the estate. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15026; Prob. Code, \u00a7 571; <em>Estate of Grivel, </em>10 Cal.2d 454, 456 [74 P.2d 759].) However, the trial court having rejected the premise upon which Connolly and Seward have constructed their argument and there being substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s implied findings, the argument advanced by them must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">It does not follow, however, that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Connolly\u2019s and Seward\u2019s rights are only enforceable as claims against the estate is correct. The validity of the court\u2019s conclusion does not turn on whether a partnership or joint venture relationship existed between Latimer, Connolly and Seward, but rather may depend upon whether such a relationship existed between Kelber and Latimer. If Latimer was merely an equitable owner of an undivided half of the properties in question, his interest would clearly be a part of the estate and it would be the right and duty of the Bank as administrator to take possession, management and control of such interest. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 571, 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">If Kelber and Latimer were partners, no part of the properties would become assets of the estate. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 571.) If they were joint venturers, the same consequences would flow as if they were partners.  Rights and liabilities of joint venturers, as between themselves, are governed by the same principles which apply to a partnership. <em>(Zeibak </em>v. <em>Nasser, </em>12 Cal.2d 1, 12 [82 P.2d 375].)  Statutory provisions gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>erning the rights of partners upon dissolution of a partnership are applicable to joint ventures. <em>(Zeibak </em>v. <em>Nasser, supra.) </em>This extends to a dissolution of a joint venture by death of a joint venturer. <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Slawter, </em>184 Cal.App.2d 715, 720 [7 Cal.Rptr. 830], See <em>Estate of Peebles, </em>27 Cal.App.3d 163, 167 [103 Cal.Rptr. 560].) Upon the death of a partner, the surviving partner is entitled to possession of the partnership property and is authorized to wind up the partnership business. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15033; Prob. Code, \u00a7 571.) He must settle the partnership business expeditiously. <em>(Estate of Peebles, supra.) </em>The same powers and responsibilities extend to a surviving joint venturer. <em>(Estate of Peebles, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In the case at bench there was evidence from which the court could have found that Kelber and Latimer were joint venturers. There was evidence of the existence of all of the incidents of a joint venture relationship, namely, joint interest in a business undertaking, an understanding as to the sharing of profits and losses, and a right of joint control. <em>(Holtz </em>v. <em>United Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 501, 506-507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">If Kelber and Latimer were joint venturers, no part of the real properties in question would constitute assets of the estate, although the value of Latimer\u2019s interest in the joint venture would be inventoried in his estate. Kelber would have been a trustee for the benefit of Latimer, not only because of written memoranda between the two, but because of their joint venture relationship.  A joint venturer holding property for the venture is a trustee for his co-venturer. <em>(Epstein </em>v. <em>Stahl, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.2d 53, 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As to whether a trust relationship existed between Kelber and Connolly and Seward, there was evidence that immediately upon the execution of the profit sharing agreement, Mr. Latimer personally delivered a copy to Kelber. Kelber testified that upon being apprised of the profit sharing agreement, he (Kelber) understood he would be accountable to \u201ctwo more people\u201d for the profits from the sale of the properties. Kelber\u2019s testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Schnabel:) When you got this copy of the contract of October 6th, 1964, you conceived that you as trustee were being advised that Charles Latimer had alienated some portion of his beneficial interest in this trust of which you were trustee; isn\u2019t that the fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cA. If I understand your question correctly, yes, that would be the fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\u201cQ. Now there were two more people you\u2019d have to make an appropriate accounting for in the division of profits; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cQ. All right. And did you ever question the legality of this October 6th, 1964 document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\u201cA. The legality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201cQ. Yes. Did you ever question the legality or did you deem yourself bound by it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cA. I felt that I was bound by it, that there were\u2014I had two new partners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The foregoing evidence would have supported a finding that Kelber was a trustee not only for the benefit of Latimer but also for the benefit of Connolly and Seward as to their share of the profits under the terms of the profit sharing agreement, assuming the agreement to be enforceable.  A trust may be created \u201cwhere a trust already exists and at the direction of the beneficiary the trustee transfers the trust property upon a different trust, or the <em>beneficiary directs the trustee </em>to hold the property upon a different trust . . . .\u201d (Rest.2d Trusts, \u00a7 17, com. h, p. 62; italics supplied.)  A contingent interest can be held in trust. (Rest. 2d Trusts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 85.) An expectancy based upon an existing contract may also be the subject of a trust. (Rest.2d Trusts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 86, com. e, p. 210.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Of course, if the profit sharing agreement is determined to be void, voidable, or otherwise unenforceable for any reason and recovery is allowed on a quantum meruit theory, the claim could only be asserted as a claim against the estate. In such event it would be unnecessary to reach the question whether Kelber was a trustee for Connolly and Seward for their share of the profits under the profit sharing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">Although Connolly and Seward disclaim any interest in the lands by virtue of the profit sharing agreement, Mrs. Latimer contends the agreement constituted an invalid attempt by her husband to transfer, without her consent or joinder, an interest in community real property. She urges that under Civil Code section 5127<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 172a) the agreement was invalid insofar as it purported to affect her community interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The only authority cited by Mrs. Latimer is <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>3 Cal.2d 110 [43 P.2d 788, 101 A.L.R. 871], involving an assignment by a landowner of a percentage of the oil and gas extracted from his lands. The court held the assignment constituted a transfer of an interest in real property in the nature of \u201can incorporeal hereditament.\u201d <em>Callahan </em>turned on the nature of a landowner\u2019s rights to oil and gas beneath his land and is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">While we have found no California case passing squarely upon the question whether a landowner\u2019s agreement to share profits from the sale of his land constitutes a transfer of an interest in real property, it has been held that an oral joint venture agreement concerning real property is not subject to the statute of frauds even though the real property was owned by one of the joint venturers. <em>(Gross </em>v. <em>Raeburn, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 792, 796, 799 [33 Cal.Rptr. 432].) This view is generally shared in other jurisdictions. (2 Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 411, pp. 418-421.) Corbin, <em>supra, </em>adds at page 421: \u201c. . . There is even more reason for holding that a contract for the assignment of a share in the profits of a particular land speculation is not a contract for the sale of an interest in land; it is an assignment of a chose in action.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We conclude the agreement did not operate as a transfer of an interest in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We next consider the question whether the trial court properly determined that Latimer\u2019s interest in the properties in question was community property. Although Connolly and Seward did not raise this issue in their opening brief, they raise it in their reply brief in response to the Bank\u2019s and daughter\u2019s contention that the judgment properly restricted enforceability of the profit sharing agreement as to Mrs. Latimer\u2019s community interest to the reasonable value of services rendered by Connolly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and Seward to the community and in response to the wife\u2019s contention that the agreement was wholly unenforceable as to her community interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The properties having been acquired by purchase during Latimer\u2019s marriage, his interest was presumed to be community, and the burden of overcoming the presumption by clear and convincing evidence rested with Connolly and Seward. <em>(See </em>v. <em>See, </em>64 Cal.2d 778, 783 [51 Cal.Rptr. 888, 415 P.2d776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Insofar as the 7th and Mountain property was concerned, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that Latimer\u2019s interest was community property. The property was acquired with proceeds of an unsecured loan from the United California Bank evidenced by a promissory note signed by Latimer and Kelber. The Bank\u2019s loan officer testified the loan was made solely in reliance upon the personal credit of Kelber and Latimer.  The proceeds of the loan so made on the personal credit of either spouse are regarded as community property, particularly where the husband is the borrower. <em>(Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>276 Cal.App.2d 9, 13 [80 Cal.Rptr. 435]; 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (7th ed. 1960) pp. 2727-2728, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">As to the airport property, its acquisition was financed by a $420,000 loan secured by the property itself and a $360,000 loan secured by the Alta Loma property. The loan proceeds secured by the airport property were obviously community in nature. As to the $360,000 loan, it was conceded that Latimer\u2019s interest in the Alta Loma property was his separate property. Ordinarily funds borrowed by hypothecation of a spouse\u2019s separate property are also separate property. <em>(Estate of Abdale, </em>28 Cal.2d 587, 592 [170 P.2d 918].)  In the case at bench, however, the court found that although the Bank took trust deeds on both the airport property and the Alta Loma property, the loans were made \u201cprimarily\u201d on the general credit of Kelber and Latimer. The Bank\u2019s loan officer testified the additional security on the Alta Loma property was taken only to comply with banking regulations restricting banks to a loan of up to 60 percent of the appraised value of property given as security. He also testified that in making the loans the Bank relied primarily on the general credit of Kelber and Latimer and not on the additional security of the Alta Loma property.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The foregoing evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Latimer\u2019s interest in the airport property was community.  There is a rebuttable presumption that property acquired on credit during marriage is community so that \u201c[i]n the absence of evidence tending to prove that the seller [in this case the lendor] primarily relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the purchaser\u2019s separate property in extending credit, the trial court must find in accordance with the presumption.\u201d <em>(Gudelj </em>v. <em>Gudelj, </em>41 Cal.2d 202, 210 [259 P.2d 656].)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">For the first time in their reply brief, Connolly and Seward urge that an agreement entered into between the Latimers on August 25, 1964, a copy of which was introduced into evidence, changed the character of the properties from community to separate. The agreement, the text of which is set out in the margin below,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides in substance that as to \u201cany . . . purchasers or encumbrancers\u201d property standing in his or her name alone shall be \u201cconclusively presumed to be his [or her] own.\u201d As between the parties, however, the agreement does not purport to change the character of property held by either spouse. Moreover, Connolly and Seward were neither \u201cpurchasers\u201d nor \u201cencumbrancers.\u201d The agreement, therefore, did not compel a finding that Latimer\u2019s interest in the two properties was his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The question remains as to the effect, if any, of the profit sharing agreement upon the wife\u2019s community interest. We have heretofore determined that the wife\u2019s contention that the profit sharing agreement was unenforceable against her community property interest because it constituted an attempted transfer of interest in community real property cannot be sustained. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>This leaves the question whether the profit sharing agreement constituted an improper disposition of community personal property.  Although the husband may dispose of community personal property, he cannot make a gift of such property or dispose of it without \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 5125 [formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 172].) A gift made by a husband in violation of Civil Code section 5125 is voidable in its entirety during the husband\u2019s lifetime and to the extent of only one-half after his death. <em>(Ballinger </em>v. <em>Ballinger, 9 </em>Cal.2d 330, 334 [70 P.2d 629]; <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Hammell, </em>4 Cal.2d 690, 691 [52 P.2d 221]; <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Trimble, </em>219 Cal. 340. 344 [26 P.2d 477]; <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 443, 448 [205 P.2d 402].)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Respondents urge that the position of a husband in dealing with community property is that of a fiduciary <em>(Vai </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>56 Cal.2d 329, 338 [15 Cal.Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247]), and that therefore any transfer, sale or disposition of community property must be for an \u201cadequate consideration\u201d substantially equal in value, measured in terms of money, to the value of the property. The only cases cited in support of their contention are <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>44 Cal. 335 and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>20 Cal. 219. Those cases had nothing to do with a husband\u2019s disposition of community property. Although they held that there was a distinction between \u201cgood consideration\u201d and \u201cvaluable consideration,\u201d the latter being \u201cmoney or the like,\u201d that distinction has since been repudiated. \u201cGood consideration\u201d and \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d mean the same thing. <em>(Horton </em>v. <em>Kyburz, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 59, 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Although in negotiating a property settlement with his wife with respect to community property, a husband has the duties of a fiduciary <em>(Vai </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 329, 338; <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>56 Cal.2d 492, 494-495 [15 Cal.Rptr. 87, 364 P.2d 263]), those duties have not been extended to all of the husband\u2019s business dealings with community property. (See Note, <em>The Husband\u2019s Fiduciary Duty\u2014More Protection for the California Wife, </em>14 Stan.L.Rev. 587.) Respondents\u2019 contention that community property should not be disposed of by the husband except for <em>adequate consideration </em>finds no support in the decisions. Civil Code section 5125 has never been so construed. The cases equate \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d as used in section 5125 with \u201cgood consideration\u201d as used in section 1605. <em>(Gantner v. Johnson, 274 </em>Cal.App.2d 869, 877 [79 Cal.Rptr. 381]; <em>Estate of Bray, </em>230 Cal.App.2d 136, 141 [40 Cal.Rptr. 750], See <em>Grolemund </em>v. <em>Cafferata, </em>17 Cal.2d 679, 683 [111 P.2d 641]; <em>Metzger </em>v. <em>Vestal, 2 </em>Cal.2d 517, 522 [42 P.2d 67].) As one note writer has observed: \u201cEvidently a husband is free to make unwise purchases, to speculate freely in stocks and securities or to use personal property foolishly without the wife\u2019s consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>for in these situations the desirability of freely transferable personal property is thought to outweigh the harm suffered by the wife.\u201d (Note, 9 Stan. L.Rev. 400, 404-405.) To extend the \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d concept to situations other than property settlements with the wife would, as another commentator has stated, \u201champer the exercise of his [husband\u2019s] business initiative, prejudice the rights of those who deal with him, and generally hinder commercial transactions. . . .\u201d (14 Stan.L.Rev., <em>supra, </em>pp. 598-599; fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">If there was valuable consideration and if the profit sharing agreement is enforceable according to its terms, it would be enforceable not only as to Latimer\u2019s community interest but to the wife\u2019s as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Gardner, P. J., and Gabbert, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 15, 1974, and the petition of respondent Latimer for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 27, 1974.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Seward died before trial but by stipulation the actions were continued in his name.

The term \u201cgood consideration\u201d as used in Civil Code section 1605 is equivalent to \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d and not adequate consideration in terms of monetary value. <em>(Horton </em>v. <em>Kyburz, </em>53 Cal.2d 59, 65 [346 P.2d 399].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Civil Code section 5127 (formerly \u00a7 172a) provides: \u201c. . .
