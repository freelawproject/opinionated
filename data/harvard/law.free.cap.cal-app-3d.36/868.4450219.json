Jones (hereinafter Jones), a resident of Los Angeles, who had previously (in 1936) opened a savings account with defendant-respondent State Mutual Savings and Loan Association (hereinafter Savings and Loan Assoc.), received, along with her new passbook, a document entitled \u201cAccumulative Investment Certificate No. 36285.\u201d The certificate was duly dated and signed by an authorized representative of defendant Savings and Loan Assoc. She (Jones) from time to time deposited various sums of money in her savings account.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">On January 12, 1951, Jones died. The balance in her savings account with defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, at the time of her death was $3,090.68. Shortly thereafter an action entitled \u201cIn the Matter of the Estate of Laura A. Jones, Deceased,\u201d was filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County and was a matter of public record. Pursuant to her will, the estate was administered by Citizens National Trust and Savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Bank of Los Angeles (now Crocker National Bank), named as executor of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On February 20, 1952, by the court-approved decree of final distribution of the estate of Jones, plaintiffs-appellants Elizabeth Marquis (hereinafter Marquis) and Mildred Click (hereinafter Click) each obtained a 15/40th fraction interest in her (Jones\u2019) estate. During the pendency of the probate proceeding neither the decedent\u2019s executor nor her heirs were aware of the existence of the savings account and Investment Certificate No. 36285, and it was not inventoried in decedent\u2019s estate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">On August 12, 1954, the board of directors of defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, adopted a resolution calling for redemption of various outstanding Accumulative Investment Certificates, including that of the deceased Jones (Certificate No. 36285), effective as of October 1, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">On August 23, 1954, pursuant to the resolution, defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, addressed and mailed a letter to Jones at her Los Angeles address, according to its records. The letter referred to the resolution, fixed the date for redemption as of October 1, 1954 and stated that interest on the certificate would cease on that date. The letter was returned to defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, by the postal officials with the notation upon its envelope, \u201cDeceased.\u201d Defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, took no action to verify her death or to ascertain or locate her executor, attorney or heirs. As of October 1, 1954, the accumulated balance in the account was $3,483.69.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">In October of 1968, approximately 17 years after the death of Jones, Marquis and Click became aware of the existence of Accumulative Investment Certificate No. 36285, and each made demand upon defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, for her proportionate share (15/40th) of principal and interest in the account, in accordance with the decree of final distribution of Jones\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">On March 21, 1969, defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, paid $1,306.39 to each of the plaintiffs Marquis and Click ($2,612.76 total), which included interest on Investment Certificate No. 36285 only to October 1, 1954. The total amount paid represented a 30/40th fraction of the credit balance of $3,483.69 upon Investment Certificate No. 36285 (principal and interest) as of October 1, 1954. Defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, refused to pay any interest upon the $3,090.68 (balance as of date of death of Jones) beyond the date of October 1, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>The Case</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">On June <em>2, </em>1969, plaintiffs-appellants Marquis and Click filed a complaint in the Los Angeles Municipal Court (case No. 598 492) naming Savings and Loan Assoc, as defendant. The complaint sought to recover from defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, additional interest allegedly due and owed to them from Investment Certificate No. 36285 as distributees of the estate of the deceased Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">On August 6, 1970, by stipulation of counsel and with court approval, the matter was transferred to the superior court (becoming superior court case No. 982 804), and the complaint was amended to include a declaratory relief cause of action, vesting jurisdiction in the superior court. The amended complaint alleged the salient facts set forth in the History, <em>supra, </em>and sought to recover plaintiffs\u2019 percentage of the interest accumulated on the October 1, 1954, balance (at the rate paid by defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, to regular savings accounts) until March of 1969 and 7 percent per annum for March 21, 1969, to date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Defendant Savings and Loan Assoc.\u2019s answer admitted the allegations in the complaints (as set forth in the History, supra) except it denied the amount of interest owed. An affirmative defense alleged that \u201cthe accumulative investment certificate held by this defendant in the name of Laura A. Jones was redeemed on August 12, 1954, effective October 1, 1954, pursuant to the terms of said investment certificate together with Sections 6563 through 6568 of the Financial Code of the State of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">On April 10, 1972, jury was waived and the matter was submitted to the trial court for determination based on the pleadings; a stipulation that the facts as set forth in the History <em>(supra) </em>were true; the interrogatories propounded to defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, by plaintiffs and the answers thereto; defendant\u2019s Exhibit \u201cA\u201d (copy of Accumulative Investment Certificate No. 36285j<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s Exhibit \u201cB\u201d (copy of letter from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>defendant\u2019s secretary to its board of directors and the board president);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s Exhibit \u201cC\u201d (copy of letter dated August 23, 1954, to Miss Laura A. Jones at 2917 West 15th Street, Los Angeles, California, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>the envelope, postmarked the same date, which was returned to defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, with the notation, \u201cDeceased\u201d).* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">On July 12, 1972, the court found in favor of defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, and against- plaintiffs Marquis and Click.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The following pertinent and controlling statutes were in full force and effect at the time defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, mailed its notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>intended redemption letter to the deceased Jones on August 23, 1954, and are still operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">California Financial Code section 6563 (hereinafter Section 6563) provides <em>in toto </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201c\u00a7 6563. All investment certificates issued after August 14, 1933, are subject to redemption, in whole or in part at the option of the association, by giving the holder at least 30 days\u2019 notice of such intended redemption. The notice of redemption shall expressly state that interest on such investment certificates ceases on the date fixed for redemption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">California Financial Code section 6568 (hereinafter Section 6568) provides <em>in toto </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\u201c\u00a7 6568. Interest, and all rights of the holder of investment certificates with respect to the amount called for redemption, except the right to receive the redemption price, cease after the date fixed for redemption if the notice of intended redemption is given as required by this article and if funds are available for the redemption on or after such date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Plaintiffs contend that interest on the investment certificate did not terminate as of October 1, 1954. Their position is that once defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, received the return of its attempted mail notice indicating the depositor was \u201cdeceased,\u201d it had the obligation to use \u201creasonable\u201d diligence \u201cto ascertain the decedent\u2019s legal personal representative and advise accordingly\u201d and that it is being \u201cunjustly enriched,\u201d at the expense of its depositor, by its use of 14 years\u2019 normal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">Respondent Savings and Loan Assoc, asserts that it strictly complied with the provisions of Sections 6563 and 6568 relating to the redemption of investment certificates, having mailed notice of redemption to the last known address of the depositor pursuant to an appropriate corporate resolution, and therefore any right to receive interest ceased, and it is immunized from any liability for interest as of October 1,1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">\n<em>Did defendant-respondent Savings and Loan Assoc, give proper \u201cnotice\u201d of redemption to the \u201cholder\u201d in order to terminate interest on </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\n<em>Accumulative Investment Certificate No. 36285 as required by Sections 6563 and 6568?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Section 6563 speaks of giving at least 30 days\u2019 \u201cnotice\u201d of the intended redemption to the \u201cholder\u201d of investment certificates. Section 6568 states that once \u201cnotice\u201d is given to the \u201cholder\u201d in compliance with Section 6563, no interest accrues after the redemption date. The nature of the required notice is not specified in Section 6568 or anywhere else in article IV chapter 7 of the Financial Code in which Section 6568 is included. We therefore must construe that reasonable \u201cnotice\u201d is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We hold that in the case at bench, \u201cnotice\u201d was not given within the spirit or letter of Sections 6563 and 6568 to effectively terminate interest under Investment Certificate No. 36285 as of October 1, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\u201cNotice\u201d is a keystone in our law. The purpose of giving \u201cnotice\u201d is to inform or impart knowledge. The importance of having the knowledge is to be able to react to the knowledge imparted.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">\u201cNotice\u201d is defined by code in California in the Commercial Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *and the Corporations Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both code sections, in defining \u201cnotice,\u201d require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>that the intended recipient of the notice acquire some knowledge of the notice. Can \u201cnotice\u201d be given to the dead? No. In the case at bench, the depositor Jones was deceased at the time the letter of redemption (Exhibit C) was mailed and could not obtain \u201cnotice,\u201d actual or constructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Defendant Savings and Loan Assoc.\u2019s having the letter sent to its depositor (holder) Jones returned marked \u201cDeceased,\u201d would ordinarily excite inquiry and it should reasonably assume and be alerted to the fact that there may be an interest, claim or right' in the investment certificate by either the legal representative or heir of the deceased Jones or by the State of California under its \u201cescheat\u201d laws if she died without heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Therefore, defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, had the responsibility, with \u201cdue diligence\u201d to use \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to (1) ascertain whether or not its depositor (holder) Jones was in fact deceased and, if so, to (2) ascertain whether or not there were legal representatives or heirs and, if so, to give \u201cnotice\u201d to them in order to effectively terminate the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">What constitutes \u201creasonable efforts\u201d varies with the circumstances of each case. The size of the deposit would be a legitimate factor to consider in determining whether or not \u201creasonable efforts\u201d were made. In the case at bench the balance in the savings account exceeded $3,000; the minimum \u201creasonable effort\u201d would certainly require the defendant to investigate the public records of the local county clerk to see if there were probate proceedings. Had this been done, it would have disclosed the name of the legal representative of the deceased depositor Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In the case of <em>Dolch </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>57 Cal.App.2d 99, 105-106 [134 P.2d 19], the court said: \u201c. . . A person may not have actual knowledge of certain facts, but if he has knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a reasonably prudent person of ordinary intelligence to make inquiry, the law will impute knowledge of those facts which may be easily ascertained by reasonable inquiry. When the law imputes knowledge, it has the same legal effect as though there was actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">\u201cThe rule is thus stated in <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co., </em>53 Cal.App.2d 736 [128 P.2d 31], at page 748:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201c \u2018A common situation is one where conflicting property rights are involved, and of these Mr. Pomeroy says (Pomeroy's Equity Juris., vol. 2, 4th ed. p. 1154, \u00a7 608), \u201cWhenever a party has information or knowledge of certain extraneous facts, which of themselves do not amount to, nor tend to show, an <em>actual </em>notice, but which are sufficient to put a reasonably prudent man upon an inquiry respecting a conflicting interest, claim, or right, <em>and the circumstances are such that the inquiry, if made and followed up </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number><em>with reasonable care and diligence, would lead to a discovery of the truth, </em>to a knowledge of the interest, claim, or right which really exists, then the party is absolutely charged with a constructive notice of such interest, claim, or right.\u201d \u2019 See, also, <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>5 Cal.2d 361 [54 P.2d 725]; <em>West </em>v. <em>Great Western Power Co., </em>36 Cal.App.2d 403 [97 P.2d 1014]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Mason-McDuffie Co., </em>50 Cal.App.2d 320 [122 P.2d 971].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Therefore, we hold that defendant-respondent Savings and Loan Assoc, did not give proper \u201cnotice\u201d of redemption to the \u201cholder\u201d in order to terminate interest on Accumulative Investment Certificate No. 36285 as required by Sections 6563 and 6568 for the following reasons: (1) that the return of the letter, with a marking \u201cDeceased,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alerted defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, that the intended recipient of the letter no longer existed, so that \u201cnotice\u201d could not be effectuated; (2) that the return of the letter with the marking \u201cDeceased\u201d also alerted defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, that decedent Jones could no longer be the \u201cholder\u201d of the investment certificate; (3) that defendant should have reasonably assumed there may be an interest, claim or right in the savings account by the legal representative or heirs of the deceased Jones, if any; and (4) that defendant failed to discharge its responsiblity of \u201cdue diligence\u201d to use \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ascertain the legal representative who would be the person/ holder to whom \u201cnotice\u201d would have to be sent to comply with Sections 6563 and 6568.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">When defendant Savings and Loan Assoc, elected to rest after the notice of redemption envelope was returned marked \u201cDeceased,\u201d it shirked its responsibility resulting in an unpaid deferred debt. Defendant must now, belatedly, settle the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Plaintiffs Marquis and Click are each entitled to a 15/40th fraction of the interest due under Investment Certificate No. 36285 from October 1, 1954, to the date of defendant Savings and Loan Assoc.\u2019s distribution on March 21, 1969; plus 7 percent interest on the interest retained from March 21, 1969, to date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to render judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and each of them, in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Lillie, Acting P.
