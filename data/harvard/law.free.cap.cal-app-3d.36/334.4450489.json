The judgment declared the statute, and certain administrative regulations adopted under it, to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The cause was submitted for decision on the pleadings, declarations under penalty of perjury, documentary exhibits, and admissions made in response to written request. Although findings were neither made nor requested, the essential facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Plaintiffs Russell, Munster, Rosell, and Taube are AFDC<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recipient mothers each of whom is, or has been, living with an unrelated adult male (UAM).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs Pelley, Camarillo, and Briggs are UAMs who are, or have been, living with plaintiffs Russell, Munster, and Taube, respectively. Defendants are the state Department of Social Welfare (SDSW), the social welfare departments of the three counties which administer AFDC payments to plaintiff mothers, and the directors of those state and county departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Section 11351.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cWhenever an unrelated adult male resides with a family applying for or receiving aid under [the AFDC program], he shall be required to make a financial contribution to the family <em>which shall not be less than it would cost him to provide himself with an independent living arrangement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cThe minimum financial contribution to the family shall be determined in accordance with standards established by the [SDSW] which takes <em>[sic] </em>into account such adult male person\u2019s income and expenses. The regulations formulated by the department shall require the mother of the children and the unrelated male to present all of the facts in connection with the sharing of expenses which comprise the agreement whereby said adult male resides with the family. The conditions of the agreement and the facts related to the sharing of the family expenses shall be signed under penalty of perjury by both the mother of the child and the unrelated male. In the event that either the mother or the adult male person willfully and knowingly fails to cooperate during the period such joint sharing of expenses arrangement exists in setting forth all of the facts in accordance with provisions of this section, aid to the family may be discontinued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">\u201cThe provisions of this section do not apply to a bona fide paying lodger, roomer or boarder living in the home of a family applying for or receiving aid under [AFDC].\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The SDSW interprets the words \u201cindependent living arrangement\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>section 11351.5 to mean that the UAM must contribute to the AFDC family what it would otherwise cost him to live alone without a sharing arrangement. A regulation adopted by the SDSW (EAS \u00a7 43-114.23) implements this construction and defines the cost of an \u201cindependent living arrangement\u201d to be the sum of the AFDC allowances which a single adult male would receive for housing, utilities, food and household operations if he were on welfare.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A companion regulation (EAS \u00a7 44-113.5) provides that the AFDC family is considered to have received income to the extent that the UAM\u2019s contribution exceeds the sum of (1) the AFDC food allowance for an adult male, plus (2) $5 for the additional cost of utilities and household operations, plus (3) substantiated increased housing costs to the AFDC family caused by the presence of the UAM. Thus, where the UAM contributes the cost of an \u201cindependent living arrangement,\u201d the family\u2019s AFDC grant will be reduced by an amount equal to <em>part </em>of that contribution. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Other regulations of the SDSW specify procedures for the enforcement of section 11351.5. Wilful failure of the AFDC mother to present to the county welfare department a statement signed by her under penalty of perjury which sets forth the UAM\u2019s financial contributions to the family, as well as states his known income, will result in the denial or discontinuance of the AFDC grant. If the UAM himself refuses to sign such a statement under penalty of perjury, \u201cinformation regarding such refusal shall, with the prior knowledge of the mother and the unrelated adult male, be sent to the district attorney.\u201d (Cal. SDSW Manual EAS \u00a7\u00a7 43-113.33, 43-113.34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u201cWhen the known or probable income of the unrelated adult male is insufficient for him to support himself in an independent living arrangement and to meet his expenses of employment, or his financial contribution to the family is less than the cost of providing himself with an independent living arrangement,\u201d the county welfare department is authorized by the SDSW\u2019s regulations to advise the mother and the UAM that \u201ccontinuation subjects them to prosecution for violating [Welfare and Institutions Code section] <em>11480.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that event, the mother and the UAM must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>be notified that unless the UAM makes the required contribution or leaves the home, \u201cthe district attorney will have to be informed of the suspected misuse of the grant.\u201d If the situation has not been corrected within 30 days after such notice, \u201cthe county welfare department shall refer the situation to the district attorney in writing.\u201d (Cal. SDSW Manual EAS \u00a7\u00a7 20-101.21, 20-101.22, 43-114.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Plaintiffs Briggs and Taube are being prosecuted in San Diego County under section 11480 because Briggs lived with Taube but did not contribute the cost of an independent living arrangement for two months. Plaintiffs Pelley and Russell have continued to live together despite Pelley\u2019s nonpayment of the required contribution, and their case has been referred to the Shasta County District Attorney for prosecution under section 11480. Plaintiffs Camarillo and Munster were instructed by the Ventura County welfare department that the matter would be referred to the district attorney for action pursuant to section 11480 if Camarillo continued living with Munster without contributing the statutory amount; unable to pay, Camarillo has left Munster\u2019s household but would rejoin her if he were able.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">1. <em>Construction of Section 11351.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief suggests that Welfare and Institutions Code section 11351.5 \u201cmight conceivably have been read simply to require the unrelated man to pay his own way\u201d\u2014i.e., to \u201cpay his own <em>share </em>of the household expenses.\u201d (Italics added.) Taking plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion as a challenge to the SDSW\u2019s construction of the \"statute, we dispose of it preliminarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Section 11351.5 requires the UAM residing with an AFDC family to contribute not less \u201cthan it would cost him to provide himself with an independent living arrangement.\u201d As previously mentioned, the SDSW\u2019s regulations construe the cost of an \u201cindependent living arrangement\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>be the cost to the UAM if he lived alone. \u201cThe contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by those charged with its enforcement and interpretation, while not necessarily controlling, is entitled to great weight, and courts generally will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.\u201d <em>(Cannon </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Comm. </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 17, 22 [346 P.2d 1].) It cannot be said that the SDSW\u2019s interpretation is \u201cclearly erroneous or unauthorized\u201d; indeed, we do not see what other construction the SDSW could properly have given to the statute. \u201cThe intent of the Legislature must be ascertained from the language of the enactment and where, as here, the language is clear, there can be no room for interpretation.\u201d <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutal L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 353-354 [139 P.2d 908].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Moreover, the SDSW\u2019s regulation which equates the cost of an \u201cindependent living arrangement\u201d with the sum of prescribed AFDC allowances for a single male (EAS \u00a7 43-114.23) is \u201cconsistent, not in conflict with the statute, and reasonably necessary to effectuate its purpose\u201d <em>(Mooney </em>v. <em>Pickett </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 669, 679 [94 Cal.Rptr. 279, 483 P.2d 1231]). Section 11351.5 expressly declares that \u201c[t]he minimum financial contribution to the family shall be determined in accordance with standards established by the department which takes [szc] into account such adult male person\u2019s income arid expenses.\u201d \u201c[T]he courts recognize that the Legislature must be permitted to rely on the peculiar ability of an administrative'agency to achieve continuous, flexible and expert regulation . . . .\u201d <em>(Ralphs Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Reimel </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 172, 176 [70 Cal.Rptr. 407, 444 P.2d 79].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">As said under analogous circumstances in <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Perluss </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 824 [27 Cal.Rptr. 19, 377 P.2d 83]: \u201cAll of the parties to this litigation recognize the intricate and technical nature of the subject matter as well as the expertise and full technical knowledge which its administration requires. It would be presumptuous of a court to claim such skill; it will not, therefore, superimpose its own policy judgment upon the agency in the absence of an arbitrary and capricious decision.\u201d (P. 832.) Accordingly, \u201cin determining whether the director has acted arbitrarily or capriciously, this court does not inquire whether, if it had power to draft the regulation, it would have adopted some method or formula other than that promulgated by the director.\u201d (P. 834.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Plaintiffs mount no attack upon the SDSW\u2019s use of prescribed AFDC allowances in computing a uniform standard for UAM contributions; their challenge is to the underlying concept of the statutory \u201cindependent living arrangement\u201d (\u00a7 11351.5). The fulcrum of their constitutional arguments is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the inquiry posed in their closing brief\u2014namely, \u201cWhy is the uniform standard calculated on the fiction that plaintiffs are living apart when in fact they are in a sharing arrangement?\u201d We therefore turn to their contentions based upon due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">2. <em>Due Process and Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Plaintiffs contend that by \u201cimposing a special obligation on the unrelated man to affirmatively support the welfare family,\u201d the UAM requirement expressed in section 11351.5 and its implementing regulations denies the UAM due process and equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. In particular, plaintiffs assert that the statute and regulations unconstitutionally discriminate against UAMs living with AFDC mothers while requiring no like contribution from adult relatives living with AFDC families, or from unrelated adult females living with male heads of AFDC households, or from UAMs living with non-AFDC mothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The contentions fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">All presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. Statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively and unmistakably appears. <em>(In re Ricky H. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 513, 519 [86 Cal.Rptr. 76, 468 P.2d 204].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u201c[A]rticle I, section 13 of the California Constitution, which provides that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law, has been held to be identical in scope and purpose with the due process clause of the federal Constitution. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Whitmore </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1, 20 [94 Cal.Rptr. 904].)  Although the California Constitution does not expressly speak in terms of \u201cequal protection,\u201d it contains a number of provisions requiring the uniform operation of laws and prohibiting special legislation. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 21, and art. IV, \u00a7 16.) These provisions of our state Constitution are substantially the equivalent of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and evoke substantially the same standards as those prescribed by the federal Constitution. <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 108, 120, fn. 8 [93 Cal.Rptr. 1, 480 P.2d 953]; <em>Dept. of Mental Hygiene </em>v. <em>Kirchner </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 586, 588 [43 Cal.Rptr. 329, 400 P.2d 321, 20 A.L.R.3d 361]; <em>County of L.

In substantive law such deprivation is supportable only if the conduct from which the deprivation flows is prescribed by reasonable legislation reasonably applied, i.e., the law must not be unreasonable, arbitrar)' or capricious but must have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Whitmore, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 21.) \u201cAccordingly, no valid objection to the constitutionality of a statute under the due process clause may be interposed \u2018if it is reasonably related to promoting the public health, safety, comfort, and welfare, and if the means adopted to accomplish that promotion are reasonably appropriate to the purpose.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguiar </em>(1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 597, 602 [65 Cal.Rptr. 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Directing our attention to the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws, we observe that the latter guarantee \u201ccompels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.\u201d <em>(Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 566, 578 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645, 38 A.L.R.3d 1194].) \u201c[T]he Legislature is vested with wide discretion in making the classification and ... its decision as to what is a sufficient distinction to warrant the classification will not be overthrown by the courts unless it is palpably arbitrary and beyond rational doubt erroneous.

Only invidious discrimination offends the equal protection clause [citation]; the Legislature need not treat similar evils identically or legislate as to all phases of a field at once [citation]; legislative classification is permissible when it is based upon some distinction reasonably justifying differentiation in treatment [citations]; a classification is not void because it does not embrace within it every other class which might be included [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguiar, supra, </em>257 Cal.App.2d at p. 604.) \u201c \u2018A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 471, 485 [25 L.Ed.2d 491, 502, 90 S.Ct. 1153].) (See also <em>Allied Stores of Ohio </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1959) 358 U.S. 522, 527-528 [3 L.Ed.2d 480, 485-486, 79 S.Ct. 437]; <em>In re Ricky H., supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d at p. 522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Similarly, the California Supreme Court has declared: \u201cThe Legislature is not bound, in order to adopt a constitutionally valid statute, to extend it to all cases which might possibly be reached, but is free to recognize degrees of harm and to confine its regulation to those classes of cases in which the need is deemed to be the most evident.\u201d <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 829, 833 [48 Cal.Rptr. 481, 409 P.2d 481].) \u201cIn the area of economics and social welfare, a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>(Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 485 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 501].) \u201c[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 486-487 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 503].) \u201cA legislature may address a problem \u2018one step at a time,\u2019 or even \u2018select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others.\u2019 [Citation.] So long as its judgments are rational, and not invidious, the legislature\u2019s efforts to tackle the problems of the poor and the needy are not subject to a constitutional straitjacket. The very complexity of the problems suggests that there will be more than one constitutionally permissible method of solving them.\u201d <em>(Jefferson </em>v. <em>Hackney </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 535, 546-547 [32 L.Ed.2d 285, 296, 92 S.Ct. 1724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on due process and equal protection do not countervail the foregoing tests. Section 11351.5, as correctly interpreted by the SDSW, is (at the very least) \u201creasonably appropriate\u201d to preventing encroachment on the AFDC grant, and, accordingly, is impervious to objection on the ground of due process. The Legislature could justifiably have determined that there were more spouseless AFDC mothers than AFDC fathers, and that a greater threat of diversion of the grant was therefore posed by cohabiting UAMs than by unrelated adult females or by adult relatives; hence plaintiffs\u2019 claimed denial of equal protection falls. The Legislature could properly have assigned a greater priority or urgency to UAM legislation than to comparable legislation in other areas. (Cf., <em>In re Ricky H., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The basic flaw in plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional argument is their characterization of the duty imposed on the UAM by section 11351.5 as being an obligation \u201cto affirmatively support the welfare family.\u201d They attempt to bolster their characterization by citing <em>Dept. of Mental Hygiene </em>v. <em>Kirchner </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 716 [36 Cal.Rptr. 488, 388 P.2d 720, 20 A.L.R.3d 353], remanded (1965) 380 U.S. 194 [13 L.Ed.2d 753, 85 S.Ct. 871], subsequent opinion (1965) 62 Cal.2d 586 [43 Cal.Rptr. 329, 400 P.2d 321, 20 A.L.R.3d 361], and <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 552 [25 L.Ed.2d 561, 90 S.Ct. 1282]. The characterization and citations are inappropriate. Unlike the legislation in Kirchner,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the statute and regulations at bench do not require the UAM to pay for someone else\u2019s support. The UAM is called upon to pay only the equivalent of what it would cost him to live alone. And unlike the state provisions which conflicted with federal law in <em>Lewis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>v. <em>Martin,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>only the UAM\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d contribution is taken into account in computing AFDC payments. (Cal. SDSW Manual EAS \u00a7 44-113.5; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The fact that a portion of his actual contribution is considered income to the family, and reduces its grant, does not alter the concept that the UAM is paying only the cost of what would be his \u201cindependent living arrangement.\u201d <em>If he contributed merely his lesser share of household expenses, as plaintiffs advocate, he would in effect be using the AFDC grant because the grant is what made the sharing arrangement possible in the first place. </em>If the prescribed portion of the UAM\u2019s contribution was not treated as reducing the level of welfare need, and if the AFDC grant was therefore not diminished accordingly, the UAM\u2019s contribution wquld constitute to that extent an extra resource for the family and would run afoul of the requirement of the Social Security Act that state agencies administering AFDC plans \u201cshall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7); see also 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(a).)7 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The SDSW\u2019s allocation to family income of the prescribed portion of the UAM\u2019s contribution is a reasonable reconciliation of the realities and federal requirements. As said in <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>397 U.S. at page 487 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 503], \u201c[T]he intractable economic, social, and even philosophical problems presented by public welfare assistance programs are not the business of this Court. The Constitution may impose certain procedural safeguards upon systems of welfare administration [citation]. But the Constitution does not empower this Court to second-guess state officials charged with the difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds among the myriad of potential recipients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>3. <em>Prosecution Under Section 11480</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Plaintiffs challenge the validity of defendants\u2019 regulations and practices related to enforcement of the UAM contribution by threat of criminal prosecution under section 11480 (fn. <em>4, </em>supra) and by referral to the district attorney for that purpose. The challenge is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief states their argument in this regard thusly: \u201c[Section] 11480 reaches only encroachment upon, or diversion of, the grant and nothing more. It does not apply to a man who, by paying his own <em>share </em>of the household expenses, <em>avoids partaking in the grant. </em>It does not enforce any affirmative support requirement . - . [1\u00cd] ... A fortiori defendants are prohibited from consistently misadvising and misinforming recipients as to the law and spuriously informing them that they are violating the law.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In acting to protect the child beneficiaries of the AFDC support grants from the diversion of funds intended to provide their basic necessities, the Legislature has chosen two separate methods. One, expressed in section 11351.5, requires the UAM who resides with an AFDC family to contribute the cost of an independent living arrangement in order not to divert money from the purposes set out by Congress and the California Legislature. The other, expressed in section 11480, is criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attack upon section 11480 is simply a restatement of the characterization of section 11351.5 advanced by them in a. constitutional context, and rejected by us above. Section 11480, by its own terms, applies where the AFDC grant is being used for the support of an ineligible person. We have previously explained that the UAM who merely pays his share of AFDC household expenses is able to enjoy a sharing arrangement because the AFDC grant, from a financial viewpoint, is what makes the household available to him. He derives a monetary savings from the grant and, within the meaning of section 11480, is using it to the extent that his contribution is less than that required for an \u201cindependent living arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first three causes of action were for class relief. The first cause of action alleged the invalidity of the UAM contribution requirements set forth in section 11351.5 and its implementing regulations. The second cause of action attacked defendants\u2019 regulations and practices concerning prosecution under section 11480. The third cause of action involved a practice peculiar to defendant Ventura County Department of Social Welfare which is not in issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The fourth and final cause of action was in plaintiff Russell\u2019s name alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and was of a hybrid nature: It incorporated previous allegations concerning her status as a class representative, the nature of the suit as a class action, defendants\u2019 resort to section 11480, and the claimed unconstitutionality of section 11351.5 and pertinent regulations. It also alleged (and the defendants concerned admitted) that Russell had raised the constitutional issues in an administrative hearing before the SDSW, where the SDSW\u2019s director had adopted a referee\u2019s decision affirming the validity of the regulations and approving the requirement of the Shasta County welfare department that plaintiff Pelley make the UAM contribution. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10950-10961.) By the prayer of the fourth cause of action, Russell sought individual relief in administrative mandamus under Welfare and Institutions Code section \u00cd0962 (which incorporates section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure); she requested that the director\u2019s decision in the administrative hearing be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The judgment of the trial court granted partial relief under the third cause of action (the court enjoined the practice peculiar to Ventura County) and denied the remaining relief sought not only under that cause of action but also under the other three causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for statutory attorney\u2019s fees under the fourth cause of action (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10962) and for attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded on equitable grounds under the first three causes of action. Plaintiffs contend that such denial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The court\u2019s rulings concerning attorney\u2019s fees are unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">As to statutory attorney\u2019s fees under the fourth cause of action, section 10962 provides that \u201c[t]he applicant or recipient shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, <em>if he obtains a decision in his favor\u201d </em>upon judicial review by administrative mandamus. (Italics added.) Even assuming that plaintiff Russell\u2019s class allegations in the fourth cause of action did not take that cause of action outside the scope of section 10962 (see <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>County of Madera </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 685, 690-691 [94 Cal.Rptr. 421, 484 P.2d 93]; <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Quitoriano </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 807 [74 Cal.Rptr. 358]), statutory attorney\u2019s fees could not be awarded to Russell under that section (nor, as requested, to \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) since Russell did not obtain a decision in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument for attorney\u2019s fees on equitable grounds under the first three causes of action is equally unconvincing. As stated in the opening brief, \u201cThese theories, under which were sought recovery of attorney\u2019s fees against defendants Carleson and SDSW [and against the Ventura County defendants under the third cause of action], were: (1) That those defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>adopted the challenged regulations, and defended them in this lawsuit, in bad faith and with full knowledge of their illegality; (2) That those defendants have benefited, and the public interest [has] been promoted, by this lawsuit; (3) That by eliminating the UAM rule this suit would have preserved a \u2018common fund\u2019 or \u2018common benefit\u2019 to the classes represented by plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first equitable theory fails if for no other reasons than that the challenged regulations were legal; there was no evidence of bad faith (even as to the practice peculiar to Ventura County which was enjoined); and there were no findings of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief makes clear that the second and third equitable theories advanced for fees are both statements of the \u201ccommon fund\u201d or \u201ccommon benefit\u201d doctrines. \u201cIt is the general rule that attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable from the opposing party in the absence of an express statutory provision or a contractual agreement that they be paid.\u201d <em>(Reid </em>v. <em>Valley Restaurants, Inc. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 606, 610 [311 P.2d 473]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.) \u201cAn exception to the general rule is found, however, in the so-called common-fund doctrine, which is applicable in equity cases and recognized as such in California. As the Supreme Court has stated: \u2018It is a well-established doctrine of equity jurisprudence that where a common fund exists to which a number of persons are entitled and in their interest successful litigation is maintained for its preservation and protection, an allowance of counsel fees may properly be made from such fund .... [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fletcher </em>v. <em>A. J. Industries, Inc. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 313, 320 [72 Cal.Rptr. 146].) \u201cUnder the \u2018substantial benefit\u2019 rule, a variant of the common-fund doctrine . . . , the successful plaintiff . . . may be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees . . . although the benefits were not \u2018pecuniary\u2019 and the action had not produced a fund from which they might be paid.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Except in the one respect involving the third cause of action, plaintiffs were <em>unsuccessful </em>in this lawsuit. But litigation success is a necessary predicate to invocation of the \u201ccommon fund\u201d or \u201ccommon benefit\u201d doctrines. (See <em>Estate of Stauffer </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d.124, 132 [346 P.2d 748]; <em>Estate of Reade </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 669 [191 P.2d 745]; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Harold G. Ferguson Corp. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 274, 277 [153 P.2d 714]; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>A. J. Industries, Inc., supra, </em>266 Cal.App.2d 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Moreover, even in a case coming within the \u201ccommon fund\u201d or \u201ccommon benefit\u201d doctrines, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under all circumstances. \u201c[T]he allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees in such circumstances rests largely in the discretion of the trial court and an appellate court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>not reverse the denial of fees unless it clearly appears that the trial court abused its discretion . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Trinity Tractor Co. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 428, 445 [83 Cal.Rptr. 783]; see also <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>West End etc. Co. </em>(1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 685, 697 [100 P.2d 318].) Quite apart from plaintiffs\u2019 near total lack of success in this case, they fail to show any abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Richardson, P.
