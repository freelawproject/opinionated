Verdict for the state. The alleged former conviction was before a police court; and the only record of it was the original complaint with minutes indorsed upon it by the clerk of court, showing that the defendant pleaded guilty and was fined. The complaint and minutes were received in evidence, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-12\"><em>George M. Fletcher, </em>solicitor, for the state.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-13\"><em>Daniel B. Donovan, Almon F. Burbank, </em>and <em>Albin, Martin Howe, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-14\">Pike, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A25\">The original complaint and the minutes indorsed upon it contained explicit evidence of all facts required for extending the j udgment. They were the only evidence of the j udgment in existence at the time of trial. The court had authority to allow a formal record to be made from them before receiving the evidence. <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>24 N. H. 344; <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>29 N. H. 530. The extended record would prove the same facts with the same force that the complaint and minutes proved. The defendant would receive no benefit by the change in the form of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It is held in Massachusetts under similar circumstances that the complaint and clerk\u2019s minutes are competent evidence of the judgment. <em>Pruden </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>23 Pick. 184, 187; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>107 Mass. 227, 231; <em>Good </em>v. <em>French, </em>115 Mass. 201, 204. Similar evidence was received, apparently without objection, in <em>Caouette </em>v. <em>Young, </em>67 N. H. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-7\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
