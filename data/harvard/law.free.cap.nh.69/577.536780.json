Facts agreed. Bichard W. Shapleigh of Somersworth died May 24, 1897, aged thirty-five years and unmarried, leaving as next of kin his mother and a brother of the half blood, James II. Shapleigh. He left a will, which, besides bequeathing his watch and sundry sums of money, together amounting to $800, contains the following provisions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201c Sixth.

He had some knowedge of legal terms, having studied law for a short time. His mother was seventy-four years old and in good health. The portion of his estate that will pass by the tenth and eleventh clauses of the will amounts to about $\u00cd8,000. Sarah has $5,000 that was bequeathed to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>by her late husband, and is also entitled to the income of some $4,000 or \u00a75,000 more under his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">Fred R. Shapleigh, also a resident of Somersworth, died April 1, 1894, leaving a widow, Marion T. Shapleigh, and no children. By his will, made prior to his marriage, he gave the residue of his estate after the payment of his debts, sundry legacies, etc., to his brother, said Richard, who was nominated and appointed executor of the will. His estate consisted of personal property of the value of \u00a715,000 and real estate of the value of $1,400. One half of the personal estate left after the payment of debts has been paid and transferred to the widow. At some time before Richard\u2019s will was made, there wras an understanding between him and James that the other half of Fred\u2019s personal estate should be equally divided between Sarah, Richard, and James.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\">Sarah, the executrix of Richard\u2019s will, is the plaintiff, and prays for a construction of the sixth and tenth clauses thereof.

Strictly speaking, there was nothing coming to Richard as an heir of Fred. The only way in which he acquired a title or right to any portion of Fred\u2019s estate was by the latter\u2019s will. He was a legatee and devisee of Fred. Being the executor of Fred\u2019s will, he must have known this fact. It cannot be doubted that he intended to give Marion something that was coming to him from her late husband\u2019s estate. Neither of the parties to the action questions this fact. He must, therefore, have used the word <em>\u201c </em>heir,\u201d not in its technical sense, but in its most general sense, as indicating the person upon whom property devolves on the death of another, either by law or by will. Cent. Diet. If he had used the words \u201c legatee and devisee \u201d instead of \u201c heir,\u201d he would have expressed his intent more specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">But it is said by James that there is a latent ambiguity in the description of the property bequeathed by this clause, and that testimony of the understanding between him and Richard, by which the personal property acquired by the latter under Fred\u2019s will was to be equally divided between Sarah, James, and Richard, is competent for the purpose of removing the ambiguity. Apparently the only subject to which the description can refer is the property coming to Richard as legatee and devisee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Fred. It is not alleged that Richard, before making his will, had actually transferred portions of the legacy to Sarah and. James by a valid conveyance, but only that there was an understanding between Richard and James that the personal estate-should be equally divided among the three. It does not appear that the understanding was of such a character as to bind Richard to its performance. In short, it is not shown that, at the-date of Richard\u2019s will, there was any binding contract in existence which could render the description ambiguous in the respect suggested. The understanding on which James relies is-not sufficient for the purpose, and cannot be considered as evidence in construing the will. Marion is entitled to whatever was coming to Richard at the time of his decease from Fred\u2019\u00bb estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">2. What interest in, and power over, Richard\u2019s estate did the-plaintiff acquire by the tenth clause of Richard\u2019s will ? An analysis of the clause may aid in its construction. It contains in the-first place a devise of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate to the-plaintiff for and during her natural life. It then confers on the plaintiff \u201c power to dispose of all and every portion thereof in her lifetime, if she shall find the same necessary to her comfortable support and maintenance, or shall desire so to do.\u201d Then, as if this provision was thought not to be sufficiently explicit, it grants the plaintiff three rights specifically: (1) The right to sell and convey any or all of the estate without license from the-probate court; (2) the right to manage the estate as if the devise- \u201c were entirely absolute ; \u201d and (3) the right to spend the whole income of the same and the principal, if she finds it necessary to do so for her comfort, or desires to do so. Finally, as if to . remove all possibility of doubt in respect to the nature and extent of the interest and power granted, it contains the following r \u201c My will and wish being that she shall fully use, have, and enjoy said estate as if it were her own absolutely during her lifetime.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The estate thus devised is, by express terms, an estate for life ;\u25a0 but powers are annexed to it which greatly increase its usefulness, although they do not enlarge it to a fee. <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>52 N. H. 267; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Society, </em>65 N. H. 139, 151, 152; <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Farmington, </em>66 N. H. 431, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The question to be answered relates principally to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s power to use the property devised. Is this power limited to providing for her reasonable necessities, or may it be exercised to gratify her desires ? This question is answered by the express grant of \u201c the right to spend the whole income of' the same [residue] and the principal, if she finds it necessary to do so for her comfort, or desires so to do.\u201d Besides this provision, there are other provisions that tend very strongly to show the same intention. As has been seen from the foregoing anal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ysis, there is a prior provision expressing this intent, but with less certainty. The testator\u2019s final expression of his \u201c will and wish \u201d that the plaintiff \u201c shall fully use, have, and enjoy said estate as if it were her own absolutely during her lifetime \u201d is unambiguous and emphatic to the same effect. The words \u201c during her lifetime \u201d were evidently intended to limit the duration of her enjoyment of the estate and powers. They may be transposed without affecting the sense, so that the sentence will read, \u201c My will and wish being that she shall fully use, have, and enjoy said estate during her lifetime as if it were her own absolutely.\u201d The bequest to Olivet College, in the ninth clause of the will, was made subject to a condition placed in the control of the plaintiff. If, in her judgment, the condition of the testator\u2019s estate did not warrant the bequest, it was to be void. The devise over after the termination of the life estate was not of the same property that was given to the plaintiff for life, but only of what remained of that property at her decease, <em>\u201c </em>whether of principal or of accrued income, in whatever form the same may be.\u201d The provision that the plaintiff should not be required to give a bond for the faithful performance of her duty as executrix, or return an inventory of the estate, or render an account of her administration, is weighty evidence on this point. There is no conflict in the evidence. It all tends to prove an intent that the plaintiff should.have power to use the property during life as she desired, or \u201c as if it were her own absolutely.\u201d If she desires to live in a more expensive style than she has lived in the past, or to travel, or to make charitable gifts, or to do any other thing within the bounds of good faith, she has power to use for the purpose the property bequeathed to her. Of course she must act in these matters in good faith, and not squander the estate for the mere purpose of preventing it from going to the remainder-man. The power is not sufficiently extensive to allow her to dispose of the property by will. It is only to be exercised during the active enjoyment of the life estate and in aid of that enjoyment. Whatever of the property shall remain after she has used in good faith so much of it as she desires, will go to the remainder-man under the eleventh clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b609-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
