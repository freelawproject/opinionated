This offer was accepted by the defendants, and on December 26, 1887, in consideration of $1,000, they conveyed to the plaintiffs, by deed duly executed, \u201c the right and privilege to put and maintain upon its stone dam, as now constructed, . . . flashboards of the width and height of three feet above the top of said dam, being one foot in width and height above and in addition to the flashboards which said Amoskeag Manufacturing Company has heretofore had the right to maintain on said dam, \u2014 such flashboards not to be renewed, replaced, or repaired during the months of March, April, and May in each year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The issue between the parties arises upon the construction ot this deed, \u2014 that is to say, the plaintiffs claim the right under their first deed to place flashboards upon the dam during the aforesaid three months two feet in width, in case any have been carried away by water or otherwise; while the defendants claim the plaintiffs cannot lawfully place upon the dam or renew any flashboards whatever during said months, or, in other words, that the plaintiffs by acquiring the right, at an expense of $1,000, to maintain three-foot flashboards for nine months of the year, , surrendered and lost the right, for which they had paid $3,525, to maintain two-foot flashboards for the entire year.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The bare statement of this issue renders it almost superfluous to say that the defendants\u2019 claim cannot be sustained. There was no exchange of rights between the parties by the second deed. Its obvious purpose was to give the plaintiffs an additional right, and no other effect can be given to it consistently with elementary rules of construction. In fact, substantially the only ground for the defendants\u2019 contention having the semblance of a reason is the extremely hypercritical one that the flashboards referred to by the word \u201csuch\u201d are the two-foot boards, because they are the ones next immediately preceding. Concede this to be so according to strict grammatical rules, and .it can have but little significance or weight. The intention of the parties, actual and expressed, to'the contrary, does not admit of reasonable doubt when the whole deed is construed together, as it must be, and still less when the competent extrinsic evidence appearing in the case is considered, as it properly may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>be. In the interpretation of deeds and other written instruments, courts are bound to effectuate the intention of the parties if it can be done consistently with the rules of law; and in this case no rule has been or can be found which prevents the carrying of that intention into effect. Even the grammatical rule invoked by the defendants does not afford a plausible pretext for a different conclusion; for while it is true that relative words are generally to be referred to the next antecedent, yet if the subject-matter, or the obvious intent of the parties, requires a different construction, such reference may he made as will effectuate the intent. <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>6 N. H. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">It appearing that the defendants are insolvent and unable to respond in damages, and that they have once unlawfully removed the flashboards on the plaintiffs\u2019 dam, and threaten and intend to repeat such unlawful act to the serious injury and damage of the plaintiffs and others, equity will afford relief by interposing its restraining power. <em>Steam Mills </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>59 N.
