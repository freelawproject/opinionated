The plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleged that it was the defendants\u2019 duty to fence their right of way, and that this duty was neglected, whereby the plaintiff, a child of tender years, was enabled to stray upon the track and was injured by moving cars. The defendants demurred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-14\"><em>Doyle $ Dueier, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-15\"><em>Charles H.

H. 53, 57, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">The statute provides that \u201c the proprietors of every railroad shall erect and maintain a sufficient fence upon each side of their road.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>159, <em>s. </em>23. But this statute is for the benefit of the owner or occupant of the adjoining land. It confers no rights upon the general public. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>67 N. H. 449, and cases cited. The fact that the plaintiff was a child does not alter the ease. \u201c The fact that the trespasser is an infant can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>not have the effect to raise a duty where none otherwise exists.\u201d <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>64 N. H. 220. If landowners do nothing to a trespasser, if they let him entirely alone, he will have no canse of action against them for injuries that he may receive. <em>Buch </em>v. <em>Company, ante, p. </em>257.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The declaration does not allege a breach of any duty which the defendants owed to the plaintiff.
