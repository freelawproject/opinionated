The declaration alleges that the plaintiff, at Weare in this county, .on the first day of May, 1897, \u201c was the owner of a large flock of sheep, and that the same were confined in the plaintiff\u2019s close at said Weare; that during said summer of 1897, while lawfully within said close, on divers days, to wit, on the fifth day of May, 1897, and on sundry days thereafter, a large number, to wit, fifty-two, of said sheep were killed by dogs; that the said plaintiff informed one of the selectmen of said town that he had sustained such damage, and requested him to proceed to the premises where the damage was done and determine whether the same was inflicted by dogs, and, if so, to appraise the amount thereof, if not exceeding twenty dollars; and if, in the opinion of said selectmen, the amount of the damage exceeded twenty dollars, to appoint two disinterested persons, who, with himself, should appraise the amount thereof, according to law. Yet the defendants\u2019 selectmen, wholly regardless of their duty in the premises, have refused and do still refuse to determine the plaintiff\u2019s damages, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, whereby the plaintiff has lost the value of his said sheep, and to the damage of the plaintiff, as he says, in the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-12\">The defendants moved to dismiss, and the motion was granted, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-13\"><em>Drury $ Surd </em>and <em>Sargent Niles, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>Taggart Bingham, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b646-5\">Blodgett, C.

His sole ground of complaint is the neglect and failure of the defendants\u2019 selectmen to perform the official duties imposed upon them by the statute. But for this neglect of duty the defendants are not liable. The rule of <em>respondeat superior </em>does not apply. Selectmen are independent public officers whose duties are prescribed by law, and not by the municipality which elects them. As such officers they are amenable to law for their conduct, but they are not agents or servants of the municipality in any such sense as to make it liable for their defaults in the performance of their statutory duties. <em>Doolittle </em>v. Walpole, 67 N. H. 554; <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Newport, </em>62 N. H. 624, 625; <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>62 N. H. 8, 18, 19, and authorities cited; <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>68 N. H. 266, 267. Such being the settled law of this jurisdiction, there is no occasion to go farther, although other defences to the plaintiff\u2019s action are not wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b646-8\">Peaslee and Young, JJ., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
