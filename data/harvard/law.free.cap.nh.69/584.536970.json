Verdict for the plaintiff. The plaintiff and one Pierce \u2014 the defendants\u2019 agent who sold the lard to the plaintiff\u2014both resided in Somersworth, and the plaintiff carried on business there. It appeared from the cross- . examination of the plaintiff that the issues involved in the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>were previously litigated before the superior court in Portland, Maine, in an action in favor of the defendants against him, in which he testified. Upon redirect examination, he testified, subject to exception, that he was arrested upon the writ in that action in Portland, as he was about to take the last train of cars for the day to return to Somersworth. Pierce was called as a witness by the defendants, and upon cross-examination \u2014 after' stating that he went to Portland in the morning of the day of the arrest on the same train with the plaintiff) arriving about ten o\u2019clock \u2014 testified, subject to exception, that he caused the action to be brought, and, for the purpose of obtaining the plaintiff\u2019s arrest, made an affidavit, in substance, that the plaintiff had possessions more than he needed for immediate use and was about to leave the state; that he know something about the plaintiff\u2019s property in Somersworth, and presumed that he had cash; that between five and six o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and within a few minutes of the time when the last train for Somersworth was to start, he pointed out the plaintiff to an officer at the depot, who arrested him; and that he (the witness) returned home on that train. He further testified on cross-examination, subject to exception, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">Q. And you made it [the affidavit] in . . .

Apparently, the defendants had no justifiable excuse for following the plaintiff into Maine, where he happened to go for the day, and causing his arrest there just as he was about to start for home. This state afforded them ample provisions for collecting their claim, among which was one for causing his arrest if he concealed his property to avoid its attach-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>merit. P. S., <em>c. 221, s. </em>8. The evidence tended to show that the defendants were unwilling to submit their claim to the usual course of litigation, but felt the need of resorting to means of \u2022oppression'to compel a settlement,\u2014 that they were conscious of some infirmity in their claim which was liable to defeat it in a fair trial relating to its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The testimony given by Pierce concerning the arrest disclosed his bias and zeal in behalf of the defendants, and was competent upon.the question of his credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Presumably, no judgment has been rendered in the Portland suit; at all events, none is alleged in the pleadings in this action. Neither party was at liberty to introduce evidence of the result of a trial of the issues in the suit, preparatory for a judgment. <em>King </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>15 N. H. 9, 13, <em>14; Hayward </em>v. <em>Bath, </em>38 N. H. 179, 185. A portion of the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of Pierce was objectionable on this ground. Immediately following a question and answer showing that the case had been tried, this question was asked the witness: \u201c And the case was decided against you, was n\u2019t it ? \u201d Besides calling for incompetent testimony, the question is objectionable, under the circum- \u2022 stances, in being declarative in form as well as interrogative. The witness was asked' to confirm a declaration positively asserted. If the answer had been in the negative, the jury might have been in doubt whether the questioner or the witness told the truth. The question having been ruled out, it was followed by another calling for the same incompetent testimony, and, this also having been ruled out, the witness was asked, \u201c Have you collected your pay ? \u201d and answered, \u201c No, sir.\u201d The natural effect of these three questions and the answer to the last one was to inform the jury that the trial of the Portland suit resulted adversely to the defendants. Although the word \u201c collected \u201d in the last question was not limited by the phrase, \u201c as a result of that suit,\u201d it was evidently used in that sense; and the question with the answer conveyed the idea which the counsel had just previously expressed by the declaration that \u201cthe case was decided against\u201d the defendants. The incompetent testimony was, by the counsel\u2019s persistence, gotten before the jury in spite of the court\u2019s ruling, and its effect was necessarily prejudicial to the defendants and rendered the trial unfair. 'For this reason the verdict must be set aside. <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Railroad,, </em>64 N. H. 27; <em>Demars </em>v. <em>Glen Mfg. Co., </em>67 N.
