The defendant bought wood of one Mitchell, to' be delivered on the cars at Bradford, for which he was to pay one dollar a cord when it was cut, one dollar when it was drawn out on the plains, and one dollar when it was loaded on the cars. Mitchell drew the wood across the plaintiff's land and yarded it there instead of the place mentioned in the contract. The defendant, knowing the wood was on the plaintiff\u2019s land, advanced money to Mitchell in addition to that then due him. The plaintiff, being uncertain who owned the wood or was responsible for the trespasses upon his land, placed two writs \u2014 one against Mitchell and the other'against the defendant \u2014 in the hands of a sheriff, with the instruction not to serve the one against the defendant unless he claimed to own the wood. The defendant, being informed by the sheriff that he had the writs and asked who owned the wood, replied that it was his; whereupon the sheriff made service of the writ against him (the one in this action) and made no service of the other. Some of the wood was then on the plaintiff\u2019s land, as the defendant knew, but has since been drawn away and delivered to the defendant according to the contract. The defendant did not authorize or direct the en.try upon, or the use of, the plaintiff\u2019s land by Mitchell, and is not guilty unless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>upon the facts stated, he is responsible for Mitchell\u2019s acts as a matter of law. The court ruled that the defendant was not liable, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-5\"><em>Albin, Martin Ilowe, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-6\"><em>Fred H.

If the defendant is responsible for the acts, it is because of his advancements to Mitchell after he learned that the wood was on the plaintiff\u2019s land, or because of his reply to' the sheriff\u2019s inquiry about the ownership of the wood. The payments furnish no ground for such responsibility. The securing of a place for \u201c yarding\u201d the wood was Mitchell\u2019s affair, and not the defendant\u2019s; and besides, so far as appears, the defendant may have understood at the time of the advancements that Mitchell had obtained the plaintiff\u2019s permission to use his land for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The plaintiff\" apparently proceeded on the assumption that the ownership of the wood fixed the liability for the trespass. His instruction to the officer was to inquire of the defendant on this subject, and not to serve the writ against him unless he claimed, to own the wood. The officer limited his inquiry accordingly. The defendant undoubtedly is estopped from denying the truth of his answer in consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s action in reliance upon it, and for the purposes of the ease must be regarded as the owner. Although ownership of the wood was a fact to be considered in determining the question of the defendant\u2019s liability, it did not establish the liability as a matter of law. The wood was composed of inert objects which would not have heen upon the plaintiff\u2019s land unless placed there by some one. The trespass arose from the acts of placing it there and not from its ownership. Unless the defendant directed or authorized these acts he was not the trespasser. His assertion that he owned the wood fell far short of being an admission that he committed the trespass. He did not say that he directed, authorized, or' ratified Mitchell\u2019s acts, and from what appears in the case it cannot be held as a matter of law that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\"><em>FJxception </em>overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-10\">Parsons, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
