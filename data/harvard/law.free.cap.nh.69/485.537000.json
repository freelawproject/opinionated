Tuttle, alleging, as amended, that the defendants Williams, Heath, Atherton, and Johnson, as directors, had illegally and fraudulently issued to Williams a certificate for 813 shares of stock in the corporation upon an illegal contract, and that he had illegally and fraudulently transferred said stock to the defendants Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle, who now hold the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-14\">The prayer of the bill is that the contract with Williams he \u2022declared void, and the illegally issued stock cancelled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-15\">The defendants filed a demurrer upon the grounds (1) that the plaintiffs had a plain and adequate remedy at law, and (2) that the bill was multifarious.

The defendants pleaded a justification. Facts found by a referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-3\">January 3,1889, the defendants Williams and Johnson, being the owners of a patent for a roller grate, and desiring to form a corporation for its operation in New England, associated with themselves three other persons and organized the New England Roller Grate Company, under the provisions of the General Laws-of this state. The purposes for which the corporation was-formed were to manufacture and vend said grates in New England ; to purchase other letters patent; to sell letters patent or any part thereof, and license other parties to use, make, or vend the invention in such place or places in said temtory as might be deemed advisable; to purchase real and personal estate; and,, generally, to do all things necessary for the proper management and advancement of the business and interests of the corporation. The capital stock was fixed at $30,000, divided into shares-of ten dollars each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\">TJpon .the organization of the corporation, on the same day three shares of stock were issued, \u2014 one each to Johnson, Williams, and one Falls, who was merely a figurehead. At the same-meeting it was voted to buy of Johnson and Williams their patent and pay therefor 2,997 shares of the corporate stock; and a certificate was thereupon made out to them accordingly, which was never removed from the certificate book. On the same day,, Williams and Johnson, by assignment on the back of the certificate, transferred to Williams, as trustee for the benefit of the corporation, 1,497 of the 2,997 shares, to be held by him and his successor in the office of treasurer, subject to the order and disposition of the directors. This certificate also was never removed from the stock certificate book; and at various times the directors passed votes in which these 1,497 shares were designated as treasury stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">The referee finds that at the time of the organization of the-corporation only 1,503 shares were issued for value, and that the pretended issue of the remaining 1,497 shares was without consideration and was illegal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">January 1, 1898, there were 813 of the 1,497 shares on hand which had not been sold. On that day, at a directors\u2019 meeting, it was voted to buy of the defendant Williams his half interest in the original patent and also his half of a later patent for the territory outside of New England. Williams was to give a clear title to the patents and was to receive the 813 shares of stock at $4.50 per share, the notes of the corporation for a certain sum, and a percentage of the profits- for a term of years. He had previously sold to Kimball the other half of his patent outside of New England, stipulating that neither he nor Kimball should \u201c have any right or power to make any license or other privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>under or relating to said patents without all the owners of the patent join in the same in writing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">Immediately after the meeting of January 1, a formal contract was made with Williams for the purchase of his half interest, and notes of the company and a certificate for the 813 shares at $4.50 per share were executed and delivered to him. He has never made a formal assignment of the patent to the company, but is willing to do so. The directors of the company at this time were the defendants Williams, Johnson, Atherton, and Heath, and the plaintiff J. E. Eider. Williams was also treasurer and general manager of the company, and secretary of the board of directors. At a meeting of the directors held in March, 1898, the transactions of January 1 were ratified. Eider was notified of these meetings, but not of their object, and did not attend either of them. The action of the directors in January and March has never been ratified By or submitted to the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">In February and March, 1898, Williams transferred the 81S shares to the defendants Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle. The plaintiffs first learned of these transfers at the annual meeting in May, and of the contract with Williams on June 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">The referee finds that the contract of January 1 was not an advantageous one for the company, that it was fraudulent in fact, and that the transfers of stock to Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle were without valuable consideration and for the purpose of enabling Williams to vote the stock in his interest at the annual election in May.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">At the stockholders\u2019 meeting in May, the stock of Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle was voted with that of the other defendants for the election of a board of five directors, while that of the plaintiffs was voted for the election of a board of three. Counting the votes of Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle, the vote was for five. Excluding such votes and assuming the validity of 500 shares of stock owned by the Eiders and hereinafter referred to, it was for three. The chairman declared the vote to be for the election of a board of five. On the ballot for directors, those who had voted for a board of five voted for the defendants Williams, Heath, Atherton, and Johnson, and the plaintiff J. E. Eider; and those who had voted for a board of three voted for Kimball, J. E. Eider, and W. II. Eider. The chairman declared Williams, Heath, Atherton, Johnson, and J. E. Eider elected. The plaintiffs seasonably filed a protest against the stock of Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle being voted upon and against their votes being counted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">The stock owned by the Eiders is a part of the 1,497 shares. One hundred shares of this they bought of the company, paying par therefor, and the remainder (500 shares) they bought of third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>parties to whom it had been sold by the company for less than par. It did not appear that the Eiders did or did not know of this fact. Kimball, as president, signed the certificates of stock that were issued when the Eiders had transfers made of their purchases from third parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">J. E. Eider has been a director since 1895, and W. H. Eider was a director from May, 1896, to May, 1897. At a directors\u2019 meeting held March 13, 1897, at which both the Eiders were present, it was voted to sell the treasury stock \u201c at any reasonable price.\u201d No stock was sold under this vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">By agreement of parties, the <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding was submitted upon the evidence taken at the hearing upon the bill in equity, so far as the same may be admissible, and the additional evidence that the returns of the company to the commissioner of corporations for Massachusetts, some of which were signed and sworn to by the plaintiffs, stated that the whole capital stock had been paid in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">At th\u00e9 stockholders\u2019 meeting in May, 1898, when the board of directors was elected, the defendants voted 1,598 shares, and the plaintiffs 1,000 shares.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-8\"><em>Charles W. Hoitt </em>and <em>Isaac W. Smith, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-9\"><em>Walter C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7b\">In any permissible view, the validity of the issue of the 813 shares cannot be sustained. Numerous reasons lead to this conclusion. One is, that these shares constituted a part of the 1,497 shares, the issue of which is found by the referee upon competent evidence to have been without consideration and void. Such being the fact, that issue must be regarded as if it had never been made, and consequently no part of the shares constituting the issue could be reissued, even to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, except upon payment of the par value, or $10 per share, unless at auction for non-payment of assessments; whereas, the sale'to Williams was for $4.50 per share. \u201c No corporation shall sell' or dispose of any of the shares of its capital stock at a price less than the par value thereof, except in sales of shares at auction for non-payment of assessments \u201d (P. S., c. 149, <em>s. </em>9); and \u201c if a corporation . . . issues certificates of stock when the par value of the shares represented by the certificates has not been fully paid to its treasurer, all certificates issued for such unauthorized stock shall be void.\u201d <em>lb., c. </em>273, <em>s. </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Another reason is, that the shares were issued to Williams for the purchase of patents to engage in business outside of New England, contrary to the corporation articles of agreement, foreign to the busin\u00e9ss in which the corporators and their succes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>;sors, the stockholders, agreed to engage, and which could not be changed without the consent of all the stockholders. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>67 N. H. 1-68. The contract with \"Williams was never \u2022submitted to the stockholders for approval; nor is there any-ground to claim that the plaintiffs in any manner assented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Still another reason is, it is found as a fact that the Williams contract, on account of which the shares in question were issued, was not an advantageous one for the corporation and was fraudulent in fact. As such, it will be set aside upon a bill in equity in behalf of a non-assenting stockholder. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>62 N. H. 537. And not only will the contract be set aside,\u2019but us the issue of the stock was in connection with and constituted .a part of the same fraudulent transaction, it was not simply illegal as to Williams, but it was also illegal as to Stillings, Tuttle, and Ames, who, it is found, were not purchasers for a valuable consideration; and consequently it is the right of the plaintiffs to have their certificates cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Finally, it may be observed that even if the defendants\u2019 contention'\u2014 that the transfer of the 1,497 shares from Johnson and Williams was a gift to the corporation and subject to the order and disposition of the directors \u2014 be adopted, it cannot avail them, because the directors would in that case be bound to execute the trust in good faith and for the best interests of the corporation. They could neither give away the stock, sell it less than par, nor for engaging in business outside that specified in the corporate articles of agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In the second case it is apparent that the <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding, if sustained, will result in little or no practical benefit, for the reason that the defendants\u2019 term of office is so near its expiration; but without regard to this consideration (as to which see <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>19 Ga. 559; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sweeting, </em>2 Johns. 184; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>17 Ohio 143), or to the further one of the plaintiffs\u2019 motives <em>(State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 R. I. 1; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>1 W. Bl. 637), we are of opinion that the information must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">It is found by the referee that at the animal meeting of the corporation on May 3, 1898, the defendants voted 1,598 shares, and the plaintiffs, 1000. Deducting the 813 shares of Stillings, Ames, and Tuttle, 785 shares, to which no objection was then or is now made, were voted by and for the defendants. But 500 shares voted for the plaintiffs by the Eiders (and acquired by them under circumstances which should at least have put them upon inquiry) were illegaly voted, because it is found that they had been originally sold by the company less than par, in violation and contravention of the statute provisions before cited. See, also, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Lumber Co., </em>59 Wis. 655; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>41 N. H. 414, 422. Deducting these 500 shares, here was a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>majority against the plaintiffs on all motions, elections, and other matters at the meeting. This being so, the election will not be set aside. It is superfluous to cite authorities to such a proposition, but see 1 Cook Stock '&amp; Stockh., <em>s. </em>620, and 1 Mor. Corn., s. 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiffs in the first case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\"><em>Information dismissed in the second </em>case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b518-7\">Peaslbe, <em>J., </em>did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
