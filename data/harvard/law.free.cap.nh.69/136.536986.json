Facts found by a referee. The defendant is assignee of J. A. Hodgdon, who was decreed an insolvent in September, 1895. The plaintiffs claim the goods under mortgages dated February 1, 1895, and April 6, 1895, both of which were duly recorded. October 28, 1895, the defendant took possession of the property and has held it ever since, claiming it as assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-10\">The property is described in the second mortgage as <em>\u201c </em>all the stock in trade and fixtures now in my store, situate on the easterly side of Main street in said Berlin.\u201d The defendant objected that the description was insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-11\">The mortgage was given to secure the payment of the mortgagor\u2019s note payable to the mortgagee, and to indemnify the mortgagee against loss in consequence of indorsing sundry notes for the mortgagor. The oath was not varied as required by P. S., o&gt;. 140, <em>s. </em>9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-12\">There was no special agreement in respect to the disposition of the property or its proceeds. The mortgagor continued his trade and business after the mortgages were executed, the same as before, replenishing the stock as required. He made no distinction between the old and the new stock, and used the proceeds as he saw fit, paying upon the mortgage debts only what He could spare therefrom. This was done with the full knowledge of the mortgagees. The business was so carried on until August 1, 1895, when the stock was attached b^ creditors of the insolvent. The goods bought after the execution of the mortgages could be and have been in fact separated from the other goods with substantial but not absolute accuracy. Both parties moved for judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Daley Goss, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-5\"><em>Albert 8.

H. 160, 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">It is immaterial that the oath was not varied. The mortgages were valid as between the parties, and as against subsequent purchasers with notice and the defendant assignee, without any oath or record. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>11 N. H. 55, 63; <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>50 N. H. 400, 402; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>58 N. H. 499, 500; <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>60 N.

H. 192, and kindred cases, has been disposed of by the decision in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Esty, ante, p. </em>55.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The plaintiffs, although entitled to judgment as against the assignee for the value of the mortgaged goods in his hands, cannot hold the goods upon the facts stated as against attaching creditors without notice. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>51 N. H. 192; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>58 N. H. 260, 263. If at the trial term it appears that there are such creditors, they may, upon proof of their claims, have judgment for the amounts thereof to the extent of the value of the goods under attachment by them. In that event the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment for the value of the mortgaged goods, if any, remaining after satisfying the claims of such attaching creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
