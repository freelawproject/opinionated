Trial by jury and verdict for the defendant. The day after the verdict was rendered the plaintiff moved to set it aside as against the law and evidence; and two or three days afterward filed a written motion to set it aside on the same ground and also in arrest of judgment and for a new trial,, specifying certain particulars wherein he claimed it was against the law and the evidence. The errors of law claimed were in-the instructions which the court gave or failed to give the jury. There were no exceptions to the charge, and no requests for instructions which were not granted. The motions were denied,, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-18\"><em>George W. M. Pitman </em>and <em>Josiah H.
