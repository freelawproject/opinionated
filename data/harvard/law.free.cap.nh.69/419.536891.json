Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant read in evidence a letter from the plaintiff, but was not allowed to read a postscript to it because the court found it contained an offer of compromise, and the defendant excepted. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his closing argument said that he \u201c should be willing to try this case before a jury composed of parties with whom he [the defendant] had dealt.\u201d There was no evidence to support this statement. The defendant objecting, the plaintiff withdrew the remark and asked the jury not to consider it. The court then and in his charge instructed the jury to disregard the remark, but did not find that its effect upon their minds had been removed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-14\"><em>Worcester, Gafney Snow, </em>for the plaintiff'.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-15\"><em>JEdgerly Mathews, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-16\">Youngs, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATf\">An offer of compromise is not admissible against the party making it. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Neilson, 4 </em>N.

H. 287, 296. \"When the statement of a party, offered in evidence, is claimed to be an offer in compromise, its admissibility raises the preliminary question whether it is such an offer; and this question may be decided by the trial judge or, in his discretion, be submitted to the jury. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>33 N. H. 151; <em>Field </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>47 N. H. 513, 521. Being a question of fact, it is not reviewable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">Whenever counsel in his closing argument goes outside the evidence for the purpose of prejudicing the jury, the verdict, if in favor of his client, will be set aside unless the presiding justice finds that the jury were not influenced by the remarks, or that their effect upon the minds of the jury has been wholly removed. <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>64 N.
