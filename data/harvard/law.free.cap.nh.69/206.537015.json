Jeremiah L. Robinson, late of Exeter, deceased, left a will containing the following provision : \u201c It is my will and I do hereby order and direct that the remaining three fourths part of all my estate shall be held by the said trustees, and all the rents, interest, and income thereof during the lifetime of my wife shall be divided by them semi-annually equally between my wife and my children and the legal representatives of such of them as may have deceased; and after the decease of my wife shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>divided by them semi-annually equally between my children and the legal representatives of such of them as may have deceased, so long as any one of my children shall be living; and when all my children are dead, then all my estate shall be divided by said trustees equally between their children and the legal representatives of such of them as may have deceased, giving to the representatives of each of my children an equal share.\u201d The plaintiffs are the trustees under this provision. The widow and the four children of the testator are dead. The defendant Curtis is the only child of one of these children ; the four defendants, Brewers, are the only children of another, and the testator\u2019s other two children left no child or issue of any child surviving them. The question is whether the defendant Curtis is entitled to one half or one fifth of the trust estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\">Eastman, <em>Young </em>O\u2019Neill, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-6\"><em>Streeter, Walker &amp; Hollis </em>and <em>Niles </em>&lt;#\u2022 <em>Johnson </em>(of New York), for Curtis.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-7\"><em>John S.

The children of a deceased child of the testator are the \u201c representatives \u201d of the child, within the meaning of the word as here used. The intention is clearly expressed. TJpon the happening of the contingency, the division is to he into as man^ equal parts as there were children of the testator who left children then surviving, and the children of each one of such children of the testator are entitled to one of the parts. As only two of the testator\u2019s children left children surviving them, the division should be into two parts, of which Mrs. Curtis, as the sole representative of one child, is entitled to one, and the four Brewer children, as representatives of the other child, together are entitled to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
