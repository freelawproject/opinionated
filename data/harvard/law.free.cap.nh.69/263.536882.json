Verdict for the plaintiff. The structure complained of is a building thirty-two feet long by ten feet wide, and next to the plaintiff\u2019s land fifteen feet high and on the opposite side nine feet high, having a roof sloping from the higher to the lower side. It is entirely upon the defendant\u2019s land, but obstructs the view and shuts out the sunlight from the plaintiff\u2019s house. It is not clapboarded or painted. It has a door (opposite the plaintiff\u2019s house) and a floor, and is used by the defendant for the storage of a sleigh and other articles. There was evidence tending to show that it was erected for the sole purpose of annoying the plaintiff. Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, his motion for a nonsuit was denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-10\"><em>Henry B. </em>Atherton, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-11\"><em>George B. </em>French, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b291-12\">Carpenter, C.

Any owner or occupant injured either in his comfort or the enjoyment of his estate by such nuisance, may have an action of tort for the damage sustained thereby.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>143, <em>sc. </em>28, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">The structure here referred to is one designed to take the place of a feuce in the ordinary meaning of the term, <em>\u2014ja </em>structure erected upon or near the dividing line between adjoining owners for the purpose' of separating the occupancy of their lands. Such a structure need not be more than four feet in height to be sufficient for its purposes. P. S.,e. 143, <em>s. </em>5. An unnecessary addition to the height is of no beneficial use to the builder. The statute was designed to prevent an act the sole effect of which would be to annoy or injure another. A building, whether it be a dwelling-house, warehouse, stable, or shed for the storage of carriages, etc., must be more than five feet in height to be of utility. It is unnecessary to determine whether the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>lature has the power to prohibit the owner of land from erecting houses or other buildings on his land with the malicious intent of injuring another by the obstruction of air and light. It is sufficient for this case that it does not appear that the legislature attempted such a prohibition in the statute under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-6\">Pike, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
