Facts found by a referee. Bostwick &amp; Turner, the contractors, employed the plaintiffs to erect a building upon land of the Lime Rock National Bank. There was never anything due to the principal contractors. After notice of the sub-contractor\u2019s claim, the owner, as an accommodation and not because it was due under the contract, paid the principal contractors two hundred dollars,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-10\"><em>Bingham, Mitchell \u00a3 Batchellor, </em>and <em>George U.

S., <em>c. </em>141, <em>s. </em>10. \u201c If a person shall . . . perform labor or furnish materials . . . for any of the purposes specified in the three preceding sections, by virtue of a contract with an agent, contractor, or sub-contractor of the owner, he shall have the same lien as provided in said sections, provided he gave notice in writing to the owner or to the person having charge of the property.\u201d <em>lb., s. </em>13. \u201cAny person giving notice as provided in the two preceding sections, shall, as often as once in thirty days, furnish to the owner or person having charge of the property on which the lien is claimed, an account in writing of the labor performed or .materials furnished during the thirty <em>days; </em>and the owner or person in charge shall retain a sufficient sum of money to pay such claim, and shall not be liable to the agent, contractor, or sub-contractor therefor, unless the agent, contractor, or sub-contractor shall first pay it.\u201d <em>lb., s. </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">Bo the words \u201c the same lien,\u201d as used in <em>s. </em>13, mean the lien by virtue of the principal contract, or an independent lien for the sum due under the sub-contract or the value of the labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>and materials furnished? If the latter is the true construction, 13 should read \u201ca like lien.\u201d If the sub-contractor\u2019s lien is for the value of what he has put into the building, it is not the same lien, although it is of like kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Section 15, which was a part of the original sub-contractor\u2019s lien law in this state (Laws 1871, <em>c. </em>1), affords further evidence of legislative intention. It provides that the owner shall retain a sufficient sum to pay the sub-contractor, and shall not be liable to the principal contractor therefor. To retain is to keep in possession, or hold back. That is, the owner is to hold back from the principal contractor the amount due the sub-contractor, lie cannot retain that which he does not possess. The provision that under these circumstances the owner shall not be liable to the principal contractor for the amount retained, unless the latter pays the sub-contractor, must relate to a fund belonging to the contractor, but for the sub-contractor\u2019s lien. The statement that the owner \u201c shall not be liable to the . . . contractor . . . therefor unless the . . . contractor . . . shall first pay it,\u201d implies that, if the contractor does first pay it, the owner shall be liable to him for the sum retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Statutes which subject the owner\u2019s property to liens created by the act of the contractor so far interfere with property rights that they have been declared unconstitutional by the courts of several states. It cannot be held that so burdensome a law has been enacted unless expressed in unequivocal terms. In those states where such a lien exists, it is expressly created by statute. In Massachusetts the statute is that the sub-contractor \u201c shall have a lien ... to secure the payment of the debt so due to him.\u201d Mass. P. S., <em>c. </em>191, <em>s. </em>1. In Maine he has a lien for labor, etc., \u201cto secure the payment thereof.\u201d Me. 11. S., <em>c. </em>91, <em>s. </em>30. In Michigan, the statute, which was held to be unconstitutional, contained the same provision, and also provided that the lien could not be affected by any agreement between the owner and principal contractor. Mich. Laws 1887, <em>Act No. </em>270; <em>Spry Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Trust Co., </em>77 Mich. 199. In Minnesota the sub-contractor has a lien to secure the contract price or value (Minn. G. S., 1894, <em>c. </em>90, <em>s. </em>6229); and in Indiana \u201c to the extent of the value of\u201d the labor, etc. Burns\u2019 B. S. Ind., 1894, c. 86, s. 7255.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The case of <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>68 N. H. 549, does not decide the question now under consideration. It may Be that upon the facts in that case the question might have been raised, although even that is not entirely clear. But the question was not discussed by counsel, nor referred to in the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The statute gives the sub-contractor the same lien that the principal contractor has and nothing more. Both as to amount and the property to which it attaches, it is limited by what the principal contractor could enforce against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The owner paid Bostwick &amp; Turner two hundred dollars after notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 lien. This was not paid because it was due, but merely as an accommodation. As there was nothing due, there was no lien. The gratuitous payment by the owner to the contractor cannot operate to give the sub-contractor any right that he would not have had if the payment had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The. plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment against Bostwick &amp; Turner, but not to a lien on the property of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\"><em>Case </em>discharged.</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
