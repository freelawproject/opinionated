Trial by jury. Verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b239-5\">A pulley in the defendants\u2019 mill broke December 23, 1896, and a piece of it struck the deceased, who was attending a spooler near by, and caused injuries from which death resulted. The evidence tended to show that the pulley was put on the shaft December 4, 1896; that it took the place of another of the same size, form of construction, and material, and was used for the same purpose and in the same way. Subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, the plaintiff1 introduced evidence tending to show: (1) That the first pulley <em>broke; </em>(2) that from June or July, 1895, to the time of the injury to the deceased, the belt on these pulleys was tight; (3) that in December, 1895, and subsequently, one of the defendants\u2019 overseers called the attention of the superintendent (who had charge of such matters) to the tightness of the belt and told him it was dangerous,\u2014 to which he replied that he didn\u2019t care about the danger, it was production that he wanted; that the same overseer also called the attention of the defendants\u2019 agent and one of their directors to the same matter, aud told him that it was liable to break the shaft or pulley,\u2014 to which the director replied that he thought the belt was too tight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b239-6\">It appeared in evidence that the defendants\u2019 servants began to remove the remnants of the broken pulley from the shaft before the deceased was removed from the room. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in his closing argument to the jury, said in substance : They [the defendants] were so anxious for production that they took down remnants of the pulley while the girl lay bleeding upon the floor. The defendants excepting, the counsel withdrew the remark and asked the jury to exclude it from consideration, as if it had not been made. At the plaintiff\u2019s request, the jury were instructed to disregard the remark, to which the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-7\"><em>Henry A..

In order to sustain his action, it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove that it was. The evidence that the first pulley, which was \u201c of the same form of construction and material, and used for the same purpose and in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>way\u201d as the last one, broke a short time before the accident; that both pulleys were driven by a tight belt; and that the tightness of the belt and the danger of its breaking the shaft or pulley were called to the attention of the defendants, was admissible in connection with the other evidence. It tended to prove-that the breaking of the pulley at the time of the accident was caused by a tight belt, and that the defendants were chargeable-with notice of the defect and the danger likely to result from-it. <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>43 N. H. 627; <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>52 N. H. 401; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>63 N. H. 25; <em>Haseltine </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>64 N. H. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The closing argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the defendants \u201cwere so anxious for pi\u2019oduetion that they took dowzzthe remnants of the pulley while the girl lay bleeding upon the-floor,\u201d contained no statement of fact which the evidence did not tend to prove, and was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled..</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-7\">Chase, did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
