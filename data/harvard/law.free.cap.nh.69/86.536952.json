Writ dated May 9, 1894. Plea, the statute of limitations. Pacts found by a referee. September 20, 1872, the parties settled the accounts between them, and signed an agreement upon the plaintiff\u2019s account book in the following terms : \u201c Sept. 20, 1872. Settled all accounts except the chargeof July 28th, 1870, of $142.40 for the horse, and the charge August 3, 1872, for $32.50 = $174.90 due I. E. Clay and int\u00e9rest on the same, and found due W. McKeen not reckoning the above $20.93.\u2014 Horse to be paid for when sold by agreement.\u201d The defendant bought the horse mentioned in the agreement of a;third person, and the plaintiff paid for it, July 28, 1870, at the defendant\u2019s request. The defendant sold the horse in 1890 without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge. Previous to the sale he had two opportunities to dispose of it to good advantage, but urged the plaintiff to allow him to keep it, and the plaintiff consented. The referee allowed the plaintiff both items due him under the agreement; and judgment was ordered upon the report, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\"><em>Fed B. Osgood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-11\"><em>Seth W.

Whether a refusal or neglect to sell when there was a reasonable opportunity for a sale and the plaintiff requested one to be made, would be a breach of the contract entitling the plaintiff to an action, need not be considered, for no such state of facts appears. When opportunities for a sale occurred the plaintiff\", at the solicitation of the defendant, consented that it should be deferred. Although the plaintiff did not agree to the sale of 1890, he has ratified it by bringing this action. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action in respect to this matter did not accrue until the sale, and as the action was begun within six years thereafter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ward, it is not barred by the statute of limitations. P. S., c. 217, <em>s. </em>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">The charge of August 3, 1872, for $32.50, was not payable at a specified time. The plaintiff might have brought an action upon it at any time after the date of the agreement. It was therefore barred by the statute of limitations when this action was begun. <em>Odlin </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>3 N.
