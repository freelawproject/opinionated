Verdict for the defendants. The plaintiff was a passenger upon one of the defendants\u2019 cars, and, in attempting to alight after the car had started, was caught by the coat and dragged some distance. There was evidence tending to show that his coat was caught beneath the outside door of the vestibule. There was no evidence that the car was defective. It was viewed by the jury. In the closing argument for the plaintiff, a claim was made, for the first time,, that the defendants were liable because of a defect in the car. The plaintiff excepted to a refusal to give the following instruction to the jury: \u201c If you find that the accident was caused by a faulty construction of the car, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s coat was caught and he was thrown, and that he was free from fault, he is entitled to a verdict.\u201d The plaintiff also excepted to the following instruction given to the jury: \u201c If he [the plaintiff] got off of a moving car, knowing or having reason to know that it was in motion, he took the chance of an injury that might result from such action, and cannot recover therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-10\"><em>Henry B.

The court cannot pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>sume that the evidence did not call for the instructions given, nor that it was of such a character as to make them erroneous.\u201d <em>Rowell </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>61 N. H. 135, 136. Neither the evidence nor the ground of the exception is stated in this case. It only appears that the plaintiff was injured in attempting to alight after the car had started. It may be that the evidence showed that the plaintiff had arrived at the age of discretion, was of ordinary intelligence, and was not under the influence of intoxication or other infirmity, and that he voluntarily, without any request by the defendants or' special occasion for so doing, attempted to alight from the car while it was in motion. If such was the evidence, he certainly would have no reason to complain of the instructions given. The act would be wholly his, and he alone would be responsible for its consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-6\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
