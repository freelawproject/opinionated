Facts found by a referee. The plaintiff made the contract for his services with J. L. Rollins, the defendant\u2019s husband. The defendant is the owner of the property, consisting of a farm, buildings, and stock upon the same, upon which the labor of the plaintiff was expended. J. L. Rollins has no property in his own right. The defendant never specially authorized the hiring of the plaintiff, but she knew he was working upon the premises and gave directions to him concerning a part of the carpentry which he did. Subject to exception, judgment for the defendant was ordered on the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-11\"><em>Sewall W. </em>Abbott, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-12\"><em>Fdward F.

There was no express contract with her. The marriage relation, the husband\u2019s impeeuniosity, the defendant\u2019s ownership of the buildings and farm upon which the labor was performed, her knowledge of the work as it was in progress and superintendence of a part of it, are facts competent as evidence upon the questions whether her husband was in fact her agent to make the contract sued upon, or wdiether she ratified the same. They do not, as matter of law, create such agency or establish such ratification. <em>Bickford </em>v. Dane, 57 N. H. 320; <em>S. C., </em>58 N. H. 185; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>62 N.
