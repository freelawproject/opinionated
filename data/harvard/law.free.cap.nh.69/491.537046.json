The plaintiff objected on the ground that it was immaterial. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the privilege of inquiring along that line for the purpose of testing the memory of the witness, and was permitted to do so to a considerable extent. The court then ruled that he had inquired sufficiently for this purpose, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-9\">The defendant offered to show that he had paid Beaudry in full. The court ruled that the evidence was immaterial.
