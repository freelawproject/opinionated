Facts found by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-13\">The appeal was taken in good faith by Hood, who assigned, as reasons for his appeal, insufficiency and ambiguity in the decree. At the term at which it was entered, counsel for Hood marked the case for trial by the court; but before the trial, at the same term, moved for leave to dismiss the appeal. Counsel for the sureties on Crippen\u2019s administration bond, who are the only parties interested adversely to Hood, objected to the dismissal of the appeal, and moved that they be allowed t-o prosecute the same for their protection, upon the ground that they were aggrieved by the decree and intended to appeal therefrom,, and would have appealed except for the appeal taken by Hood ; and for the reason that they were advised and understood that the questions as to which they were aggrieved by the decree-would be open to them upon the trial of his appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-14\">The sureties offered to prove the foregoing, and that they had substantial grounds of defence against the decree of the probate court, which they desired and intended in good faith to litigate. The court rejected the evidence, denied the motion of the appellees and granted that of the appellants, to all of which the sureties, as appellees, excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Sargent Mies, </em>for the plaintiff!</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b634-5\"><em>Leach \u00a3 Stevens, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b634-6\">Blodgett, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlP6\">In analogy to the right of a plaintiff to become nonsuit before opening' his case to the jury, it is the right of an appellant from the decree of the probate court to have , his appeal dismissed at any time before trial. <em>Doughty </em>v. <em>Little, </em>61 N. H. 365, <em>366; Simpson </em>v. <em>Gafney, </em>66 N. H. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">So far as appears, there was no error in denying the sureties\u2019 motion that they be allowed to prosecute the appeal. Their interests are understood to be adverse to those of the appellant, and their reasons of appeal to be different from Kis ; and, if this be so, the granting of their motion would not subserve their purpose, because the only reasons of appeal before the court would be those assigned by the appellant in conformity with the statutory requirement. P. S., <em>c. </em>200, <em>s. </em>2. Under these circumstances, neither law nor the furtherance of justice would require the granting of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-9\">Parsons, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
