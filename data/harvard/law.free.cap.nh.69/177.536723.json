The plaintiffs claim a lien for the price of the belting ($482.45), under P. S., <em>c. 141, s. </em>10. The belting was affixed to the machinery in the factory, October 24 to 28, 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">The claimant claims the belting under two mortgages from the defendants, both dated October 20,1894,\u2014 one, a personal mortgage of the machinery and belting then in the factory, and the other, a mortgage of the real estate.

P. S., <em>e. </em>141, <em>ss. </em>10, 16. Whether the belting was a material to be used in the erection of the box factory building or its appurtenances, depends upon the question whether it would be a fixture after it was attached to the machinery as intended. Belting may be a fixture. <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>43 N. H. 390; <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>62 N. H. 657. In determining whether it is in a given case, \u201c the purpose of the annexation and the intent with which it is made are the important considerations.\u201d <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>62 N. H. 657, 660. It is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>59 N. H. 236; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>119 Mass. 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">It is not found whether the belting became a fixture when affixed to the machinery as intended. If it did, the plaintiffs, by furnishing it, furnished a material for erecting the building or its appurtenances within the meaning of the statute. In such case, the lien w'ould attach upon the furnishing of the belting, although the belting was not affixed to the machinery until a later time. <em>Barstow </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Allen 605. The building being in the course of erection when the claimant took the mortgages, he would have constructive, if not actual, notice of the contract under which the belting was furnished, and his security would be subject to the statutory lien, if one existed. <em>Cheshire Provident Institution </em>v. Stone, 52 N. H. 365; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>60 N. H. 469, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\n<em>Case discharged,</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-11\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
