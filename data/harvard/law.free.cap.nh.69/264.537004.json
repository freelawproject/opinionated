Verdict for the \u00a1plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-15\">The plaintiff is a carpenter of many years\u2019 experience and fully understood all the duties and risks incident to that employment, one of which is the putting up of wall brackets to support the staging on which he is to work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-16\">The work on the hospital was being done by one Bradley, the owner of the property, who employed one Gay to superintend the work, hire and pay the men, and buy the materials. In the performance of these duties, Gay went to the defendants and engaged St. Lawrence, their superintendent, and all the other men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>in their employ, one of whom was the plaintiff, under an arrangement by which the defendants were to receive the same wages the men were then receiving, and twenty-five cents a day additional for each man furnished by them; and the men went to work on the hospital accordingly. The defendants were not employed on the building and had nothing to do with it aside from the letting of their men.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">By Gay\u2019s direction, St. Lawrence acted as foreman of all the men on the job, and kept their time and reported the same to Gay, who kept the pay-roll, paid the men directly hired by him, and also paid the defendants in a lump sum for the men furnished by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">Not having a sufficient number of wall brackets for stagings, Gay subsequently borrowed of the defendants about ninety of their brackets, which were used by the men on the job. These brackets were loaned to Gay gratuitously and merely as an accommodation to him; and the loan had nothing to do with the original contract of hiring the defendants\u2019 men.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">The staging on which the accident happened was built by the plaintiff and one Dana, a fellow-workman. It was about fourteen feet from the ground, and in front of a bay window. The brackets were placed on the building at each side of the window, and a plank about a foot wide, two inches thick, and fourteen feet long, made the staging. The plank touched the window, and was on the outside part of the bracket within six inches of the end of it. While Dana and the plaintiff were on the plank, one of the brackets broke at a point just outside the brace, and the plaintiff\u2019 fell to the ground, stunned and seriously injured. He testified that the staging looked all right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-8\">Several witnesses for the plaintiff' testified that they heard the defendant Dana say soon after the accident that he knew some of the brackets were old and unsound, and that he told St. Lawrence to pick them out and not to use them. This was denied by Dana and by St. Lawrence ; and Dana further testified that he knew of no unsoundness in the brackets when they were loaned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-9\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, a motion for a nonsuit was denied, subject to exception. At the close of all the evidence, the motion was renewed by the defendants, who also moved that a verdict be directed for them. The motions were denied, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-10\">Among other things, the court instructed the jury that a master is not liable unless he knew or ought to have known of the defect that caused the injury to his servant; that if the defendants knew or ought to have known that the bracket was unsafe, they would be liable; and that it was not material whether anything was paid for the use of the bracket or not, \u2014 to all which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the defendants excepted. They also asked for the following, among other instructions, and excepted to the refusal to give them :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">\u201c(1) When one person lends his servant to another for a particular employment, the servant, for anything done in that particular employment, must be dealt with as a servant of the man to whom he is lent, although he remains the general servant of the person who lent him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">\u201c (2) At the time of the accident the plaintiff was performing work for Denis M. Bradley, under the control and direction of his superintendent, Alpheus Gay. At that time he was not under the control and direction of Dana <em>&amp; </em>Provost, and for the purposes of this case he was not their servant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">\u201c (3) The fact that the plaintiff received his wages from Dana &amp; Provost is immaterial. The plaintiff being the servant of Bradley, it became the dpty of Bradley to furnish suitable brackets and appliances to work with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">\u201c(4) A lender of anything is not liable to the borrower on account of its unsafe condition unless the lender at the time of the loan had actual knowledge of the defect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">\u201c (5) If the plaintiff used this bracket in a way for which it was not intended to be used, or in a way for which Dana &amp; Provost would not expect it to be used, he cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">\u201c (6) If the plaintiff could have discovered about this bracket all that Dana &amp; Provost could have discovered by. inspection, he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-11\"><em>Burnham, Brown ft Warren </em>and <em>Isaac W. Smith, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-12\"><em>Elijah M, Topliff, David A. Taggart, </em>and <em>Reuben E.

L. 0. 43, 44, and authorities generally. But the obligation of a mere lender goes no further than this, and he cannot, therefore, be made liable for not communicating anything which he did not in fact know, whether' he ought to have known it or not. <em>MacCarthy </em>v. <em>Young, </em>6 H. &amp; N. 329; <em>Blakemore </em>v. <em>Railway, 8 </em>E. <em>&amp; </em>B. 1035, 1050, 1051; Shearm. &amp; Red. Neg. (3d ed.), <em>s. </em>197, note; 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Par. Cont. (5th ed.) 109<em>; </em>1 Add. Cont. *353; 2 Wait Act. &amp; Def. 268; Sch. Bailm., <em>s. </em>79<em>; </em>Sto. Bailm., <em>s. </em>275.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Resting rrpon such authority, and being so consonant to reason and justice that it cannot but be the law, the rule thus enunciated necessarily renders erroneous the reiterated instruction to the jury that the defendants might be liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injury \u201c if they knew or ought to have known that the brackets furnished were unsafe and unsuitable for use on the building.\u201d While a gratuitous lender \u201c must be taken to lend for the purpose of a beneficial use by the borrower,\u201d and is rightfully \u201c responsible for defects in the chattel, with reference to the use for which he knows the loan is accepted, of which he is aware, and owing to which directly the borrower is injured\u201d <em>(Blakemore </em>v. <em>Railway, supra, per Coleridge, </em>J.), it would be the grossest injustice, as well as extending the law beyond any recognized principle, to subject him to liability for defects of which he is not aware <em>; </em>and especially in a case like this, where the defect complained of was apparently as open to ascertainment by the plaintiff' as it could possibly have been to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The instruction that \u201c it is not material whether anything was paid for the use of the brackets or not,\u201d was no less erroneous upon the question of the defendants\u2019 liability. While in many respects the duties and liabilities of the parties are materially different in the ease of a gratuitous bailment and one for hire, it is enough for the present purpose to observe, that while in the former the benefit is exclusively to the bailee, and therefore the liability of the bailor for defects in the thing loaned extends only to those which are known to him and not communicated to the bailee, in the latter, the bailment being for the mutual benefit of both alike, the bailor\u2019s obligation is, and of right ought to be, correspondingly enlarged; and it is therefore his duty to deliver the thing hired in a proper condition to be used as contemplated by the parties, and for failure to do so, he is justly liable for the damage directly resulting to the bailee, or his servants, from its unsafe condition. This distinction is fundamental and of universal recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The relation of master and servant not existing between the plaintiff' and the defendants at the time of his injury, their request to have the jury specifically so instructed should have been granted. The duties and obligations of a niaster to his servant in respect of tools and appliances for performing the labor for which he is engaged, differ widely from those of a gratuitous lender to the borrower, and a radically different rule obtains in the one case than in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The defendants\u2019 additional requests, making actual knowledge of the defect the test of their liability, should also have been given, not only because the law is so, but because under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>instructions which were given, the jury might well have found that the defendants did not know of the defect and still have found them chargeable with it, on the ground that they ought to have known it.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In view of the errors to which attention has been called, it is deemed unnecessary to go farther and specifically consider other exceptions relating to the instructions given and refused; but we think it should be added that, owing to the misapprehension by the court of the obligations of the defendants to the plaintiff and of the legal relation between them, the instructions generally were not such as the -case required.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The defendants can take nothing by their exceptions to the denial of their motions for a nonsuit and to direct a verdict in their favor. If at the time the plaintiff rested he had not adduced competent evidence to sustain a verdict in his favor (as to which no intelligent opinion can be expressed without additional facts), it. is now immaterial because the defendants, instead of risking their case upon their exception to the denial of their motion for a nonsuit, went on with the trial and introduced their evidence, and the deficiency, if any, of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was supplied by one side or the other before the case went to the jury, inasmuch as it is found that at some stage of the trial there was testimony from numerous witnesses to and against the defendants\u2019 knowledge of the bracket\u2019s defective and unsound condition ; so that when all the proof was- in the case, there was no ground of exception for the reason of its insufficiency to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff, and this being so, it is wholly indifferent by which party the proof was introduced. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>55 N. H. 308, 309, and authorities cited; <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>28 N. H. 44, 47 <em>(per Woods, </em>J.). And this testimony also rendered the renewal of the motion at the close of the evidence unseasonable <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>59 N H. 298, 307), and precluded the granting of the motion to direct a verdict for the defendants. <em>Shepardson </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>58 N. H. 354, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The result is that the defendants\u2019 exceptions on this branch of the case are overruled, and their other exceptions herein-before considered sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-9\">Clark, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
