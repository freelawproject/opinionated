Facts found by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">The deeds were without consideration, and were executed and delivered to the defendant on July 29, 1895, at which time Ballou\u2019s assets and the assets of the firm, aside from the homestead, were of a value barely equal to the amount of his and the firm\u2019s indebtedness. In making the deeds, Ballou had no intention to hinder or delay his own or the firm\u2019s creditors in the collection \u25a0of their claims, but supposed that he and the firm had ample means to pay their creditors in full. The firm subsequently made losses and became embarrassed. On May 11, 1896, they made an assignment to the probate court, and the plaintiff was \u25a0appointed assignee. The firm and individual estate will each pay about fifty cents on the dollar of their respective indebtedness. A substantial part of the indebtedness outstanding at the \u25a0date of the assignment existed July 29, 1895. Subject to the \u2022defendant\u2019s exception, a decree was made setting aside the \u25a0deeds. The defendant moves to set aside the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-10\"><em>Andrews Andrews </em>and <em>Leach $ Stevens, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-11\"><em>Burnham, Brown $ Warren, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-12\">Pike, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_R\">The law respecting insolvent debtors provides that all . . . sales and transfers, whenever made, if fraudulent as to \u2022creditors, shall be void; and the assignee may recover . . . any property so . . . sold or transferred.\u201d P.

The phrase, \u201c if fraudulent as to creditors,\u201d has been construed to mean such sales or transfers as are frauds in fact, but not constructive frauds, or frauds by intendment of law. \u201c Gifts or \u25a0conveyances without valuable consideration are not mere constructive frauds, or frauds by intendment of law. They are, as against creditors, fraudulent in fact.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Esty, ante,p. </em>55. See, also, <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>93 N.
