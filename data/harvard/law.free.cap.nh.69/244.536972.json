Apparently, there was an intention to limit them to debtors who are capable of forming family relations,\u2014 that is, to individuals. Viewed in this light they seem reasonable and appropriate. The character of the property exempt is suited to the needs of debtors of this class. On the other hand, provisions for a debtor\u2019s family have no application to partnerships. Partnerships may be classed with corporations in this respect. No reasonable doubt can exist that the property named in the first eight and last six clauses of the section was not intended to apply to partnerships. In most of them, property is enumerated for which partnerships have no use. In the remainder, the language and the context clearly show it has no application to them. There is nothing in clause IX to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>that its provisions were intended for any different class of debtors than those provided for in the clauses which precede and follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The object of the statute was to prevent individual debtors and their families from being reduced to want by securing to them some of the comforts and necessaries of life for their temporary need, and tools with which the debtor may continue to earn a living. Partners are entitled to exemptions only as individuals and out of property which they individually own. <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>68 N. H. 262. The same conclusion was reached under similar statutes in <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>101 Mass. 105, and <em>Bonsall </em>v. <em>Comly, </em>44 Pa. St. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-7\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
