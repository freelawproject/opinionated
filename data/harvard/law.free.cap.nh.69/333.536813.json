But this provision shall not-be construed to prevent any person from making complaint, and instituting and carrying on prosecutions for such offences; and such complainant, whether a town or city by its officers, or an individual, shall be entitled to one half of every fine collected-through such prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">We have no doubt that this question should bo answered in the affirmative, and, moreover, it is in effect so answered in <em>Northumberland </em>v. <em>Co\u00f6s, </em>51 N. H. 557, 559, where it was held that a town is entitled to one half the fines in liquor prosecutions instituted and carried on by its agent. In other words, it is our - opinion that the explanatory and qualifying part of <em>s. </em>23 is to be - construed as if it read: But this provision shall not be construed to prevent any person, town, or city from making complaint, etc. Taking this to be so, if the selectmen neglect their duty to prosecute, or if for any reason it is deemed desirable, the town may do so; and as towns can act only through agents, they may - of course appoint an agent for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-14\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
