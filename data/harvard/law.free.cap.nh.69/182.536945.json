Pacts found by a referee. May 2, 1882, Jonas Poster loaned the defendant $500 upon his promissory note of that date, payable to Poster\u2019s order on demand, with interest annually, and secured by a mortgage of the real estate described in the writ. On the same day, after the note-had been delivered to Poster, he and the defendant agreed that if Poster, who was then about seventy years of age, should become disabled or be thrown out of employment, he should make his home with the defendant and board out the amount of the note. September 3, 1884, Poster being out of employment went-to the defendant\u2019s in pursuance of the agreement, and remained there the most of the time until June 24, 1891, both parties understanding that the board furnished in the meautime was in fulfillment of the agreement. The board at a reasonable price more than paid the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">At some time after June 22, 1891, Poster sold and transferred the note and mortgage to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration,\u2014the plaintiff\u2019having no knowledge of Poster\u2019s agreement with the defendant, nor of the defendant\u2019s claim that the note had been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">Each party moved for j udgment in his favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-12\"><em>Willis </em>6r,. <em>Buxton </em>and <em>Albin, Martin \u00a3 Hoioe, </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-13\">\u25a0 <em>Arthur W.

As both he- and the defendant understood that the board was furnished and accepted in payment of the note, it was payment. <em>Jameson </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>68 N. H. 62. Payment by the maker of a note prior to its transfer is a good defence to an action against him by an indorsee who took it after it became due, although he paid a full consideration for it and had no notice of the payment. <em>Odiorne </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Howard, 10 N.
