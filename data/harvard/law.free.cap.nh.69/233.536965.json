Said entire cut for the year is estimated to be ten or twelve carloads. We are to call for and accept the entire cut for the year, before February 1, 1894. The prices delivered on the cars at Boston points to be as follows : [naming them as in the original order].\u201d It was found that the allegations of the bill were true, and that the contract should be reformed so as to read as stated in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-11\">The plaintiffs fulfilled, and were ready and willing to fulfill, the terms of their contract in all respects; but just after February 1, 1894, the defendants refused to take any more of the clapboards, and some 261 M of the less desirable portion of them were left on the plaintiffs\u2019 hands. Between the date of the contract and February 1, 1894, the market price of clapboards fell below the prices specified in the contract. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants\u2019 refusal was due to the fall in prices. This the defendants denied and offered to prove the prices by the quotations in a newspaper, which were excluded subject to their exception. As tending to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 theory in regard to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>fendants\u2019 refusal, the plaintiffs were allowed, subject to exception, to put in evidence a letter of the defendants, dated August 24, 1893, addressed to one Ward, a dealer in clapboards, countermanding an order for clapboards, and saying: \u201cYou of course appreciate as well as any one the condition of trade, and while we regret being compelled thus to countermand to you, see no other recourse.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">July 17, 1895, the plaintiffs sold all the clapboards of the cut of 1893 which the defendants refused to take, at public auction.

S., <em>c. </em>222, <em>s. </em>8; <em>Ib., c. </em>227, <em>s. 10; Metcalf </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>59 N. H. 417; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Howison, </em>63 N. H. 382; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>67 N. H. 484, 488. It being found that the plaintiffs fully performed their part of the contract, it is immaterial whether the defendants\u2019 refusal to perform their part was occasioned by a decline in the market value of clapboards or by some other cause. The quotation of prices of clapboards in the newspaper and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ants\u2019 letter to Ward related to an immaterial issue, and the rulings as to their admission in evidence furnish no ground for setting aside the report. Neither party was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence in the one case, or by its reception in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">There was error in the assessment of damages other than in the figuring. The plaintiffs were entitled to recover the difference between the contract price of the clapboards and their market value at the time when the defendants refused to accept them, <em>i. e., </em>on or about February 1, 1894. The price obtained at the auction sale was evidence of their value at that time and also of their value February 1, 1894, although not conclusive. On what ground the referee deducted from this price the interest thereon ($114.87) from February 1, 1894, to the date of the auction, is not apparent. There is no presumption that the value increased at the rate of six per cent per annum, and unless there was evidence tending to show that it did, the deduction was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Upon the defendants\u2019 refusal to accept the clapboards, the plaintiffs were at liberty to dispose of them, and became entitled to damages for the breach of the contract. The plaintiffs could not by any acts of theirs enhance the damages. They kept the clapboards after that at their own risk and cost. Had the clapboards been destroyed by fire, the loss wTould have been theirs and not the defendants\u2019. They cannot charge the defendants with the storage of their own goods, nor with the taxes upon them. Neither are the defendants chargeable with the expense of the auction sale as such. It must be deducted from the gross proceeds in order to obtain the net auction price; but that is quite another and different thing in principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Assuming that the market value of the clapboards was the sum \u2022which they brought at the auction sale, the plaintiffs\u2019 damages would be as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">Contract price of the clapboards not taken by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">the defendants ....... $1,834.09'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">Less market value as shown by sale .... 1,307.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">$526.11</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">Interest due on notes (not questioned) . . . 43.83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">$569.94</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">To which interest should be added from February 1, 1894, to the date of judgment. The plaintiffs may, if they so elect, have judgment on the report accordingly. Otherwise, the report must be set aside on the question of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-16\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
