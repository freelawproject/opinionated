Eacts agreed. November 16, 1895, the right in equity of E. M. and C. B. Wentworth to re-, deem certain lands in Dover from a mortgage held by the Cocheco Savings Bank, one of the defendants, was sold on execution, and the purchaser afterward conveyed the same to the defendant Mowry. The bank was at that time in possession for the purpose of foreclosure, and the time of redemption expired May 8, 1896. April 29, 1896, the Wentworths filed a bill in equity against the bank and Mowry, praying for the appointment of a receiver and an extension of time for redeeming from the mortgage. A hearing was had upon the bill before a justice of the supreme court May 1, 1896, at which both the bank and Mowry were present or represented. The justice hearing the petition granted on May 2, 1896, a preliminary injunction against Mowry, restraining him from making transfer of his interest in said lands, and at the same time sent to counsel for the parties the following memorandum: \u201cNo occasion to extend year of redemption from bank mortgage. See P. S., <em>c. </em>88, <em>s. </em>26. Question of receivership can be determined upon final hearing in suit. The injunction issued will hold title to property in present shape. May 2, 1896.\u201d The Wentworths understood that Mowry would redeem from the mortgage, and that they cpuld redeem from the mortgage and the sale of the equity at any time on or before November 16, <em>1896. </em>This understanding of the Wentworths was derived from the memorandum given above, and neither that nor their understanding that Mowry would redeem was induced by anything said or done by the bank or by Mowry, except their silence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\">At a meeting of the bank\u2019s investment committee, May 4, 1896, it was voted to release to Mowry the bank\u2019s interest in the premises, and on the same day the bank conveyed the premises to Mowry by an ordinary quitclaim deed, containing, after the description of the premises, the following clause:' \u201c This release is given by reason of redemption on the part of said Mowry, he having purchased the equity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>At the September term, 1896, the Wentworths\u2019 bill was dismissed on the ground, among others, that the mortgage was foreclosed and that they had no interest in the property. November 16, 1896, they conveyed their interest to the plaintiff, who, on the same day, tendered the amount due under the mortgage and the sale of the equity to an agent of Mowry.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-5\"><em>William T. Gunnison, James Ryan, Jr., </em>and <em>John S. II. Frink, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-6\"><em>John Kivel </em>and <em>William F.

No reason has been given, and we think none can be, why this understanding and intention may not properly be effectuated, for \u201c equity will give effect to the real intentions of the parties, as gathered from the objects of the instrument and the circumstances of the ease, although the instrument may be drawn up in a very inartificial and untechni\u2022eal manner\u201d (1 Sto. Eq. Jur., <em>s. </em>168); and payment of a mortgage debt by one having an interest to protect, although accompanied by a release from the mortgagee, will operate as an assignment and not as an extinguishment of the mortgage, whenever justice requires it. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>59 N. H. 415, 417; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>61 N. H. 438, 468, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">But the plaintiff' is likewise entitled to relief upon the ground of misapprehension and mistake. It is self-evident from the memorandum order that the court intended to preserve, and supposed he had preserved, to the plaintiff\u2019s grantors, the right to redeem as against the bank mortgage until the expiration of the time of redemption from the execution sale; and not only did the grantors so understand, but the evidence afforded by the wording of the vote under which the conveyance was subsequently made, the qualifying clause in the conveyance itself, and the other admitted facts, makes it reasonably certain, in view of the situation then existing, that the defendants had the same understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Under these circumstances it would be marked injustice to permit Mowry to retain the benefit of undue advantage by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>means of the conveyance, and especially when no rights or interests have intervened so that it is not now entirely practicable to do exact justice by all parties and place them in the same position they would have been in if the mortgage had been formally assigned to him. To deny relief in such a ease would be contrary to the fundamental principles of equity jurisprudence. And we are not aware of any rule that \u00abexcludes it; for while the maxim, <em>Ignorantia legis nerrdnem excusat, </em>is equally as much respected in equity as in law (1 Sto. Eq. Jur., <em>s. </em>Ill), and while it is a well established general rule that mere naked mistakes of law are not remediable in equity (1 Sto. Eq. Jur., <em>s. </em>138; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmaniere, </em>1 Pet. 1, 15; <em>Bank of U. S. </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>12 Pet. 32, 55, 56), it is equally well established that the rule is not absolute and inflexible in its operation, and does not apply in cases where the result of denying relief will be to give the other party an unconscionable advantage and the fact of such misapprehension is admitted or clearly proved, nor in eases of imposition, misplaced confidence, or surprise, unless the plaintiff has been grossly negligent, or other rights have intervened, and the. parties cannot be placed <em>in statu quo. </em>1 Sto. Eq. Jur., <em>ss. </em>137, 138, 138 <em>c, </em>138 f, 138 <em>i.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Substantially the same general principle obtains and the same-rules apply when the mistake is one of fact <em>{lb., s. </em>138), which \u201c is ordinarily said to take place, either when some fact which really exists is unknown, or some fact is supposed to exist which really does not exist.\u201d <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>12 Wis. 112, 125, <em>per Dixon, </em>C.
