Trial by the court. The expense of caring for the horse while it was sick and of no use to the plaintiff was $14.50. The horse died, and it will cost the plaintiff $35 to replace it by another equally serviceable, although he could not have sold his hoTse in the market which his neighborhood afforded for more than $20.

H. 342; <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>52 N. H. 569, 581. The market value of goods which have been destroyed is not the measure of the injured party\u2019s damages, but only evidence to be considered on that question; for \u201c a party may be greatly injured by the loss of goods which he cannot sell.\u201d <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Grant, supra. </em>Compensation being the rule, the plaintiff\u2019s judgment was for the correct amount. It will take $49.50 to put him in as good condition as he was before the wrong was done; for he paid $14.50 for care of the horse when it was of no use to him <em>(Cornell </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>58 N. H. 534), and it will cost him $35 to replace it by another as serviceable as the one he lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-15\">Parsons, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
