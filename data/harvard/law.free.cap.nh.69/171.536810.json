The oven was built by the plaintiff in accordance with the contract. It did not work in a satisfactory manner on account of the fault of the plans. The failure of the oven to work in a satisfactory manner being attributable to the defects in the plans furnished by the defendant, and not to the failure of the plaintiff to perform his contract, he is entitled to recover the contract price for the performance of his undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant on cross-examination, and subject to his exception, testified that he had put his real estate out of his hands before he went into the bakery business and about two months before the contract was made, and also that he had conveyed certain personal property to his wife since the making of the contract. Upon rebuttal, the plaintiff, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, introduced a copy of the defendant\u2019s deed conveying away his real estate for the purpose of showing the date. The object of introducing the deed was to show that the defendant, being mistaken or untruthful as to its date, would be more likely to be unreliable in other particulars. This was contradicting him on a collateral issue. To what extent this should be carried for the purpose of disparaging the credibility of a witness, or how far the cross-examination of a witness should be allowed to go for a like purpose, are questions of fact to be determined at the trial term. <em>Gutterson </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>58 N.

H. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, after inquiring particularly as to the condition of the oven at a certain time and after counsel for the defence had protested that his inquiry upon this point had been clearly answered, remarked, \u201c This is a pretty serious matter when a man testifies to what is not true in a matter of as great importance as this, and I don\u2019t want him or his counsel either to-say that he did not understand the question,\u201d to which the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The remark of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, although reprehensible, affords no ground for setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b200-9\">Pike, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
