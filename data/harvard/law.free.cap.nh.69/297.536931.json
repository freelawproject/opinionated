Facts found by the court. The plaintiffs are dealers in funeral supplies in Boston. They claimed title to the goods under a written memorandum, dated April 17,1896, signed by them and one Yeaton, providing in substance that the title to the goods attached which were furnished him by them should not pass to Yeaton until fully paid for. Yeaton carried on the undertaking business in Newport with the goods so furnished until February, 1897, when the goods were attached by creditors of Yeaton, who had no notice of the facts relied upon by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-11\">At the June term, 1897, the case was recommitted for further findings which are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-12\"><em>Hosea W. Parker </em>and <em>Ira Colby, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-13\"><em>Albert S.

S., <em>e. </em>140, <em>ss. </em>23, 24) does not destroy the plaintiffs\u2019 title. The reservation to the seller of title to the goods until payment, valid within the jurisdiction where the contract was made and the goods delivered, was not rendered invalid by the fact that Yeaton subsequently brought the property within this jurisdiction. Upon this point the case cannot be distinguished from <em>Cleveland Machine Works </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>67 N. H. 348, where the question was fully considered and determined adversely to the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-16\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
