The plaintiff\u2019s claim is for labor performed under this contract, and for money loaned to and goods bought for the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-15\">The plaintiff offered in evidence his diaries for the years 1891 to 1896, inclusive, verified by his suppletory oath. They contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>daily memoranda of purchases made and various kinds of work done for several persons, and. of various transactions with them. The entries are original, and were made by the plaintiff at the times they purport to have been made, which were at or near the times of the .transactions to which they relate.

The referee found that the entries for work and for groceries \u201c do not show an intention to charge the deceased with a debt,\u201d and that all of the entries are \u201c not in any usual mode of keeping accounts.\u201d He also excluded the diaries, and denied the plaintiff\u2019s offer to explain and interpret some of the entries therein, to both of which rulings the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b631-7\"><em>Worcester Snow, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b631-8\"><em>Arthur L.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATMs\">The exclusion of the diaries altogether was erroneous. They were the plaintiff\u2019s books of account, kept by himself as a daily and original record of his transactions and business, and as such they were competent evidence in his favor, in the absence of anything in their appearance or character, or in the circumstances of the case, indicating that they were not kept with honesty and accuracy. Nothing of this nature is found or suggested. On the other hand, the principal contention of the defendant is that the entries against his intestate should be rejected because they are not in such a form as the law requires; and it is upon this ground also that the finding of the referee, \u201c that the entries do not show an intention to charge the deceased with a debt,\u201d must be understood to have been based, in view of his additional finding that all of the entries are \u201c not in any usual mode of keeping accounts.\u201d It thus being apparent that the books were excluded solely because of the form of the entries therein, it becomes necessary to consider this phase of their competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">It was decided in the leading case of <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>13 N. H. 420, 425, that \u201c there is no particular form in which the book of a party must be kept, in order to its admission as evidence in support of his account;\u201d that it is sufficient if it shows of itself a charge against the adverse party, and the nature of the charge. See, also, <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>41 N. H. 232, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Testing the plaintiff\u2019s entries in the respect complained of by the rule laid down in <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>or by a comparison of them with the charges which were held in that case not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u25a0objectionable in point of form, the unavoidable result is in favor of their competency. It is true that in the items for labor, which constitute the major part of the account, no prices are \u25a0carried out; but their competency as evidence does not hinge upon this fact. The fair presumption is that, when the labor was performed, no price was agreed upon, and therefore its reasonable value may be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">- Nor can it be properly held that these entries, and those for groceries also, \u201c do not show an intention to charge the deceased with a debt.\u201d The law looks to the substance rather than to the form of things. A statement in one\u2019s book that he performed labor for, or furnished goods or lent money to another, is ordinarily understood to mean, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that he intended to charge that person with such labor, goods, or money. An entry in a diary containing daily memoranda of a person\u2019s transactions, \u201c p. m. Hauling sawdust for Maleham,\u201d is hardly less expressive of an intention to charge Maleham with the labor than it would be if in a formal account book in this form: \u201c Maleham, Dr. To hauling sawdust, p. m.\u201d Such entries show the nature of the charge, the date of the labor, for whom performed, its duration and its kind, and we have no doubt of their competency and sufficiency as charges. Certainly, they afford more particulars than are afforded by \u25a0ordinary time-books, which are held to be competent under the rule in reference to account books. <em>Mathes </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>8 Met. 269; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>White, </em>132 Mass. 477, 479. So, also, a book containing straight marks, made at or about the time of the delivery of loads of sand, has been held to be competent in an action to recover pay for the sand. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Shay, </em>145 Mass. 162. And even marks upon a shingle and notches in a stick have been admitted in evidence. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Field, </em>14 Me. 30. In brief, no arbitrary rule exists, or can be laid down without \u25a0occasioning a frequent failure of justice, as to the form in which entries must be made to entitle them to be received as charges in favor of the party making them; and, in passing upon their sufficiency, regard is necessarily to be had to his education and his methods and knowledge of business, as evidenced by the \u25a0entries or through other proper sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The result of our conclusions is, that all original entries upon the diaries relating to items of account in issue in this action, whether for labor, for goods, or for money paid or loaned, in sums not exceeding $6.67 <em>(Bassett </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>11 N. H. 167; <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Eldredge, </em>42 N. H. 153, 158; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>60 N. H. 152), which of themselves show an intention to charge Male-ham with the subjects thereof, are competent evidence, and should have been received and considered by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony in explanation and interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the entries was properly excluded. It would not have been competent at common law, and, the defendant being an administrator, it is not competent under the statutes of this state. P. S., <em>c. </em>224, <em>s. 16; Stevens </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>68 N.
