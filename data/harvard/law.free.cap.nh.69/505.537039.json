The prayer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>for a reversal of the decree of the probate court, and an injunction to restrain Berry from interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 property, The defendants demurred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-5\"><em>George W.

H. 336, 340; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Page, </em>54 N. H. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The act of congress approved July 1, 1898, entitled \u201c An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States,\u201d went \u201c into full force and effect upon its passage,\u201d with the proviso that \u201c no petition for voluntary bankruptcy shall be filed within one month of the passage thereof, and no petition for inyoluntary bankruptcy shall be filed within four months of the passage thereof. Proceedings commenced under state insolvency laws before the passage of this act shall not be affected by it.\u201d This provision in respect to the taking effect of the act differs materially from that contained in the bankruptcy act of March 2, 1867, which by its terms took effect* \u201c as to appointment of officers created hereby and the promulgation of rules and general orders, from and after the date of the approval; <em>provided, </em>that no petition or other proceedings under this act shall be filed, received, or commenced before the first day of June, <em>Anno Domini, </em>1867.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The act of 1898 provides in terms that it shall go \u201c into full force and effect upon its passage.\u201d The proviso simply postpones the time when the rights secured by it to both debtors and creditors may be exercised. The rights themselves accrued from the passage of the act, and there is no apparent reason why it should go into effect on one date for debtors voluntarily availing themselves of its provisions, and on a date three months later for creditors desiring to put their debtors into bankruptcy. If such were the intention of the law, there, would be a period of three months in which the act of congress would control the proceedings if they were begun by the debtor, and the state law* if they were begun by creditors; and if within this time creditors filed a petition under the state law, the debtor might oust the. state court of jurisdiction by voluntarily filing a petition under the bankruptcy act. The provision that \u201cproceedings commenced under state insolvency laws before the passage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>this act shall not be affected by it,\u201d seems conclusive evidence that this was not the intention of congress; for the provision, that this act shall not affect proceedings begun under the state law before its passage, necessarily implies that no proceedings can be brought under state insolvency laws after that date. <em>Parmenter Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>172 Mass. 178. Chapter 201, P. S., was suspended October 20,1898, when the plaintiffs\u2019 creditors filed their petition, and all proceedings under it were void.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>Demurrer </em>overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-6\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
