After making bequests of small value to his children, the testator-provided as follows: \u201c Fifth \u2014 I give, bequeath and devise unto-my wife, Janet Mack, the use and income of all the rest and remainder of all property of which I may die possessed, for. and during her natural life, the same to be in lieu of her claim to-dower, homestead, and distributive share out of my estate, and from and after the decease of my said wife, I give, bequeath and devise all my said property of which T may die possessed, in five equal shares, unto my sons Albert F. Mack, George C. Mack, my daughter Ellen B. Hildreth, wife of William E. Hildreth of' Grand Rapids, Michigan, my grandchildren Charles A. DeLoyd, John A. DeLoyd, George E. DeLoyd and Bessie M. DeLoyd, children of my daughter Elizabeth C. DeLoyd, hereinbefore mentioned, and my grandchildren Isabella A. Eddie and James N.

Janet Mack, the testator\u2019s widow, has recently deceased, having occupied the property during her lifetime, leaving it to be divided into five equal shares, the three children receiving one fifth each, the DeLoyd children one fifth, and the Eddie children one fifth. The Eddie children are both dead, having died under age, unmarried, and without issue, one before the testator\u2019s death and the other shortly afterward.

P. S., <em>c. </em>186, <em>s. </em>12; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>64 N. H. 401. If, however, the gift to the Eddie grandchildren was to them as a class of one fifth of the estate, then only the survivors of the class take, and the Eddie child surviving the testator became entitled to the whole fifth share. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>64 N. H. 328, 330; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>61 N. H. 144; <em>Swallow </em>v. <em>Swallow, </em>166 Mass. 241. In the latter view, the whole \u25a0estate is disposed of by the will; in the former, the testator died intestate as to one tenth of his estate. The question is, what did the testator intend ? <em>Swallow </em>v. <em>Swallow, supra. </em>\u201c Though the bequest be to individuals by name, yet if it appears upon the whole will that the testator considered them as constituting a class, and intended that the whole should go to the survivors, that intention will prevail.\u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>146. The testator intended to dispose of his whole estate and expressly says : <em>Al </em>Said DeLoyd children, together, to take one share, or one fifth of my said property, and said Eddie children, together, one fifth.\u201d He divides his whole estate into five equal shares, one of which ho gives to each of his living children and one to the representatives of those deceased. The four DeLoyd grandchildren together receive no more than the two Eddie children. The number of equal shares in the estate is determined by the number of the testator\u2019s children, without reference to the number of grandchildren in each family. If there were no will, the surviving Eddie child would take as the mother\u2019s representative one fifth of the estate, subject to the widow\u2019s right. Except for the minor bequests of small value, the provision for the widow and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>preservation of the interests of the grandchildren during their minority, the will does not disturb the equal division of the testator\u2019s property among his children and their representatives which the law would have made had there been no will. Hence a different division was not intended to be made. A construction of the will which would increase the remaining shares by the reduction of one, would defeat the testator\u2019s expressed intention by making unequal that which he said should be equal. \"W\"e think it clear the testator intended the surviving children or child of his daughter Isabella should have one fifth of the estate,\u2014that he considered her children together as a class. Hence the surviving child became entitled upon the death of the testator, as the only representative of the class, to the whole of the fifth share, which vested immediately upon the testator\u2019s death, despite the intervening life estate and the fact that the enjoyment of the legacy was withheld until the child should arrive at the age of twenty-one. <em>Benton </em>v. Benton, 66 N. H. 169; <em>Parker </em>v. Leach, 66 N. H. 416. This grandchild having died since the vesting of the legacy, the father, William Eddie, upon the facts stated is now entitled to the whole share. P. S., <em>c. </em>196, <em>ss. </em>1, 2: <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Benton, supra; Whitten </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>18 N. H. 88, 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">There is no occasion for the appointment of a trustee to care for the shares of such of the grandchildren as are not yet twenty-one. There is no reason why that duty may not properly be performed by the executor. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>61 N. H. 643; <em>Bell </em>v. Sawyer, 59 N. H. 393; <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Burns, 58 </em>N. H. 405; <em>Ham </em>v. <em>Ham, 58 </em>N. H. 70. That the executor should do so appears to have been intended and expected by the testator. Whether in the due administration of his trust the executor should join with the other legatees in a conveyance of a part of the estate; whether to carry out the purposes of the will the executor should now be licensed to sell the whole real estate; whether the real estate should be divided or sold, by proceedings in partition, or the interests of the minors preserved undivided or in severalty after partition, are questions upon which the facts before us are insufficiently stated to authorize any expression of opinion, and upon which the executor, as trustee, probably will not need instruction, while authority for such action as may be necessary can be obtained from the probate court.
