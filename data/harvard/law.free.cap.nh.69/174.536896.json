Facts agreed. October 2, 1891, Dugan, then and for some time before commorant in Belknap county, was committed to the state prison for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tbe term of three years, to which he was sentenced by the supreme court for that county, and since that time has been a pauper. April 25, 1894, by order of the governor and council, he was transferred from the prison to the asylum as an insane person. The governor and council notified the plaintiffs that the state would not be responsible for his support in the asylum after April 80, 1896, and the plaintiffs notified the defendants that after that time his support would devolve upon them. The action is for the expense of his support after April 30, 1896. He is not chargeable on any other county, or on any town or person.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-5\"><em>M A. </em>tf <em>G.

S.,. <em>c. </em>255, <em>s. </em>4. There is nothing in the statute indicating that the liability of the state for the support of a prisoner transferred to the asylum is to terminate at the end of the term for which he is sentenced. He is to be kept in the asylum at the state\u2019s expense until he is discharged according to law. The place of his residence or settlement is immaterial. The state prison is not a \u201chospital\u201d or \u201cother charitable institution\u201d within the meaning of the act of March 21, 1895, which provides that \u201cAny person who shall become a pauper or public charge while at any orphans\u2019 home, hospital, home for the aged, or other charitable institution, or within three months after leaving such institution, shall be chargeable for support to the county in which he last resided before entering such institution, unless such person has-a settlement in some town, or some other county is liable for his support.\u201d Laws 1895, <em>c. </em>54.
