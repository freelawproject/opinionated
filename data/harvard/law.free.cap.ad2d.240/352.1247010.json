Rather, when the plaintiff moved, <em>inter alia, </em>to strike their answer for failure to respond to the discovery notice, the City defendants cross-moved for a protective order. The Supreme Court granted the cross motion and vacated the plaintiff\u2019s notice for discovery and inspection in its entirety, finding it to be palpably improper, overbroad, and burdensome. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">While the discovery notice included many improper demands, it also contained numerous appropriate requests for information material and necessary to the prosecution of this action <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3101 [a]). Under the circumstances, the City defendants should not be rewarded for their lack of diligence by the grant of a belated cross motion for a protective order vacating the entire discovery notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The amendment of CPLR 3122 was intended to encourage the parties to resolve discovery disputes without court intervention in order to reduce the volume of motion practice <em>(see, </em>Mem of Off of Ct Admin, 1993 NY Legis Ann, at 76). Amendment of the statute contemplated a reduction of litigation costs and judicial time\u2014goals of the Bench, Bar, and the litigants themselves. The conduct of the parties here undermined the spirit and the letter of CPLR 3122, the plaintiff by including many improper requests and the City defendants by never providing any discovery, even as to those items to which the plaintiff was clearly entitled to responses. This was only escalated by motion practice and an appeal. The City defendants should now provide answers to the proper discovery requests and object to the improper ones. Only then can the parties determine if court intervention is required. Rosenblatt, J. P., Thompson, Santucci, Altman and Friedmann, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
