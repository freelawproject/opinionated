R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">California state prisoner Nathaniel Williams appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, challenging the Board of Prison Terms\u2019s (\u201cthe Board\u201d) 2002 decision denying him parole. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo, <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Williams contends that his due process rights were violated because the Board\u2019s decision violated his plea agreement. We reject this contention because the record contains no evidence of the terms of any plea agreement. <em>Cf. Buckley v. Terhune, </em>441 F.3d 688, 699 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (holding that a federal habeas court may grant specific performance of a plea agreement in the face of evidence that the state has breached the terms of such an agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Williams contends that the Board\u2019s reliance on a \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d allegation that was dismissed violated his protection against double jeopardy. We reject this contention because the Board\u2019s decision did not subject him to either a second criminal prosecution or to multiple punishments for the commitment offense. <em>See United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">We conclude that \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). We reject Williams\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s reliance on the nature of the commitment offense as justification for the denial of parole violated his right to due process, especially in light of the fact that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by other factors in the record. <em>See Irons v. Carey, </em>505 F.3d 846, 852-54 (9th Cir.2007). Consequently, the California court\u2019s decision rejecting this contention was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b198-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
