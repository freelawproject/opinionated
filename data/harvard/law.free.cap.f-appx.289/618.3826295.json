At sentencing, the district court departed upward from the advisory Guidelines pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3 (2006) because Moore\u2019s criminal history category under-represented the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and the likelihood that he would recidivate. The district court sentenced him to a total term of eighty-seven months imprisonment. Moore\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether the district court erred by imposing an upward departure based on Moore\u2019s criminal history. Moore has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-23\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), appellate review of a district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">A district court may depart upward based on the inadequacy of the defendant\u2019s criminal history if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.... \u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>318 F.3d 585, 588 (4th Cir.2003). The guideline further directs that \u201c[i]n a case in which the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 (a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Our review of the record shows that the district court properly determined that Moore\u2019s criminal history category underrepresented his criminal history. The court then properly moved incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level and chose a sentence from within that range of imprisonment. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination of Moore\u2019s sentence and therefore affirm. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew her motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
