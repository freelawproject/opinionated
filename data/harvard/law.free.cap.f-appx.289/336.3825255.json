Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA issued its own decision, so we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. When considering a petition to review a BIA final order, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Under this test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">First, petitioners argue that exceptional circumstances existed that should have applied to excuse the untimely filing of their asylum application. The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). An alien may apply for asylum if \u201cthe alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An alien may apply for asylum more than one year after arrival if the alien \u201cdemonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d that an application was untimely or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the delay. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">We have held that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956-57 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003)). Further, the timeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law that we could review pursuant to the REAL ID Act. <em>Chacon-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA erred in holding the asylum application untimely and we dismiss the petition as to asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Second, petitioners argue the BIA erred in not reversing the denial of their withholding of removal claim because Alvarado suffered past persecution for his political opinion. Alvarado states he was politically active in the Ecuadorian Roldosista Party (\u201cPRE\u201d) and Unidad Democr\u00e1tica Ecuatoriana (Ecuadorian Democratic Unity) (\u201cUDE\u201d) parties, and that Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) persecuted him because of his refusal to run for political office on their behalf. He asserts he will face future persecution because his family are \u201cpolitical militants,\u201d and the government cannot protect him. He also argues the IJ and the BIA erred in finding he was subject to threats alone and ignored the physical attack on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that \u201cit is more likely than not he will be subject to persecution based upon race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\u201d <em>Javier Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765-766 (11th Cir.2007). The statute also covers persecution by nongovernmental groups that the \u201cgovernment cannot control.\u201d <em>Jaime Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2006). The applicant must show either past persecution on a protected ground, which raises a rebuttable presumption of future harm, or show a future threat to his life or freedom likewise based on a protected ground. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation ... [and m]ere harassment is not persecution.\u201d <em>Javier Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 766. Menacing phone calls and threats are not sufficient evidence of past persecution to require reversal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Where the applicant received threats, attempted attacks, and was physically attacked on account of his political opinion over a period of several months, we have held that such mistreatment is sufficient evidence of past persecution. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007) (asylum context). Resistance to forced recruitment does not by itself qualify as persecution on account of political opinion. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815-16, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Likewise, evidence of acts of private violence or failure to cooperate with guerillas \u201cdoes not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Jaime Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257-58. Family members living unharmed in the home country weakens a claim of well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1259. If the agency does not find the alien\u2019s testimony incredible, we take the testimony as true. <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1254 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Although the BIA misinterpreted the record by failing to connect the beating Alvarado suffered with the threats by FARC, this error does not require reversal. Other evidence shows that FARC was interested in recruiting Alvarado to act as their political agent or based on his access to medicinal supplies or money, and not persecuting him on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Third, Alvarado argues that substantial evidence does not support denial of his claim for CAT relief, as he will be constructively tortured by the Ecuadorian government because it cannot adequately protect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In a CAT claim, the burden of proof is on the applicant to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he would face torture if returned to his country. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. He must also show this torture will be done with the acquiescence of the government. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007). The burden of proof of an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the statute is higher than that for an asylum applicant. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The decision to deny the CAT application is supported by substantial evidence because petitioners have not presented any evidence that they will face torture by or with the acquiescence of the Ecuadorian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review with regard to asylum, and deny the petition for review with regard to withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
