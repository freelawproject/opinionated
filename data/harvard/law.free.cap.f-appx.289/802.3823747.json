He alleged that following his arrest on a state felony charge, the defendants violated his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention (the Convention) because they failed to advise him or insure that he was aware of his right to consulate notification and consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">The district court sua sponte determined that Adi\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. Contrary to Adi\u2019s contentions, the district court was not required to give him an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>respond to the time-bar issue prior to dismissing his complaint. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i); <em>Jackson v. City of Beaumont Police Dep\u2019t, </em>958 F.2d 616, 619 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Adi argues that he first became aware that he suffered an injury and that the defendants violated his rights under Article 36 of the Convention on June 12, 2007, after reading the decision in <em>Jogi v. Voges, </em>480 F.3d 822, 834-35 (7th Cir.2007), which concluded that a foreign national could pursue a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 for a violation of his Article 36 rights. Adi\u2019s argument is without merit. Because Adi knew at the time of his arrest and conviction that the defendants failed to advise him of his rights under the Convention, he was aware of the injury which is the basis of his action. The fact that Adi did not know that he had a \u201clegal cause of action\u201d under \u00a7 1983 is not relevant in determining the date on which the limitations period began to run. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995). Because Adi was aware of the injury at the time of his arrest and conviction, the limitations period ended, at the latest, in April 2001, two years after Adi\u2019s criminal conviction. Adi\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint filed in 2007 comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Adi contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint to allege that he first became aware that the defendants violated his rights under Article 36 on June 12, 2007, after reading the decision in <em>Jogi. </em>As discussed above, the <em>Jogi </em>decision is of no help to Adi. Thus, any amendment would have been futile, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Adi\u2019s motion. <em>See Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir.2003). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We note that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Adi\u2019s complaint as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Adi has already accumulated two prior strikes. <em>See Adi v. Management &amp; Training Corp., </em>282 Fed.Appx. 352 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished). Further, we are imposing another strike in <em>Adi v. United States Marshals Serv., </em>289 Fed.Appx. 801 (5th Cir.2008), decided today. As Adi has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal while he \u201cis incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g). Adi should review any pending matters to insure that none is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">AFFIRMED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
