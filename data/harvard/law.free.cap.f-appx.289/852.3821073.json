Ware and Lauren B. Bovill-Ware filed this action alleging conversion and violation of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendant Tow Pro Custom Towing and Hauling, Inc. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">In June 2000, the Wares bought a used 1996 Kenworth truck from a truck dealer in Charlotte, North Carolina, for $47,915.00. In October 2000, Danny Ware had the vehicle inspected at the TA Truck-stop in Nashville, Tennessee. The truck-stop mechanic discovered certain commercial motor vehicle safety violations. Danny Ware left the truck in the parking lot of the truckstop. He claims to have obtained a verbal communication from an employee of the truckstop that he could leave the vehicle there for an indeterminate amount of time. Danny Ware never paid any vehicle storage fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">Eight months later, the Wares initiated a breach of warranty action against the vendor of the truck in state court in Charlotte, North Carolina, based on the defects discovered at the TA Truckstop. While that case was pending, the truck remained at the TA Truckstop in Nashville.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">On July 10, 2002, twenty-two months after the Wares left the truck at the TA Truckstop, a security manager at the TA Truckstop requested that Defendant Tow Pro remove the truck from the premises. Tow Pro impounded the vehicle at its storage lot in Nashville. The truck did not have a license plate or any other indicia of ownership. On July 12, 2002, Tow Pro sent a Form SF-0957 to the Tennessee Department of Safety requesting the name and address of the owners and lienholders of the vehicle. The Department of Safety instructed Tow Pro to contact the Georgia Department of Motor Vehicles for current information. On August 13, 2002, Tow Pro did so, but received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">On October 7, 2002, Danny Ware contacted Tow Pro, communicating that he owned the truck. Tow Pro\u2019s manager told Ware that he must pay $4,996.63 (which included a $125.00 towing fee and eighty-nine days of storage at $50/day) before Tow Pro would release the truck. On October 8, 2002, Tow Pro told the Wares\u2019 attorney that the truck was being held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>lieu of the outstanding charges for vehicle storage at the TA Truckstop, and that it was subject to sale at a foreclosure sale within ten days if the charges were not paid and the vehicle retrieved. On October 9, 2002, the Wares\u2019 attorney sent a letter to Tow Pro acknowledging Tow Pro\u2019s claim for $4,996.63 in towing and storage fees, as well as the fact that Tow Pro intended to sell the vehicle at a public auction if the Wares did not pay the storage charges within ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On October 15, 2002, Lauren Ware received a certified mail notice sent by Tow Pro advising that the truck would be sold at a possessory lien foreclosure auction if not retrieved within ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">On October 31, 2002, and November 7, 2002, Tow Pro published notices of the sales of the truck in the <em>Nashville Record. </em>The identical notices stated that Tow Pro would sell the vehicle, a \u201c1996 Kenworth T-600 1XKAD89X2TR,\u201d on November 14, 2002. The notices did not set out the specific address of the sale or the owner of the truck. Tow Pro did not expressly notify the Wares or their attorney of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">On November 14, 2002, Doug Williams, President and Manager of Tow Pro, purchased the truck at the referenced sale for the sum of $200.00. He was the only buyer at the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Plaintiffs claim that their counsel wrote to Tow Pro in September 2003 regarding the status of the truck and proposing a settlement, and that Tow Pro demanded $20,000 before it would release the truck. An invoice dated July 3, 2003, reflects this demand. However, the truck had been sold ten months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">On June 15, 2004, the Wares filed this lawsuit. Tow Pro filed a countercomplaint seeking to recover its towing and storage costs. Tow Pro also filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing <em>inter alia, </em>that the Wares\u2019 claims were preempted by federal law. On January 12, 2007, the district court granted the motion. <em>See Ware v. Tow Pro Custom Towing &amp; Hauling, Inc., </em>No. 3:04-0528, 2007 WL 108885 (M.D.Tenn. Jan. 12, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">The district court held that the Wares\u2019 conversion claims, \u201cincluding any claims regarding alleged unauthorized storage charges or Defendant\u2019s alleged violations of Tennessee statutes regarding notice as to storage fees and sales,\u201d were preempted by federal law, namely the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1610, and the ICC Termination Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 899 (FAAAA), codified at 49 \u00a7 14501. The court held that the Wares\u2019 claim under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Term Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 47-18-101-125, lacked evidentiary support. The court further concluded that the TCPA, which prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting the conduct of any trade or commerce,\u201d did not apply to the conduct at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Thereafter the parties stipulated to the dismissal of Tow Pro\u2019s counterclaim. On February 23, 2007, the district court entered an order constituting final judgment for Tow Pro.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">The Wares argue on appeal that the district court erred in granting Tow Pro summary judgment on their claims that: (1) Tow Pro committed the tort of conversion by charging unlawful storage fees; (2) Tow Pro\u2019s failure to provide them sufficient notice of the storage fees and sales constituted conversion; and (3) Tow Pro\u2019s conduct in continuing to negotiate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>them after Tow Pro sold the truck violated the TCPA. The Wares contend that we may reach the merits of their claims because the district court erred in determining that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1) preempted their state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Ty singer v. Police Dep\u2019t of Zanesville, </em>463 F.3d 569, 572 (6th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">We review the district court\u2019s preemption ruling, as well as its interpretation and construction of the FAAAA, de novo. <em>See Nye v. CSX Transp., Inc. </em>437 F.3d 556, 560 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Congress deregulated trucking in 1980, and in 1994 enacted \u00a7 14501(c) to preempt state trucking regulations. <em>Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 989, 993, 169 L.Ed.2d 933 (2008) (holding that two state statutes aimed at preventing delivery by truck of tobacco products to minors are preempted by the FAAAA). Section \u00a7 14501(c)(1) provides, subject to certain exceptions (such as one for certain aspects of nonconsensual towing, which we will address shortly), that \u201ca State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1). The FAAAA\u2019s language was patterned after the preemption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which preempts state laws \u201crelating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier ... when such carrier is transporting property.\u201d <em>See Rowe, </em>128 S.Ct. at 993. In <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), the Court read the ADA\u2019s preemption provision broadly, concluding that the \u201crelated to\u201d clause \u201cexpress[ed] a broad pre-emptive purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031. The <em>Morales </em>Court ruled that \u201c[sjtate enforcement actions having a connection with, or reference to\u201d carrier \u201crates, routes, or services\u201d are preempted, <em>id. </em>at 384, 112 S.Ct. 2031, and that such preemption may occur even if a state law has only an \u201cindirect\u201d effect on rates, routes, or services. <em>Id. </em>at 386, 112 S.Ct. 2031. Furthermore, preemption occurs where state laws have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d related to Congress\u2019 deregulatory and preemption goals. <em>Id, </em>at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2031. The Supreme Court recently followed <em>Morales </em>in interpreting \u00a7 14501(c)(1). <em>See Rowe, </em>128 S.Ct. at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Tow trucks are considered \u201cmotor carrier[s] of property\u201d under the FAAAA. <em>City of Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv. Inc., </em>536 U.S. 424, 430, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">In the district court, the Wares argued that all of their claims were saved from preemption because the claims were \u201cseparate and apart from any issue of non-consensual towing and do not relate to the price, route, or service.\u201d Pis\u2019 Resp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. 20. The district court rejected the argument. The district court held that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by \u00a7 14501(c)(1) because Plaintiffs\u2019 argument was not premised upon nonconsensual towing, but upon unauthorized <em>storage </em>charges and violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Tennessee statutes regarding notice as to storage fees and sales. The district court observed \u201cthat Congress intended a broad statutory definition of \u2018transportation\u2019 to apply to \u00a7 14501,\u201d as reflected in the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d under the Act. <em>Ware, 2007 WL </em>108885, at * 11. Thus, in the district court\u2019s view, \u201cto the extent that [the Wares] raise claims involving the storage of the vehicle, including storage charges, their claims are preempted by \u00a7 14501(c)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court also noted that the Wares did not argue that any of the exceptions applied, and that it therefore had no reason to address them. <em>Id. </em>at *8 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The Wares first claim \u2014 that Tow Pro illegally converted their truck by charging unlawful storage fees \u2014 is \u201crelated to\u201d the price Tow Pro charges for the transportation of property, and thus preempted under \u00a7 14501(c)(1). Section 13102(23) of the Act defines \u201ctransportation\u201d to include \u201cservices related to th[e] movement [of passengers and property], including ... <em>storage, </em>handling, packing, unpacking, and interchange of passengers and property.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See also Ace Auto Body &amp; Towing v. City of New York, </em>171 F.3d 765, 771 (2d Cir.1999). Because the statutory definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d specifically includes \u201cstorage,\u201d the Wares\u2019 challenge based on unauthorized storage charges \u201crelate[s] to [the] price ... of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The Wares\u2019 second claim \u2014 that Tow Pro converted the truck by failing to provide the Wares sufficient notice of the storage fees and sale \u2014 is also related to Tow Pro\u2019s prices and services and is similarly preempted by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1). The Wares cite several Tennessee statutes to support their conversion claim on this ground, arguing that: (1) Section 55-16-112 of the Tennessee Code required Tow Pro to obtain express written authorization not only for the towing of the truck but also for the truck\u2019s storage, <em>see </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 55-16-112 (\u201c[I]n order for a garagekeeper or a towing firm to tow or store a vehicle the garagekeeper or towing firm shall obtain an express written authorization for towing and storage of each vehicle from a law enforcement officer ... or from the owner ... of the private property from which the vehicle is to be towed.\u201d); (2) Sections 55-23-103 and -104 of the Tennessee Code prohibited Tow Pro\u2019s collection of storage fees for a period in excess of sixty days without the Wares\u2019 consent, <em>see </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 55-23-103 (\u201cPersons engaged in the business of towing motor vehicles ... and the storing of such motor vehicles ... shall not charge the owner or lienholder of any such motor vehicle a storage fee for a period exceeding sixty (60) days without the consent of [the] owner.\u201d); and (3) Section 66-19-103 of the Tennessee Code prohibited Tow Pro from collecting any storage or related fees unless certain circumstances were met, <em>see </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 66-19-103 (setting forth the requirements for a \u201c[g]aragekeeper\u2019s or towing firm\u2019s lien\u201d). Because these claims relate on their face to the \u201ctransportation of property,\u201d namely prices and services, the claims fall within \u00a7 14501(c)\u2019s preemptive reach. Thus, the district court\u2019s ruling, set within the parameters of the Wares\u2019 argument in the district court, is clearly correct in light of the plain language of the statute and the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Rowe, </em>absent a statutory exemption from preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The Wares argue for the first time on appeal that their claims should be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>empted from preemption under \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(C). <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 30 (citing \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(C) and <em>Ours Garage, </em>536 U.S. 424, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430). That exception exempts from preemption state laws \u201crelating to the price of for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation is performed without the prior consent or authorization of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Because the Wares did not raise this argument below, they have as a general matter waived it on appeal. \u201cIt is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); <em>see also Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Flowers, </em>513 F.3d 546, 552 (6th Cir.2008). Two main policies support this general rule. \u201cFirst, the rule eases appellate review \u2018by having the district court first consider the issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scottsdale, </em>513 F.3d at 552 (quoting <em>Foster v. Barilow, </em>6 F.3d 405, 409 (6th Cir.1993)). \u201c \u2018Second, the rule ensures fairness to litigants by preventing surprise issues from appearing on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Novosteel SA v. United States, </em>284 F.3d 1261, 1274 (Fed. Cir .2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">At the same time, this Court has \u201con occasion, deviated from the general rule in \u2018exceptional cases or particular circumstances\u2019 or when the rule would produce a \u2018plain miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Foster, </em>6 F.3d at 407 (quoting <em>Pinney Dock &amp; Transport Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., </em>838 F.2d 1445, 1461 (6th Cir.1988))). However, we rarely exercise such discretion, and instead focus on whether the issue was properly raised in the district court. <em>Scottsdale, </em>513 F.3d at 552 (and citations therein); <em>see also In re Morris, </em>260 F.3d 654, 664 (6th Cir.2001) (stating that \u201cthe exceptions to the general rule are narrow and intended to promote finality in litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Thus, in deciding whether to address an argument raised for the first time on appeal, this Court is guided by the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">First, we <em>may </em>deviate from the general rale [in]an exceptional case, if declining to review issues for the first time on appeal would produce a plain miscarriage of justice, or if this appeal presents a \u201cparticular circumstance\u201d warranting departure. We also <em>may </em>hear an issue for the first time on appeal if doing so would serve an overarching purpose other than simply reaching the correct result in [the] case. Finally, we <em>should </em>address an issue presented with sufficient clarity and requiring no factual development if doing so would promote the finality of litigation in [the] case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">Both of the policies underlying the general rule apply here, and none of the concerns articulated in <em>Morris </em>justify deviating from the general rule in this case. First, it cannot be said that a plain miscarriage of justice would result: the Wares, by their own admissions, were not particularly diligent in protecting their interest in the truck, and Tow Pro did not act without giving the Wares notice that it intended to sell the truck. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Tow Pro would have withheld the truck had the Wares been forthcoming with an appropriate payment of fees. Second, although the question of whether the nonconsensual towing exemption saves the Wares\u2019 claims from preemption does not seem to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>extensive factual development, <em>see Semaan v. Allied Supermarkets, Inc. (In re Allied Supermarkets, Inc.), </em>951 F.2d 718, 725-26 (6th Cir.1991) (considering issue raised for the first time on appeal because it involved a question of law that required no additional factual development), it involves difficult issues of federal preemption as well as statutory interpretation. <em>Cf. Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington, </em>350 F.3d 925, 930 (9th Cir.2003) (declining, in the absence of argument, to \u201cpick through\u201d the FAAAA in order to match the statutes and regulations with a preemption theory that the parties did not articulate to the court); <em>Tow Operators Working to Protect Their Right v. City of Kansas City, </em>338 F.3d 873, 876 (8th Cir.2003)(declining to reach argument asserting that ordinance did not fall within FAAAA\u2019s safety exception because the tow operators failed to raise the issue in the district court). Third, resolution of the issue would not promote finality in litigation were the Wares to prevail in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Thus, we conclude that this case does not warrant the exercise of our discretion to address a complex federal preemption question that was raised for the first time, in a perfunctory manner, on appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Wares\u2019 first and second claims are preempted under \u00a7 14501(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We finally consider whether the district court properly dismissed the Wares\u2019 third claim \u2014 that Tow Pro\u2019s continued negotiations with the Wares after the company sold the truck violated the TCPA. The district court found this issue presented a closer preemption question, but ultimately decided that the claim did not involve \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d as defined under the TCPA, and that the Wares had otherwise failed to state a cognizable TCPA claim. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling based on its alternative holding that the Wares failed to create a genuine issue of material fact necessary to establish that Tow Pro\u2019s actions were deceptive and that they suffered damages. First, the Wares did not create a factual issue supporting their theory that Tow Pro\u2019s negotiations were deceptive. The truck was in the possession of either Tow Pro or its president at all times. As the district court observed, \u201cif [the Wares] and [Tow Pro] had reached agreement upon an appropriate payment of fees, it is difficult to believe that [the Wares] could not have obtained the truck from its President.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>2007 WL 108885, at *15 n. 13. Further, as the district court held, the Wares failed to allege that they suffered any damages as a result of Tow Pro\u2019s allegedly deceptive negotiating practices. <em>See id </em>at *15.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b880-9\">GRIFFIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARTC\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that plaintiffs\u2019 common law conversion claim is preempted by federal law. In all other respects, I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">In my view, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c) does not preempt plaintiffs\u2019 common law claim alleging excessive and unauthorized vehicle storage fees arising out of the non-consensual towing of plaintiffs\u2019 truck. Because I conclude that federal preemption does not apply, I would reverse and remand for further proceedings relating to plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>At issue is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c), which provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">(c) Motor carriers of property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier (other than a carrier affiliated with a direct air carrier covered by section 41713(b)(4)) or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder with respect to the transportation of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">(2) Matters not covered.

Nonetheless, in ascertaining the meaning of the text of \u00a7 14501(c), the statutory language must be considered as a whole and in context. <em>United States v. Atlantic Research Corp., </em>-U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2331, 2336, 168 L.Ed.2d 28 (2007) (citing <em>King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp., </em>502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991)). It is clear that, pursuant to \u00a7 14501(C)(2)(c), Congress did not preempt state laws relating to the non-consensual towing of vehicles. However, under the majority\u2019s construction, Congress preempted state laws regarding the storage, impound, and administrative fees charged for such a towed vehicle. In my view, such an anomalous result is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">It is well settled that tow trucks are \u201cmotor carriers of property.\u201d <em>City of Columbus v. Ours Garage and Wrecker Sen., Inc., </em>536 U.S. 424, 430, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002). Further, the statute defines \u201ctransportation\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-18\">(A) a motor vehicle, vessel, warehouse, wharf, pier, dock, yard, property, facility, instrumentality, or equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property, or both, regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-19\">(B) services related to that movement, including arranging for, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in transit, refrigeration, icing, ventilation, storage, handling, packing, unpacking, and interchange of passengers and property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-20\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102(23).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-21\">Because the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d specifically includes \u201cstorage,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>majority concludes that the Wares\u2019 conversion claim is related to the price of a motor carrier with respect to the \u201ctransportation of property\u201d and is therefore preempted. I disagree and find this argument flawed in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">First, because the term \u201cstorage\u201d is not defined in the statute, the plain meaning of the statutory text must be ascertained and implemented. <em>Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. ofEduc. v. Murphy, </em>548 U.S. 291, 296-97, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006). When the meaning of a term is ambiguous, we should employ established canons of statutory construction. <em>Cf. United States v. Monsanto, </em>491 U.S. 600, 611, 109 S.Ct. 2657, 105 L.Ed.2d 512 (1989). Under the familiar canon of statutory interpretation, <em>noscitur a sociis </em>(\u201cit is known by its companions\u201d), a term is \u201cgiven more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 1839, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008); <em>United States v. Ossa-Gallegos, </em>491 F.3d 537, 540 (6th Cir.2007) (en banc). Here, \u201cstorage,\u201d and its sister terms \u201creceipt,\u201d \u201cdelivery,\u201d \u201celevation,\u201d \u201ctransfer in transit,\u201d \u201crefrigeration,\u201d \u201cicing,\u201d \u201cventilation,\u201d \u201chandling,\u201d \u201cpacking,\u201d \u201cunpacking,\u201d and \u201cinterchange,\u201d reasonably read, refer to the <em>cargo </em>transported in the channels of commerce, rather than the truck transporting them. Trucks are not \u201chandled\u201d or \u201ctransferred in transit\u201d and, although they often carry refrigerated cargo, or a refrigerated trailer, they are not themselves the subject of refrigeration. I therefore do not construe the term \u201cstorage\u201d as encompassing storage of anything beyond merchandise in transit. To conclude that the Act includes storage of plaintiffs\u2019 non-functioning truck requires a tortured reading of the surrounding terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Moreover, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102(23)(B) refers to \u201cstorage\u201d as a \u201cservice[ ] related to [the] movement ... of passengers and property.\u201d Storage of freight is a likely event during the cargo\u2019s journey from manufacturer to marketplace. Goods may be temporarily stored at a warehouse or waypoint as part of transferring cargo from one truck, or company, to another. Thus, \u201cstorage\u201d of such goods lies at the heart of \u201cmovement of property.\u201d Here, by contrast, plaintiffs\u2019 truck ceased to be involved in transport activities several months before its eventual impound. As a non-operational truck is not engaged in the transport of passengers or property, storage of the same is not related to the movement of passengers and property and therefore does not fit within the four corners of \u00a7 13102(23)(B). Because I construe \u201cstorage\u201d as applying to the freight and cargo transported, not to storage of the truck itself, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part. I would remand for further proceedings regarding plaintiffs\u2019 common law conversion claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
