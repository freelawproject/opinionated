STAMP, JR., Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b883-21\">Marcus Tarrell Sylvester (\u201cSylvester\u201d) pleaded guilty in the United States Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>trict Court for the Western District of Michigan to being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Sylvester filed a sentencing memorandum in which he argued for an unspecified downward departure from the applicable sentencing range set forth in the United States Sentencing Commission advisory guidelines. In that memorandum, Sylvester stated that he had no objections to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPIR\u201d) and that he agreed that the applicable advisory sentence under the guidelines provided for a range of fifty-seven (57) to seventy-one (71) months. The district judge sentenced Sylvester to a term of imprisonment of sixty (60) months, to be followed by three (3) years of supervised release. On appeal, Sylvester challenges his sentence on grounds of procedural and substantive reasonableness. For the reasons that follow, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In 2003, Sylvester pleaded guilty to three offenses in two separate state criminal actions in the Seventeenth Circuit Court, Grand Rapids, Michigan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 16, 2003, the state court sentenced Sylvester to three years of probation on all three offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">While Sylvester was on probation, state authorities executed a search warrant on his residence on December 2, 2004, after he had failed to report to his probation officer as required by the conditions of his probation. During the search, law enforcement officials discovered Sylvester hiding under a pile of clothes in a basement bedroom. They also discovered an unloaded .32 caliber Smith and Wesson handgun and a box of .32 caliber ammunition, as well as a scale, and a razor blade with white residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">At that time, Sylvester was taken back into state custody. The state court revoked Sylvester\u2019s probation for failing to report to his probation officer and for possessing a firearm, and sentenced Sylvester to eighteen (18) months to twenty (20) years of imprisonment. Sylvester was paroled from state custody on June 13, 2005. Some time during the latter part of November 2006, Sylvester was once again taken into state custody for parole violations, which included failure to comply with substance abuse treatment requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Meanwhile, during the early part of 2005, the United States Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) had completed a federal investigation into Sylvester\u2019s firearm possession. Based upon the results of its investigation, the ATF recommended to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office that the firearm offense be prosecuted. Federal authorities secured an indictment against Sylvester on August 29, 2006\u2014 approximately eighteen months after the ATF recommended prosecution, and more than one year after Sylvester was paroled by the state court after his probation had been revoked for possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ai3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>On December 6, 2006, Sylvester pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan to being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was released on bond until his sentencing. On December 11, 2006, during the presentence interview with his probation officer, Sylvester was subjected to a random drug test, which preliminarily tested positive for marijuana use. Despite Sylvester\u2019s strenuous denials and his insistence that the drug screen had yielded a false positive, a laboratory report confirmed that he had used marijuana. Sylvester was then rearrested for violating the terms of his bond. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan sentenced Sylvester to a sixty-month term of imprisonment and a three-year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">On appeal, Sylvester argues that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. When reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, an appellate court must engage in a two-step analysis: it must first determine whether the sentencing court committed any significant procedural error;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, if the sentence imposed is found procedurally sound, the appellate court must then evaluate the substantive reasonableness of the sen-fence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">A. <em>Procedural Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">The standard of review for a procedural reasonableness challenge to a sentence depends upon whether the challenging party objected in the lower court proceedings on the ground of procedural reasonableness. If the challenging party did so object, this Court reviews under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>445 F.3d 865, 869 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>437 F.3d 550, 553 (6th Cir. 2006). In this Circuit, district courts are advised to ask the parties whether they have any objections, not previously raised, to the court\u2019s proposed sentence. <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865 (6th Cir. 2004). If the challenging party has been afforded the opportunity to object to the court\u2019s reasons for selecting the sentence imposed and has failed to do so, this Court reviews for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 385 (6th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">In the case at bar, the district court provided the requisite opportunity to object. JA 118-119. Sylvester failed to object on procedural reasonableness \u2014 or any other \u2014 grounds. Consequently, plain error is the appropriate standard of review for Sylvester\u2019s appellate challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">Plain error requires a defendant to show (1) the court made an error (2) which \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>obvious or clear,\u201d (3) which \u201caffected defendant\u2019s substantial rights,\u201d and (4) which \u201caffected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gardiner, </em>463 F.3d 445, 459 (6th Cir.2006). Only exceptional circumstances warrant a finding of plain error. <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, a district court ruling will be vacated only \u201cwhere the error is so plain that the trial judge ... [was] derelict in countenancing it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Here, Sylvester argues that when the district court imposed his sentence, it did not adequately take into account the mitigating factors that Sylvester presented for the court\u2019s consideration. Specifically, Sylvester contends that the district judge failed to engage in any analysis or state any reasons for rejecting Sylvester\u2019s ax\u2019guments that the government\u2019s delay in bi'inging charges and the time served in state custody wex-e mitigating factors warranting a downward departure in Sylvester\u2019s sentence. These contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The sentencing statute at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires a district court to state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence, but no statutory provision obligates a sentencing court to articulate its reasons for rejecting each argument a party advances for an alternative sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 387. Nor does the case law of this Circuit impose any such obligation. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>510 F.3d 603, 608 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] district court need not explain its reasons for rejecting each argument made by a defendant.\u201d). Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), suggests that the record should demonstrate that the sentencing judge has considered each argument presented by a party and the evidence offered in support thereof. Thus, for a sentence to suiwive a procedural reasonableness challenge under plain error review, the record and the context must demonstrate that the judge listened to, understood, and considered each argument, taking each into account when determining the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 387 (citing <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">In this case, Sylvestex\u2019\u2019s sentencing memorandum listed three factors in support of an unspecified downward departure from the applicable guideline range. Sylvester argues on appeal that the district judge failed to consider two of them: (1) the delay by the government in prosecuting him; and (2) the time he had already served in state custody after his state probation was revoked for, in part, the same conduct that prompted the federal indictment. The sentencing judge directly addressed neither of these factors. Thus, this Court must determine whether the sentencing judge listened to, understood, and considered the delay in federal prosecution of the firearm offense, and the time the defendant spent in state custody after his probation was revoked for, in part, possessing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">1. <em>Delay in Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The x\u2019ecord indicates that the sentencing judge considered \u2014 and rejected\u2014 the delay in prosecution as a mitigating factor. At the sentencing hearing, the judge acknowledged receipt of the defendant\u2019s \u201crather extensive\u201d sentencing memorandum. JA 107. Defense counsel began his argument by stating that the most important aspect of the case was the two-year delay between the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>crime and Sylvester\u2019s sentencing. JA 108. When the judge interjected, inquiring whether that circumstance was the most important factor, defense counsel answered in the negative. JA 108-109. After presenting the factor that he considered most important (i.e., that Sylvester had undergone significant change since the time the offense occurred), defense counsel returned to his argument that the delay in prosecution should be considered as a mitigating factor. JA 112. The judge observed that the defendant had not filed a motion to dismiss on this basis, and asked whether any legal grounds supported the defendant\u2019s argument. Defense counsel answered: \u201cIt\u2019s just a fact that we would ask that you would consider.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">When he pronounced Sylvester\u2019s sentence, the district judge stated that he had considered the sentencing guidelines as one factor for determining a sentence that was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). JA 116. He concluded that the nature and circumstances of the underlying offense, the defendant\u2019s previous contacts with law enforcement, and the defendant\u2019s status a felon made the offense a serious one. <em>Id. </em>The judge indirectly acknowledged the delay in initiating prosecution when he stated that Sylvester\u2019s \u201chaving a weapon and drug paraphernalia in a house some couple of years before having parole revoked\u201d informed his understanding of the nature and circumstances of the underlying offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In light of the exchanges between the judge and Sylvester\u2019s counsel during the sentencing hearing, and the judge\u2019s explicit acknowledgment of the time that had elapsed between the conduct giving rise to the federal charge and the defendant\u2019s sentencing, this Court finds no plain error in the district judge\u2019s process as it concerns the defendant\u2019s delay in prosecution argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">2. <em>Time Spent in State Custody for Same Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Sylvester\u2019s second contention concerning the procedural reasonableness of his sentence is that the district judge failed to consider the time Sylvester had spent in state custody for the same conduct. This arguments also lacks merit. As with Sylvester\u2019s pre-indictment delay argument, the judge offered no specific analysis of the defendant\u2019s state custody argument. During the sentencing hearing, however, defense counsel, in response to the district judge\u2019s expressed concerns about Sylvester\u2019s positive drug test on December 11, 2006, described Sylvester\u2019s state of mind upon learning that the firearm offense was a separate crime under federal law and that the time Sylvester had spent in state custody could be supplemented by a separate prosecution, conviction, and sentence in the federal court system. JA 109-110. In other words, Sylvester presented this factor for the judge\u2019s consideration in the context of an effort to explain the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s recent drug use, and it is in that context that the judge considered the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Of primary importance among the judge\u2019s reasons for imposing a sixty-month sentence was Sylvester\u2019s positive drug test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>while on bond and Sylvester\u2019s vehement denial, which the court considered \u201cespecially egregious.\u201d JA 116. The court emphasized Sylvester\u2019s \u201cpersistent association with drugs\u201d and recommended as part of his sentence that Sylvester receive intensive substance abuse treatment during his incarceration. JA 117. In addition, the judge gave the following reasons for the sentence: the need to provide just punishment and an adequate deterrence to criminal activity; the need to protect the public; and the duty to provide the defendant with medical, educational, and correctional treatment. As to this last factor, the judge recommended that Sylvester be afforded opportunities for vocational training during his term of imprisonment. Given the context in which the judge considered Sylvester\u2019s argument concerning time already spent in state custody and the counterbalancing weight the judge attached to the other sentencing factors, the district court committed no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">B. <em>Substantive Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Having determined that the sentence imposed meets the standards for procedural reasonableness, this Court now turns to Sylvester\u2019s assertions that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. An abuse-of-discretion standard applies to challenges to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Unlike challenges to procedural reasonableness, however, a party need not object below to the reasonableness of the length of a sentence. <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 389. Consequently, even if a defendant fails to object at sentencing to the length of the sentence of imposed, the standard of review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, where, as here, a sentence falls within a properly calculated range under the Sentencing Guidelines, a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness attaches. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006). Because Sylvester\u2019s sentence falls within the advisory guideline range, this Court reviews his sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard and applies a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">A sentence is substantively reasonable if it is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to advance the purposes of the federal sentencing statute at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Thus, Sylvester must show that the length of his sentence is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to promote the following goals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-8\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-10\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-11\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other corrective treatment in the most effective manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where the sentencing judge has selected the sentence arbitrarily; has relied upon on impermissible factors; has failed to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a); or has assigned unreasonable weight to any relevant factor. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 385 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Sylvester\u2019s appellate challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence consists of further reference to the miti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>gating factors above and an argument that the sentence is unnecessarily long to achieve the desired deterrent effect, particularly given the time Sylvester has already spent in state custody. Because Sylvester was sentenced to a term within the applicable guideline range, which he has conceded was correctly calculated, he must rebut the presumption of reasonableness which attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 708. This he has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">According to Sylvester, his sentence is substantively unreasonable because, in part, the district court failed to consider that the federal government waited to indict him until more than one year after he completed his state sentence for the same conduct and approximately eighteen months after the ATF recommended prosecution. On appeal, Sylvester argues that he suffered prejudice as a result of this delay because a \u201cpossibility\u201d existed \u201cthat [his] sentence might have been reduced by as much as eighteen months ... had the district court considered the arguments raised in mitigation----\u201d Pl.\u2019s Final Reply Br. 4. The mere <em>possibility </em>that Sylvester\u2019s sentence <em>might </em>have been reduced fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded to a within guidelines sentence, particularly because, as discussed above, the sentencing judge considered the effect of the delay in his sentencing determination and found other relevant factors more compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The second reason Sylvester advances in his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is the punishment he received in state court for the underlying conduct giving rise to his federal conviction. Sylvester seems to be arguing that the district court should have granted him credit for time served in state custody. However, only the Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisons have the power to grant credit for time served. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992) (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b)); <em>United States v. Crazier, </em>259 F.3d 503 (6th Cir. 2001). A district court judge who imposes a sentence without considering time served as a mitigating factor properly refrains from granting credit for time served. Accordingly, Sylvester has failed to show that his sentence is substantively infirm on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Finally, Sylvester contends that a sentence well below sixty (60) months would provide adequate deterrence to his future criminal conduct, especially because he has already been incarcerated in the state system for the same conduct that resulted in the federal charge. Sylvester offers no support for this bare assertion, and, in light of his repeated violations of the conditions of his state offense probation, his state offense parole, and his federal offense presentence release bond, this contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">In sum, Sylvester has failed to demonstrate that the sentencing judge imposed an arbitrary sentence, based the sentence on impermissible factors, failed to consider pertinent statutory factors under \u00a7 3553(a), or accorded unreasonable weight to any relevant factor. Sylvester has therefore failed to rebut the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. Consequently, his challenge before this Court to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">. In one of the cases, Sylvester pleaded guilty to delivery of a controlled substance, and in the other, he pleaded guilty to one count of domestic violence and one count of second degree home invasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-12\">. The ATF\u2019s report recommending prosecution is undated. The precise date upon which the matter was forwarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office is therefore uncertain. An ATF report dated March 30, 2005 referring to a firearm identification correction from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ATF's Report of Investigation dated February 28, 2005 suggests that the recommendation for prosecution was probably forwarded some time in March or April 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. A district court\u2019s failure to consider the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), for example, or to adequately explain the reasons for the sentence imposed constitutes significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b885-19\">. Although <em>Vonner </em>was decided after Sylvester was sentenced, its holding should still apply in this case because a plain error standard of review was applied to the <em>Vonner </em>defendant, whose sentence had likewise been imposed before this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Vonner.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. The judge seems to have misstated the reference points of the delay, commenting that the conduct occurred a \u201ccouple of years\u201d before the revocation of the defendant\u2019s parole rather than several months before the federal govemment brought charges. However, this misstatement should not affect the analysis of whether the district court considered the time lapse and rejected it as mitigating factor warranting leniency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
