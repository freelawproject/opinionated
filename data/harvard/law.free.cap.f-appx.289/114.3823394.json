The district court dismissed the federal claims as untimely and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Porter\u2019s state-law claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">Porter is the owner and president of Memphis Chemical Janitorial Supply, Inc., a Tennessee corporation that sells chemical and janitorial supplies. In 2000, Porter decided to sell the company\u2019s assets, and three individuals offered to buy the assets through the yet-to-be-formed 3Bs Company LLC. The three individuals were George H. Brown, Jr. (Brown), a former Tennessee Supreme Court Justice and then Circuit Court Judge for Shelby County, Tennessee, George Brown, III (Brown\u2019s son) and Charles Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">On November 1, 2000, 3Bs and its members entered into an asset purchase agreement with Memphis Chemical as well as a consulting agreement with Porter, by which he agreed to work as a consultant for 3Bs for six months. The consulting agreement required Porter to work 30 hours per week, to serve on 3Bs\u2019 advisory board and to \u201cwork in good faith and in cooperation with [3Bs] to maintain existing customers and pursue other customers.\u201d JA 128. In exchange, 3Bs agreed to pay Porter a salary and 10% of the gross sales over $500,000 per year, up to $37,500 annually, for 2001-2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-20\">After Porter completed his consulting obligations, Brown asked him to perform some public relations work for 3Bs. Porter refused, and Brown allegedly told him that he would not be paid the participation money to which he was entitled unless he performed the public relations work.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-21\">On October 27, 2006, Porter filed this complaint in federal district court. As amended, the complaint alleged that 3Bs and its members violated \u00a7 1983 by engaging in a civil conspiracy \u201cto use George H. Brown, Jr.\u2019s position, status, and office as a sitting Circuit Court Judge ... (1) to deprive [Porter] of his right to contract for the sale of Memphis Chemical\u2019s assets, and for his personal employment, without unlawful state interference; (2) to coerce [Porter], against his will, to do public relations work for 3Bs Company; and (3) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>deny [Porter] a public trial in [a related state-court action].\u201d JA 139. The amended complaint also raised state-law claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Porter\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims under Civil Rule 12(b)(6) and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Porter\u2019s appeal raises one question: Did the district court err in determining that Tennessee\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for personal tort actions applies to these \u00a7 1983 claims? As Porter sees things, the district court committed reversible error by failing to apply Tennessee\u2019s three-year statute of limitations for property tort actions. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-105. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In the first place, Porter did not raise this argument \u2014 or mention this statute\u2014 in the district court. A federal appellate court generally will not consider arguments presented for the first time on appeal, <em>see Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Flowers, </em>513 F.3d 546, 552 (6th Cir.2008), and Porter offers no basis for deviating from that rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In its motion to dismiss Porter\u2019s amended complaint, 3Bs argued that a one-year statute of limitations, <em>see </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-104, barred Porter\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. That statute provides that actions for \u201cinjuries to the person\u201d as well as \u201c[c]ivil actions for compensatory or punitive damages, or both, brought under the federal civil rights statutes\u201d shall be commenced \u201cwithin one (1) year after the cause of action accrued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 28-3-104(a)(l), (3). In responding to the motion, Porter did not argue that a different statute of limitations applied, and, with the exception of contending that a \u201ccontinuing conspiracy\u201d exists, JA 280, Porter made no reference to 3Bs\u2019 argument about the one-year limitations bar. Under these circumstances, Porter has waived the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">But even if Porter had not waived the argument, his appeal still would not get off the ground. The statute of limitations for a \u00a7 1983 action is the \u201cstate statute of limitations applicable to personal injury actions under the law of the state in which the \u00a7 1983 claim arises.\u201d <em>Eidson v. Tenn. Dep't of Children\u2019s Servs., 510 </em>F.3d 631, 634 (6th Cir.2007); <em>see also Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 275-76, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). And our precedent has long made clear that the limitations period for \u00a7 1983 actions arising in Tennessee is the one-year limitations provision found in Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-104(a). <em>Hughes v. Vanderbilt Univ., </em>215 F.3d 543, 547 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Berndt v. Tennessee, </em>796 F.2d 879, 883 (6th Cir.1986). The district court thus correctly concluded that the one-year limitations period applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">In resisting this conclusion, Porter says that his complaint concerns a \u201cdemand to be compensated for his personal consulting services,\u201d Br. at 14, and thus that the three-year limitations period for <em>property </em>tort actions, <em>see </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-105, applies to such a claim as well as to \u201ccommon law actions for inducement of breach of contract [and] unlawful interference with a business and employment,\u201d Br. at 14. But the Supreme Court has already stuck a dagger in this theory, \u201cexpressly rejecting] the proposition that the limitations period for a \u00a7 1983 claim depends on the nature of the underlying right being asserted.\u201d <em>City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, </em>544 U.S. 113, 124, 125 S.Ct. 1453, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>161 L.Ed.2d 316 (2005). Were it otherwise, the Court has explained, the courts would be filled with collateral litigation over the appropriate limitations period for virtually every \u00a7 1983 action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">If the choice of the statute of limitations were to depend upon the particular facts or the precise legal theory of each claim, counsel could almost always argue, with considerable force, that two or more periods of limitations should apply to each \u00a7 1983 claim. Moreover, under such an approach different statutes of limitations would be applied to the various \u00a7 1983 claims arising in the same State, and multiple periods of limitations would often apply to the same case. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have sanctioned this interpretation of its statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\"><em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 273-75, 105 S.Ct. 1938. Instead, all \u00a7 1983 constitutional claims generally are subject to the statute of limitations for personal injury torts under the law of the State in which the claim arises \u2014 no matter how the plaintiff chooses to characterize the underlying harm. <em>See Rancho Palos Verdes, </em>544 U.S. at 124 &amp; n. 5, 125 S.Ct. 1453; <em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 271-76, 105 S.Ct. 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">One final note. Porter argues for the first time in his reply brief that the \u201cgravamen[] of [his] Amended Complaint is that Appellees are engaged in a continuing civil conspiracy to prevent his payment of participation money,\u201d Reply Br. at 3, thereby attempting to argue that the limitations period (whether one year or three) has not even started to run. But the district court rejected this argument, and Porter did not challenge this aspect of the court\u2019s opinion in his opening brief. That precludes him from raising it now. <em>See Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov\u2019t, </em>305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2002); <em>Wright v. Holbrook, </em>794 F.2d 1152, 1156 (6th Cir.1986). The argument, at any rate, is a weak one because it confuses the existence of an already completed tort with the ongoing <em>damages </em>caused by that tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The closest issue in the case is whether Porter\u2019s appellate arguments are so frivolous that he should be sanctioned. We think not because, while Porter had few legitimate bases for filing this appeal, we had not applied the one-State, one-limitations-period concept in the setting of an alleged Tennessee-based property tort. But as a point of caution, Porter\u2019s counsel, Willie James Ellison, would do well to pick his appeals and appellate arguments more carefully in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
