The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issues whether the admission at trial of a tape recording of a 911 telephone call and the victim\u2019s statement to the police officer who responded to the 911 call violated Martin\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. Martin argues that his right to confrontation was violated under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), because the district court admitted into evidence the 911 tape recording, but Claudia Evans, the victim, did not testify at trial. He also challenges, under the Confrontation Clause, the admission of the testimony of the officer who responded to the 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The AEDPA\u2019s scheme of deference is to be used in reviewing the claims in a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition that were adjudicated in state court proceedings on the merits of the federal constitutional questions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d); <em>see Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 484-85 (5th Cir.2000). Because it is not apparent that the state court adjudicated the merits of the federal constitutional claims, review is de novo. <em>See Nobles v. Johnson, </em>127 F.3d 409, 416 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The Sixth Amendment states that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court held that the right to confrontation bars the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Evans\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were nontestimonial because the circumstances, viewed objectively, indicated that the primary purpose of the interrogation by the 911 operator was \u201cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Proctor, </em>505 F.3d 366, 370-72 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1457,170 L.Ed.2d 285 (2008). To the extent that Martin challenges the portion of the tape involving the exchange between Catherine Johnson, Evans\u2019s mother, and the operator, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the portion of the tape in which \u201cthe louder female voice makes a statement where she is guessing about what might have happened.\u201d Moreover, because Johnson testified at trial, Martin\u2019s right to confrontation was not violated. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Martin has not shown that his right to confrontation was violated by the trial court\u2019s admission of the tape of the 911 call. <em>See Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 827-28, 126 S.Ct. 2266; <em>Proctor, </em>505 F.3d at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Martin argues that his right to confrontation was violated by the admission into evidence of statements Evans made to police officers responding to the 911 call. Although Martin argues that the testimony of \u201cvarious officers\u201d violated his right to confrontation, the only specific officers he mentions are Officer Joe Reynolds and Detective Chuck Wilson, and he fails to identify any specific trial testimony. Conclusional allegations on a critical issue do not raise a constitutional issue and are not sufficient to warrant habeas relief. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>To the extent that Martin suggests that 1) his right to confrontation was violated because an officer testified that Evans stated that the attack was unprovoked, and 2) his right to confrontation was violated by the trial testimony of Chuck Wilson, these claims are raised for the first time on appeal. \u201cA contention not raised by the habeas petitioner in the district court cannot be considered for the first time on appeal from that court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Puckett, </em>176 F.3d 809, 814 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Martin challenges Officer Reynolds\u2019s testimony that the victim identified him as the person who stabbed her. In situations involving domestic disputes, \u201c \u2018[ojfficers called to investigate ... need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to them own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 832, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (quoting <em>Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Disk Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., </em>542 U.S. 177, 186, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 159 L.Ed.2d 292 (2004)). We need not decide, however, for purposes of this appeal whether the admission of the testimony violated the Confrontation Clause because any error was harmless. <em>See Horn v. Quarterman, </em>508 F.3d 306, 322 n. 24 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2084, 170 L.Ed.2d 820 (2008). In federal habeas proceedings, the harmless error analysis looks to whether the error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the district court observed, Evans identified Martin as the individual who stabbed her during the taped 911 call; Martin admitted to \u201chitting\u201d Evans with a knife in his recorded statement to police, which was admitted into evidence at trial; and Evans\u2019s statement implicating Martin in the stabbing was distinct from the issues as to whether Martin acted in self defense or had the requisite intent, both of which were significant issues at trial. Any Confrontation Clause error was harmless. <em>See Horn, </em>508 F.3d at 322 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
