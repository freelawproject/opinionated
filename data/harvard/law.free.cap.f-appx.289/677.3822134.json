She argues that the district court clearly erred by denying her motion for a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because she had a minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">A Section 3B1.2 reduction applies only when a defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Robles\u2019s courier status alone did not entitle her to a role adjustment because a defendant may be a courier without being <em>\u201csubstantially less culpable </em>than the average participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). If a sentence is based on activity in which a defendant was actually involved, Section 3B1.2 does not require a reduction in the base offense level even though the defendant\u2019s activity in a larger conspiracy may have been minor. <em>United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Robles admitted to transporting 40.47 kilograms of marijuana across the border and she admitted that she suspected that the vehicle that she was driving across the border contained the drugs. Her sentence was based on the amount of drugs which were present in the vehicle. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in denying her request for a reduction based on her role in the offense. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
