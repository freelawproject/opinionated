Atkins was then on felony probation for distributing cocaine. A jury convicted Atkins of, among other crimes, knowingly distributing a controlled substance (heroin) that resulted in death from the use of such substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). On appeal, Atkins argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that another heroin addict\u2019s failure to seek medical attention when McKinney passed out was a superseding cause that relieved Atkins of criminal liability. We hold that the district court did not commit plain error in failing to give such an instruction <em>sua sponte </em>when six other courts of appeal have held that the statute does not require proof of proximate cause or proof that the death was foreseeable. We also reject Atkins\u2019s suffieiency-of-the-evidence argument, and we therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">On December 28, 2004, a grand jury indicted Eugene Atkins on one count of possession of heroin with the intent to distribute. The grand jury issued three superseding indictments, which added counts for distributing heroin that resulted in \u201cdeath from the use of the heroin,\u201d conspiracy to distribute heroin involving 100 grams or more, and two counts of distribution of heroin to a person under the age of 21. Atkins pleaded guilty to count one of the third superseding indictment on November 17, 2005, but later withdrew the plea and the case proceeded to trial. On March 13, the government filed an Information establishing Atkins\u2019s prior felony conviction for selling cocaine. Atkins\u2019s jury trial began on April 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">At trial, the government presented evidence that a group of high school students and recent high school graduates in the Grand Rapids area began experimenting with marijuana, moved to abusing Oxyeotin, and, tragically, ended up addicted to heroin. Ten of these addicts testified. All identified Atkins, whom they knew as \u201cAustin,\u201d as their source and said that they bought heroin from him in the Eastown area of Grand Rapids. At least three of these addicts also testified that Atkins occasionally sent another person, known to them as \u201cPat\u201d or \u201cWebster,\u201d to deliver the heroin. An agent from the Drug Enforcement Agency testified that the police later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>identified Ryan Moss as \u201cPat.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The government introduced into evidence a cell phone they found on Atkins\u2019s person when they arrested him. This phone was registered to Tiffany Price, the mother of Atkins\u2019s child. Records from this phone showed an unusually high number of phone calls and of Nextel \u201cDirect Connect\u201d communications between Atkins and the various addicts between October 10 and December 17, 2004 (including 75 communications with one of the addicts alone).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">McKinney\u2019s companion and fellow addict, Christopher Perrin, then testified that he picked up McKinney at McKinney\u2019s home around 8:00 p.m. on December 14, 2004, so they could go buy heroin. They drove across town, and during that time Perrin called Atkins several times to set up the deal. They arranged to meet in Eastown at the corner of Logan and Ethel streets. Perrin parked his car, and then got out to see if something was dragging underneath. Perrin\u2019s testimony then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">Q: So, how long after you pulled up was he at your car on Logan and Ethel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">A: Within, you know, ten seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">Q: And what occurred at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">A: I leaned down and checked the car and he was doing the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-10\">Q: And did he give you or Matt the drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-11\">A: He gave Matt the dope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-12\">Q: And who paid him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-13\">A: Matt did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">After making the buy, McKinney tried unsuccessfully to inject himself. Perrin then helped McKinney inject the heroin. Soon after taking the heroin, McKinney passed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">Cell phone records show that the sale took place about 9:45 p.m. Specifically, the records show that Perrin called Atkins at 8:47, 9:12, and 9:27. Atkins called Perrin at 9:27. Perrin then called Atkins at 9:41 and again at 9:42. Finally, Atkins called Perrin at 9:43. During this time, the phone records show that Perrin\u2019s phone moved from the west side of Grand Rapids toward the east side where Atkins was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">Perrin stated that he was not worried when McKinney passed out because \u201c[e]veryone that\u2019s ever done heroin has passed out at one time or another,\u201d and McKinney had passed out before for two or three hours. Perrin demonstrated his lack of worry by driving to a Meijer to buy pop and cigarettes, calling his girlfriend, and then driving to his mother\u2019s house. Perrin finally tried to take McKinney home, but parked down the street to avoid McKinney\u2019s mother. Perrin saw that the back sliding door to McKinney\u2019s house was unlocked, but did not bring McKinney inside because he could not awaken or move the passed-out McKinney.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-20\">From there, Perrin drove to his grandmother\u2019s house, where he used heroin and called his girlfriend again. Phone records show that Perrin stopped talking to his girlfriend at 1:58 a.m. Perrin then drove back to his mother\u2019s house, and when he got there, he lied to his mother and said that McKinney was passed out from being drunk. Perrin and his mother covered McKinney with blankets and left him in the car overnight. Before going to bed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>4:00 a.m., Perrin checked McKinney and saw that he was \u201csnoring loud.\u201d At 6:00 a.m., Perrin\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend found McKinney dead in the car. A toxicologist tested McKinney\u2019s body and determined that McKinney died from a heroin overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Perrin admitted to the jury that he spoke with police three times the day McKinney died, and that he did not tell the police the full truth until the third time. He also acknowledged that he had pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony for misleading the officers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and admitted his own moral culpability for McKinney\u2019s death through his failure to seek medical help. The government produced Perrin\u2019s plea agreement, in which Perrin was promised a reduced sentence if he testified accurately. On cross-examination, Perrin acknowledged that in late 2004 he ran into Ryan Moss, aka \u201cPat,\u201d in the local jail, where Moss told Perrin that Moss\u2019s name better not come up at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Police officers explained that after McKinney\u2019s death, they began talking to known heroin addicts in an attempt to track down the supplier. Addict Charles Helder agreed to cooperate in the investigation and made taped phone calls to \u201cAustin\u201d (Atkins) in which he asked for more heroin. Officers then convinced another addict, Ross Poel, to help them set up a sting. On December 17, 2004, Poel called \u201cAustin\u201d about buying heroin. This call was taped and played to the jury. \u201cAustin\u201d told Poel to meet him at the corner of Logan and Ethel \u2014 the same corner where Perrin testified that Atkins sold the heroin to McKinney three days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The police then staked out the intersection. Poel called Atkins again when Poel reached the intersection, and as the call was taking place, police saw Atkins walking toward the intersection. Atkins saw the police, tossed something from his pocket, and started running. Officers chased and tackled Atkins. Another officer located the two bags that Atkins threw from his pockets. The bags contained heroin. Police also searched Atkins\u2019s room at his girlfriend\u2019s apartment and found a digital scale. Atkins did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">On April 10, 2003, a jury convicted him on all five counts. The base offense level for a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for distributing an illegal drug that results in death is 43 if the defendant has been convicted previously for selling illegal drugs. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(l). Thus, Atkins\u2019s base offense level for count 1 was 43. Pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2, all five counts were grouped together, and pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.3, the base offense level of 43 was applied to all five counts. The PSR added 2 levels for obstruction of justice, but this addition was irrelevant because 43 is the highest offense level under the Guidelines. Atkins had a Criminal History Category of III, and, combined with his offense level of 43, his Guidelines range was life in prison. On July 19, 2006, Judge Bell sentenced Atkins to life on count 1 (distribution resulting in death) and count 3 (conspiracy to distribute heroin) and to 360 months of imprisonment on the other three counts. Atkins appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">Atkins contends that \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) requires proof of proximate cause, further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>argues that Perrin\u2019s failure to seek medical attention was a superseding cause that cut off Atkins\u2019s criminal liability for McKinney\u2019s death, and concludes that the district court should therefore have given a superseding cause instruction to the jury. Atkins admits that he faces plain error review because he did not ask for a superseding cause instruction below. Proving plain error requires proving: \u201c(1) there was an error; (2) the error was obvious or clear; (3) the error affected his substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Wheaton, </em>517 F.3d 350, 362 (6th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted). Jury instructions (or the lack of them) do not constitute plain error unless \u201ctaken as a whole, the jury instructions were so clearly erroneous as to likely produce a grave miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>452 F.3d 593, 605 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Combs, </em>33 F.3d 667, 669 (6th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) requires a prison sentence of twenty years to life if the defendant has a prior drug conviction, sells illegal drugs, and \u201cdeath or serious bodily injury results from the use of\u2019 those drugs. Although our circuit has not decided if \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) requires proof of proximate cause, six other circuits have addressed the issue. All six have held that the use of the passive words \u201cif death or serious bodily injury results from the use of\u2019 eliminates any requirement that the distribution be the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death or that the death be foreseeable. <em>United States v. Houston, </em>406 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 284 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Soler, </em>275 F.3d 146, 153 (1st Cir.2002); <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>236 F.3d 968, 973 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>167 F.3d 824, 831 (3d Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>38 F.3d 139, 145 (4th Cir.1994). Furthermore, our circuit has stated in dicta that \u201cthe statute is, in effect, a strict liability statute with respect to injury or death of another arising out of the distribution of drugs.\u201d <em>United States v. Rebmann, </em>226 F.3d 521, 525 (6th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Leachman, </em>309 F.3d 377, 385 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">At oral argument, Atkins\u2019s counsel argued that these cases \u201cdid not preclude\u201d the district court from giving a superseding cause instruction. Even if this statement is correct, it overlooks the fact that Atkins never asked for such an instruction. On plain error review, it is not enough to say that the district court could have granted Atkins\u2019s request for such an instruction. Instead, Atkins must show that the district court was required to give such an instruction <em>sua sponte, </em>and that failure to do so was \u201cso clearly erroneous as to likely produce a grave miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Newsom, </em>452 F.3d at 605 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">A circuit split generally bars a finding of plain error. <em>United States v. Madden, </em>515 F.3d 601, 608 (6th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>53 F.3d 769, 772 (6th Cir. 1995). Here, we do not have a circuit split and thus cases on both sides. Instead, we have six circuits on the government\u2019s side, none on the defendant\u2019s side, and dicta from our circuit on the government\u2019s side. If a circuit split bars a finding of plain error, a 6-0 score in the government\u2019s favor, buttressed by dicta from this circuit in the government\u2019s favor, certainly bars plain error. Therefore, even if we assume, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>contrary to our fellow circuits, that the statute requires proof of proximate cause, and even if we further assume that one heroin addict\u2019s failure to seek medical treatment on behalf of another addict could have been a superseding cause, <em>cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>279 F.3d 947, 951 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that it is not), Atkins\u2019s claim fails because he cannot prove plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Atkins also makes three related arguments that can be summarized, and rejected, briefly. First, he points to <em>United States v. Swiney, </em>203 F.3d 397 (6th Cir. 2000), which held that the government could not apply \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) to all members of a heroin conspiracy without showing that an addict\u2019s death was reasonably foreseeable as to each member of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 403. <em>Swiney </em>addressed co-conspirator liability under <em>Pinkerton </em>and the Guidelines <em>Id. </em>at 406. <em>Swiney </em>is irrelevant here because Atkins is not being held responsible for someone else\u2019s actions based on his status as a co-conspirator, but is being punished for his own actions. <em>See Soler, </em>275 F.3d at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Second, Atkins suggests that the Guidelines require proof that McKinney\u2019s death was foreseeable. He relies on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), which states that a defendant\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for the purpose of sentence enhancements consists of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions\u201d of his co-conspirators. This reliance is misplaced. The government does not seek to hold Atkins accountable for McKinney\u2019s death through the relevant conduct provisions in the Guidelines. Instead, the government specifically indicted Atkins for personally selling the lethal heroin and it proved its case to a jury, so the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d rules are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Third, Atkins contends that under <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), our court can and should read into the statute a <em>mens rea </em>requirement because strict liability crimes are disfavored. He overlooks the fact that the statute already has a <em>mens rea </em>requirement. It applies only to defendants who knowingly sell illegal drugs. Atkins satisfied it by knowingly selling heroin. If Atkins had thought he was selling Advil, but he was really selling heroin, then he would have a point, but that was not what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Finally, Atkins argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>conviction. This argument raises the question of \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>488 F.3d 700, 710 (6th Cir.2007). A conviction will be reversed for insufficient evidence only if it is \u201cnot supported by substantial and competent evidence upon the record as a whole. Circumstantial evidence alone, if substantial and competent, may support a verdict and need not remove every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>398 F.3d 516, 522 (6th Cir.2005) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">This \u201cvery difficult hurdle for a criminal appellant,\u201d <em>United States v. Rayborn, </em>495 F.3d 328, 337 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Winkle, </em>477 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir.2007)), is even higher here because Atkins admits that he did not preserve this issue below by making a timely Rule 29 motion. Therefore, we review only for a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d meaning that \u201cwe only reverse a conviction if the record is <em>devoid </em>of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Carnes, </em>309 F.3d 950, 956 (6th Cir.2002) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Atkins cannot approach, let alone clear, this hurdle. In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence only as to count 1, he does not dispute that he sold heroin, conspired to sell heroin, or sold heroin to someone under 21; he only disputes that on December 14, 2004, he sold the heroin that killed McKinney. That heroin, he suggests, came from \u201cPat,\u201d aka Ryan Moss. As evidence for his theory, Atkins points to Perrin\u2019s admission that Moss told Perrin that Moss\u2019s name \u201cbetter not come up\u201d at trial, and suggests that Perrin fingered Atkins out of a fear of Moss. While this theory makes for a good closing argument, on appeal it is the kind of challenge to a witness\u2019s credibility that offers a defendant no help. <em>See Wheaton, </em>517 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Atkins posits alternative, innocuous explanations for the prosecution\u2019s evidence. While his explanations might permit a reasonable juror to acquit Atkins, they do not require every reasonable juror to acquit, and they certainly do not establish a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice;\u201d therefore, they do not establish that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. Atkins points to testimony that Moss sold heroin in the same area as Atkins and that Moss occasionally appeared on behalf of Atkins for a drug deal. Atkins also makes much of the fact that Perrin did not actually see Atkins hand over the drugs, and he highlights the jury\u2019s request during deliberations to review Perrin\u2019s testimony on this point. As quoted earlier, Perrin specifically said that Atkins sold the heroin to McKinney. A1&gt; kins insists that this testimony is ambiguous because Perrin tacitly admits to not seeing Atkins hand over the drugs because Perrin was looking down at the time and also because Perrin identifies the dealer only as \u201che.\u201d <em>See ibid. </em>But the entire context removes the ambiguity because before this exchange Perrin said that he had called Atkins. Furthermore, the prosecution\u2019s final question was whether Perrin had \u201cany doubt\u201d who sold the fatal heroin. Perrin answered \u201cno,\u201d and said that the dealer was Atkins. The jury\u2019s request shows that it considered this testimony carefully (for which it should be commended), and then chose to accept it, which it was entitled to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Given that Atkins must show that the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence\u201d of his guilt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Perrin\u2019s testimony alone would be enough to sustain the conviction. However, the record includes much more evidence pointing to Atkins\u2019s guilt. Nine other addicts corroborated Perrin\u2019s testimony by identifying Atkins as their primary source of heroin. The police caught Atkins attempting to sell heroin three days later at the exact same intersection where McKinney bought the fatal heroin. Atkins\u2019s cell phone records show multiple calls between Perrin and Atkins the night McKinney died, and also show that the two phones were moving closer together. These records support Perrin\u2019s timeline and identification of Atkins, and they show a pattern from, which the jury was free to infer a drug deal. The record is more than sufficient to sustain Atkins\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-15\">. Moss\u2019s status as a juvenile kept him safe from federal prosecution, but in November 2005, state police arrested him for assault with intent to murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. Perrin was sentenced two years of imprisonment for this crime on March 17, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. We leave for a more appropriate case the question of whether to join our sister circuits in holding that \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) does not require proof of proximate cause or the foreseeability of death. <em>See PDK Labs. Inc. v. U.S. D.E.A., </em>362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C.Cir.2004) (Roberts, J., concurring) (reasoning that \u201cif it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more\u201d). Likewise, we note, but do not rule on, the Third Circuit\u2019s view that even if the statute does not require proximate causation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">in some cases it is possible that the death or serious bodily injury which \u201cresults from the use of a [controlled] substance\u201d may be so remote a consequence from the criminal conduct of the defendant with respect to the substance that a court might conclude that it would not be consistent with congressional intent to apply the mandatory 20-year minimum sentence. Wherever, if anywhere, that line might be is of no concern to us now. In this case, Robinson conspired to distribute the heroin and a person to whom it almost immediately was distributed consumed it and died as a result. Surely, here the mandatory minimum sentence is applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-15\"><em>Robinson, </em>167 F.3d at 831-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
