Reyton argues that the District Court erred in predicting that the Kentucky Supreme Court would apply the economic loss doctrine which bars Reyton\u2019s recovery under tort law. Finding that the record supports the District Court\u2019s ruling, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Throughout the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, Zamias Services (\u201cZamias\u201d) developed, constructed and owned Ashland Galleria Mall (\u201cthe Mall\u201d) in Ashland, Kentucky. During construction, Zamias hired Universal Roofing as the roofing contract for the Mall. In 1989, Dynamit Nobel of America, Inc. (\u201cDynamit\u201d), a predecessor of HPG, provided roof membrane to Universal Roofing for the construction of the Mall. HPG provided Zamias a 15-year warranty for the roof that expired in August 2004. In November 2004, Reyton, the appellant in this matter, purchased the Mall from Zamias. A month later, the Mall roof shattered, resulting in extensive property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">As a result of the property loss, Reyton sued HPG alleging negligence and strict liability under Kentucky law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reyton alleged that the roof shatter was caused by defects in the roof membrane provided by Dynamit. Reyton claimed $1.8 million in damages to the interior of the Mall and $1.2 million to replace the roof. After discovery, Reyton filed a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court denied after concluding that the economic loss doctrine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> barred recovery in tort for the loss sustained to the roof and to the interior of the Mall. Shortly thereafter, in a separate opinion, the District Court granted HPG\u2019s motion for summary judgment after concluding that Reyton alleged no viable theory of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Reyton appeals, arguing that the District Court erred in granting HPG\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, Reyton alleges that Kentucky would not adopt the economic loss doctrine and instead would apply the \u201cdestructive occurrence test\u201d or \u201cdamaging event test.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the alternative, if the economic loss doctrine applies, Reyton argues that only the roof is the product and therefore they are entitled to recover for damage to the interior of the mall. Additionally, Reyton has requested that we certify the question of whether Kentucky would adopt the economic loss doctrine to the Kentucky Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The primary issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court correctly predicted that the Kentucky Supreme Court would adopt the economic loss doctrine barring Reyton\u2019s recovery based on tort theory. While we lack a clear statement from the Kentucky Supreme Court on the adoption of the economic loss issue, there are multiple sources of persuasive authority available. In <em>Mt. Lebanon Pers. Care Home, Inc. v. Hoover Universal, Inc., </em>276 F.3d 845, 848-49 (6th Cir.2002), a case involving a property loss in Kentucky, the Sixth Circuit observed that a majority of jurisdictions and the weight of the academic community favor application of the economic loss doctrine to business purchases. In light of <em>Mt. Lebanon, </em>we agree with the District Court that if Kentucky\u2019s highest court were faced with the same facts as the case before us, it would adopt and apply the economic loss doctrine. Thus, we will affirm substantially for the thorough and persuasive reasons stated by Judge Nealon in his decision and add only the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Having determined that the Kentucky Supreme Court would apply the economic loss doctrine, the District Court identified the entire mall as the product. Based on his review of <em>Mt. Lebanon, </em>Judge Nealon concluded that the Kentucky Supreme Court would hold that the product for the economic loss doctrine purposes includes the entire unit for which a party to a business transaction has the ability to distribute risk by contract and to insure against loss. In <em>Mt. Lebanon, </em>the court applied the economic loss doctrine to an entire nursing home concluding that the economic loss doctrine \u201cpermits recovery for damages to property other than the product purchased but denies recovery for damages to the product itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849. The court identified the entire nursing home as the product because Mt. Lebanon had the ability to allocate risk contractually and/or insure against loss with respect to the entire nursing home. <em>Id. </em>at 851. Similarly, here, Reyton contracted for the purchase of the Mall and could have allocated their risk in a contract or insure against loss. Thus, we agree with the District Court that the Mall is the product that the parties contracted for and recovery for damage to the entire mall is barred by the economic loss doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Alternatively, Reyton argues that the Kentucky Supreme Court would adopt the \u201cdestructive occurrence\u201d or \u201cdamaging event\u201d test. The \u201cdestructive occurrence test\u201d referred to by Reyton, allows for recovery under tort theory if there is a destructive occurrence (or damaging event). Having determined that the Kentucky Supreme Court would apply the economic loss doctrine, recovery in tort is barred including economic losses caused by a \u201cdestructive occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Finally, Reyton has requested certification to the Kentucky Supreme Court to determine if they would apply the economic loss doctrine to the facts of this case. Because we agree with Judge Nealon\u2019s application of <em>Mt. Lebanon, </em>we discern no need to request certification. Moreover, as Judge Nealon noted in his opinion, the Kentucky Supreme Court declined to hear a similar certification request brought in <em>Bowling Green Mun. Utilities v. Thomasson Lumber Co., </em>902 F.Supp. 134, 136 (W.D.Ky.1995) and there is no reason to believe it would grant one here.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s final order granting Defendant HPG\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying certification to the Kentucky Supreme Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. The parties do not dispute that Kentucky law governs this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">. The \u201ceconomic loss doctrine\u201d is a judicially created doctrine that bars recovery under tort theory when the parties could have contracted for losses, such as those that occurred in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The District Court exercised jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b570-15\">. The \"destructive occurrence test\u201d or \"damaging event test\u201d, as cited by Reyton, allows for recovery under tort theory if there is a destructive occurrence (or damaging event). <em>See Real Estate Mktg. v. Franz, </em>885 S.W.2d 921, 926 (Ky.1994) (\"we do recognize that to recover in tort one cannot prove only that a defect exists; one must further prove a damaging event\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b570-16\">. We exercise plenary review over the District Court's grant of summary judgment, applying the same test as required by the District Court in their initial determination. <em>Caprio v. Bell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Atl. Sickness &amp; Accident Plan, </em>374 F.3d 217, 220 (3d Cir.2004). To grant summary judgment, the District Court views the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must find that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R-Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
