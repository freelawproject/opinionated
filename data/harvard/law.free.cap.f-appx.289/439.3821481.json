Bain, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re You Zhu Li, </em>No. A97 814 079 (B.I.A. Dec. 11, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A97 814 079 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 31, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-21\">Generally, when the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">Li argues principally that the BIA violated his due process rights by failing to consider his asylum and withholding of removal claims. However, the BIA\u2019s decision clearly affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of each of Li\u2019s claims. To the extent Li argues that the BIA violated his due process rights by issuing a summary decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), that argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ment is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 156-59 (2d Cir.2004) (summary decisions by BIA do not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Furthermore, by failing to raise the merits of his asylum and withholding claims in his brief to this Court, Li waived any challenge to the denial of that relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Similarly, Li fails to raise any challenge to the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. Accordingly, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See id. </em>In any event, the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief based on Li\u2019s alleged illegal departure was proper because he did not establish \u201cthat someone in his particular alleged circumstances is more likely than not to be tortured if imprisoned in China.\u201d <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir. 2003); <em>see also Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending <em>motion for </em>a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
