Schoppert, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Lin Ye Zheng, </em>No. A98 719 408 (B.I.A. Jan. 3, 2008), <em>ajfg </em>No. A98 719 408 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sep. 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In this case, we need not review the merits of the agency\u2019s denial of relief, because Zheng does not challenge with any specificity the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>LNC Invs., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, N.J., </em>308 F.3d 169, 176 n. 8 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cWhile we no doubt have the power to address an argument despite its abandonment on appeal, we ordinarily will not do so \u2018unless manifest injustice otherwise would result.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. Branen, </em>27 F.3d 29, 30 (2d Cir.1994))). Aside from his conclusory assertions that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was \u201cbased on minor and immaterial inconsistencies,\u201d Zheng does not specifically challenge any of the IJ\u2019s numerous credibility findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Zheng\u2019s suggestion that the IJ erred by failing to evaluate his demeanor is without merit. While we afford particular deference to the fact-finder\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor, we have never held that the failure to make such an assessment is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Because Zheng fails to challenge the IJ\u2019s dispositive credibility findings, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7. Moreover, declining to consider arguments Zheng did not make will not result in a manifest injustice where, based on our limited review, the IJ\u2019s findings were supported by the record. <em>See LNC Invs., Inc., </em>308 F.3d at 176 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">. Indeed, without identifying any of the IJ's inconsistency and omission findings, Zheng argues that \u201cthough the IJ gave [him] the chance to confront the minor inconsistencies, that chance was not adequate.\u201d Zheng further argues that he \u201cmade sufficient explanations for the inconsistencies in his brief,\u201d but does not identify which findings he is challenging.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
