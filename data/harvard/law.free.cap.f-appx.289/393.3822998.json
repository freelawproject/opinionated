Smart (\u201cSmart\u201d) seeks review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) holding that Smart failed to prove his claim of discrimination against the Department of the Army (\u201cArmy\u201d) under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301-4333. <em>Smart v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. DE0731060294-B-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 10, 2007) <em>(\u201c2007 Initial Decision </em>\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, Smart v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. DE0731060294-B-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 28, 2007). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">Smart contends that the Army impermissibly declined to select him for a Security Guard position with the Law Enforcement &amp; Security Division at the Pueblo Chemical Depot in Colorado because of his status as a veteran. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c) (providing that under USERRA, \u201c[a]n employer shall be considered to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>engaged in actions prohibited ... if the person\u2019s ... service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such ... service\u201d). An earlier Initial Decision had sustained the Army\u2019s negative suitability determination but failed to address Smart\u2019s affirmative defenses. <em>Smart v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. DE0731060294-B-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 19, 2006) <em>(\u201c2006 Initial Decision\u201d). </em>On review, the Board remanded the case for adjudication of Smart\u2019s affirmative defenses of unlawful color and race discrimination and retaliation for prior Equal Employment Opportunity activity, neither of which are relevant to this petition. <em>Smart v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. DE0731060294B-l (M.S.P.B. Apr. 12, 2007) <em>(\u201cRemand Order </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">On remand, Smart alleged for the first time his affirmative defense of discrimination under USERRA. The Board noted that the selecting official, Major Ortegas, had submitted a sworn statement denying that Smart\u2019s prior military service was a motivating factor in not selecting him for the Security Guard position and that \u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence that [Smart\u2019s] status as a veteran was a factor in [the selecting official\u2019s] suitability decision.\u201d <em>2007 Initial Decision </em>at 6. It further held that the Army had \u201cdemonstrated by preponderant evidence a valid, legitimate government reason for its decision not to select [Smart] due to a negative suitability determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Smart appeals the Board\u2019s USERRA determination. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In his petition, Smart relies exclusively on Major Ortega\u2019s testimony that he considered, among other factors, Smart\u2019s Company Grade Article 15 and general discharge from active duty for fighting in making his decision to remove Smart from consideration. <em>See 2006 Initial Decision </em>at 5. Smart argues that this partial reliance on discipline received while in the military demonstrates that his status as a veteran was a \u201cmotivating or substantial factor\u201d in the Army\u2019s decision not to select him for employment, and that the Army failed to prove that it would have taken the same action in the absence of this status. <em>See Sheehan v. Dep\u2019t. of the Navy, </em>240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201c[I]n USERRA actions there must be an initial showing by the employee that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action, upon which the agency must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u201cThis court\u2019s scope of review of [Board] decisions is defined and limited by statute. The agency\u2019s action in this case must be affirmed unless it is found to be: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Smart does not dispute the Board\u2019s finding that \u201cthe documentary and testimonial evidence of record\u201d established that Smart \u201cwas, in fact, unsuitable for Federal employment in light of his troubling employment record and history of unpaid debts, and that the agency\u2019s negative suitability determination promoted the integrity and efficiency of the service.\u201d <em>Remand Order </em>at 5. Smart\u2019s employment record included \u201cabandonment of one civilian position, removal from a second civilian position for being unable to complete academic training, and removal from a third civilian position for failure to perform.\u201d <em>2006 Initial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Decision </em>at 7. These findings, along with the observation that Smart \u201chad a history of debt problems and in fact had not paid one creditor for over a year,\u201d <em>id., </em>were based on Smart\u2019s own admissions and amply support Major Ortega\u2019s determination that Smart would be \u201cunable to obtain a secret security clearance or qualify as suitable under the agency\u2019s CPSR program,\u201d both of which were required for the position at issue, <em>2006 Initial Decision </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Army demonstrated a legitimate reason for its decision not to select Smart for the Security Guard position, we need not and do not address Smart\u2019s contentions regarding the Army\u2019s consideration of discipline received by Smart during his military service. <em>See generally Pittman v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>486 F.3d 1276, 1282 (Fed.Cir.2007) (declining to address whether an employee can be removed for cause under USERRA based on that employee\u2019s conduct during military service).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Because the Army carried its burden in demonstrating that it \u201cwould have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason,\u201d <em>Sheehan, </em>240 F.3d at 1013, because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and because we otherwise discern no basis on which to overturn the decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
