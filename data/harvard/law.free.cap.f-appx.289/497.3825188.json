Moscoso and Ferrer were also convicted of three counts of distribution of crack, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), three counts of distribution of crack within 1,000 feet of a school, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 860(a), one count of possession of crack with intent to distribute, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of possession of crack within 1,000 feet of a school with intent to distribute, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 860(a). All five defendants appeal their convictions, and Moscoso also appeals his sentence. For the reasons set forth below we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-20\">Between March 2003 and August 2004, the defendants controlled and operated the Chestnut Street Gang. The Chestnut Street Gang shuttled cocaine from New York City to Reading, Pennsylvania where gang members processed the cocaine into crack and sold it. In July 2004 Baez was arrested at one of the properties operated by the Chestnut Street Gang. He pleaded guilty in state court to possession with the intent to deliver cocaine and criminal trespass. Local and federal law enforcement agents began investigating the Chestnut Street Gang and arrested its members in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>August 2004. The indictment charged the defendants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with conspiracy to distribute crack in Reading, Pennsylvania from March 2003 through August 2004, as well as other substantive drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The trial began on November 28, 2005. During voir dire, prospective jurors were asked if they knew any potential witnesses from a list of thirty names, including that of FBI Agent Greg Banis. Juror 3 did not respond. During the trial, the Court was informed that Agent Banis recognized Juror 3 as a neighbor. As a result, the government agreed not to call Agent Banis as a witness, and the defendants waived them right to request Juror 3\u2019s removal. During a later examination, a government witness mentioned that the investigation had been turned over to an FBI unit supervised by Agent Banis. The defendants objected to this reference and requested a mistrial. The District Court conducted further inquiry and was assured by Juror 3 that although Banis was his neighbor, he did not \u201creally associate\u201d with Banis and could remain impartial. The District Court did not remove Juror 3 and denied the request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Concurrently, the Court began receiving reports of juror misconduct by Juror 9. Some of this conduct included making sexual advances on female jurors and other federal employees, approaching counsel for conversation, arriving late, sleeping during trial and making racially-charged remarks. After confronting Juror 9 with these allegations, the Court, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, excused Juror 9 from further participation in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">During trial, as evidence of Baez\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, the government sought to introduce Baez\u2019s certified conviction records, guilty plea, and sentencing order regarding his July 2004 state drug conviction. Other witnesses were able to corroborate this evidence. The defendants objected to the introduction of this evidence, asserting that it was more prejudicial than probative, and that despite being introduced only against Baez, it inferred that the other defendants were also involved with the conspiracy, and thus violated their Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Despite these objections the Court admitted the conviction records into evidence. The Court gave a limiting instruction to the jury, specifically stating that Baez\u2019s conviction record was \u201cnot evidence that any of those other five defendants [were] guilty of conspiracy, and [was] not evidence of anything against those other five co-defendants.\u201d The Court also explained to the jury that Baez \u201cdid not plead guilty to conspiracy. He pled guilty to acts which may or may not have been part of that alleged conspiracy and that\u2019s for you to determine.\u201d The Court also directed the jury \u201cnot to consider Joshua Baez\u2019s plea against any of the other co-defendants for any reason or any charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Also during trial, the government examined officers assigned to the F.B.I. Federal Task Force in charge of the conspiracy investigation. These officers testified that the defendants dealt drugs near schools and around law-abiding citizens. Video surveillance of the neighborhood where some of the drug activity occurred was also introduced at this time. Moscoso objected to the introduction of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Delgado, Baez, Bosah, Moscoso, and Ferrer were eventually convicted and sentenced. Moscoso, the only defendant who now appeals his sentence, was found guilty of conspiring to distribute crack, possession with intent to distribute, distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>(three counts), and distribution of crack within 1,000 feet of a school (three counts), charges carrying a statutory maximum penalty of life in prison. The Court calculated a base offense level of 46 and a criminal history category of IV, yielding an advisory Guidelines sentence of life imprisonment. The Court considered the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) and sentenced Moscoso to a below-Guidelines sentence of 480 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 3742. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of motions for a mistrial and a new trial, as well as its investigation of jury misconduct, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Bertoli </em>40 F.3d 1384, 1392 (3d Cir.1994). We review the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rutland, </em>372 F.3d 543, 545 (3d Cir.2004). However, we exercise plenary review when we \u201care considering whether the District Court correctly interpreted the Federal Rules of Evidence and relevant case law, and [when the defendants\u2019] challenge implicates the confrontation clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>145 F.3d 572, 576 (3d Cir.1998). We review the constitutionality of the District Court\u2019s sentencing procedure de novo. <em>United States v. Barbosa, </em>271 F.3d 438, 452 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">All five defendants contend that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to remove Juror 3 or grant their motions for a mistrial. Juror 3 failed to disclose his acquaintance with Agent Banis during voir dire and was an empaneled juror when he heard another witness mention that Banis was the F.B.I. agent supervising the conspiracy investigation. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the non-disclosure was unintentional and did not affect the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">In general, in order to obtain a new trial a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. The motives for concealing information may vary, but only those reasons that affect a juror\u2019s impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AXo\"><em>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S.Ct. 845, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984). Here, after conducting an on-the-record inquiry, the District Court found that Juror 3\u2019s failure to reveal his acquaintance with Banis during voir dire was unintentional, and was either caused by Juror 3\u2019s inattention or the Court\u2019s mispronunciation of Banis\u2019s name. \u201cGenerally, we will not invalidate a jury verdict because of a juror\u2019s \u2018mistaken, though honest\u2019 response at voir dire.\u201d <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>321 F.3d 429, 441 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>McDonough, </em>464 U.S. at 555, 104 S.Ct. 845). Defendants have not cited specific evidence showing that the District Court incorrectly found Juror 3\u2019s actions to have been unintentional. Regardless, a timely disclosure of Juror 3\u2019s acquaintance with Agent Banis would not have necessarily resulted in a dismissal for cause. As the District Court found, the relationship between Juror 3 and Banis was quite weak, noting that Juror 3 did not \u201creally associate\u201d with Banis. In addition, Banis was not a central figure in the trial, having no active role, thus mitigating the possibility of partiality. Significantly, and in contrast to other venirepersons who had been dismissed, Juror 3 also made repeated assurances, accepted by the District Court, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>he could and would remain impartial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thornton, </em>1 F.3d 149, 154 (3d Cir.1993) (a district court possesses \u201cwide latitude in making the kind of credibility determinations underlying the removal of a juror\u201d). Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in not declaring a mistrial with respect to the actions of Juror 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Moscoso and Ferrer argue that the District Court abused its discretion when it dismissed Juror 9 for inappropriate conduct over their objections. The record shows that Juror 9 engaged in an array of inappropriate behavior, including: approaching trial counsel for conversation, making inappropriate advances to members of the jury and others, making racially-charged remarks, sleeping during proceedings, and arriving late to court. The District Court found that this behavior was \u201cpoison to the deliberation process to the point where jurors cannot have a free and frank interchange.\u201d As we have previously stated, the District Court is \u201cin a far superior position than this Court to appropriately consider allegations of juror misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Boone, </em>458 F.3d 321, 329 (3d Cir.2006). Therefore, as the actions of Juror 9 were egregious, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Juror 9 in order to preserve the integrity of deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Baez argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it permitted his state conviction records to be admitted as evidence against him. The state conviction records contain statements made by Baez admitting to possessing and distributing drugs at the same time and location as the federal conspiracy. This evidence was therefore properly admitted under Rule 801(d)(2) as an admission, as it is probative of his conduct at the time and place of the federal conspiracy. Baez has not shown compelling grounds to find that the probative value of this evidence is greatly outweighed by the prejudicial effect of admitting this evidence, which was corroborated by other testimony. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. Any prejudice or confusion that the admission of Baez\u2019s record may have caused was mitigated by an explicit jury instruction, explaining that Baez \u201cdid not plead guilty to conspiracy.... He pled guilty to acts which may or may not have been part of that alleged conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Delgado, Bosah, Moscoso, and Ferrer additionally argue that the admission of Baez\u2019s state conviction \u201cnecessarily implicated them\u201d and because they did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Baez, their right under the Confrontation Clause was violated. The defendants rely on the rule enunciated in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>which held that a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was violated where his non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession, which implicated both the defendant and the co-defendant in the crime, was admitted into evidence. 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). <em>Bruton </em>is not applicable when the admission of a non-testifying co-defendant does not name or \u201cfacially incriminate\u201d any other defendant. <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 207, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). Since Baez\u2019s admission did not expressly name or reference any other defendant, there is no Confrontation Clause violation. The defendants, other than Baez, argue that even if the admission did not directly implicate them, it created a strong inference that they were involved with Baez in the conspiracy to distribute drugs. However, as we stated in <em>United States v. Belle, </em>\u201cevidentiary linkage or contextual implication may not be utilized to convert a non <em>-Bruton </em>admissible statement into a <em>Bruton </em>inadmissible statement.\u201d 593 F.2d 487, 494 (3d Cir.1979). Moreover, the jury was given a limiting instruction, requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>by the defendants, reminding them to consider Baez\u2019s conviction against him only, and it is an \u201calmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>481 U.S. at 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702. We therefore conclude that Baez\u2019s admission was properly admitted as evidence against him, and that admission of the evidence did not offend the Sixth Amendment rights of the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Appellant Moscoso argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to grant his motion for a mistrial after a government witness mentioned that the investigation was turned over to the FBI and that the drug activity had occurred near to a school and law-abiding citizens. Moscoso does not dispute the factual basis for these comments, but rather argues that he was unfairly prejudiced under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. However, \u201cRule 403 does not provide a shield for defendants who engage in outrageous acts.... It does not generally require the government to sanitize its case, to deflate its witnesses\u2019 testimony, or to tell its story in a monotone.\u201d <em>United States v. Cross, </em>308 F.3d 308, 325 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The references to schools were essential to the government\u2019s standard of proof. The references to innocent bystanders and the FBI were, as the government states \u201cinnocuous and inevitable.\u201d Regardless, Moscoso has not shown that the District Court abused its discretion when it determined that this material was not substantially more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Finally, Moscoso appeals his sentence, arguing that he should be resentenced and that he \u201cis entitled to have the beneficial aspects of the <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] decision apply without retroactive application of the detrimental aspects.\u201d Moscoso contends that the \u201cdetrimental aspect[]\u201d of <em>Booker </em>is that it allows courts to sentence defendants above the Guidelines range. \u201cThe <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the Constitution prohibits application of a law enacted after the date of the offense that inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Pennavaria, </em>445 F.3d 720, 723 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). No ex post facto violation occurred, first because Moscoso had fair warning that participation in federal conspiracy to distribute crack was punishable by life imprisonment under the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 723-24. In addition, <em>Booker </em>\u201cclearly instructed that both of its holdings should be applied to all cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Pennavaria, </em>445 F.3d at 724. Here, Moscoso\u2019s sentence of 480 months\u2019 imprisonment is below both the statutory maximum of life imprisonment and the advisory Guidelines sentence of life imprisonment. We will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence against Moscoso.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">.
