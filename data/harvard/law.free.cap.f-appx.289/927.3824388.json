Behr appeals an order awarding litigation expenses and statutory penalties under Michigan law to Plaintiff-Appellee M &amp; C Corporation (\u201cM&amp;C\u201d), an order finding Behr in contempt of court, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>discovery order. M&amp;C has filed a motion to dismiss Behr\u2019s appeal, arguing that none of the orders challenged are appeal-able final orders. For the reasons discussed below, we DENY M&amp;C\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, we AFFIRM the contempt and discovery orders, but we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the order regarding litigation expenses and statutory penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Although the procedural history of this case is lengthy and complex, the facts relevant to this appeal can be summarized fairly briefly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1985, M&amp;C entered a contract with Behr to act as the exclusive sales agent for Behr in the United States and Canada for at least five years for the sale of wood interior panels for General Motors\u2019 luxury automobiles. The contract specified that Michigan law governed the parties\u2019 agreement and that any disputes arising in connection to the contract be arbitrated under the Rules of the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Behr terminated the agreement in 1991 but failed to pay M&amp;C commissions it had earned for some sales and client development work. The parties\u2019 dispute eventually came before an arbitrator in London, England, and on March 1,1994, the arbitrator issued eleven awards,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the district court confirmed, and this court affirmed. <em>M &amp; C Corp. v. Enwin Behr GmbH &amp; Co., KG, </em>87 F.3d 844 (6th Cir. 1996) <em>(Behr I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">One of the awards, Award Eight, concerned payment of future commissions on the sales of certain orders, and the parties disputed which orders were included within the scope of that award. The district court agreed with Behr that the award was ambiguous regarding on which \u201corders\u201d M&amp;C deserved commissions, and the district court remanded the case to the arbitrator for clarification. We reversed that decision in <em>M &amp; C Corp. v. Enwin Behr GmbH &amp; Co., KG, </em>143 F.3d 1033 (6th Cir.1998) <em>(Behr II). </em>The parties continued to dispute the amount owed under the Eighth Award, and the district court again remanded the case to the arbitrator for clarification. We reversed and remanded again, requesting that the district court clarify the precise reason for its remand to the arbitrator. <em>M &amp; C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH &amp; Co., KG, </em>326 F.3d 772 (6th Cir.2003) <em>(Behr III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">In March 2004, the district court specified that \u201c \u2018[t]he award is unclear insofar as the Court cannot determine whether or not [a list appearing in the award] is the exclusive list of the products on which commissions are due ... [and] there is a continuing controversy over how long particular parts are commissionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Behr TV, </em>411 F.3d at 756 (quoting district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>remand order). The district court remanded the case to the original arbitrator \u201c(1) to state the exact scope of the products commissionable under the Eighth Award and (2) to state what payments, if any, are due to each party from the other under the Eighth Award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Behr appealed the district court\u2019s March 2004 remand order, and, while that appeal was pending in our court, the arbitrator held the hearing that the district court had ordered on April 1 1-13, 2005, in London. On April 28, 2005, we heard oral argument in <em>Behr TV </em>and filed our decision on June 17, 2005. In <em>Behr TV, </em>we concluded that the Eighth Award was not ambiguous and, retaining jurisdiction in the case, we solicited further filings regarding the amounts owed under the reading of the award and contract adopted in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The day after <em>Behr IV, </em>the arbitrator issued a letter clarifying the award, <em>see </em>Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 286-91 (Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 Letter), and on July 27, 2005, we withdrew and vacated our opinion, J.A. at 393 (Sixth Circuit Order). We stated that \u201cin view of the arbitrator\u2019s clarification\u201d we granted the petition for rehearing, vacated our opinion, and remanded the case \u201cto the district court for enforcement proceedings in accordance with the arbitration award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">M&amp;C filed a number of motions attempting to enforce the clarified award, and those motions gave rise to the Orders at issue in this appeal. In particular, on September 14, 2006, the district court issued an order granting M&amp;C\u2019s motion for assessment of litigation expenses and statutory penalties under the Michigan Sales Representatives Commission Act (\u201cMSRCA\u201d), accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d). J.A. at 65-73 (Statutory Damages &amp; Litigation Fees Order). As noted in the magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R, as to statutory damages, the MSRCA provides that a principal who \u201cintentionally\u201d fails to pay commissions when they are due must pay \u201can amount equal to 2 times the amount of commissions due but not paid as required by this section or $100,000.00, whichever is less.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961(5)(b); J.A. at 305 (Statutory Damages &amp; Litigation Expenses R&amp;R). The MSRCA also provides that \u201cthe court shall award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and court costs\u201d and defines \u201cprevailing party\u201d as \u201ca party who wins on all the allegations of the complaint or on all of the responses to the complaint.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 \u00a7 600.2961(6), 600.2961(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">The district court also issued an order on September 14, 2006, granting M&amp;C\u2019s motion for contempt, again accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R. JA. at 74-83 (Contempt Order). The contempt order was based on Behr\u2019s violation of an earlier January 1996 order that placed Behr in receivership in response to Behr\u2019s efforts to obstruct and delay M&amp;C from collecting the payments that the arbitrator had awarded M&amp;C in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">On January 31, 1996, the district court stated that it would \u201cimpose a limited receivership over any direct or indirect property interest held by Erwin Behr in Behr Industries [\u201cBIC\u201d] of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\u201d J.A. at 115 (Receivership Order at 18). On March 29, 1996, the district court issued an Addendum to the Receivership Order, which contained the following language: \u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant, Erwin Behr GmbH &amp; Company, KG, its officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys ... are enjoined from directly or indirectly transferring, receiving, changing, encumbering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>selling, removing, assigning or otherwise disposing of any assets and property owned, controlled, or in possession of the defendant.\u201d J.A. at 128. (Addendum to Receivership Order). In 1996, Behr owned Erwin Behr Beteiligungs-GmbH (\u201cBehr Beteiligungs\u201d), which owned Erwin Behr Automotive GmbH (\u201cBehr Automotive\u201d), which owned BIC. J.A. at 315 (Contempt R&amp;R at 3); J.A. at 302 (Villwock Deck).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">In May 2005, while the case was pending in our court, Behr Beteiligungs sold its subsidiary Behr Automotive, and its subsidiary BIC, to a German private equity firm; this transaction occurred without any notice to M&amp;C, the district court, our court, the arbitrator, or the court-appointed receiver. JA. at 315 (Contempt R&amp;R at 3). Behr has not disclosed any of the terms or conditions of the sale. <em>Id. </em>The magistrate judge found that \u201cDefendants are in unequivocal contempt of this Court\u2019s order,\u201d J.A. at 317 (Contempt R&amp;R at 5), and the district court agreed, noting that \u201c[sjince the confirmation of the arbitration award, M&amp;C has had extreme difficulty in collecting the amount due,\u201d J.A. at 75 (Contempt Order at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Finally, on September 14, 2006, the district court issued an order overruling Behr\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s order requiring Behr to produce a witness for deposition in Detroit, Michigan. JA. at 84-85 (Discovery Order). The magistrate judge\u2019s amended discovery order noted that \u201cPlaintiff [M&amp;C] obtained a money judgment against [Behr, and Behr] has since frustrated the attempts of [M&amp;C] and this Court to ascertain the nature and location of [Behr\u2019s] assets.\u201d J.A. at 485-86 (Amended Discovery Order at 2-3). Although Behr\u2019s counsel had claimed that Behr was insolvent under German law and was under the control of an estate administrator who lacked relevant personal knowledge and funds to travel to the United States, J.A. at 459-60 (Discovery Order at 1-2), the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan denied Behr\u2019s application for recognition of a foreign bankruptcy proceeding. J.A. at 485 (Amended Discovery Order at 2). Behr identified a representative willing to testify by phone from Germany, but this individual was affiliated with Behr Automotive, not Behr. Appellant Br. at 52-53. The magistrate judge found that this proposal did not comply with the discovery order, and the magistrate judge amended the discovery order, requiring Behr to make a number of disclosures and to designate and make available a witness for a deposition in Detroit. J.A. at 486 (Amended Discovery Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Behr timely appealed all three orders of the district court. In March 2007, M&amp;C filed a motion to dismiss Behr\u2019s appeals for lack of jurisdiction, contending that none of the orders were final, appealable orders. In April 2007, Behr filed a response, and M&amp;C then filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">A. Statutory Damages and Litigation Expenses Order</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">M&amp;C argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order awarding M&amp;C statutory damages and litigation expenses because the order was not a final judgment, as it left undetermined the amount that M&amp;C was entitled to receive. Behr argues that the Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 letter was a \u201cnew award\u201d requiring confirmation before any enforcement proceeding. Neither argument is convincing, and we address each in turn. Finally, Behr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>argues that the district court improperly granted M&amp;C\u2019s motion for damages and expenses when no arbitrator had considered or ruled on these claims, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">1. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">M&amp;C contends that the district court\u2019s Statutory Damages and Litigation Fees Order is not an appealable final judgment because the district court did <em>not </em>award a precise amount of litigation expenses, but remanded the issue to the magistrate judge for consideration after M&amp;C produces evidence of its expenses. <em>See </em>Appellee Br. at 29; <em>see also </em>Appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Behr notes, however, the portion of the order awarding M&amp;C statutory penalties <em>is </em>complete and final. We have noted that \u201c[a]s a practical matter, most post-judgment orders should be deemed final because \u2018there is often little prospect that further proceedings will occur to make them final.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. One 1985 Chevrolet Corvette, </em>914 F.2d 804, 807 (6th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Washington, </em>761 F.2d 1404, 1406 (9th Cir.1985)). In its order regarding statutory penalties under the MSRCA, the district court fixed a specific amount, and only M&amp;C\u2019s collection of that amount remains. We have held that \u201c[ujnder the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction ... a court of appeals may, in its discretion, \u2018exercise jurisdiction over issues that are not independently appealable when those issues are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with matters over which the appellate court properly and independently has jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farm Labor Org. Comm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, </em>308 F.3d 523, 549 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Chambers v. Ohio Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>145 F.3d 793, 797 (6th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">The district court\u2019s Statutory Damages and Litigation Fees Order deals with two claims under the MSRCA, and the order completely disposes of the statutory penalties claim. M&amp;C concedes that the statutory penalty aspect of the order is final and appealable but argues that we should not consider the appeal essentially because of Behr\u2019s history of delay and obstruction. Appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 18-19. Although we recognize that this litigation has a protracted history, we nonetheless exercise our discretion to consider the issue of litigation expenses along with the intertwined issue of the propriety of damages under the MSRCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">2. The Need to Confirm the Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 Clarification Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Behr argues that the Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 Clarification Letter is a new award requiring judicial confirmation under the FAA prior to enforcement. Appellant Br. at 31-36. Behr describes the letter as a new award because the arbitrator held a hearing, considered new evidence, and determined a specific amount of damages owed to M&amp;C. We have previously held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>however, that \u201cthe arbitrator has the power ... to go back and \u2018clarify\u2019 an ambiguous or incomplete portion of an award,\u201d and that is precisely what the arbitrator did in this case. <em>Sterling China Co. v. Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plasties &amp; Allied Workers Local No. 21, </em>357 F.3d 546, 555 (6th Cir.2004). The parties have disputed the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s original Eighth Award, which was a forward-looking order of specific performance that commanded Behr to pay M&amp;C commissions on the future sales of a class of products. The parties\u2019 dispute as to which products the arbitrator intended to include in this order has exceeded a decade, and all the possible parts on which M&amp;C might conceivably deserve a commission were sold long ago. After the matter was finally remanded in 2005 to the original arbitrator, he held a hearing and issued a letter clarifying the exact products he had meant to include in the original award. Once the arbitrator identified those products using Behr\u2019s own sales records, as kept by the court-appointed receiver, J.A. at 290 (Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 Clarification Letter at 5), the matter of calculating the commissions owed to produce an award total was a simple, ministerial task.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Even the case law that Behr cites supports viewing the arbitrator\u2019s letter as a clarification and not a new award requiring confirmation. As the Seventh Circuit has explained, when determining whether an arbitrator\u2019s action is an award, courts should \u201cgo beyond a document\u2019s heading .and delve into its substance and impact.\u201d <em>Publicis Commc\u2019n v. True North Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>206 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>Appellant Br. at 32-36 (citing <em>Publicis.) </em>The substance and impact of the arbitrator\u2019s 2005 letter, issued after a remand ordered by the district court, was merely to clarify the scope of the original award, not to issue any new award to M&amp;C. The original Eighth Award was one of specific performance, and although the arbitrator held a hearing and heard new evidence, the effect of the letter was merely to clarify and determine precisely what Behr should have paid M&amp;C under the original award.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">We conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s 2005 letter was merely a clarification of the original award that did not require confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">3. The Award of Damages and Litigation Expenses under the MSRCA</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">Behr contends that the district court lacked the authority and jurisdiction to grant M&amp;C\u2019s motion for damages and litigation expenses under the MSRCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">As we noted in <em>Behr I, </em>the parties\u2019 contract required them to submit disputes to arbitration. <em>Behr I, </em>87 F.3d at 846 (noting that the district court stayed proceedings on Behr\u2019s breach of contract suit and \u201cordered the parties to submit the dispute to arbitration as required by the contract\u201d). To receive damages, the MSRCA requires a showing that a defendant \u201cintentionally failed to pay the commission when due,\u201d and the MSRCA provides litigation expenses only to a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d which it defines as \u201ca party who wins on all the allegations of the complaint or on all of the responses to the complaint.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961. In his 2005 letter, the arbitrator specifically declined to consider the issues of damages and expenses, noting that although \u201cM&amp;C also claim[s] attorney\u2019s fees and costs[, tjhose are not a matter for me but for the U.S. Courts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>which proceedings for enforcement have been brought.\u201d J.A. at 288 (Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 Letter at 3). Nonetheless, we believe that the issues of whether Behr \u201cintentionally failed to pay\u201d commissions to M&amp;C and whether M&amp;C qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d are questions that an arbitrator, not the district court or magistrate judge, must answer given the parties\u2019 contract requiring arbitration of their disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Behr made this argument to the district court, but the court summarily rejected it. The district court stated Behr\u2019s position as, \u201c[i]n short, if the arbitrator did not make a ruling on statutory penalties, Behr argues, this Court is unable to make a ruling.\u201d J.A. at 69 (Statutory Damages and Litigation Fees Order at 5). The district court labeled that objection \u201cmerit-less,\u201d explaining that \u201cthe arbitrator did make a ruling on [M&amp;C\u2019s] entitlement to these additional expenses in his original March 1, 1994 arbitration award,\u201d in which \u201cthe arbitrator found that M&amp;C was entitled to statutory penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, as Behr points out, the original arbitration award found that Behr \u201cintentionally failed\u201d to pay commissions on sales that occurred between 1991, when Behr terminated the agreement with M&amp;C, and 1994, when the arbitration occurred. Appellant Br. at 21-26. In 2005, M&amp;C was seeking damages for Behr\u2019s failure to pay commissions on sales that occurred <em>after </em>the 1994 arbitration and award. The arbitrator\u2019s finding in 1994 regarding Behr\u2019s conduct between 1991 and 1994 could not possibly be relevant to whether Behr \u201cintentionally failed\u201d to pay these later commissions. Whether Behr intentionally failed to pay these later commissions is a new question that an arbitrator, not the district court, should address in this first instance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The issue of M&amp;C\u2019s entitlement to litigation expenses was similarly improper for the district court to decide. The arbitrator\u2019s original 1994 award found that M&amp;C was entitled to litigation expenses as a prevailing party under the MSRCA, J.A. at 388-89 (Arbitration Award at 42-43) (awarding M&amp;C $335,793.47 in legal expenses because it \u201csucceeded\u201d on the vast majority of its claims), but the arbitrator\u2019s June 2005 letter expressly declined to consider whether M&amp;C was entitled to litigation expenses from litigating the scope of the Eighth Award. J.A. at 288 (Arbitrator\u2019s 2005 Clarification Letter at 3). While the arbitrator\u2019s 2005 letter did adopt a view of the Eighth Award in line with M&amp;C\u2019s view of the award, the question of whether M&amp;C is a prevailing party \u2014 which determines any entitlement to litigation expenses \u2014 is a matter that an arbitrator, not the district court, should determine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">In sum, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s Statutory Damages and Litigation Fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Order insofar as it determined that the arbitrator\u2019s 2005 letter was merely a clarification of the original award that did not require confirmation, but we REVERSE the remainder of the order because the court improperly usurped the role of the arbitrator in determining whether M&amp;C was entitled to damages and litigation expenses under the MSRCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">B. Contempt Order</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">\u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s finding of contempt for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Liberte Capital Group, LLC v. Capwill, </em>462 F.3d 543, 550 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cAn abuse of discretion exists where the district court relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or applied an incorrect legal standard [and t]his Court will reverse only if it is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">\u201cThe movant in a civil contempt proceeding bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent \u2018violated a definite and specific order of the court requiring him to perform or refrain from performing a particular act or acts with knowledge of the court\u2019s order.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Glover v. Johnson, </em>934 F.2d 703, 707 (6th Cir.1991)). \u201cThis Court requires that the prior order be \u2018clear and unambiguous\u2019 to support a finding of contempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550-51 (quoting <em>Grace v. Ctr. for Auto Safety, </em>72 F.3d 1236, 1241 (6th Cir.1996)). We must resolve ambiguities \u201cin favor of the party charged with contempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">2. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">M&amp;C argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a contempt order, citing <em>Joy &amp; Middlebelt Sunoco, Inc. v. Fusion Oil, Inc., </em>179 Fed.Appx. 301, 303 (6th Cir.2006), for the proposition that \u201ca civil contempt order ... is not considered a final order in this Circuit.\u201d In <em>Fusion Oil, </em>however, we next immediately quoted <em>McAlpin v. Lexington 76 Auto Truck Stop, Inc., </em>229 F.3d 491, 500 (6th Cir.2000), in which we stated that \u201ca \u2018judgment of civil contempt is not [itself] a final decree,\u2019 and therefore is not appealable <em>in the absence of a final judgment. </em>\u201d <em>McAlpin, </em>229 F.3d at 500 (alteration in original, emphasis added) (quoting <em>Blaylock v. Cheker Oil Co., </em>547 F.2d 962, 965 (6th Cir.1976)); <em>see also United States v. Conces, </em>507 F.3d 1028, 1037 n. 7 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>McAlpin </em>and stating that \u201cthe post-judgment contempt order entered by the district court in this case is considered final and reviewable\u201d). This appeal involves a final judgment, and, as we noted in <em>McAlpin, </em>the policy of preventing piecemeal litigation is served when a final judgment exists because the concern that the appeal of the contempt order represents an interlocutory order is not present. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">M&amp;C misreads <em>Fusion Oil </em>and <em>McAlpin, </em>and both cases demonstrate that we have jurisdiction in this case to hear Behr\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order finding it in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">3. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Behr challenges the contempt order on the ground that the wording in the original orders was ambiguous and did not cover the transaction in question. We disagree, and accordingly we AFFIRM the contempt order.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">As stated above, on January 31, 1996, the district court stated that it would \u201cimpose a limited receivership over any direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>or indirect property interest held by Erwin Behr in Behr Industries [BIC] of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\u201d J.A. at 115 (Receivership Order at 18). On March 29, 1996, the district court issued an Addendum to the Receivership Order, which contained the following language: \u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant, Erwin Behr GmbH &amp; Company, KG, its officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys ... are enjoined from directly or indirectly transferring, receiving, changing, encumbering, selling, removing, assigning or otherwise disposing of any assets and property owned, controlled, or in possession of the defendant.\u201d J.A. at 123. (Addendum to Receivership Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Behr\u2019s challenge to the contempt order hinges on arguing that because the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d modify the list of verbs beginning with \u201ctransferring,\u201d and do <em>not </em>modify the phrase \u201cany assets and property owned, controlled, or in possession of the defendant,\u201d the Addendum to the Receivership Order did not clearly reach Behr\u2019s \u201cindirect\u201d property interest in BIC, a subsidiary corporation several levels below Behr. Even resolving any possible ambiguities in favor of the party charged with contempt, this argument lacks any merit. As the district court noted in its contempt order, the \u201cJanuary 31, 1996 receivership order ... noted that Behr may be holding and concealing assets through a chain of affiliates, including BIC.\u201d J.A. at 78 (Contempt Order at 5). Further, although Behr expends much effort arguing that, under doctrines of corporate law, a parent company does not \u201cown\u201d legally distinct subsidiary corporations, Behr ignores that the Addendum <em>also </em>prohibited Behr from transferring or disposing of \u201cany assets and property ... <em>controlled </em>\u201d by it. J.A. at 123 (Addendum to Receivership Order) (emphasis added). A corporation that owns 100% of the shares of another corporation, or chain of corporations, \u201ccontrols\u201d those corporations in any meaningful sense of the word. Most importantly, the Receivership Order made <em>specific reference </em>to BIC. J.A. at 115 (Receivership Order at 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Given that the Order\u2019s operative language included the word \u201ccontrolled\u201d and that the Order specifically referred to BIC, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Behr in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">C. Discovery Order</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">\u201c[I]t is well established that the scope of discovery is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders Corp., </em>643 F.2d 1229, 1240 (6th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">2. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">M&amp;C argues that we lack jurisdiction over Behr\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s discovery order because \u201cpost-judgment orders granting discovery, such as those relating to judgment debtors \u2018are not considered final judgments and may be appealed only after the issuance of a contempt order for failure to comply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piratello v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., </em>360 F.3d 506, 509 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Richmark Corp. v. Timber Falling Consultants, Inc., </em>937 F.2d 1444, 1449 (9th Cir. 1991)); <em>see also </em>Appellee Br. at 31-32 (citing <em>Piratello </em>and <em>Richmark </em>along with cases from the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits). M&amp;C also notes that the Seventh Circuit has observed that when a \u201cjudge orders discovery, the person ordered to produce, if desperate for an immediate appeal, can disobey the order and appeal the resulting judgment for criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>tempt.\u201d <em>Cent. States, Se. &amp; Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Express Freight Lines, Inc., </em>971 F.2d 5, 6 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Behr counters with two arguments: that a contempt order <em>is </em>present in this case, and that M&amp;C misreads Judge Posner\u2019s opinion in <em>Express Freight Lines. See </em>Appellant Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 9-11. We agree with Behr\u2019s second argument that M&amp;C misreads Judge Posner\u2019s opinion in <em>Express Freight Lines </em>and that his reasoning would support holding that jurisdiction exists over Behr\u2019s appeal in this case. Appellant Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Behr highlights the following language from <em>Express Freight Lines:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">A contested collection proceeding will end in a judgment or a series of judgments granting supplementary relief to the plaintiff. The judgment that concludes the collection proceeding is the judgment from which the defendant can appeal. In doing so he can of course bring before the appellate court any interlocutory orders of which he complains that have not become moot, including an order granting his adversary post-judgment discovery. But that order is not appealable until then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-8\"><em>Express Freight Lines, </em>971 F.2d at 6 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Appellant Reply Br. at 5-6; Appellant Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 10. We have previously cited <em>Express Freight Lines </em>regarding a related point. <em>United States v. Worthy, </em>No. 97-4459, 1998 WL 898840, at *1 (6th Cir. Dec.17, 1998) (per curiam order) (stating that \u201cthe district court\u2019s order denying Worthy\u2019s discovery motion was a final judgment\u201d and citing <em>Express Freight </em>Lines).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">We therefore hold that a party may appeal a post-judgment order granting discovery when the party is also appealing the collection judgment itself, as is the case here given that Behr is appealing the district court\u2019s final order regarding the assessment of statutory damages and litigation expenses under the MSRCA. We proceed to discuss whether the district court abused its discretion in granting M&amp;C\u2019s motion for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">3. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">In light of the history of this case, in which Behr has received numerous sanctions for its tactics of delay and obstruction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and given what the magistrate judge termed Behr\u2019s \u201cunequivocal\u201d violation of the district court\u2019s Receivership and Addendum orders, the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering the discovery order in this case. In its 1996 Receivership Order, the district court presciently observed that because \u201cBehr has already demonstrated that its disclosures have not been consistently accurate ... there is a very real concern in this ease that assets of a foreign corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>which might otherwise be used to satisfy this judgment, may be removed from the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d J.A. at 115 (Receivership Order at 18). For that reason, the district court \u201cimpose[d] a limited receivership over any direct or indirect property interest held by Erwin Behr in [BIC] of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In May 2005, while this case was pending before this court, one of Behr\u2019s subsidiaries, over which it had total control, sold off a subsidiary that owned BIC in blatant violation of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">After M&amp;C learned that Behr had sold BIC, M&amp;C sought to depose a representative of Behr regarding this transaction, and Behr has refused to designate any witness, claiming it has entered bankruptcy in Germany. But as M&amp;C notes, Behr has twice had its petitions for recognition of a foreign bankruptcy proceeding dismissed. Appellee Br. at 60-61 (citing dismissals). Further, M&amp;C notes that although Behr contends that its German bankruptcy proceeding was filed in August 2005 and power over the company was vested in a person beyond its control, Appellant Br. at 50-51, Behr was nonetheless able on October 13, 2005, to secure a sworn declaration from Klaus Villwock, who stated that he was the former manager of Behr who could testify about various matters relating to Behr for the purpose of challenging the contempt order. J.A. at 302-03 (Villwock Aff.); Appellee Br. at 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">In light of these facts, the district court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he Magistrate Judge did not err in believing that there must be at least one person who can speak on behalf of Behr\u201d was not an abuse of discretion. J.A. at 84 (Order Overruling Behr\u2019s Objections to Magistrate Judge\u2019s Discovery Order); <em>see also </em>J.A. at 459-61 (Magistrate Judge\u2019s Order Granting M&amp;C\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">In sum, we hold that we have jurisdiction to consider Behr\u2019s appeal of the discovery order alongside Behr\u2019s appeal of the statutory damages and litigation expenses order and the contempt order. We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that Behr designate an official for a deposition in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">For the reasons discussed above, we DENY M&amp;C\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s contempt and discovery orders, but we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the order regarding litigation expenses and statutory penalties.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. The last time this case appeared in our court, we summarized the relevant facts in somewhat greater detail. <em>See M&amp;C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GMBH &amp; Co., KG, </em>411 F.3d 749, 751-56 (6th Cir.2005) <em>(Behr IV) </em>(withdrawn); 411 F.3d 749, 2005 WL 1413132. The facts summarized above come from our opinion in <em>Behr TV.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. Several of the awards compelled Behr to pay M&amp;C money. \"The total amount of principal payments required under these awards is $1,976,292.47, which was to be paid in full, irrespective of any other judicial proceeding, by March 31, 1994____ Behr did not make any payment on the principal amount of any of these awards,\u201d and, as the district court noted in February 1996, \"[t]o date, Erwin Behr has not complied with any of the awards.\u201d <em>M &amp; C Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH &amp; Co., KG, </em>165 F.R.D. 65, 66 (E.D.Mich. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b954-6\">. The parties vigorously dispute whether an order finding liability for, but not determining the amount of, attorney fees is final and appealable. M&amp;C\u2019s position appears correct: such an order may <em>not </em>be appealable. <em>See Loudermill v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., </em>844 F.2d 304, 308 (6th Cir.1988) (noting prior holding \"that while a judgment on the merits was a final judgment and could be appealed when the amount of attorneys' fees was undecided, such reasoning did not apply to a splitting of the elements of attorneys' fees\u201d) (internal citation omitted). As explained in text above, however, resolving this issue does not settle the matter because the district court\u2019s award of statutory damages under the MSRCA <em>is </em>a final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b956-5\">. Furthermore, given that the parties vigorously debated the scope of the Eighth Award for years, with the district court and our court reaching varying interpretations of its meaning, we note that Behr would seem to have a strong good-faith defense for its failure to pay M&amp;C the commissions. Indeed, in <em>Behr IV, </em>we initially agreed with Behr\u2019s interpretation of the Eighth Award and sought further submissions from the parties to determine whether Behr had already satisfied the award or, in fact, <em>overpaid </em>M&amp;C under Award Eight. <em>Behr IV, </em>411 F.3d at 758, 761-62 (stating that \u201d[w]e agree with Behr\u201d and noting expert\u2019s calculation that Behr overpaid M&amp;C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b956-11\">. Because we conclude that M&amp;C may not receive litigation expenses prior to an arbitrator\u2019s finding that M&amp;C is entitled to them, we do not address the parties\u2019 dispute regarding whether the cost of the court-appointed receiver may be recovered as a \"court cost\u201d under Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2961(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b959-9\">. <em>See M &amp; C Corp. v.
