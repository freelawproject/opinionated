After review, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AWeY\">A. Initial Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">On December 5, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> served Sanchez-Becerra with a Notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d). The NTA charged that (1) on or about January 1, 1980, SanchezBecerra, a native and citizen of Mexico, illegally entered the United States through Texas; (2) on September 27, 1991, Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident based on his seasonal agricultural work; (3) on November 18, 1993, Sanchez-Becerra was convicted in Alabama state court of second-degree rape; and (4) based on this conviction, Sanchez-Becerra was removable under Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On February 4, 2003, Sanchez-Becerra did not appear for his removal hearing. An IJ ordered him removed <em>in absentia </em>based on his second-degree rape conviction. In April 2004, Sanchez-Becerra was removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On October 23, 2004, Sanchez-Becerra was arrested by federal Border Patrol agents in New Mexico. He was charged with illegal reentry, but the indictment was dismissed after Sanchez-Becerra argued his initial removal proceedings <em>in abstentia </em>were fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">B. Reopened Removal Proceedings and \u00a7 212(c) Waiver Request</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On June 16, 2005, Sanchez-Becerra and the government filed a joint motion to reopen Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s removal proceedings. The motion stated Sanchez-Becerra never actually received notice of the removal hearing because the INS listed his address as the county jail and sent the notice of the hearing there, but in the interim he had been released on bond. The IJ granted the motion and reopened the removal proceedings on September 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">The IJ continued the removal proceedings five times between April 2006 and May 2007, at least four of which were attributed to Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s counsel being sick and/or Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s not filing the required written applications for relief from removal. During the course of these continued hearings, Sanchez-Becerra admitted the charges in the NTA and conceded removability, but stated that he intended to apply for a waiver of removal under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">A year after the removal proceedings had been reopened, Sanchez-Becerra filed his application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver on October 31, 2006. The next day, he filed a memorandum supporting his request for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver <em>nunc pro tunc.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>His memo argued that the agency error in 2003 in not providing him notice of his original removal hearing and ordering him removed <em>in abstentia </em>prevented him from applying for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of removal back in 2003. Sanchez-Becerra acknowledged that he was statutorily ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver under the relevant statutes as construed by the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Sanchez-Becerra requested that the IJ allow him to apply for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>i.e., as if he was at his original removal hearing in 2003 before the BIA decided <em>Blake </em>in 2005. The government\u2019s position throughout the proceedings was that Sanehez-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Becerra was statutorily ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">At a continued hearing on November 2, 2006, the IJ scheduled a merits hearing for Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) waiver request. While appearing before the IJ, Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s counsel requested a hearing date in May 2007 and accepted a hearing date of May 7, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On May 7, 2007, Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s counsel was not present at the hearing. The IJ stated that Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s counsel had filed an untimely request for another continuance the previous week, which had been denied. The IJ also stated the clerk of the United States District Court in El Paso had called the previous week and said the district court judge had issued an order forbidding Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s counsel from leaving Texas until the pending criminal trial was finished. The IJ told the clerk that Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s case would proceed. The IJ told SanchezBecerra, who did appear, that the IJ would be issuing a written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">C. IJ\u2019s Removal Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">On May 7, 2007, the IJ issued a written decision finding that Sanchez-Becerra was removable as an aggravated felon based on his second-degree rape conviction. The IJ also concluded that Sanchez-Becerra was statutorily ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Further, the IJ\u2019s decision stated that Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s request for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief was \u201chighly speculative\u201d in light of the Attorney General\u2019s instructions in <em>In re Jean, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 373 (BIA 2002), that a discretionary waiver must balance humanitarian concerns against the seriousness of the criminal offense, and, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, waivers would not be granted where the person seeking relief was convicted of a dangerous or violent crime. The IJ stated that it considered second-degree rape to be a dangerous crime and that \u201c[gjiven the highly speculative nature of the relief, even if this Court were empowered to grant such relief, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief is not a realistic option in this matter.\u201d Finally, the IJ stated that Sanchez-Becerra had not provided any authority, from either the BIA or this Court, establishing that an IJ has any equitable power to grant <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief and thus concluded that it had \u201cno authority to grant the requested relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">D. BIA Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">On appeal to the BIA, Sanchez-Becerra argued that (1) the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance deprived him of his right to counsel and was an abuse of discretion, and (2) he was eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">The BIA dismissed Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s appeal. The BIA found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s factual findings. The BIA concluded that the IJ correctly determined that Sanchez-Becerra was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, citing <em>Blake.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">The BIA also noted Sanchez-Becerra \u201cthrough counsel, does not argue on appeal that he is statutorily eligible for section 212(c) relief, notwithstanding <em>Matter of Blake.\u201d </em>The BIA concluded it had no jurisdiction to grant equitable relief, which is what a \u00a7 212(c) waiver <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s case would constitute. Finally, the BIA concluded Sanchez-Becerra had shown no prejudice in the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance in light of his statutory ineligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility. Sanchez-Becerra filed a timely petition for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">This Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review removal orders is restricted where the petitioner, like Sanchez-Becerra, is a criminal alien removable based on a conviction for an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (referencing INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)). However, we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). A petitioner must allege a constitutional or legal claim that is \u201ccolorable,\u201d i.e., with \u201csome possible validity,\u201d for us to have jurisdiction under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1284 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). We review legal and constitutional claims <em>de novo. Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">B. \u00a7 212(c) Waiver <em>Nunc Pro Tunc</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Sanchez-Becerra argues the BIA erred in concluding that it lacked equitable jurisdiction to grant <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief and in denying his request for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver <em>nunc 'pro tunc. </em>Sanchez-Becerra thus presents a legal question that this Court has jurisdiction to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">It is unnecessary to address whether <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief is purely equitable in nature or if the BIA had discretionary authority to grant <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief because, even if the BIA had that authority, Sanchez-Becerra was statutorily ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver in 2003, just as he was in 2007. As discussed below, the applicable statutory framework in 2003 was the same as that in 2007 and thus Sanchez-Becerra was equally ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">We start with INA \u00a7 212(a) and (c). INA \u00a7 212(a) lists the \u201cclasses of excludable aliens\u201d who are ineligible for admission to the United States. INA \u00a7 212(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). One of these excludable classes is \u201c[cjriminal and related grounds,\u201d which includes, in relevant part, aliens convicted of \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Former INA \u00a7 212(c), which has now been repealed, provided for a waiver of such \u00a7 212(a) ineligibility as follows: \u201c[ajliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily <em>and not under an order of deportation, </em>and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section.\u201d INA \u00a7 212(c); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">In 1976, the BIA expanded \u00a7 212(c) to permit a waiver of removal to a lawful permanent resident <em>in deportation proceedings </em>and regardless of whether he voluntarily departed the United States and merely seeks to return. <em>See Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Matter of Silva, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26, 30 (BIA 1976)). In subsequent cases, the BIA and Attorney General clarified that a \u00a7 212(c) waiver was available only to aliens who were deporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ble on grounds for which there was a comparable ground of inadmissibility in INA \u00a7 212(a). <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Matter of Hemandez-Casillas, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 262, 280-93 (BIA 1991); <em>Matter of Wadud, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 182, 184 (BIA 1984); <em>Matter of Granados, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dee. 726, 728 (BIA 1979)). In other words, a deportee was eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver if the statutory ground for his deportation was comparable to a statutory ground for inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In 1991, the BIA applied this statutoiy framework to an alien deportable for an aggravated felony conviction and concluded that \u201ca waiver under section 212(c) is not unavailable to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony simply because there is no ground of exclusion [in \u00a7 212(a)] which recites the words, \u2018convicted of an aggravated felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Meza, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 257, 259 (BIA 1991). Instead, the BIA looked to whether the \u201cspecific category of aggravated felony at issue\u201d had a comparable ground of inadmissibility in \u00a7 212(a). <em>See id. </em>The BIA concluded an alien deportable for an aggravated felony of \u201cillicit trafficking in any controlled substance,\u201d as defined in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), was eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because it had a statutory counterpart of inadmissibility in INA \u00a7 212(a)(23), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(23).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In 2005, the BIA applied this same framework in concluding that an alien deportable based on an aggravated felony conviction for sexual abuse of a minor is ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. <em>See Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 727-29. The BIA concluded the inadmissibility grounds for a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude\u201d in INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) was not a statutory counterpart because \u201cthe moral turpitude ground of exclusion addresses a distinctly different and much broader category of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728. The BIA explained that \u201cthe test for comparability is not met merely by showing that some or many of the offenses included in the charged category could also be crimes involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729. The aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor, which formed the basis of Blake\u2019s removal, did not have a comparable ground of inadmissibility in \u00a7 212(a) and thus deportee Blake was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">As shown above, the use of a statutory counterpart analysis for \u00a7 212(c) waiver requests applied by the BIA in <em>Blake </em>was established by the time of Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s initial removal proceedings in 2003. <em>See Zamora-Mallari v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 679, 689-90 (7th Cir.2008) (stating that the BIA in <em>Blake </em>\u201cdid not establish a new rule of law, but rather applied the previously well-established comparability standard in a different factual context\u201d); <em>Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 369-70 (5th Cir.2007) (rejecting argument that <em>Blake </em>contradicted prior agency practice); <em>Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158, 163 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cThe principle that \u00a7 212(c) is available in removal proceedings only where the ground for removal has a \u2018statutory counterpart\u2019 ground for exclusion has been firmly in place and consistently applied since at least 1991.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Even if the BIA allowed him to apply for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver as if it was 2003, Sanchez-Becerra has not shown the statutory framework and BIA\u2019s decision would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>be any different than in <em>Blake. </em>In fact, Sanchez-Becerra has not challenged the BIA\u2019s analysis in <em>Blake </em>or explained what he would argue differently to show that his aggravated felony conviction for sexual abuse of a minor for which he is being deported has a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a) to render him eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Thus, because SanchezBecerra was statutorily ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver in 2003, just as he was in 2007, we deny Sanehez-Becerra\u2019s petition as to its challenge to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that it could not grant him a \u00a7 212(c) waiver <em>nunc pro tunc.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">C. Denial of Motion to Continue</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Sanchez-Becerra argues that the IJ abused its discretion in denying him a continuance of the May 7, 2007 removal hearing and effectively denied him his right to counsel. The decision to grant a continuance is \u201cwithin the IJ\u2019s broad discretion.\u201d <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2006). As outlined above, Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s removal hearing had already been continued five times, and the IJ scheduled the May 7, 2007 hearing in November 2006. Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s main challenge \u2014 that the IJ failed to explain why it denied the continuance and thereby abused its discretion \u2014 does not present a legal question that this Court has jurisdiction to review. <em>See Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that a \u201cgarden-variety abuse of discretion argument-which can be made by virtually <em>every </em>alien subject to a final removal order-does not amount to a legal question under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">To the extent Sanchez-Becerra argues that the denial of a continuance violated his due process rights to a fundamentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>fair hearing and to the presence of retained counsel, he presents a colorable constitutional claim that this Court has jurisdiction to review. However, in order to prevail on a due process claim, SanchezBecerra must show \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d <em>See Mullen-Cofee v. INS, </em>976 F.2d 1375, 1380 (11th Cir.1992). Because the relief he is seeking \u2014 a \u00a7 212(c) waiver \u2014 is discretionary, <em>A\u00f1as, </em>482 F.3d at 1283, his counsel already presented his arguments for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver in a memorandum to the IJ, and he has not cited any arguments or evidence that counsel would have presented at the May 7, 2007 hearing, Sanehez-Becerra has not shown he suffered \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d from the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance. Thus, we deny SanchezBecerra\u2019s petition as to the continuance claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-15\">.

Because Sanchez-Becerra pled guilty in 1993 (before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment in 1996), he was thus still eligible for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief under <em>St. Cyr.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">.

In 2007, the Second Circuit rejected the petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA's decision had changed the law regarding \u00a7 212(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>waivers and stated \"[t]he statutory counterpart rule does nothing more than crystallize the agency\u2019s preexisting body of law.\" <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88, 98-99 (2d Cir.2007). However, the Second Circuit ultimately disagreed with the BIA\u2019s approach of analyzing whether the \"aggravated felony\" ground of deportation had a statutory counterpart in the \u00a7 212(a) grounds of inadmissibility. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03. Instead, the Second Circuit adopted the approach of analyzing whether the particular criminal offense, which was the ground for the aggravated-felony deportation, had a statutory counterpart in the \u00a7 212(a) grounds of inadmissibility. <em>Id. </em>at 103-04. The Second Circuit remanded to the BIA to make that statutory counterpart analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Although the Second Circuit disagreed with the BIA's <em>Blake </em>decision, this does not affect the precedential effect of the BIA\u2019s decision elsewhere. <em>See Matter of Anselmo, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (\"We are not required to accept an adverse determination by one circuit court of appeals as binding throughout the United States.\u201d). Indeed, other circuits agree with the BIA\u2019s analysis in <em>Blake </em>and have analyzed whether the \"aggravated felony\u201d ground of deportation had a statutory counterpart in the \u00a7 212(a) grounds of inadmissibility. <em>See Zamora-Mallari, </em>514 F.3d at 691-93 (addressing aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor); <em>Vue v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 858, 860-61 (8th Cir.2007); <em>Vo, </em>482 F.3d at 368-72; <em>Caroleo, </em>476 F.3d at 167-68; <em>Kim v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 58, 62-63 (1st Cir.2006). In any event, Sanchez-Becerra does not challenge the BIA's analysis in Blake in 2005, and we consider here only whether Sanchez-Becerra was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver in 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b380-11\">. At the end of the day, we note that the Seventh Circuit, albeit in a cursory footnote, rejected a similar argument, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">The petitioners all maintain on appeal that if their case had been heard before Blake they would have qualified for \u00a7 212(c) relief. However, as just noted, <em>Blake </em>merely applied the comparable basis test to a new factual scenario. If one of these petitioners\u2019 cases had come before <em>Blake, </em>that case would be the <em>\u201cBlake </em>\u201d case that stood for the proposition that an alien convicted of sexual abuse of a minor does not qualify for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because there is no comparable ground of excludability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\"><em>Zamora-Mallari, </em>514 F.3d at 689-90 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-22\">. We deny the government\u2019s October 3, 2007 motion to dismiss Sanchez-Becerra\u2019s petition for review as moot. Sanchez-Becerra's motion to stay deportation was previously denied by this Court on October 3, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
