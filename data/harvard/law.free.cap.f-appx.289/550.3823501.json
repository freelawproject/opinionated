The District Court sentenced Reid to 12 months\u2019 incarceration for the violations. Reid appeals from the judgment of sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-26\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-27\">On March 8, 2005, Reid was sentenced by the District Court to 27 months\u2019 incarceration and two years\u2019 supervised release for possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base. Reid\u2019s term of supervised release com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>menced on March 24, 2006. In November 2006, Reid was charged with two separate counts of driving under the influence. On January 17, 2007, Reid was arrested for possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base. At a hearing on the Government\u2019s petition to revoke his supervised release, Reid admitted guilt to the above violations. The District Court determined that the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range for the supervised release violations was 12 to 18 months\u2019 incarceration. Following revocation of supervised release, the District Court sentenced Reid to the advisory Guidelines minimum of 12 months to be served consecutively to the 68-month sentence he was then serving for a separate federal drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">During the hearing, Reid\u2019s counsel urged the District Court to apply his 12-month sentence concurrently to his 63-month sentence. The District Court prompted Reid\u2019s counsel to explain the rationale for applying the sentence concurrently. Reid\u2019s counsel noted that Reid had participated in substance abuse programs at the detention center and in filming a cable television video that encouraged young individuals to avoid gang activity. Reid\u2019s counsel next testified to a positive change in Reid\u2019s demeanor and character. Reid\u2019s counsel also suggested that Reid may have intentionally violated the terms of his supervised release in order to seek the safety of custody, after having been the target of one or more violent attacks since his initial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The District Court then asked for the Government\u2019s response. The Government recommended a consecutive sentence, noting that Reid committed three violations within one year of commencing supervised release and that the District Court had sentenced Reid below the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range for his initial offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In explaining its decision, the District Court noted that it had given Reid a \u201cbreak\u201d on his original sentence. The District Court found that Reid had demonstrated an inability to adjust to supervised release, noting that he had gotten into trouble shortly after his release and in a \u201cmajor way\u201d with respect to his drug violation. Thereafter the District Court stated that it believed it \u201cappropriate\u201d to apply Reid\u2019s sentence consecutively, while acknowledging that Reid\u2019s counsel\u2019s comments were \u201cvery astute and very insightful.\u201d The District Court stated that \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any choice frankly but to sentence you consecutively.\u201d Elsewhere, the District Court explained that it applied Reid\u2019s sentence consecutively because he committed the same offense for which he was originally incarcerated, stating that \u201c[tjhat\u2019s why I\u2019m making it consecutive, that\u2019s the reason, and I think it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.\u201d The District Court concluded that, considering the Guidelines and \u201cthe factors contained in Title 18, U.S.C., Section 3553(a)[,] ... this [is] an appropriate and reasonable sentence.\u201d The District Court concluded by sentencing Reid to the advisory Guidelines minimum of 12 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review sentences imposed for violations of supervised release for reasonableness under the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Bungar, </em>478 F.3d 540, 542 (3d Cir.2007). Our review of sentences is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d and the challenging party bears the burden of proof in demonstrating unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Reid appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to apply his 12-month sentence for violating the general terms of his supervised release consecutively, rather than concurrently, to a sentence he is currently serving. In <em>United States v. Dees, </em>467 F.3d 847 (3d Cir.2006), we held that a district court had discretion to impose consecutive sentences upon revocation of concurrent terms of supervised release based upon the same violation conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 852. A fortiori, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), a district court has the discretion to impose a sentence for a violation, which is consecutive to an undischarged term of imprisonment for some entirely separate convicted offense. <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (advising imposition of sentence for supervised release violation to run consecutive to any sentence defendant is then serving).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Nonetheless, Reid challenges the reasonableness of his consecutive sentence on three grounds. First, he argues that the District Court considered impermissible factors in imposing its sentence. Specifically, he argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) prevents courts that are imposing sentences for supervised release violations from considering factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (pertaining to the punitive purposes of sentencing) and \u00a7 3553(a)(3) (pertaining to the \u201ckinds of sentences available\u201d). Reid notes that the District Court imposed a consecutive sentence after voicing its consideration of the \u201csentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d without the necessary qualification purportedly required by \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Without deciding whether \u00a7 3583(e)(3) forbids consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (3) as a matter of law, <em>see Bungar, </em>478 F.3d at 543 n. 2, we find no indication in the record that the District Court considered an impermissible factor in reaching its decision. While the District Court did not explicitly state which \u00a7 3553(a) factors it considered in contradistinction with which ones it did not, \u201c[t]here are no magic words that a district judge must invoke when sentencing, as long as the record shows that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Dragon, </em>471 F.3d 501, 505 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Reid, therefore, reads too much into the District Court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3553(a) as necessarily revealing that it considered any purportedly forbidden factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Reid next argues that the District Court improperly imposed a consecutive sentence under the mistaken belief that it was compelled to do so, citing a solitary comment that \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any choice frankly but to sentence you consecutively.\u201d The record clearly indicates, however, that the District Court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors in reaching its conclusion. <em>Bungar, </em>478 F.3d at 543. The District Court noted its leniency on Reid\u2019s initial sentence, Reid\u2019s breach of trust, and the number and frequency of violations, considerations that would have been superfluous had the District Court believed that it was compelled to impose a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Finally, Reid argues that the District Court improperly applied a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard in determining the appropriate sentence, on the theory that reasonableness can only be an appellate standard. This argument is unavailing. Never have we forbidden a district court from characterizing its own sentence as reasonable under some (incorrect) notion that appellate courts have a monopoly over using the word \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">For the forgoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
