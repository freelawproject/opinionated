Navarro had twice been convicted of DWI offenses, in violation of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 49.04 and 49.09(b) (West 2004), and he pleaded guilty to the instant DWI charge without having first reached a plea agreement. Texas\u2019 DWI law is assimilated into federal law in this case by the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, (\u201cACA\u201d), which makes state law applicable to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>duct occurring on lands acquired by the federal government when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The ACA \u201crequires federal courts to find the defendant guilty of a \u2018like offense\u2019 and to impose a \u2018like punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>274 F.3d 897, 904-OS (5th Cir.2001) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13). The \u201clike punishment\u201d requirement limits the range of punishment to the minimum and maximum sentences provided by state law. <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>915 F.2d 981, 984 (5th Cir.1990). The parties agree that Texas law provides for a statutory range of two to ten year\u2019s imprisonment for the DWI offense at issue here. Ordinarily, the federal sentencing guidelines would determine the actual sentence within that range, since \u201c[i]f there is no guideline for a particular offense, including an ACA offense, the court is to use \u2018the most analogous offense guideline.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 362 (5th Cir.2001) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1). However, it is undisputed that there is no sufficiently analogous offense guideline for the DWI charge at issue here, and \u00a7 2X5.1 provides that, in such cases, \u201cthe provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 shall control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Navarro argues that the district court violated \u00a7 3553 by failing to provide reasons for sentencing him to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Section 3553(c)(2) does require that the court \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,\u201d and \u00a7 3553(b)(1) provides that \u201c[i]n the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an appropriate' sentence, having due regard for the purposes set forth\u201d in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The government acknowledges that the district court failed to state its reasons for the sentence which it imposed in this case. However, Navarro did not object to the court\u2019s failure to do so, and we therefore apply a \u201cplain error\u201d standard of review on this issue. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We note that it is unclear whether Navarro\u2019s sentence should be reviewed under the \u201creasonableness\u201d standard set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 245, 259, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) or under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4). We have utilized the latter standard to review sentences entered after revocation of supervised release, for which there are no guidelines, only policy statements. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 428 (5th Cir. 2008). Although we have not addressed the issue, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard should likewise be applicable in ACA appeals where, as here, there are no sufficiently analogous offense guidelines. <em>See U.S. v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288 (4th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. McNair, </em>254 Fed.Appx. 246, 246 (4th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Floresdelgado, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 28, 29 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We need not resolve whether the \u201creasonableness\u201d or \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard applies in this case, since it is apparent that the district court did not commit \u201cplain error\u201d in sentencing Navarro under either standard. Plain error must be \u201cerror so obvious that our failure to notice it would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of [the] judicial proceedings and result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 n. 3 (5th Cir.2007)(quoting <em>United States v. Fortenberry, </em>914 F.2d 671, 673 (5th Cir.1990)). Applying this standard, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error based on the fact that 1) it sentenced Navarro within the middle of the statutory range; 2) the presentence report establishes that Navarro had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>extensive criminal history; 3) Navarro failed to object to his sentence as being unreasonable. In light of these factors, the district court\u2019s failure to consider the \u00a7 3553 factors can not be considered \u201cplain error,\u201d and we accordingly AFFIRM the court\u2019s sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b746-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
