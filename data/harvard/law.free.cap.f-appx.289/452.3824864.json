Horn denying Saleem\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), <em>In re Kashif Saleem, </em>No. A98 420 084 (B.I.A. Aug. 7, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 420 084 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sep. 27, 2005); (2) a September 27, 2007 order of the BIA denying his motion to reconsider, <em>In re Kashif Saleem, </em>No. A98 420 084 (B.I.A. Sep. 27, 2007); and (3) a February 29, 2008 order of the BIA denying his motion to reopen, <em>In re Kashif Saleem, </em>No. A98 420 084 (B.I.A. Feb. 29, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">As an initial matter, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to consolidate Dkt. No. 08-1379-ag with the related petitions in Dkt. Nos. 07-3740-ag (L) and 08-0460-ag (Con). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-18\">I. Dkt. No. 07-3740-ag (L)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-19\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>See Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). Because the agency never made an explicit credibility finding, in reviewing the agency\u2019s determination, we assume Saleem\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>credibility. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. DOJ, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that the mistreatment Saleem described did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Ivanishvili v. DOJ, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA found that such mistreatment \u201cwas tantamount to discrimination on account of [Saleem\u2019s] religion.\u201d Indeed, there is no evidence that Saleem was ever arrested or imprisoned on account of his Ahmadi religion. <em>See Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006). To be sure, the incidents Saleem described are disturbing, detailing a life marred by atrocious discrimination. Nonetheless, we are not compelled to disagree with the agency and find that such mistreatment constituted persecution. <em>Kambolli v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 454, 457 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201c[Persecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d)). Additionally, regarding any allegation of persecution prior to Saleem\u2019s 2003 visit to the United States, he conceded that the mistreatment he suffered was not so severe as to prompt him to apply for asylum at that time. Thus, the IJ properly questioned whether Saleem had a subjective fear of persecution at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">As to the May 2004 incident, where Saleem was robbed and threatened by a former patient, the IJ likely erred in concluding that this incident was criminal, implying that it bore no relation to a protected ground. Indeed, the record suggests there was, at the least, a mixed motive for the robbery. <em>See Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1028 (2d Cir.1994); <em>see also Matter of S-P-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 486, 492-95 (B.I.A.1996). Nonetheless, any error was harmless where the BIA, assuming that the incidents Saleem described were based on his religion, found that they did not rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Despite the agency\u2019s proper finding with respect to past persecution, we find that remand is required in light of the agency\u2019s failure to analyze Saleem\u2019s claim that he had an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 394 n. 3 (2d Cir.2005), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Shi Liang Lin v. DOJ, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir. 2007) (\u201c[W]e note that a showing of past persecution ... need not be a necessary condition for asylum eligibility to be established. An applicant who demonstrates a well-founded fear of future persecution is not required to show that he or she suffered past persecution as well.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">In particular, remand is warranted pursuant to our decision in <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007), where we found insufficient the agency\u2019s conclusion as to the petitioner\u2019s pattern or practice claim. Here, the BIA acknowledged that \u201cmembers of the Ahmadi faith suffer discrimination in Pakistan and are also often the victims of religious violence.\u201d That observation notwithstanding, the BIA concluded that \u201ca pattern or practice of perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>cution [does not] exist there against such individuals.\u201d The BIA provided no further analysis on this issue. In <em>Mufied, </em>508 F.3d at 91, we found that the BIA erred by failing to address the petitioner\u2019s claim that there exists a pattern or practice of persecution against Indonesian Christians, and by concentrating instead on the individualized risk of persecution. While we acknowledged the BIA\u2019s holding in <em>Matter ofA-M-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 737 (B.I.A.2005), we found that its decision \u201cdoes not provide us with sufficient guidance for how to evaluate a pattern or practice claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. Thus, applying the \u201cordinary remand rule,\u201d we returned the case to the agency to allow it to announce a standard regarding pattern or practice claims and apply that standard in Mufied\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 93 (\u201cthe better course is for us to remand this petition to the BIA rather than attempt to adjudicate Mufied\u2019s claim ourselves.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The same result is also appropriate here. The BIA has yet to address <em>Mufied </em>on remand or to provide further guidance in a precedential decision as to how to evaluate a pattern or practice claim. In this case, the BIA provided no such standard, merely concluding without analysis that Saleem failed to show a pattern or practice of persecution of Ahmadis in Pakistan. In light of evidence in the record suggesting a troubling degree of violence against Ahmadis, we are unable to engage in meaningful review of the agency\u2019s decision. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 77 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cWe require a certain minimal level of analysis from agency decisions denying asylum, and indeed must require such if judicial review is to be meaningful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We also conclude that neither the BIA\u2019s finding that Saleem could safely relocate in Pakistan nor the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum obviate the need for remand. With respect to the relocation finding, the BIA failed specifically to assess whether, \u201cunder all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant^]\u201d to relocate, and to consider, among other things, \u201cadministrative, economic, or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). As to the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum, the BIA has held that \u201call but the most egregious adverse factors\u201d will be outweighed by the danger of persecution. <em>Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, </em>436 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Matter of Chen, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 16, 19 (B.I.A.1989)). The IJ\u2019s discretionary denial in this case was apparently based on Saleem\u2019s failure to apply for asylum at an earlier date, either in this country or on a visit to Dubai. However, in reaching that finding, the IJ never had the opportunity to balance the totality of the circumstances, as is required before denying asylum as a matter of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Because Saleem did not argue that the agency erred in denying his CAT claim, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">II. Dkt. Nos. 08-1379-ag (Con); 08-0460-ag (Con)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Because we vacate the BIA\u2019s decision challenged in Dkt. No. 07-3740-ag (L), Saleem\u2019s motion to reconsider that decision is moot and the petition for review in Dkt. No. 08-0460-ag (Con) is dismissed as such. Similarly, because we remand for further proceedings, Saleem\u2019s motion to reopen his proceedings is also moot, and the petition for review in Dkt. No. 08-1379-ag is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the Government\u2019s motion to consolidate Dkt. No. 08-1379-ag with the related petitions in Dkt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Nos. 07-3740-ag (L) and 08-0460-ag (Con) is GRANTED. The petition for review in Dkt. No. 07-3740-ag (L) is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order. The petitions for review in Dkt. Nos. 08-0460-ag (Con) and 08-1379-ag (Con) are DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
