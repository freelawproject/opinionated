For the reasons stated below, we DENY her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">In December 1992, at the age of 17, Vushaj left Albania and came to the United States with her then-husband. Vushaj entered the United States on a false passport (which her husband had procured for her without her knowledge) and was immediately placed in exclusion proceedings. She conceded her inadmissibility, but filed an application for asylum and/or withholding of removal based on political persecution. Vushaj claimed past persecution and a fear of future persecution based on her and her family\u2019s political activities in support of the Democratic Party of Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">After a hearing on July 27, 1994, an Immigration Judge denied her application. On August 31, 2001, the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d) reversed and remanded for a new hearing due to translation problems. In 2002, Vushaj supplemented her application and added a claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">Vushaj\u2019s second hearing, via video conference and before a different Immigration Judge, occurred on February 25, 2005. By that time, Vushaj had divorced her first husband, remarried, given birth to a son (in 2000), who is a United States citizen, and separated from her second husband. Before the hearing, the parties \u201cstipulated and agreed on the record that the facts stated by [Vushaj] in her asylum applications [were] true and correct\u201d and that, based on those facts, Vushaj had suffered \u201cpast persecution\u201d based on her political beliefs. JA 30. As a result, Vushaj was entitled to a regulatory presumption that she had a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d in the future. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The government sought to rebut the presumption by showing \u201ca fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in [her] country of nationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">In the years between 1992 and 2005, the political situation in Albania evolved. In 1992 the Democratic Party won national elections. After an economic collapse in 1997 and a period of anarchy, the Socialist Party came to power. Post-Communism, the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party have been the two primary parties. At the hearing in 2005, Vushaj proffered her own testimony, as well as testimony from her father, Pashko Kroni, her uncle, Alfons Grishaj, and an expert witness, Bernd Fischer, Ph.D. Each testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>conditions in Albania, albeit improved since Vushaj\u2019s departure in 1992, were still such that given her and her family\u2019s past and current support of the Democratic Party, her fear of future persecution was well-founded. The government offered no witnesses of it own, but relied on its cross-examination of Vushaj\u2019s witnesses and a few documents to rebut the presumption. The documents submitted by the government included: (1) the United States Department of State\u2019s 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Albania (the \u201c2003 Country Report\u201d); (2) the United States Department of State\u2019s 2001 and 2004 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania (the \u201c2001 and 2004 Profiles\u201d); and (3) an unaddressed, unsigned, and undated letter from Vushaj, stating that she had a six-month old son (a copy of his birth certificate was attached to the letter) and asking for help with her papers so that she could \u201cvisit and go back to my country Albania and show my son where he is from.\u201d JA 110. Although the letter was undated, her son had been born on December 29, 2000, indicating that the letter was written in the summer of 2001. The government represented that it discovered the letter in an Alien Relative Status Petition file at the Department of Homeland Security. Vushaj challenged the admissibility of the letter, but the Immigration Judge admitted it, ruling that \u201cit was apparent ... that the letter was the handiwork of [Vushaj] and sent to the [Department of Homeland Security] in an effort to expedite the processing of the relative petition so she could return to Albania with her son.\u201d JA 36. He rejected Vushaj\u2019s suggestion that her second husband might have authored the letter as \u201cunconvincing and not credible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On February 28, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied all relief. He found that the government had \u201cpresented sufficient evidence to rebut the Applicant\u2019s regulatory presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution based upon changed circumstances.\u201d JA 36. Vushaj\u2019s statement in the 2001 letter that she wanted to take her infant son to Albania to visit family, the Immigration Judge opined, \u201cper se would rebut the Applicant\u2019s regulatory presumption of a well-founded fear\u201d because it \u201cclearly indicates that the Applicant never had a fear in returning to Albania after the birth of her U.S. citizen son while the [Socialist Party] was in control and after her parents and other relatives left Albania and were granted asylum in the US.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, he found that the 2003 Country Report and the 2001 and 2004 Profiles established that any danger to Vushaj in returning to Albania would be the result of the fact that \u201clawlessness and the proliferation of illegal guns are prevalent, thereby fostering high crime and violence,\u201d not \u201cmere membership in the [Democratic Party]\u201d which was \u201coperating openly, visibly and legally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having found that Vushaj was unable to establish a claim for asylum, he also found that she \u201cfailed to meet the higher burden of proof for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Immigration Judge denied relief under the Convention against Torture, finding that Vushaj \u201cfailed to demonstrate credible evidence of any past torture, or that it is more likely than not that [she] will suffer torture upon her return.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Vushaj appealed the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. On June 6, 2006, the Board affirmed in a brief order. Its only substantive comment was that it found \u201cno error in the determination that, although the applicant may have established prior persecution in Albania, significant changes have occurred in that country that have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>rebutted the presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d JA5.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Vushaj filed the pending petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Where, as here, the Board adopts the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision with additional commentary, we review the decision of the Immigration Judge, as supplemented by the Board, as the final administrative order. <em>See Ceraj v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 583, 588 (6th Cir.2007); <em>Gilaj v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 275, 283 (6th Cir.2005). We review questions of law, including questions of due process violations, de novo. <em>See Mapouya v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 396, 405 (6th Cir.2007); <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 407, 409 (6th Cir.2004). We will affirm the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings, including the determination that the petitioner failed to establish eligibility for asylum due to a fundamental change in circumstances, if substantial evidence supports such determinations. <em>See Ceraj, </em>511 F.3d at 588. Under this standard, we will reverse a factual determination of the Immigration Judge only if \u201cthe evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">B. Vushaj\u2019s Claim for Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she is a \u201crefugee\u201d who is eligible for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cA well-founded fear of persecution does not require the applicant to show that he probably will be persecuted if he is deported; \u2018one can certainly have a well-founded fear of an event happening when there is less than a 50% chance of the occurrence taking place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkovic v. INS, </em>33 F.3d 615, 621 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The government may rebut this presumption by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that there is \u201ca fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). As noted above, the sole issue before the Immigration Judge and the Board with respect to Vushaj\u2019s claim for asylum was whether the government rebutted the presumption that Vushaj had a \u201cwell-founded fear of [future] persecution.\u201d The Immigration Judge and the Board concluded that it did. Vushaj challenges this finding on due process grounds and as not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">1. Due Process Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Vushaj\u2019s first due process argument is that both the Immigration Judge and the Board applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating her asylum claim. Specifically, she contends that each failed to decide whether there had been a \u2018 <em>fundamental change </em>in circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) (emphasis added), so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>as to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Rather, she argues, each applied a less stringent test. In the Immigration Judge\u2019s opinion, she points to the following sentence as evidence that the wrong legal standard was applied: \u201cThe [Department of Homeland Security] argues, however, that there has been a <em>substantial </em>change in country conditions and circumstances that adequately rebuts the regulatory presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution----\u201d JA 35 (emphasis added). And in the Board\u2019s decision, she points to its statement that: <em>\u201csignificant </em>changes have occurred in that country that have rebutted the presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d JA 5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Vushaj\u2019s argument is not persuasive. First, the Immigration Judge uses the term \u201csubstantial\u201d merely to describe the government\u2019s position, not to set forth the applicable legal standard. Moreover, although significant and substantial are not synonyms for fundamental, fundamental changes can certainly also be significant or substantial. Finally, there is nothing in either the Immigration Judge\u2019s opinion or the Board\u2019s order to suggest that the failure to use the word \u201cfundamental\u201d was based on a misunderstanding of the standard that applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Vushaj\u2019s second due process argument is that the Board did not give the Immigration Judge\u2019s order the meaningful review which due process requires. She argues that the Board\u2019s two-paragraph decision, consisting of only a brief procedural history, a statement that it affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision with a citation to its own decision in <em>In re Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994), and one substantive statement agreeing with the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that the changes in Albania rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, was inadequate to satisfy due process. This argument is foreclosed by controlling precedent. <em>See Gishta v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 972, 980 (6th Cir.2005). In <em>Gishta, </em>as in the present case, the Board did not invoke its authority to affirm without opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), but rather exercised its authority to \u201cissue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the decision under review,\u201d <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5). The Board\u2019s decision in <em>Gishta, </em>like its decision in the present case, included a citation to <em>In re Burbano </em>and a brief statement addressing only one aspect of the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision. In considering whether the Board thereby violated the petitioners\u2019 due process rights, the Sixth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQtI\">The board\u2019s independent review of the case is demonstrated by its citation of <em>In re Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), which states that a brief decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision does not mean that the board did not exercise its independent review authority over the case, but rather the board adopts or affirms the immigration judge\u2019s decision when it is \u201cin agreement with the reasoning and result of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874. [Moreover,] the board\u2019s specific finding that the Gishtas\u2019 inadequate interpretation argument failed for lack of prejudice and provided no basis for reversing the immigration judge\u2019s decision also demonstrates that the board independently reviewed the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-9\"><em>Gishta, </em>404 F.3d at 980. Accordingly, Vushaj\u2019s second due process argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">2. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Vushaj also argues that the decision to deny her asylum \u2014 based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>finding that there had been a \u201cfundamental change in circumstances such that [she] no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution,\u201d 8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) \u2014 was not based on substantial evidence. She faults the Immigration Judge for relying too heavily on the 2003 Country Report and the 2001 and 2004 Profiles, for admitting the 2001 letter into evidence, and for not fully crediting the hearing testimony, particularly the testimony of the expert witness. However, given the record before us, we cannot say that it compels a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Vushaj\u2019s claim of political persecution is based on her and her family\u2019s affiliation with and activities on behalf of the Democratic Party of Albania. However, the situation in Albania today, as evidenced by the 2003 Country Report, the 2001 and 2004 Profiles, and, even to some extent, the testimony at the hearing, is much different (and greatly improved) from when Vushaj left in 1992. Although violence and organized crime remain problems, affiliation with the Democratic Party no longer leads to persecution. Notably, in 2002, \u201cthe Democratic Party resumed its participation in the Parliament,\u201d and \u201cthe municipal elections in October 2003 were considered the most transparent in Albania\u2019s short democratic history, with no police interference.\u201d <em>Shkulaku-Purballori v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 499, 503 (6th Cir.2007) (citing 2004 Profile). Although this court has acknowledged that reports issued by the United States Department of State \u201cmay be problematic sources on which to rely,\u201d <em>Mullai v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 635, 639 (6th Cir.2004), such reports are nonetheless \u201cgenerally the best source of information on conditions in foreign nations,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Based on these reports, and the lack of any truly contradictory testimony, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that there has been a \u201cfundamental change in circumstances\u201d such that Vushaj does not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on affiliation with the Democratic Party. <em>See also Ramaj v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 520, 531 (6th Cir.2006); <em>Macotaj v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 464, 465 (6th Cir.2005); <em>Liti v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 631, 640 (6th Cir.2005). Inasmuch as the denial of asylum is supported by substantial evidence without considering the 2001 letter, any error on the admissibility of the letter is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">C. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Vushaj also challenges the denial of her request for withholding of removal under the INA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to be eligible for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must \u201cestablish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). As with a claim for asylum, past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption \u201cthat the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim,\u201d but the \u201cpresumption may be rebutted if an asylum officer or immigration judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>account of any of the five grounds mentioned in this paragraph upon the applicant\u2019s removal to that country.\u201d <em>Id, </em>\u00a7 208.16(b)(1)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Pilica v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 941, 951 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Accordingly, our decision that substantial evidence supports the denial of Vushaj\u2019s asylum claim renders her \u201cautomatically incapable of qualifying for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 667, 677 (6th Cir.2008); <em>see also Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 401 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we DENY Vushaj\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-5\">. Vushaj does not challenge the denial of her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
