We review this decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">We have reviewed petitioner\u2019s response to this court\u2019s June 2, 2008 order, and we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Petitioner\u2019s motion was number-barred, and the petitioner has not provided evidence to support an exception to the numerical limit on motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Accordingly, this petition for review is summarily denied because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">All pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1008-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
