For the brandishing of a firearm conviction, Holman was sentenced in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1) to a mandatory life sentence. Holman argues that \u00a7 3559(c)(1) is unconstitutional because it violates the Eighth Amendment, the separation of powers doctrine, and the Due Process Clause. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance and alternatively requested an extension of time in which to file a brief. The Government contends that Holman\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Martin, </em>431 F.3d 846 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a sentence enhancement provision de novo. <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>402 F.3d 482, 485 (5th Cir.2005). The Government is correct that Holman\u2019s Eight Amendment argument is foreclosed by <em>Martin. </em>In <em>Martin, </em>431 F.3d at 853, the court determined that \u00a7 3559(c) does not violate the Eighth Amendment and is constitutional. In making its decision in <em>Martin, </em>the court relied on <em>United States v. Rasco, </em>123 F.3d 222 (5th Cir.1997). In <em>Rasco, </em>123 F.3d at 226-27, the court determined that \u00a7 3559(c) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Thus, Holman\u2019s separation of powers argument is also foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>However, neither <em>Martin </em>nor <em>Rasco </em>addressed Holman\u2019s particular due process arguments. Nevertheless, Holman\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Holman argues that \u00a7 3559(c)(1) violates the Due Process Clause because it restricts a sentencing judge\u2019s discretion and prevents the judge from tailoring an individualized sentence based upon a defendant\u2019s particular circumstances. Holman also argues that the statute\u2019s mandatory life sentence violates the Due Process Clause because it effectively denies a defendant the right to be present at sentencing and the right to offer mitigation evidence by way of allocution. These due process arguments raised by Holman are not the same arguments he raised before the district court. Thus, they are reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679, 681 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, Holman must show that (1) there was a legal error, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The Constitution does not guarantee individualized sentencing nor provide for the presentation of mitigation evidence in non-capital cases. <em>See Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991). Thus, there is no constitutional impediment to the district court imposing a mandatory sentence without considering Holman\u2019s particular circumstances. <em>See, e.g., United States v. White, </em>869 F.2d 822, 825 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, Holman has failed to show any error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Jones, </em>489 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
