Capps also appeals Judge Voss\u2019s denial of her pre- and post-verdict motions for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, both of which posited that Capps, who served as county assessor when she terminated Madrid, was acting within the course and scope of her employment as a matter of Arizona law when the termination occurred. Madrid cross-appeals Judge Broomfield\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Apache County on Madrid\u2019s claim of retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). We have jurisdiction to consider these appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Capps\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Under Arizona\u2019s notice of claims statute, any person who wants to bring suit against a public entity or employee must first serve a notice on the entity or employee stating \u201cfacts sufficient to permit the public entity or public employee to understand the basis upon which liability is claimed.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 12-821.0KA). If a notice of claim is not filed within 180 days of the accrual of a cause of action, the claim is barred and no legal action may be taken on it. <em>Id. </em>While Madrid served a notice of claim on Apache County, she did not serve one upon Capps.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">This omission is not fatal to Madrid\u2019s claim against Capps, however, if Capps was not acting in the course and scope of her employment when she terminated Madrid. The Arizona Court of Appeals has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>held that notices of claims need only be filed against public employees who were acting in the course and scope of their employment when the challenged conduct occurred. <em>See Crum v. Superior Court, </em>186 Ariz. 351, 922 P.2d 316, 317-18 (Ariz. Ct.App.1996). Madrid has contended that Capps was not acting in the course and scope of her employment when she terminated Madrid because she did so for purely private reasons based on a long-standing personal dislike. Capps responds that firing someone, by its nature, can only be done in the course and scope of employment because an individual acting in a private capacity does not have authority to fire another.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The court in <em>Crum </em>made clear what the consequences would be for a plaintiff, like Madrid, who asserts that a public employee was not acting in his official capacity and who consequently declines to follow the notice of claims statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">the issue of whether the defendant was acting within the course and scope of his employment remains to be decided by the trier of fact, and a plaintiff who fails to file a notice of claim does so at his own risk.... [I]f the plaintiff does not file a notice, and the finder of fact concludes that the defendant was acting within the course and scope of his employment, the plaintiff cannot have judgment against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 318. Here, whether Capps was acting in the course and scope of her employment when she terminated Madrid was submitted to the jury as a question of fact, and in ruling in Madrid\u2019s favor, the jury necessarily answered that question in the negative.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Arizona courts maintain that \u201c[w]hether an employee\u2019s tort is within the scope of employment is generally a question of fact,\u201d it may be a question of law when \u201cthe undisputed facts make clear that the conduct was [within] the scope of employment.\u201d <em>See Smith v. American Express, </em>179 Ariz. 131, 876 P.2d 1166, 1173 (Ariz.Ct.App.1994). Although hesitant to reverse a judgment resting on a jury verdict and jury fact determination, we conclude that this is such a case where undisputed facts make clear that Madrid\u2019s termination occurred in the scope of Capps\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The Arizona Supreme Court has established a three-part test for determining whether an act was committed in the course and scope of employment: \u201cAn employee\u2019s conduct is within the scope of employment if and only if: a) it is the kind he is employed to perform; b) it occurs substantially within authorized time and space limits; and c) it is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Schallock, </em>189 Ariz. 250, 941 P.2d 1275, 1281 (1997). The parties do not dispute that terminating Madrid\u2019s employment in the county assessor\u2019s office is the type of act that Capps, as county assessor, was employed to perform, or that the firing took place within authorized time and space limits. The only question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>then is whether there was any \u201clegally sufficient basis\u201d for the jury to conclude, as it did, that Capps\u2019s action in firing Madrid was not motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the county. <em>See Bell v. Clackamas County, </em>341 F.3d 858, 865 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cWe can overturn the jury\u2019s verdict [based on a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50] only if there is no legally sufficient basis for the jury to find\u201d as it did).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In <em>Schallock, </em>which involved a supervisor accused of sexual harassment, the Arizona Supreme Court found that the matter of motivation cut both ways and ultimately \u201ccreate[d] a jury question\u201d on course and scope of employment: \u201cIn fondling the file clerks and offering advancement for sex, [the supervisor] was both serving the [employer] by running the office \u2014 a task he was explicitly authorized to do \u2014 and serving his personal desires. That his motives were mixed is of consequence, but the mixed motives cut both ways.\u201d 941 P.2d at 1283, 1284. More recently, the Arizona Court of Appeals reaffirmed the <em>Schallock </em>analysis in a ease with very similar facts to this one. In <em>Dube v. Desai, </em>a doctoral student sued his former dissertation advis- or for tortious interference with business opportunities for writing letters and emails to other university personnel critical of the student\u2019s work. 218 Ariz. 362, 186 P.3d 587, 587-90 (Ariz.Ct.App.2008). The student, Dube, asserted that the advisor, Desai, was motivated by a personal desire to undermine Dube\u2019s research, which had been critical of a proprietary formula owned by Desai. <em>See id. </em>The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Desai, holding that Dube\u2019s suit could not go forward because he had not served a notice of claim on Desai and Desai had been acting within the course and scope of his employment when the critical letters and e-mails were sent. <em>Id. </em>at 589-92. Addressing Dube\u2019s contention that Desai\u2019s actions had been motivated by a personal desire to protect his formula and not by a desire to serve the university, the court invoked <em>Schallock:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">The sexual harassment analysis in <em>Schallock </em>is conceptually analogous to the issue in the present case. In <em>Schallock, </em>our supreme court observed that, when a supervisor harasses employees while performing his authorized duties, the harassment can be incidental to his work and thus within the scope of his employment. 941 P.2d at 1283. Even though a supervisor may harass from some personal desire, he commits the harassment in the course and scope of performing his duties, so long as he is authorized to perform those duties. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Desai may have had a desire to protect C. Desai, Inc. and may have used his position at the University to advance a personal agenda. But even if this is true, all the actions of which Dube complains were incidental to Desai\u2019s work for the University.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">186 P.3d at 591-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Finally, the court in <em>Desai </em>distinguished <em>Schallock, </em>which had held that the question of course and scope should be presented to a jury, concluding that \u201chere, Dube has faded to produce any evidence showing that Desai\u2019s acts were not at least incidental to his job [and has therefore] failed to raise any issue of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Madrid has not produced any evidence that Capps\u2019s actions in terminating her employment, regardless of the reasons for those actions, were not at least incidental to Capps\u2019s job as county assessor; to the contrary, such staffing functions would necessarily be a central component of Capps\u2019s management position. We therefore conclude that <em>Schallock, </em>as clarified by <em>Dube, </em>is dispositive and that, as a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ter of Arizona law, Capps was acting within the course and scope of her employment when she fired Madrid from her position in the county assessor\u2019s office. We reverse the denial of Capps\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and hold that because Madrid did not serve a notice of claim on Capps within the period authorized by Arizona Revised Statutes (\u201cA.R.S.\u201d) \u00a7 12-821.01, Madrid \u201ccannot have judgment against\u201d Capps. <em>See Crum, </em>922 P.2d at 318.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On remand, we direct the district court to enter judgment for Capps on Madrid\u2019s intentional interference with contract claim under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Madrid\u2019s Cross \u2014 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"A_x\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Apache County de novo, we bear in mind our prior admonition that \u201c[i]n evaluating motions for summary judgment in the context of employment discrimination, we have emphasized the importance of zealously guarding an employee\u2019s right to a full trial, since discrimination claims are frequently difficult to prove without a full airing of the evidence and an opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., </em>360 F.3d 1103, 1112 (9th Cir.2004). Viewing the record in this light, we conclude, as did the district court, that Madrid has established a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). By filing complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) in 1997 and 2001, Madrid engaged in the \u201cquintessential action protected by\u201d Title VII, <em>McGinest, </em>360 F.3d at 1125 n. 19, and when the Apache County Board of Supervisors (\u201cthe board\u201d) declined to approve the county attorney\u2019s plan to hire Madrid as a legal secretary,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> she suffered an \u201cadverse employment decision\u201d within the meaning of Title VII, <em>see Ruggles v. Cal. Polytechnic State Univ., </em>797 F.2d 782, 786 (9th Cir. 1986). Moreover, the fact that county manager Delwin Wengert had a retaliatory motive in that he was concerned that Madrid\u2019s past EEO activities might expose the county to \u201cliability,\u201d and that he communicated these concerns to at least two of the board members who made the decision not to rehire Madrid, raise sufficient inferences of impropriety to satisfy the required causal nexus for purposes of Madrid\u2019s prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">We further conclude that the county met its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision\u2014 namely, long-standing county Human Resources Policy A-5.4 discouraging the rehire of employees previously terminated for cause absent \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d and a \u201cclear justification\u201d for the rehire, as well as outside attorney Katherine Baker\u2019s interpretation of that policy in two letters reviewed by the board. Given that the county has met its production burden, the only remaining question is whether Madrid has presented a genuine issue of material fact to support \u201c[her] ultimate burden of demonstrating that the [county\u2019s proffered] reason was merely a pretext for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>Stegall v. Citadel Broad. Co., </em>350 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Manatt v. Bank of Am., </em>339 F.3d 792, 800 (9th Cir.2003)). Stated another way, we must decide if there was a genuine issue of material fact on pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Madrid presented testimony from Del-win Wengert\u2019s deposition that Wengert harbored a retaliatory motive, which she argues constitutes direct evidence of discriminatory animus. <em>See Stegall, </em>350 F.3d at 1066 (\u201cDirect evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). When a plaintiff offers direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, \u201ca triable issue as to the actual motivation of the employer is created even if the evidence is not substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Wengert did not himself make the decision not to rehire Madrid, we have previously held that \u201c[e]ven if a manager was not the ultimate decisionmaker, that manager\u2019s retaliatory motive may be imputed to the company if the manager was involved in the hiring decision.\u201d <em>Bergene v. Salt River Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist., </em>272 F.3d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Dey v. Colt Constr. &amp; Dev. Co., </em>28 F.3d 1446, 1459-60 (7th Cir.1994)); <em>see also Vasquez v. County of L.A., </em>349 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir.2003) (explaining that where a supervisor who had displayed discriminatory animus in the past was not the decisionmaker, the plaintiff would have to show \u201ca nexus between [that supervisor\u2019s] discriminatory [animus] and [the] subsequent employment decisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On our review, we come to the conclusion that Wengert was \u201cinvolved in the ... decision\u201d not to rehire Madrid in several respects. First, he discussed the proposal to rehire Madrid and his concerns about that proposal with at least two of the three board members, even though all board members insisted that these discussions did not influence their decision-making process. Second, he did not follow the board\u2019s directive at the January 7, 2003 meeting to submit the county attorney\u2019s letter outlining the special circumstances that justified rehiring Madrid to outside counsel, who would then \u201cdo the required background investigation and come back to us with a recommendation.... \u201d Instead, before receiving the letter of special circumstances from the county attorney, Wengert instructed human resources manager Karen Houston to contact Katherine Baker and ask her for \u201can interpretation\u201d of Policy A-5.4 as it pertained to the potential rehiring of Madrid. Specifically, rather than asking that a background check be conducted, as the board had directed, Wengert apparently asked Baker, according to her understanding of the assignment, to \u201cadvise the county on the issues surrounding [Madrid\u2019s] potential rehiring, including ... whether the county must undertake the burden and expense of a background check every time a former employee, who has been terminated for cause, seeks re-employment.\u201d Third, Wengert acknowledged that in his discussions with Baker, he made her aware of his \u201cconcerns\u201d about hiring Madrid. A reasonable jury could conclude from these facts that the way Wengert presented the issues to Baker influenced the conclusions she reached, on which the board in turn relied, and that this level of involvement, combined with Wengert\u2019s direct discussions with board members about rehiring Madrid, was sufficient to allow imputation of Wengert\u2019s retaliatory motive to the board. <em>See Bergene, </em>272 F.3d at 1141; <em>Vasquez, </em>349 F.3d at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We conclude that this evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it are sufficient to create a fact issue as to whether the county\u2019s proffered reason for refusing to hire Madrid was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>pretext for retaliation. We thus reverse the grant of summary judgment to Apache County and remand Madrid\u2019s retaliation claim to the district court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT as to 06-16766; REVERSED AND REMANDED as to 06-16920.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Capps provided the language for the jury instruction on this point, which established course and scope of employment as a threshold issue in the case. The instruction read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">As a threshold matter, Cora Madrid must prove that Melody Capps was not acting in the course and scope of her employment as assessor for Apache County when Cora Madrid\u2019s employment was terminated. Melody Capps was acting within the course and scope of her employment as county assessor for Apache County if: (1) her actions were the kind she is authorized to perform; and (2) her actions were motivated at least in part by a purpose to serve the county. If you find that Melody Capps was acting within the course and scope of her employment when Cora Madrid\u2019s employment was terminated, you need go no further and you must find for Defendant Melody Capps and against Plaintiff Cora Madrid.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\">. Because we conclude that judgment against Capps was improper under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-821.01, we need not reach Capps\u2019s alternative argument that she cannot be held liable for intentional interference with contract when she was acting as an agent of one of the parties to that contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\">. Although Madrid raised seven distinct claims of retaliation in her amended complaint filed on May 20, 2003, we agree with Judge Broomfield that all but one of these claims were not actionable. Madrid also did not mention the dismissal of any of her other retaliation claims in her briefs on appeal, and so we consider those issues waived and confine our analysis to the alleged retaliation based on the board\u2019s refusal to rehire Madrid as a legal secretary in 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-19\">. We reject the argument that the county was entitled to summary judgment on the separate basis that Madrid was not qualified for the legal secretary position. Under our decision in <em>Ruggles, </em>the employer has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the same adverse employment action would have been taken \"even in the absence of discriminatory or retaliatory intent,\" for example, by showing that the decision would also have been justified by the applicant\u2019s lack of qualification. 797 F.2d at 786. No such evidence was presented here, as none of the board members were asked in their depositions about Madrid\u2019s qualifications or lack thereof. Thus summary judgment on this alternative ground is not warranted on the current record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
