We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review de novo. <em>Smith v. Pac. Props. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>358 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.2004). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>Dittman v. California, </em>191 F.3d 1020, 1027 n. 3 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-25\">The BAP properly concluded that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to reconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>er because an automatic stay does not necessarily reinstate retroactively upon the vacation of a dismissal. <em>See Sewell v. MGF Funding, Inc. (In re Sewell), </em>345 B.R. 174, 180 (9th Cir. BAP 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Mixon\u2019s contentions that he was denied due process lack merit. The record supports the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Mixon and his attorney were properly served with the trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Moreover, as a contested matter, the dismissal was not subject to the 10-day stay prescribed by Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and incorporated by Rule 7062 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bank. P. 9014; <em>see also Ewell v. Diebert (In re Ewell), </em>958 F.2d 276, 279 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Before the BAP Mixon failed to challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s abstention from addressing the validity of the foreclosure sale or the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Twin Assets was not required to seek relief from the automatic stay, and therefore waived these arguments. <em>See Burnett v. Resurgent Capital Servs. (In re Burnett), </em>435 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2006) (stating that, absent exceptional circumstances, issues not raised before the BAP are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Mixon\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b190-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
