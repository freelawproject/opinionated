De Anguiano argues that the BIA erred when it found her removable both as an aggravated felon and as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. De Anguiano challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of her request to terminate her removal proceedings pursuant to <em>In re Manrique, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 58 (BIA 1995). She contends that the BIA\u2019s denial of that request violated her rights under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. Finally, De Anguiano contends that the BIA\u2019s opinion should be vacated and her case remanded so that she may seek cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We have no jurisdiction to review removal orders based on an alien\u2019s commission of an aggravated felony or to review challenges to discretionary denials of relief under \u00a7 1229b. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I), (a)(2)(C). However, we retain jurisdiction to consider in a petition for review constitutional claims and questions of law such as whether an alien\u2019s prior offense qualifies as an aggravated felony. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Patel v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 800, 802 (5th Cir.2008). We also retain jurisdiction to consider an alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for discretionary relief. <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The BIA erred when it found De Anguiano removable as an aggravated felon as that term is defined for immigration purposes in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). De Anguiano\u2019s state possession offense did not involve illicit trafficking in a controlled substance and cannot be considered a drug trafficking crime under \u00a7 924(c)(2) because the conduct is not punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a); <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 629-33, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006); <em>Arce-Vences v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 167, 170-71 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">We lack jurisdiction to consider De Anguiano\u2019s claims that the BIA erred in finding that she was removable as an alien convicted of a drug trafficking offense. De Anguiano failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by raising those claims before the BIA. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d </em>132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">De Anguiano has not shown that the BIA erred in determining that her removal proceedings could not be terminated pursuant to <em>In re Manrique </em>because the policy exception to removal in that case had been superceded by the enactment of \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A). <em>See Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir.2004). Nor has De Anguiano shown that the BIA\u2019s decision to deny her that relief violated her rights under the Constitution. <em>Salazar-Regino v. Trominski, </em>415 F.3d 436, 452 (5th Cir.2005), <em>vacated on other grounds, Salazar-Regino v. Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 827, 166 L.Ed.2d 660 (2006); <em>Madriz-Alvarado, </em>383 F.3d at 332; <em>Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1001-02 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Anetekhai v. INS, </em>876 F.2d 1218, 1222 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">Finally, De Anguiano has not shown that she would have been statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal if she had not been erroneously classified as an aggravated felon. De Anguiano does not meet the eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal because she did not reside in the United States continuously for seven years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>after having been admitted in any status. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). Remand is not necessary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b41-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\">. De Anguiano's argument that the BIA's order of removal violates international law and treaty obligations between the United States and Mexico is deemed waived as inadequately briefed. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
