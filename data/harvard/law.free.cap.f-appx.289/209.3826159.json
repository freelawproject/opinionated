The Jacqueline, </em>742 F.2d 555, 559 (9th Cir.1984); <em>see also Vaughan v. Atkinson, </em>369 U.S. 527, 530-31, 82 S.Ct. 997, 8 L.Ed.2d 88 (1962) (allowing attorneys fees against shipowner who willfully and persistently failed to investigate claim for maintenance and cure by a seaman). In the weeks immediately after the assault, as he was still receiving unearned wages from Icicle, Ward expressly indicated that his symptoms had subsided and that he did not need or wish to receive medical attention. When, nearly six months later, Ward\u2019s symptoms worsened and he sought payment of maintenance and cure, Icicle requested evidence from Ward\u2019s counsel substantiating Ward\u2019s description of the assault to his treating physician. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Icicle\u2019s failure to pay maintenance and cure immediately was not \u201carbitrary, reca\u00edcitrant or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Kopczynski </em>742 F.2d at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"AHh\">We decline Ward\u2019s invitation to create a <em>per se </em>rule whereby seamen who are forced to file suit in federal court to obtain payment of maintenance and cure are automatically entitled to recover attorneys fees. Such a holding would be irreconcilable with <em>Kopczynski </em>742 F.2d at 559, and Ward has pointed to no intervening higher authority \u201cundercutting] the theory or reasoning underlying\u201d that decision. <em>Miller v. Gammie, </em>335 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"AEU\">We similarly are not at liberty to revisit our decision in <em>Glynn v. Roy Al Boat Management Corp., </em>57 F.3d 1495 (9th Cir.1995). In that case, we held that \u201cpunitive damages are not available ... where the shipowner has been willful and persistent in its failure to investigate a seaman\u2019s claim for maintenance and cure or to pay maintenance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1505. As a three-judge panel, we are bound by <em>Glynn. See Miller, </em>335 F.3d at 900. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"Aer\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Acm\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
