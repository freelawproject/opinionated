O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Jimmy Lee Sharbutt, a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro </em>se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. Sharbutt contends his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to a sentencing enhancement imposed under the penalty provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Specifically he claims one of the predicate crimes, a second-degree burglary, was included in violation of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 18, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). We granted a limited Certificate of Appealability (COA) and ordered the government to file a responsive brief addressing the following issues: (1) whether, consistent with <em>Shepard, </em>the government presented sufficient evidence of at least three predicate offenses; and if not, (2) whether Sharbutt suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel. Having reviewed the government\u2019s response and Sharbutt\u2019s reply, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b307-18\">Sharbutt was charged in a two-count superseding indictment with possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (Count I); and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C) (Count II). After the court granted Sharbutt\u2019s motion to sever the counts for purposes of trial, a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>found him guilty of Count I. The court subsequently granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">At sentencing, the district court applied the ACCA, which \u201cmandates a minimum 15-year prison sentence for anyone possessing a firearm after three prior convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 15, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Sharbutt was deemed an Armed Career Criminal based upon the presentence report\u2019s identification of three prior convictions committed on different occasions: a conviction in Oklahoma County on June 20, 1980, at the age of 19 for Second Degree Burglary and two later convictions for Robbery with Firearms. Sharbutt was sentenced to 262 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Sharbutt appealed, arguing the district court erred by denying several evidentiary motions. On January 5, 2005, we affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Sharbutt, </em>120 Fed.Appx. 244 (10th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1097, 126 S.Ct. 1020, 168 L.Ed.2d 866 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Sharbutt filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. <em>See United States v. Sharbutt, </em>Nos. 02-CR-78-JHP, 06-CV-600-JHP-FHM, 2007 WL 1894274 (NJD.Okla. July 2, 2007). It also denied his subsequent request for a COA. Sharbutt renewed his request here, raising only the claim he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to challenge the ACCA sentencing enhancement based on his conviction for second degree burglary. We granted a COA on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">To succeed on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Sharbutt must show his counsel was ineffective under the standards established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Strickland </em>requires two components; first, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This means Sharbutt must establish \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, Sharbutt \u201cmust show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense\u201d; counsel\u2019s errors must be \u201cso serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Failure to succeed in demonstrating either component is fatal to Sharbutt\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Because the government\u2019s submission to our request for argument vitiated any claim of prejudice, we need not reach the first prong. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[A] court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">A \u201cburglary\u201d is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA if the conviction is for any crime \u201chaving the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This is known as a generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Oklahoma statute defining Sharbutt\u2019s crime, second degree burglary, is non-generic. Under the statute, a conviction may be based on entry of a vessel or vending machine as well as a building. Thus, the court was required to determine whether his prior conviction qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. To do so, we apply a \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Generally, the sentencing court must \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, where the statutory definition of the state crime of conviction encompasses both crimes that would qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and crimes that would not, a broader inquiry is permissible. <em>Id. </em>(addressing a conviction based on a jury verdict). Sharbutt claims his counsel was ineffective because he did not require the government to prove Sharbutt\u2019s conviction was for a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Even assuming Sharbutt\u2019s counsel should have objected to the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) under <em>Taylor, </em>the government established it would have been able to prove Sharbutt\u2019s conviction was appropriately considered at sentencing. In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court held the sentencing court, when considering a guilty plea for a burglary conviction under a non-generic statute, is generally limited \u201cto examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d 544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Here, the government supplied the indictment in Sharbutt\u2019s second degree burglary conviction. The indictment leaves no doubt Sharbutt was convicted for burglary by entering a building, a violent felony as described in the ACCA. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2148. Therefore, he was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the PSR as any objection would have been without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
