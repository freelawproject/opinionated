R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming the denial of petitioners\u2019 application for cancellation of removal. The BIA found that the male petitioner failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative and that the female petitioner and the minor petitioner lacked a qualifying relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">We have reviewed the response to the court\u2019s order to show cause, and we conclude that the male petitioner has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction as to the male petitioner. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">The female petitioner and the minor petitioner presented no evidence that they have a qualifying relative for purposes of cancellation of removal as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that these petitioners were ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition as to the female petitioner and the minor petitioner because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b269-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
