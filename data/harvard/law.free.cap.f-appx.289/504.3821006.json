Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. See 3d Cir. LA.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-26\">In 2007, following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Davis was found guilty of possession with the intent to distribute controlled substances and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. On February 19, 2008, while awaiting sentencing, he filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in which he claimed that authorities lacked probable cause to arrest and search him on March 28, 2006. On February 28, 2008, the District Court issued an order denying the petition, concluding that Davis\u2019 claims were not cognizable under \u00a7 2241. Davis now appeals that decision. We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s denial of the petition. <em>See Okereke </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 119 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Generally, a challenge to a federal conviction must be brought in a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120. A prisoner may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only where the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his confinement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective only if the petitioner can show that a limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Because Davis is unable to show that a \u00a7 2255 motion is an inadequate or ineffective vehicle for the constitutional claims raised in his petition, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that it lacked authority to entertain those claims in the context of a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. Even if it were appropriate to construe Davis\u2019 petition as a motion under \u00a7 2255, the motion would be subject to dismissal as premature because it was filed prior to sentencing and direct appeal. <em>See Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570-72 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the appeal does not present a substantial question. We will therefore summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court pursuant to 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
