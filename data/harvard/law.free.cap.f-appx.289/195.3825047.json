The district court dismissed the petition as untimely because Ruiz did not file it within the one-year statute of limitations provided by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Although Ruiz had filed three state post-conviction relief petitions, the district court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the second and third petitions were not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and thus did not toll the running of the limitations period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Ruiz contends that his second and third state post-conviction petitions were \u201cproperly filed\u201d in state court and therefore should have tolled the running of the limitations period. In the alternative, Ruiz contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling. We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal and remand to allow the district court to consider his arguments for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The district court correctly concluded that Ruiz\u2019s second and third petitions for post-conviction relief did not toll the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because they were not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cProperly filed\u201d means that the petition\u2019s \u201cdelivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings\u201d in that state. <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). In <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen a post-conviction petition is untimely under state law,\u201d it is not properly filed \u201cfor purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 125 S.Ct. 1807.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Arizona court held that Ruiz\u2019s petition was untimely under Arizona law. Our cases have not addressed the questions of whether we may review a state court\u2019s decision, under state law, that a petitioner\u2019s state petition was untimely in the context of determining whether a petition was \u201cproperly filed,\u201d and, if so, what standard of review applies. <em>See, e.g., Bonner v. Carey, </em>425 F.3d 1145, 1149 (9th Cir.2005) (assuming, without addressing the issue, that the California courts\u2019 conclusion regarding timeliness is conclusive as to whether the petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2)), <em>as amended, </em>439 F.3d 993 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 856,127 S.Ct. 132, 166 L.Ed.2d 97 (2006); <em>Thorson v. Palmer, </em>479 F.3d 643, 645 (9th Cir.2007) (same). Regardless of whether we treat the state court decision as conclusive or whether we review the state court decision, Ruiz\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">If we treat as conclusive the state court\u2019s decision that Ruiz\u2019s third petition was untimely under state law, it follows automatically that Ruiz\u2019s petition was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d to toll the statute of limitations. <em>See Pace, </em>544 U.S. at 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (\u201cBecause the state court rejected petitioner\u2019s ... petition as untimely, it was not \u2018properly filed.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bonner, </em>425 F.3d at 1149 (\u201cBecause the California courts dismissed Bonner\u2019s petition as untimely, his petition was not \u2018properly filed\u2019 under AEDPA.\u201d); <em>Thorson, </em>479 F.3d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">On the other hand, if we review the state court\u2019s decision, we would conclude that Ruiz\u2019s third petition<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not properly filed to toll the statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>because it was late under state law and his claim of ineffectiveness of counsel was not one of the types of claims exempted from the state\u2019s timeliness rules. <em>See </em>Ariz. R.Crim. P. 32.4 (listing types of claims that are exempt from the state\u2019s timeliness requirement) and 32.1 (defining types of claims). The state trial court considering Ruiz\u2019s third petition correctly determined that his ineffectiveness of counsel claim was a claim alleging a constitutional violation under Rule 32.1(a), which is not exempt from Arizona\u2019s timeliness requirement. <em>See State v. Robbins, </em>166 Ariz. 531, 803 P.2d 942, 944 (Ariz.App.1991) (stating that for cases involving ineffective assistance of counsel, applicable rule is 32.1(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The state trial court also correctly ruled that this claim did not fall under the significant change in law exception of Rule 32.1(g) because <em>Stewart v. Smith, </em>202 Ariz. 446, 46 P.3d 1067 (2002) (en banc), was a clarification of Rule 32.2(a), not a significant change in law that applies to Ruiz. Moreover, Ruiz\u2019s reliance on <em>Smith </em>and <em>State v. Bennett, </em>213 Ariz. 562, 146 P.3d 63 (2006) (en banc), are misplaced because those cases concerned preclusion of waived issues under Rule 32.2, not timeliness under Rule 32.4. <em>Smith, </em>46 P.3d at 1068; <em>Bennett, </em>146 P.3d at 66-67. Here, the state trial court did not dismiss Ruiz\u2019s third post-conviction petition on waiver grounds under Rule 32.2(a)(3); it dismissed the petition on timeliness grounds under Rule 32.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Because the Arizona trial court correctly found the third petition untimely under state law, it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and did not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Ruiz contends that his reliance on prePace cases, in particular on <em>Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>244 F.3d 724 (9th Cir.2001), and <em>Saffold v. Carey, </em>312 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir.2002), and the state\u2019s appointment of the same attorney to represent him in both his state appeals and post-conviction proceedings are extraordinary circumstances that justify equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Although Ruiz argued in the district court that he was entitled to tolling, he did not brief equitable tolling, and the district court did not rule on it. Therefore, we decline to address it in the first instance. <em>Bonner v. Carey, </em>425 F.3d 1145, 1150 (9th Cir.2005) (remanding to allow district court to consider in the first instance argument for equitable tolling), <em>as amended, </em>439 F.3d 993 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 856, 127 S.Ct. 132, 166 L.Ed.2d 97 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">However, Ruiz\u2019s claim for equitable tolling on the basis that he detrimentally relied on <em>Dictado </em>and <em>Saffold </em>may have merit. <em>See Harris v. Carter, </em>515 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir.2008) (holding that detrimental reliance on pre-Pace precedent that held that untimely state post-conviction petitions were \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d) and tolled the statute of limitations while the petitions were pending in the state courts justified equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations). Therefore, we remand to the district court to consider whether Ruiz is entitled to equitable tolling on this or any other theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b217-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

R. 22-l(e). As jurists of reason would find it debatable whether \u201cthe petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and whether \"the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we grant the COA pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).

R. 22-1 (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-13\">. We consider only his contention regarding the third post-conviction petition because the year and a half that elapsed during his third post-conviction proceeding decides the issue; if that time is not tolled, tolling during his second post-conviction proceeding would not help Ruiz.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
