We review this decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider because petitioner\u2019s motion was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). We further conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen because petitioner\u2019s motion was untimely, as well as number-barred, and the petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to support an exception to the numerical or time limits for motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) and 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary denial of this petition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
