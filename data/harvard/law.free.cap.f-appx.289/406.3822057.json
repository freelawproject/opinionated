He argues that the board erred as a matter of law because under Subpart B, he is not required to hold an ATCS certif\u00edcate, but rather an Ah* Traffic Control Tower Operator certificate (CTO). He also argues that the ATCS requirement in AFI 13-203 is a fabrication counter to law, thus inherently in bad faith and patently unfair. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This court must affirm a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board unless the decision is (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Because the decision of the board met these requirements, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Thompson does not contest that he lost his ATCS certification. Instead, he argues that AFI 13-203, which required him to have this certification, was in bad faith and patently unfair. At the time of his removal, AFI 13-203 Paragraph 14.1 read: \u201cIn accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations 14, Part 65, Subpart B, Air Traffic Control Tower Operators, only personnel holding a current Air Traffic Control Specialist (ATCS) Certificate shall be authorized to perform air traffic control duties in USAF facilities.\u201d It further states: \u201cAdditionally, each individual must satisfactorily complete the FAA CTO written test or hold an FAA CTO certification.\u201d Subpart B however requires only the CTO certificate, stating that \u201c[n]o person may act as an air traffic control tower operator at an air traffic control tower in connection with civil aircraft unless he ... [hjolds an air traffic control tower operator certificate issued to him under this subpart.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 65.31(a). The discrepancy can be accounted for because the Federal Aviation Administration has expressly granted permission to the military to add extra requirements in addition to those stated in Part 65 in FAA Order 7220.1A, chapter 1, paragraph 9. Thus, the Air Force was legally entitled to require Thompson to hold a current ATCS certificate in addition to the requirements of Subpart B, and AFI 13-203 was not a fabrication. Without evidence that the Air Force had acted in bad faith or patently unfairly, the board deferred to the Air Force.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
