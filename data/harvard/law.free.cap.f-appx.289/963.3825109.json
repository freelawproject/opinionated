Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, <em>see </em>Cano-<em>Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 due process claim based on assertions that the IJ\u2019s conduct forced them to withdraw them asylum application because they failed to present this claim to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied petitioners\u2019 motion to remand to the IJ for consideration of their eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) because the record does not support petitioners\u2019 contention that withdrawal of their asylum application did not include withdrawal of their CAT claim and petitioners did not submit evidence of eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See Cano-Merida, </em>311 F.3d at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b986-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
