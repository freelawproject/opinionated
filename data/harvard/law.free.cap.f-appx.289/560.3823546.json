For essentially the reasons provided by the Magistrate Judge, in a Report and Recommendation that was adopted as the opinion of the District Court, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-30\">Porter, an inmate previously incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Greene (\u201cSCI-Greene\u201d), filed the underlying civil action against SCI-Greene correctional officers Donald Blake, Barry Wright and Mark Capozza. Porter alleged that sometime in mid to late March 2002, defendants Blake and Wright gave him an opened container of milk that they had contaminated with Hepatitis C and A blood. Porter claimed that this contaminated milk caused him to contract Hepatitis that same month. Porter further alleged that defendant Capozza, the Unit Manager, failed to report the incident despite his responsibility for supervising the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The defendants ultimately filed motions for summary judgment, arguing that Porter had not exhausted administrative remedies and/or procedurally defaulted his claims insofar as the only grievance he filed (Grievance # 26070 submitted on July 13, 2002) merely complained that his health had been put in jeopardy as a result of his contraction of Hepatitis from an unknown source at SCI-Greene, and because it was rejected by the grievance officer as untimely. The Magistrate Judge to whom the action was referred agreed with the defendants that Porter failed to properly exhaust his administrative remedies, and recommended that the defendants\u2019 motions be granted. Over Porter\u2019s objections, the District Court adopted the recommendation, granting summary judgment in favor of defendants. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>See Torres v. Fauver, </em>292 F.3d 141, 145 (3d Cir.2002). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), prisoners are required to exhaust available administrative remedies before bringing a civil rights action concerning prison conditions, regardless of whether these remedies can provide the inmate with the relief sought. <em>See Booth v. Chumer, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has a three-tier grievance system, set forth in Policy Statement DC-ADM 804, which serves as a prisoner\u2019s administrative remedy. <em>See Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 232 (3d Cir.2004). In order to avoid a procedural default, an inmate is required at the initial level to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cidentify any persons who may have information that could be helpful in resolving the grievance,\u201d and to submit the grievance \u201cwithin fifteen (15) working days after the events on which the claims are based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, <em>quoting </em>DC-ADM 804, Part VI.A.l.d and VI.A.l.e.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Porter appears to contend that he exhausted his administrative remedies because he appealed Grievance #26070 to final review. That contention, however, is erroneous. While Porter did in fact proceed with his grievance through all three tiers of the grievance system, the grievance officer rejected Grievance # 26070 as untimely while also noting that Porter failed to provide a date on which the medical issue allegedly occurred. The Superintendent thereafter denied Porter\u2019s appeal, specifically finding that, insofar as Porter alleged he received his Hepatitis blood test results on April 11, 2002, his grievance dated July 13, 2002 was clearly outside the time requirements established by DC-ADM 804. The responses Porter received on initial review and from the Superintendent were upheld on final review by the Chief Grievance Coordinator. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Brief in Support of Summary Judgment, Exhibit A 1-6. As the Supreme Court has explicitly held, an untimely \u201cor otherwise procedurally defective administrative grievance or appeal\u201d does not satisfy the mandatory exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 83, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). <em>See also Spruill, </em>372 F.3d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Finally, Porter\u2019s contention that he is entitled to an exception to the exhaustion requirement because \u201cdefendants\u2019 misconduct evaded [his] perception,\u201d and because, after receiving his test results on April 11, 2002, he had \u201cto recollect back to the incident of being given a funny tasting milk,\u201d is unavailing. As defendants asserted in their summary judgment motions, Porter\u2019s own allegations indicate that he suspected defendants Blake and Wright of contaminating his milk in March 2002 or, at the latest, in April after he learned the results of his blood test. This is a full three months prior to his submission of Grievance # 26070, wherein he claimed the source of his contraction of Hepatitis was unknown. Moreover, despite Porter\u2019s argument to the contrary, the exhaustion requirement is not excused merely because a prisoner <em>alleges </em>that the correctional defendants engaged in misconduct (unrelated to the grievance process itself) and should be estopped from raising the exhaustion defense. The Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[t]he benefits of exhaustion can be realized only if the prison grievance system is given a fair opportunity to consider the grievance.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. at 95, 126 S.Ct. 2378. The administrative system was simply never given that opportunity with respect to a timely grievance against the named defendants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The record clearly reflects that Porter did not properly exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Summary judgment was thus appropriate because Porter failed to come forward with any evidence to rebut the record evidence that he committed a procedural default. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>see also Spruill, </em>372 F.3d at 230. We, therefore, discern no error in the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendants. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal as lacking in merit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Appellant\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied. <em>Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155-58 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
