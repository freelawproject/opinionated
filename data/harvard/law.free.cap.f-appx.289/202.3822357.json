We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm,</p>\n<p id=\"AMT\"> Powers first argues that the district court erred by failing to value his claims for the 1991, 1992 and 1993 fishing seasons, which were related to his lost profits from a lost business contract with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Seafoods for Alaska (\u201cSFA\u201d). The 1991 to 1993 seasons were not \u201crecognized fishing seasons\u201d under the Plan, which allows tender operators to claim \u201ceconomic losses\u201d only from \u201cseasons in oiled fisheries in which harvest was lost as the result of the oil spill.\u201d Although we agree with Powers that his SFA claim is not a claim for damages from lost harvest, his claim is nonetheless a claim for \u201ceconomic losses.\u201d The plain language of the Plan precludes his recovery for economic losses in non- . , <em>~ </em>,. recognized fishing seasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Powers also argues that the district court erred in valuing a dock that was to be built and leased to SFA under the SFA contract, before reverting to Powers\u2019 ownership. The district court found that Powers\u2019 agreement with SFA was that SFA would build a dock facility worth $250,000, and in exchange Powers would forgo rent from SFA for seven years. The district court found that the lost rental value of the dock under the contract was $35,714 per year. There is nothing clearly erroneous about the district court\u2019s computation of the dock\u2019s value. <em>See Stephens v. City of Vista, </em>994 F.2d 650, 657 (9th Cir.1993). Further, Powers is not entitled to recover the rental value of the dock in non-recognized fishing seasons, because this is also a claim for \u201ceconomic losses\u201d and is precluded by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">On cross-appeal, EQSF argues that the district court erred by recognizing Powers\u2019 claims for losses from the SFA contract for 1990, 1994 and 1995. The district court found that Powers was a participant in the Upper Cook Inlet drift fishery in 1989 and therefore not subject , ,, -r,, , ...... . , to the Plan s one-year limitation on tender claims for tender operators who \u201cceased operations altogether, or were driven out of business, as a result of the spill.\u201d The district court did not err in finding that Powers was \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to pack harvest in the drift fishery in 1989. Further, even if Powers were not a participant in the fishery in 1989, he clearly did not \u201ccease[ ] operations altogether\u201d nor was he \u201cdriven out of business\u201d by the spill, as the EQSF acknowledged by recognizing his claims for lost harvest for the 1990, 1994 and 1995 seasons. Therefore, the Plan\u2019s one-year limitation on claims would not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"Axl\">Powers\u2019 appeal, case number 07-35636, . , __ is AFFIRMED.
