California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Salazar has filed a response. Salazar also has moved for appointment of new counsel and leave to proceed pro se. Salazar\u2019s motions are DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Salazar\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
