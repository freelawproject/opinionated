We affirm. <em>See Casino Res. Corp. v. Harrah\u2019s Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>243 F.3d 435, 437 (8th Cir.2001) (de novo review).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">As relevant, Midwestern sought to hold hable Arkansas Bus Exchange Corporation, d/b/a America\u2019s Bus Superstore of Orlando LLC, d/b/a America\u2019s Bus Superstore (Superstore) for providing a false odometer statement in connection with Midwestern\u2019s purchase of a bus from Superstore. We conclude that a plain reading of the federal statute precludes liability on these facts: because it is undisputed that the vehicle at issue here \u2014 one weighing over 16,000 pounds \u2014 was exempt from the federal odometer act\u2019s mileage-reporting requirements, it was likewise exempt from the statute\u2019s prohibition against giving false statements when making a required disclosure. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32705(a)(l)-(5) (mileage-reporting requirements; prohibition against giving false statement in making \u201cthe disclosure required by\u201d regulations promulgated by Secretary of Transportation; authority of Secretary to exempt categories of vehicles); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 200-01, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976) (in cases of statutory interpretation, language of statute controls if it is sufficiently clear in context); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.17(a) (vehicles exempted). Thus, the district court was correct in concluding that Midwestern was not entitled to relief under the federal odometer act.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Similarly, we agree with the district court that Midwestern has no claim under the Missouri odometer act. That act unambiguously states that the mileage-reporting requirements \u201cdo not apply\u201d to the category of vehicle at issue here. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 407.536 (disclosure requirements), 407.546 (civil damages), 407.556.2 (exemptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">We also reject Midwestern\u2019s argument that Superstore waived the exemption in the federal odometer act. Even if this court were to recognize a waiver, a waiver requires the voluntary relinquishment of a known right, and here there was no evidence that Superstore knew of the exemption and knowingly waived the right to not disclose the mileage. <em>See Farley v. Benefit Trust Life Ins. Co., </em>979 F.2d 653, 659 (8th Cir.1992) (definition of waiver; without evidence of any intention to surrender right, there was no error in district court\u2019s rejection of waiver argument). Finally, we find unpersuasive Midwestern\u2019s argument that a seller should not be allowed to provide false information and then escape liability for its fraud by relying on the exemptions: fraudulent sellers cannot escape liability because a buyer may still bring suit under common law fraud statutes, which Midwestern did.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">.
