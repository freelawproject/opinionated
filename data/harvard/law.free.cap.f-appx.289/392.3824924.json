California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Dimanche has filed a document that we have construed as a motion for an extension of time to file a supplemental reply to the <em>Anders </em>motion. Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is- correct. Dimanche was able to file a response to counsel\u2019s brief raising several issues of alleged arguable merit. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Dimanche\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. Because Dimanche had opportunity to file an extensive response to counsel\u2019s motion, his motion for an extension of time to file a supplemental reply is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
