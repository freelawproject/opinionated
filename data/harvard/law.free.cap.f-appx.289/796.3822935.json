Key, III for accepting a $5,000 fee and not performing any service. The district court dismissed Leal-Rodriguez\u2019s lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The district court noted that amendment of the suit would not have saved it from dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-20\">Leal-Rodriguez argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without allowing him to amend the complaint. This court reviews a dismissal as frivolous under \u00a7 1915A for abuse of discretion. <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998). A dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A is reviewed under the same de novo standard as dismissals under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). Because the district court found that Leal-Rodriguez\u2019s complaint was both frivolous and failed to state a claim, review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-21\">Key, a private attorney, was not a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). LealRodriguez does not argue that Key was a \u201cwillful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents.\u201d <em>Green v. State Bar of Texas, </em>27 F.3d 1083, 1088 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted). The district court was correct in finding that Leal-Rodriguez failed to state a claim for relief. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544,127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.8d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008). A district court should not dismiss a pro se complaint without providing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend, unless it is obvious that the plaintiff has pleaded his \u201cbest\u201d case, and a cause of action has not been established. <em>See Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 792-93 (5th Cir.1986). On appeal, Leal-Rodriguez has presented nothing to show that he could have prevented the dismissal of his claim against Key if allowed to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. The district courts dismissal of Leal-Rodriguez\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Leal-Rodriguez is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
