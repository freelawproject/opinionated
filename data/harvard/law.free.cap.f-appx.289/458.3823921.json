Weisel denying You\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Li Yu You, </em>No. A 98 713 038 (B.I.A. Aug. 2, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>No. 98 713 038 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Oct. 20, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Gum v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based almost entirely on his conclusion that You\u2019s testimony was \u201chighly implausible[.]\u201d This Court will not disturb an IJ\u2019s finding that an applicant\u2019s testimony is inherently implausible so long as that finding is \u201ctethered to record evidence, and there is nothing else in the record from which a firm conviction of error could properly be derived.\u201d <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 169 (2d Cir.2007). In making such a finding, an IJ is not required to \u201cexplain in precise detail what made each identified act implausible.\u201d <em>See Wensheng Yan, </em>509 F.3d at 67. Rather, where \u201cthe reasons for [the IJ\u2019s] incredulity are evident,\u201d the implausibility finding \u201cis supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">The IJ found implausible You\u2019s assertion that he knew that practicing Falun Gong would improve his basketball skills, but did not practice Falun Gong because he was busy with school. You testified that, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>playing basketball as a thirteen-year-old, he was so impressed with the extent to which Falnn Gong improved his friend\u2019s basketball skills that he endorsed it to his peers. In light of this assertion, the IJ properly found implausible that You did not practice Falun Gong himself, where it was \u201clogical that if his friend told him that Falun Gong would make him a better basketball player, he would have started practicing it.\u201d <em>See Wensheng Yan, </em>509 F.3d at 67. Further, the IJ reasonably declined to credit You\u2019s explanation that he did not practice Falun Gong because he was too busy with school, where this explanation failed to account for the fact that he had time to promote Falun Gong and to continue playing basketball. <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-f\u00ednder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The IJ also properly based his adverse credibility determination on an inconsistency between You\u2019s testimony and a letter submitted by his father. You\u2019s father stated in his letter that You was detained by school security officials in May 2005, whereas You testified that this event occurred in May 2000. This inconsistency, although minor, further undermines You\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">However, the IJ\u2019s decision was not without error. The IJ erred by basing his adverse credibility determination on his finding that You\u2019s testimony about Falun Gong lacked \u201csufficiency of detail\u201d where You was not asked to provide additional details. <em>See Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the record did not support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding in the absence of additional probing). Moreover, the IJ\u2019s finding that it was implausible that You testified that he did not practice Falun Gong because he was afraid was based on a mischaracterization of the record. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (providing that this Court will not uphold findings based on \u201cmisstatementfs] of the facts in the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">These errors notwithstanding, remand would be futile because, based on the properly-made findings outlined above, it can be \u201cconfidently predict[ed]\u201d that the IJ would reach the same decision on remand. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility was, taken as a whole, supported by substantial evidence. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74. Accordingly, the IJ properly found that You failed to meet the burden of proof required for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, where each claim was based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. Because You's asylum application was filed after May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act applies to his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act of 2005, Div. B of Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, 303 (2005) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). The Real ID Act modified credibility determinations to provide that an adverse credibility determination may be supported by implausibilities and inconsistencies regardless of whether they go to the heart of the applicant's claim. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(I)(B)(iii). Nonetheless, because the implausibilities present in You\u2019s case go to the heart of his claim that he was mistreated for supporting Falun Gong, they provide strong support for the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
