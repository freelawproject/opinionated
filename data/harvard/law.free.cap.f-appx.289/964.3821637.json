Frank, </em>916 F.2d 558, 562 n. 6 (9th Cir.1990). Whether a particular accommodation is reasonable depends on the individual circumstances of each case and requires a fact-specific, individualized analysis of the disabled individual\u2019s circumstances and the accommodations necessary to meet the program\u2019s standards. <em>Vinson v. Thomas, </em>288 F.3d 1145, 1154 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">1. Spelling 095</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">A triable issue of fact exists with respect to whether the institution provided Button with a \u201cqualified interpreter\u201d for this class. Button complained about the quality of interpreters on a number of occasions. Although the institution agreed to use Debra Scott\u2019s interpreting services for some classes as Button requested, the record reflects that Button complained about the quality of interpreters and the spotty attendance of interpreters on several occasions. In one e-mail, Button notes, \u201cI already gave FIVE months for you to arrange to search [for] an interpreter....\u201d Button\u2019s expert testified that \u201cthe institutions in this case did not respond in a timely enough manner.\u201d The e-mail exchange, in combination with the expert testimony, points to a triable issue of fact as to whether the accommodations offered in response to Button\u2019s requests were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">2. Environmental Science</p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">College officials acknowledged some insufficiency in note taking; at one point the administration sent an e-mail explaining that they had been looking for a \u201clegitimate\u201d note taker and finally found one. This indicates that there was a substantial period of time during which a \u201clegitimate\u201d note taker was not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-16\">Button\u2019s e-mails confirm that she raised concerns about the delay in finding an adequate note taker. Button\u2019s expert also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>concluded that the institution\u2019s response was not adequate, stating that, while a single missed note taker might be understandable, it is not excusable \u201c[w]hen you have a whole series of courses where note takers [and] notes were never provided, there is a problem, and it\u2019s a systemic problem____\u201d This indicates that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether the Board\u2019s actions constituted \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d of Button\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">3. Global Economics</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">With respect to Global Economics, the district court concluded that there was no evidence that Button complained about Dr. Robinson\u2019s speaking speed after the institution sent him a letter asking him to slow down. However, the evidence is undisputed that Button requested Real Time Captioning (\u201cRTC\u201d) instead of an interpreter for this class, which was not provided. It appears the district court addressed only the initial RTC request and not the one made in the Global Economics class. The court justified the denial of the UNLV RTC request by stating that RTC in addition to an interpreter would be duplicative. However, in the e-mails pertaining to her Global Economics class, Button specifically requested RTC <em>instead, of </em>an interpreter for this class. The institution apparently looked into the possibility of RTC but found it was not available. The stated lack of availability is odd in light of CCSN\u2019s utilization of RTC for her spelling class when an interpreter was unavailable. Button\u2019s expert also stated that when the quality of interpreters and note takers is spotty the school \u201cdoes have the responsibility to have some kind of back-up plan.\u201d Given Button\u2019s continual e-mail complaints that she was unable to keep up with the class, in conjunction with the expert testimony, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the university\u2019s response constituted a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">4. UNLV RTC Request</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">Button\u2019s expert stated that the institution\u2019s summary denial of the RTC in conjunction with note taking and interpreters was inappropriate because administrators did not try to determine why Button believed all three services were necessary. The Board\u2019s expert, on the other hand, opined that \u201cit is totally inappropriate to have both [interpreters and RTC] at the same time.\u201d A conflict in expert testimony is a quintessential dispute of material fact. <em>See e.g., Schroeder v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., </em>514 F.2d 901, 903-904 (9th Cir.1975). The Board does not argue that Button\u2019s expert was unqualified. Rather, it argues that her testimony is not supported by sufficient record evidence. However, different inferences could be drawn from the record evidence. <em>See Linn Gear Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>608 F.2d 791, 796 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">The institution\u2019s denial and the reasons for the denial are undisputed, but there is no legal or factual barrier preventing a jury from reasonably concluding that the university\u2019s response constituted a denial of a reasonable accommodation. \u201c[M]ere speculation that a suggested accommodation is not feasible falls short of the reasonable accommodation requirement; [both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act] create a duty to gather sufficient information from the disabled individual and qualified experts as needed to determine what accommodations are necessary....\u201d <em>Duvall v. County of Kitsap, </em>260 F.3d 1124, 1136 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Wong v. Regents of the University of California, </em>192 F.3d 807, 818 (9th Cir.1999) (omission in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>original)). The denial of a request for accommodation \u201cwithout consulting [plaintiff] or any person at the University whose job it was to formulate appropriate accommodations\u201d has been found \u201ca conspicuous failure to carry out the obligation \u2018conscientiously\u2019 to explore possible accommodations.\u201d <em>Wong, </em>192 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Deliberate Indifference</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">To recover money damages, Button must show that the institution acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d which requires both \u201cknowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely, and a failure to act upon that likelihood.\u201d <em>Duvall, </em>260 F.3d at 1139. A denial of a request without investigation is sufficient to survive summary judgment on the question of deliberate indifference. <em>See id. </em>at 1139-41. In <em>Duvall, </em>the court stated, \u201cif [plaintiffs] account of the timing and content of his requests for accommodation and defendants\u2019 reactions thereto are accurate, a trier of fact could conclude that defendants\u2019 decisions not to accommodate him were considered and deliberate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1141. There, the plaintiff contacted the ADA coordinator of the court to request RTC; the coordinator responded that the courtroom would be equipped for the hearing impaired but that the plaintiff would have to file a motion for further accommodation; plaintiff made such a motion, and the judge denied it because they did not have the technology, and instead allowed the plaintiff to move about the courtroom freely wherever he could best hear the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">We cannot say that, if the jury concludes that the Board\u2019s accommodations were not reasonable, the jury could not also conclude that the Board\u2019s failure to provide greater accommodations was not \u201cdeliberate and considered,\u201d particularly in light of the Board\u2019s summary denial of Button\u2019s RTC request. It is not enough that the Board took some action \u2014 in <em>Duvall </em>the court made some effort to accommodate, but we held that a jury could find this effort both insufficient and deliberate. <em>See id. </em>This inquiry is nuanced and fact-intensive \u2014 precisely the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Disputed issues of material fact preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-10\">. The Board of Regents of the CCSN and UNLV are considered the same entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b988-17\">. There is no dispute that Button is <em>capable </em>of a strong academic performance \u2014 after her experience at CCSN and UNLV, she transferred to the State University of New York in Cortland, where she made the Dean\u2019s List.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b990-10\">CLIFTON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APEE\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">I respectfully dissent. Plaintiff Lezlie Button seeks only an award of damages, not injunctive relief. To recover money damages she must show that the Board acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Duvall v. County of Kitsap, </em>260 F.3d 1124, 1139 (9th Cir.2001). Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to her, she has not identified sufficient evidence to support such a finding. Indeed, her brief does not even argue that she has.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">The Board responded repeatedly to try to satisfy Button\u2019s concerns. The majority cites <em>Duvall </em>in support of the proposition that the denial of a request without investigation is sufficient to survive summary judgment on the question of deliberate indifference, but there is no evidence that the Board ever denied any of Button\u2019s requests without investigation. I infer from the majority\u2019s discussion that the denial allegedly without investigation was the Board\u2019s so-called summary denial of Button\u2019s request that she be provided at the same time with multiple accommodations: Real Time Captioning (RTC), note-taking, and an interpreter. But it did not require a special investigation for university administrators to know that it was not customary for a disabled student to require or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>to receive all three forms of assistance at the same time. Moreover, the record shows that university administrators did in fact consult other providers of deaf services about the feasibility of RTC as a form of note taking before denying that request. The denial was not without investigation and it did not demonstrate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The Board\u2019s responses might not have been effective or sufficient to solve the problems \u2014 and may not have satisfied the legal obligation to make reasonable accommodations \u2014 but there is no evidence of indifference, let alone the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d needed to support a claim for money damages. I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
