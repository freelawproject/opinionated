We review de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Flaten v. Secretary of HHS, </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1457 (9th Cir.1995). The decision must be affirmed if substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings and the ALJ applied the correct legal standards. <em>Moncada v. Chater, </em>60 F.3d 521, 523 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam), We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision and dismiss Hill\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">. T T , ., , . The ALJ properly considered and dis- . , _ L , . . . counted Dr. Toths opimon m light of the \u201e .. i mi a t t , , , full record. The ALJ must present clear , . . . . , and convincing reasons tor rejecting the , , , .. \u201e , . ,, , uncontroverted opmion of a claimant s phy- ,, \u201e \u201e \u201e\u201e\u201e sician. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 761 9th Cir.1989). Although a dmmant S teatmg phy^cmn * generally entitled to deference, the ALJ may reject . . ,, , <em>, \u201e </em>the opmion of a treating physician m favor \u201e <em>: </em>. . o\u00ed a conflicting opmion of an examining , .. ,, . ' , , physician it the ALJ makes findings set-f. \u201e ,, , \u201e tmg forth specific, legitimate reasons for . . ,, , \u2019 , . , domg so that are based on substantial . ,, evidence m the record. <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 957 (9th Cir.2002). The ALJ can \u201cmeet this burden by setting out a detailed and thorough summary of , , the facts and conflicting clinical evidence, 6 \u2019 statmg his mterpretation thereof, and &amp; <em>\\ </em>\u2019 ma 'ng in ings. .</p>\n<p id=\"AnX\">There appears to be some dispute over how frequently and how many times Hill saw Dr. Toth, and thus, whether he can be considered her \u201ctreating\u201d physician, However, as the district court observed, even if it is assumed that he was in fact Hill\u2019s treating physician, \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record contradicts his views. <em>Thomas, </em>278 F.3d at 957. The ALJ carefully analyzed the several opinions in the record and ultimately struck upon a compromise view of Hill\u2019s condition and her potential to work that fell somewhere between the views of Dr. Toth (a family practitioner), those of Dr. Sturtz (a board certified orthopedist), and those of other physicians who evaluated her. The ALJ\u2019s careful and detailed discussion satisfies the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard and justifies his rejection of Dr. Toth\u2019s opinion,</p>\n<p id=\"Ag-W\">Hill next argues that the ALJ discred- ., , , , , , .. ited her statements regarding her symp- , <em>UT </em>, , . . AT T toms. In determining credibility, an ALJ . ,. , . . . may engage in ordmary techniques of ... .... ... . .. . credibility evaluation, such as considering , . ,, , claimant s reputation for truthfulness and . ... . , . ,, , ,. \u201e inconsistencies in claimants testimony. <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Barnhart, 400 </em>F.3d <em>676, </em>6<em>8</em>0 adaiti gocU SeCTr\u00a1 \u201e ,. co 10 .. . , \u201e \u201e , ,. Ruling 88-13 lists a number of factors the ATT .. \u201e .. ALJ may consider. General findings are . . . ,, ,. . T T msufficient; rather, the ALJ must identify , , , ,. . , .... , . , what testimony is not credible and what .. . . ,, . . ,, evidence undermines the claimants com- , . , \u201e <em>r , </em>. \u00abi nnj no-. plamts.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995)</p>\n<p id=\"AqEH\">^ ALJ did not make a , , ... , , erahzed credibility determmation, but \u201e . , , TT.,,, , , carefully weighed Hill s statements m light ,,,, , ,. , , of the rest of the record, indicating why he wag skepycai 0f some 0f fier claims. In particular, he noted that Hill admits that she can \u201cperform all of the activities of daily living including meal preparation for herself and her children,\u201d that she \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>not appear to be motivated to change her condition,\u201d and that the \u201cnumber and frequency of doctor visits documented in the record is less than what I would expect from the degree of impairment alleged by the claimant.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s interpretation was rational, and because the evidence here is \u201csusceptible to more than one rational interpretation,\u201d we must uphold the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Burch, </em>400 F.3d at 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"Aix\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AFVs\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
