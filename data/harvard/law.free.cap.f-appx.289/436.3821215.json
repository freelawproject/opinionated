PARKER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b459-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">Defendant-Appellant Raheem Davis appeals from a judgment entered in the District Court on June 5, 2007, finding him guilty of distributing or possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base, or \u201ccrack,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(C). He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings prohibited him from presenting a complete defense, and that his case should be remanded in light of the recent amendments to the Sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ing Guidelines respecting crack cocaine convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Davis was arrested following police officers\u2019 observation of three men standing near each other in a stairwell, making hand motions and \u201cpassing\u201d something. When officers approached, the men fled. One man \u2014 later identified as Davis \u2014 threw a packet containing crack cocaine and 41 individual plastic bags, and dropped a cell phone. Although no arrest was made at the scene, Davis admitted that the number of the recovered cell phone was his own. Additionally, the numbers in the recovered phone matched those on Davis\u2019s contact list at the Metropolitan Correction Center, the name \u201cDice Man\u201d written on the phone\u2019s screen matched Davis\u2019s repeated references to himself as \u201cDice\u201d in phone calls made from prison, and an officer on the scene of the attempted arrest later identified Davis with \u201c80 percent\u201d certainty as the man who had thrown the drugs, dropped the phone, and fled. In light of this evidence, a rational juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis was the man whom the officers observed, and that he was distributing or possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base. <em>See United States v. Gagliardi, </em>506 F.3d 140, 149-50 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The District Court did not err by refusing to suppress certain statements Davis made, after being Mirandized, outside the presence of counsel. At the time he made the statements, Davis was represented by counsel in another, unrelated matter. But the right to counsel is offense-specific, so it is not enough for Davis to show that he had counsel in an unrelated matter. <em>United States v. Mapp, </em>170 F.3d 328, 334 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>528 U.S. 901, 120 S.Ct. 239, 315, 145 L.Ed.2d 200 (1999). Moreover, the District Court was not persuaded that Davis ever requested (and therefore was ever denied) access to an attorney, and noted that he completed and signed a <em>Miranda </em>warning form. We see no reason to disturb these factual findings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Nor did the District Court violate Davis\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by limiting his efforts to argue that the officers had a motive to tamper with the evidence \u2014 specifically, the cell phone. This argument was unsubstantiated and in any case is largely irrelevant because the witnesses Davis presented \u2014 including an employee of the cell phone company Nextel \u2014 tended to confirm that even if the government had such a motive, it had no means by which to effectuate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Davis and the government both note that the Sentencing Commission recently reduced the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels, effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (2007); <em>Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, </em>72 Fed.Reg. 28571-28572 (2007). That change has since been given retroactive effect. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>339 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Davis\u2019s principal brief was filed the same day as Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Our subsequent opinion in <em>United States v. Regalado, </em>518 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2008), noted that \u201cwhen the sentencing of a defendant for a crack cocaine offense occurred before <em>Kimbrough, </em>we cannot tell whether the district court would have exercised its now clear discretion to mitigate the sentencing range produced by the 100-to-l ratio.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148-49. Thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Where a defendant has not preserved the argument that the sentencing range for the crack cocaine offense fails to serve the objectives of sentencing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a), we will remand to give the district court an opportunity to indicate whether it would have imposed a non-Guidelines sentence knowing that it had discretion to deviate from the Guidelines to serve those objectives. If so, the court should vacate the original sentence and resentence the defendant. If not, the court should state on the record that it is declining to resentence, and it should provide an appropriate explanation for this decision. On appeal, if we have not already done so, we will review the sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We therefore AFFIRM Davis\u2019s conviction, but REMAND for consideration re-sentencing in light of <em>Regalado </em>and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
