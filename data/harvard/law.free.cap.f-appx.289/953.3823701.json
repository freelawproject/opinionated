Lawrence, </em>535 F.3d 631, 633-34 (7th Cir. 2008). In July 2005 Cortez Trapps was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), but earlier this year he moved under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify that sentence based on Amendment 706. The district court denied the motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-22\">Trapps\u2019s appeal has no merit because, although his guidelines range was 140 to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment, he received the mandatory-minimum sentence of 120 months. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). When the sentencing guidelines are amended, a district court may reduce a prisoner\u2019s sentence only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>duction is inconsistent with the policy statements accompanying Amendment 706 if a \u201cstatutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d prevents the district court from lowering the prisoner\u2019s guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (n.l(A)). Because Trapps received the statutory mandatory-minimum sentence for his crime, the district court correctly recognized that it lacked authority to reduce Trapps\u2019s. sentence any further. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (\u201c[A]s to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note [that] ... district courts are constrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.\u201d); <em>United States v. Black, </em>528 F.3d 892, 892-93 (8th Cir.2008) (district courts lack authority to modify a sentence below the mandatory minimum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706); <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>536 F.3d 798, 813 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhile the sentencing guidelines may be only advisory for district judges, congressional legislation is not.\u201d); <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>337 F.3d 905, 909 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe only provisions allowing for departure from a statutory minimum are 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(e) and (f).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
