The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that his five prior drug convictions \u2014 which included sales of controlled substances to an undercover officer on three different dates within a forty-day time period \u2014 totaled at least three serious drug offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), and the court imposed a 180-month prison sentence on October 6, 2006. Smith appeals, arguing the government did not prove that his prior narcotics convictions were district criminal episodes rather than one prolonged transaction constituting a single criminal episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We agree with the district court that Smith\u2019s prior drug convictions amount to at least three qualifying convictions for purposes of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Mason, </em>440 F.3d 1056, 1057 (8th Cir. 2006) (de novo review; criminal episodes underlying convictions trigger application of ACCA, not date of convictions or number of trials or pleas); <em>United States v. Speakman, </em>330 F.3d 1080, 1081-82 (8th Cir.2003) (3 drug sales to same undercover officer on 3 separate dates within 1 month, although consolidated into single sentence, were properly treated as 3 convictions for purposes of ACCA); <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>217 F.3d 491, 491-92 (7th Cir. 2000) (2 drug sales to same individuals within 45 minutes constituted separate and distinct episodes under \u00a7 924(e)(1); defendant had time to change his mind, to cease and desist, and to refuse to sell to informants during time lapse).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
