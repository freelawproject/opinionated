He argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial following the testimony of Jennifer Allen, which, he contends, gave the jury the impression that he had committed crimes or bad acts not alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-29\">Lerma is entitled to a new trial \u201conly [if], after a review of the entire record, it appears that there is a significant possibility that the prejudicial evidence had a substantial impact on the jury verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 345 (5th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(June 2, 2008) (No. 07-1512). The prejudicial effect of Allen\u2019s testimony was rendered harmless by the district court\u2019s curative jury instructions; Lerma\u2019s lack of credibility, as evidenced by his own contradictory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>testimony; and the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. The denial of Lerma\u2019s motion for mistrial was therefore not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
