Wellons argues that the court lacked subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ter jurisdiction to try, convict, and sentence him because there was a \u201cdefect\u201d in his indictment. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Generally, we review a district court's denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>476 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cm.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 193, 169 L.Ed.2d 130 (2007). However, a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction \u201cis a question of law and, therefore, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098,1101 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">A motion alleging a defect in an indictment must normally be filed pre-trial, \u201cbut at any time while the case is <em>pending, </em>the court may hear a claim that the indictment ... fails to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction or to state an offense.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) (emphasis added). In Wellons\u2019s case, he filed his motion to dismiss his indictment seven years after we affirmed his convictions and five years after we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. <em>See Wellons v. United States, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 328 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, Wellons\u2019s case was not \u201cpending\u201d within the meaning of Rule 12(b)(3)(B), and, therefore, the district court properly denied the motion. <em>See United States v. Patton, </em>309 F.3d 1093, 1094 (8th Cir.2002) (holding that district court correctly denied a post-conviction motion to dismiss an indictment where the defendant\u2019s case that led to his conviction and sentence was no longer pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Moreover, as mentioned above, Wellons had already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied by the district court and affirmed by us. <em>See Wellons v. United States, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 328 (11th Cir. 2002). Thus, to the extent that Wellons\u2019s motion could be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, his motion was nonetheless properly denied because Wellons improperly has attempted to circumvent federal habeas requirements. See <em>28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), cross-referencing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (requiring that, before an applicant may file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, the applicant must move the court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider such a motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">In light of the foregoing, the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
