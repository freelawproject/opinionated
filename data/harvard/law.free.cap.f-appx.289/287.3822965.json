O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Jose Pedro Flores-Gomez pled guilty to unlawful reentry of a deported alien subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). The district court sentenced him to forty-six months imprisonment. FIores-Gomez\u2019s counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved for leave to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We received no response from Flores-Gomez and the government declined to submit a brief. Finding no meritorious issues, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Following FIores-Gomez\u2019s guilty plea, a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared using the 2006 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines manual. The government filed a motion requesting Flores-Gomez receive an additional one-level decrease in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b). Based on a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of IV, FIores-Gomez\u2019s recommended guideline range was fifty-seven to seventy-one months imprisonment. The United States Probation Office, however, believed FIores-Gomez\u2019s criminal history was over represented and he most closely resembled defendants in criminal history category III. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-18\">Flores-Gomez filed a motion seeking a sentencing variance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argued the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a sentence below the guideline range and requested a sentence of twelve months and one day. The government agreed with the probation office that FIores-Gomez\u2019s criminal history score should be category III rather than category IV. It requested he be sentenced within the guideline range under category III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">The court agreed with the probation office and the government. With a criminal history category III, FIores-Gomez\u2019s guideline range was forty-six to fifty-seven months imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5A. The court declined to vary from this range and sentenced him to forty-six months imprisonment. Flores-Gomez appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\"><em>Anders </em>holds \u201cif counsel finds his [client\u2019s] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must submit to both the court and his client a \u201cbrief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The client may then \u201craise any points that he chooses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the court must completely examine all the proceedings to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the frivolity of the appeal. \u201cIf it so finds it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal____[I]f it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous) it must, prior to decision, afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Flores-Gomez\u2019s counsel indicates he could find no non-frivolous appellate issues, but stated it was Flores-Gomez\u2019s position that the court erred in failing to dramatically vary from the guidelines and impose a sentence of twelve months and one day. We have carefully reviewed the record and find no non-frivolous issues. The guideline range was properly calculated and the district court properly applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Geiner, </em>498 F.3d 1104, 1107 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding sentence reflecting a proper guideline calculation and application of \u00a7 3553(a) factors is procedurally reasonable). The district court considered Flores-Gomez\u2019s motion to vary, but denied the motion. The court did, however, decide a downward departure of one criminal history category was appropriate given his criminal history. It sentenced Flores-Gomez at the bottom of the post-departure guideline range. No evidence counters the reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1114 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201c[E]very sentence that a district court ultimately imposes must reflect its determination of what is reasonable in light of the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether that sentence is within or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 880, 169 L.Ed.2d 739 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Flores-Gomez\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-14\">. A departure occurs \"when a court reaches a sentence above or below the recommended Guidelines range through application of Chapters Four or Five of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099. 1101 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007). A variance occurs \"[w]hen a court enhances or detracts from the recommended range through application of \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
