Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the order of the immigration judge as petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed eight years late, and did not meet any of the regulatory exceptions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">To the extent petitioner challenges the decision of the BIA not to reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority, this court lacks jurisdiction to review that claim. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we dismiss that claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
