Appellees, former employees of the Appellant, initiated plans to open their own restaurants in Dest\u00edn, Florida, and Jackson, Mississippi. On August 31, 2006, Appellees registered the mark \u201cClark and Blake Brennan\u2019s Royal B\u201d for use in connection with their restaurants with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Appellant brought suit against Appellees pursuant to the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114 <em>&amp; </em>1125, for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Appellant also sought an injunction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116, to prohibit Appellees from using the name, or any name similar to, the \u201cBrennan\u2019s\u201d mark; selling, displaying, using, or advertising under the \u201cBrennan\u2019s\u201d mark or incorporating the \u201cBrennan\u2019s\u201d mark or any variation thereof; and engaging in unfair competition. The district court held that Appellant failed to satisfy the elements necessary to impose a preliminary injunction. Appellant timely filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We review the factual findings of the district court for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Hoover v. Morales, </em>164 F.3d 221, 224 (5th Cir.1998). Each of the four elements required to support a preliminary injunction presents mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Id. </em>The ultimate decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion, however a decision based on erroneous legal principles is reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing a trademark claim, a \u201cfinding of a likelihood of confusion is ... a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Westchester Media v. PRL USA Holdings, Inc., </em>214 F.3d 658, 665 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary equitable remedy that may be granted only if the plaintiff establishes four elements: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction might cause the defendant; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest. <em>Speaks v. Kruse, </em>445 F.3d 396, 399-400 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted). To succeed in a trademark infringement claim, a party must first show that it has a protectable right in the mark and, second, show that there is a likelihood of confusion between the marks. <em>See Sec. Ctr., Ltd. v. First Nat\u2019l Sec. Ctrs., </em>750 F.2d 1295, 1298 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Following limited discovery and a hearing, the district court found that Appellant failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits after considering the \u201cdigits of confusion.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece, </em>141 F.3d 188, 194 (5th Cir.1998). Specifically, the district court found that: 1) the \u201cBrennan\u2019s\u201d mark is weak due to the number of restaurants using the Brennan name; 2) the only similarity in the two marks is the name \u201cBrennan\u2019s,\u201d and differences in exemplars and the use of the Appellees\u2019 first names sufficiently distinguishes the marks; 3) any similarities between the parties\u2019 restaurants already exist between Appellant\u2019s restaurants and \u201ccountless other\u201d New Orleans and French Quarter restaurants, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>eluding restaurants opened by other Brennan family members, and that Appellees have not replicated Appellant\u2019s restaurant to an extent likely to cause confusion; 4) the parties are not in direct competition for customers due to the distances between the restaurants and the sophistication of the potential patrons; 5) the distances in between the restaurants would not likely result in advertising that misleads potential customers; 6) the Appellees did not intend to confuse or deceive the public; and 7) there was insufficient evidence of actual confusion by the public. The district court found that, with only one exception, Appellant has not suffered any confusion, loss of goodwill, or loss of reputation with any of the multiple Brennan family restaurants in operation in New Orleans and elsewhere.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court also held that Appellant failed to establish irreparable harm given the lack of evidence that Appellees\u2019 restaurant would threaten Appellant\u2019s reputation. Finally, the district court found that allowing Appellees to use their own last name in connection with their restaurant when there is a low likelihood of confusion would not disserve the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We find no error with the district court\u2019s findings and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction, thus the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We review the district court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ogle, </em>328 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir.2003). The district court denied Appellant\u2019s motion to exclude the expert testimony of Kenneth Germain. Appellant has offered no basis for this court to find that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s granting of Appellees\u2019 motion to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">. The non-exhaustive list of factors, or \"digits of confusion,\u201d includes: \"1) the type of trademark allegedly infringed; 2) the similarity between the two marks; 3) the similarity of the products or services; 4) the identity of the retail outlets and purchasers; 5) the identity of the advertising media used; 6) the defendants' intent; and 7) any evidence of actual confusion.\u201d <em>Elvis Presley Enters., </em>141 F.3d at 194.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">. For example, the district court heard testimony that Brennan's in Houston, specifically intended to replicate the Brennan\u2019s in New Orleans, created little to no confusion with, and had no effect on the reputation or goodwill of, the Brennan\u2019s in New Orleans.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
