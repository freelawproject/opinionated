California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We deny his motion because further action will be needed on behalf of Alamo. In accordance with the then mandatory nature of the Guidelines, the district court sentenced Alamo to 276 months of incarceration, followed by 10 years of supervised release. On direct appeal, we vacated his sentence and remanded to the district court in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, the District Court reimposed the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a) provides: \u201c[w]here, upon review of the district court record, trial counsel is persuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit, trial counsel may file a motion to withdraw and supporting brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California </em>... \u201d. <em>See also, United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We agree that there are no nonfrivilous issues for appeal. However, after Alamo\u2019s counsel filed his <em>Anders </em>brief, the Supreme Court decided <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558,169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), wherein the Court clarified that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the erack/powder disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes....\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 575. In addition, the United States Sentencing Commission has since adopted Amendment 706 modifying the Guideline ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Amendment 706 decreases the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Since the district court sentenced Alamo without the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough, </em>or the retroactive change in the Guidelines, we will dismiss the appeal without prejudice to Alamo\u2019s right to file an appropriate motion in the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We take no position regarding the propriety of any sentence the district court may decide to impose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
