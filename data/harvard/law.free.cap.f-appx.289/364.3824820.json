(Nova). He also appeals his unsuccessful motion for sanctions. Both issues arise from certain discovery conduct by Nova that Hirsch alleges was improper. Hirsch, a former dental student at Nova, sued the school alleging they had discriminated against him based on his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A jury found in favor of Nova. Hirsch then filed the Rule 60(b)(3) motion, arguing Nova engaged in misconduct when it misleadingly compiled a list of similarly situated students that Hirsch says was important to his theory at trial. He also sought sanctions. The district court denied both motions, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Hirsch matriculated at Nova\u2019s college of dentistry in Fall 2001. He failed one course his first semester and was placed on probation; he then failed three more courses in Winter 2002. During this time, he was diagnosed with ADHD, although he had not yet told Nova. His parents informed Nova after learning of the failures in May 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Because Hirsch demonstrated academic deficiency, he was referred to the Student Advancement Committee (SAC). According to the student handbook, Hirsch would have been subject to possible dismissal for failing four or more courses in a single year. Instead, he was allowed to take reexaminations in each of the four courses. He passed three, but failed the fourth. The school required that he repeat his first year. After sailing through the fall semester of his repeat year, Hirsch failed two courses during the Winter Term, including Physiology, the class he could not pass from the previous year. This time the school dismissed Hirsch.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">While all of this transpired, Hirsch and the school were discussing whether Hirsch was entitled to reasonable accommodations during his exams due to his ADHD. The details are unimportant for purposes of this appeal. Suffice to say Hirsch thought Nova treated him unfairly based on his ADHD, and so in January 2004 he filed suit under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, alleging discrimination due to his disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">During discovery, Hirsch sought certain information relating to other students who had failed classes and appeared before the SAC. Nova resisted, and a magistrate order was issued on February 11, 2005 compelling discovery. It stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">For each student who is identified in Student Advancement Committee meeting minutes as having failed one or more dental courses from August 1, 2000 to date, [Nova] shall identify each student by first year of enrollment and current enrollment status, the course(s) failed and the semester of each course failure, and for each such failure provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Committee\u2019s recommended action and actual disciplinary action taken by the Dean. [Nova] will protect the identity and gender of each student by assigning each student a letter or number identifier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Nova complied and produced a chart with each student identified by year of enrollment, their status (enrolled, not enrolled, dismissed, or graduated), the courses failed, the SAC\u2019s recommendation (re-examination, probation, or dismissal), and the dean\u2019s ultimate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Hirsch says he hoped to use this information, which he dubs the \u201cComparator Data,\u201d to establish that similarly situated students were treated differently from him. At trial, he attempted to introduce the Comparator Data as evidence, but Nova objected. Nova said the court could not know whether the students in the data were truly similarly situated persons, because Hirsch had not asked for \u2014 and had not received \u2014 information on whether the students had taken and passed re-examinations. Such information would be essential to meaningfully compare them with Hirsch.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">After hearing arguments from both sides, the district court kept the Comparator Data out, noting, \u201cYou got what you asked for, and [it was] within the strictures of [the order compelling discovery]. But I\u2019m not sure that what you got is particularly useful to you. I don\u2019t know that it proves what you want to prove, and I don\u2019t know that you asked for the right thing.\u201d The jury never saw the Comparator Data.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The judge did allow Hirsch to proffer what he would have produced had he been allowed to use the Comparator Data, and so Hirsch\u2019s counsel began questioning Dean Timothy Hottel about the data. During this questioning, Hottel revealed that many of the \u201cfailures\u201d identified on the chart were not actual failures in the common understanding of the word. Hot-tel distinguished between failures in didactic courses and failures in clinical courses, and he said that a student could receive a \u201cfailure\u201d in a clinical course for reasons beyond his or her control. For example, if there were insufficient patients upon which students could complete their course work, a student would receive a failure in the course. The student\u2019s failure would remain a failure until the clinical work was able to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">But the Comparator Data Nova provided to Hirsch did not distinguish between failures in a didactic course and temporary \u201cfailures\u201d in a clinical course \u2014 it listed them all as failures. Hirsch\u2019s counsel pressed Hottel on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">Q. When you reviewed the answers to interrogatories and you saw the codes, why didn\u2019t you add a separate code for clinical holdbacks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">A. Because I didn\u2019t think of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">Q. So your answer was incomplete?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">A. Well, it\u2019s complete in the data. It\u2019s just the interpretation of what a failure is in my mind and your mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">The trial continued, and the jury ultimately rejected Hirsch\u2019s claim. Specifically, the jury found Hirsch did not have a \u201cdisability\u201d as defined by the Court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">Hirsch timely sought relief from judgment and sanctions against Nova based on its response to Hirsch\u2019s request for the Comparator Data. Hirsch argued Nova engaged in misconduct when it failed to distinguish between clinical \u201cfailures\u201d and actual course failures in its discovery response. The district court denied Hirsch\u2019s motions, and Hirsch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">Hirsch argues the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>60(b)(3) motion because Hottel essentially admitted Nova included misleading information in the chart; specifically, Nova failed to distinguish between technical clinical failures and actual failures. Hirsch says this behavior amounts to the sort of misconduct covered by the rule because a fair reading of the discovery order would have required Nova to note the difference between genuine didactic course failures and technical clinical failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We review the denial of a Rule 60(b)(3) motion for relief from judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cox Nuclear Pharmacy, Inc. v. CTI, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 1303, 1314 (11th Cir.2007). Rule 60(b)(3) states: \u201cOn motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... fraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party....\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). Put another way, to prevail under Rule 60(b)(3), the moving party must show by clear and convincing evidence that the adverse party obtained the verdict by fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct. <em>Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriffs Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2003). In addition, the party must show the misconduct prevented him from fully and fairly presenting his case. <em>Id. </em>The failure to produce information called for by a discovery order can comprise the sort of \u201cmisconduct\u201d contemplated by Rule 60(b)(3). <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1339 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the question is whether Nova\u2019s response to the discovery order \u2014 which did not distinguish between actual failures and technical non-failure \u201cfailures\u201d \u2014 was a violation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The exact language of the discovery order is excerpted above. To be sure, Nova denies it engaged in any wrongful conduct and asserts its response to the discovery order was complete and honest. But we can assume, without deciding, that the language obligated Nova to distinguish between genuine failures and temporary clinical failures. We can assume this because Hirsch\u2019s argument fails for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">First, the transcript suggests the district court refused to admit the Comparator Data because it did not contain information on whether the students successfully passed re-examinations. Nova cannot be blamed for that omission, because they were not asked to disclose that information. The order did require Nova to list any students who had failures and appeared before the SAC, and it required disclosure of the courses failed, the action recommended by the SAC, the dean\u2019s ultimate action, and the students\u2019 current status. Nowhere did the order call for re-examination data. Hirsch himself failed four courses and successfully re-examined three, so re-examination data would have been essential for any meaningful comparative purposes. Nova cannot be blamed for Hirsch\u2019s failure to ask for re-examination data.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Second, the jury rejected Hirsch\u2019s claim on a basis unrelated to the Comparator Data. The jury specifically found Hirsch had not established his ADHD constituted a \u201cdisability\u201d under the law. No one disputes the Comparator Data is irrelevant to the question whether Hirsch\u2019s ADHD constituted a disability; the data would come into play only after Hirsch had proven a disability, when the data could then be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>used to show Nova discriminated against him. Thus, the jury never reached an issue where the absent Comparator Data would have been relevant to their decision. In other words, Hirseh would have had to prove a \u201cdisability\u201d regardless of whether the data was responsive to his discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Hirseh reminds us that our inquiry is not one of outcome-determinativeness: \u201c[Rule 60(b)(3) ] does not require that the information withheld be of such nature as to alter the result of the case.\u201d <em>Rozier, </em>573 F.2d at 1339 (\u201cThis subsection of the Rule is aimed at judgments which were unfairly obtained, not at those which are factually incorrect.\u201d). We do not quarrel with this proposition. But there was nothing unfair about Hirsch\u2019s unfavorable judgment; he simply did not prove to the jury he was disabled. The Comparator Data, even if disclosed exactly as Hirseh thinks he asked for it, would have been completely irrelevant to the question whether his ADHD constituted a disability. Hirseh \u201cfully and fairly presented] his case\u201d on whether he was disabled, <em>see id., </em>and he lost. The Comparator Data was irrelevant to this dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Although alteration of the result is not the touchstone of a Rule 60(b)(3) analysis, the moving party surely is obligated to demonstrate the relevance of the withheld evidence in light of the jury\u2019s explicit determination. <em>Cf. Rozier, </em>573 F.2d at 1345 (\u201cIt is apparent ... that the [withheld evidence] ... might have been the catalyst for an entirely different approach to the case on a theory that the plaintiff, lacking the document, let die before it reached the jury.\u201d). Hirseh cannot show his approach to a threshold, dispositive issue was impacted in any way by Nova\u2019s disclosures of the Comparator Data. Therefore, Hirseh was not prevented from fully and fairly litigating his case, and he is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Hirseh also argues he is entitled to monetary sanctions for Nova\u2019s abuse of discovery. We review the decision whether or not to award sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Coup., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1146-47 (11th Cir.2006). Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2), if a discovery order is violated the court should impose monetary sanctions unless the conduct was substantially justified or \u201cother circumstances\u201d would make an award unjust. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2). In addition, Rule 37(c)(1) permits a court to impose monetary sanctions for failures to disclose or supplement prior disclosures. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). \u201cRule 37 sanctions are intended to prevent unfair prejudice to the litigants and insure the integrity of the discovery process.\u201d <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir. 1999). The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Hirsch\u2019s motion for sanctions, which stated \u201cdefendant complied with its discovery obligations and plaintiff was not unfairly prejudiced by the alleged errors.\u201d We readily conclude neither holding was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In part II, we assumed, without deciding, that Nova\u2019s conduct was a violation of the discovery order. Here we look more closely at the order, and we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Nova did not violate its discovery obligations. The order requires disclosure of \u201ccourse(s) failed\u201d and \u201ceach course failure,\u201d and does not explicitly require Nova to distinguish between genuine failures and technical failures in the clinical work. In light of Hottel\u2019s testimony that the school \u201c[did not] consider any difference at the time the grades go out,\u201d we cannot say the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>abused its discretion in finding Nova met its discovery obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Hirsch was not prejudiced by any perceived failures in Nova\u2019s discovery disclosures. For the reasons discussed <em>supra </em>part II, Hirsch\u2019s unfavorable verdict did not relate to any issue implicating the Comparator Data, and he failed to request information necessary for drawing meaningful comparisons. Therefore, the district court was well within its discretion to deny sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\">. Hirsch also had a breach of contract claim against Nova, but Hirsch\u2019s counsel admitted at oral argument that the discovery response at issue here was relevant only to the Rehabilitation Act discrimination claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th. Cir.1981), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
