Black contends on appeal that the district court erred in determining her revocation sentence by considering a factor that was not permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">A sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release will be affirmed if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). We must initially determine the reasonableness of the revocation sentence by generally following the procedural and substantive considerations employed in a review of original sentences, \u201cwith some necessary modifications to take into account the unique nature of supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39. If the revocation sentence is not unreasonable, it will be affirmed; however, if the sentence is in some manner procedurally or substantively unreasonable, there must be a second determination of whether it is plainly so. <em>Id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">Black contends her sentence is plainly unreasonable because the district court impermissibly considered promoting respect for the law as a factor in fashioning its sentence. While a district court \u201cultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum,\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements as well as the statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e) (2000). Section 3583 approves consideration of a majority of the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), omitting only two. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Included among the omitted factors is the need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">The district court offered multiple reasons supporting its decision to impose an eighteen-month sentence. First, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>considered Black\u2019s serious medical condition that was both caused and exacerbated by continued substance abuse. The court noted that Black tested positive for cocaine while in the hospital and concluded that the medical care and substance abuse treatment she could receive while incarcerated would be in her best interest. Next, the court considered that this was the second time Black\u2019s term of supervised release had ended in failure. The court noted that the fifteen-month term of imprisonment imposed after Black\u2019s first revocation did not deter her from falling into a pattern of misconduct upon her release. Finally, the court considered the Government\u2019s recommendation that a term of imprisonment above the advisory guideline range be imposed, and stated: \u201cI think it is in the best interest of you to [serve eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment]. It also promotes respect for the law. There has been just utter disrespect for the probation office and the terms and conditions of supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Even assuming the district court improperly considered a factor not specifically permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), we nevertheless conclude that Black\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable. Here, the district court\u2019s focus at sentencing was on the potential to provide Black with much needed medical and substance abuse treatment. The court further focused on Black\u2019s history of failing to comply with the terms of supervised release. While the court referenced the omitted factor of promoting respect for the law, it tempered this reference by subsequently referring to the disrespect Black had specifically shown the probation office. Therefore, the district court primarily based the revocation sentence on permissible factors, rendering the resulting sentence not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>498 F.3d 393, 399-400 (6th Cir.2007) (rejecting a per se rule that consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) results in an unreasonable sentence, plainly or otherwise, and instead interpreting \u00a7 3583(e) as requiring consideration of the enumerated factors in \u00a7 3553(a) without forbidding consideration of other relevant factors), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Apr. 11, 2008) (No. 07-1295); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>443 F.3d 35, 47-48 (2d Cir.2006) (same); <em>cf. United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1182-83 (9th Cir.2006) (stating in dicta that while it did \u201cnot suggest that a mere reference to promoting respect for the law would in itself render a sentence unreasonable,\u201d it could result in reversible error if the record failed to establish that permissible factors were properly considered and formed the basis of the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
