On appeal, Carter challenges the calculation of his Guidelines range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Carter first asserts that the district court clearly erred in determining the amount of loss for which he was responsible. Specifically, he claims that many of the money orders attributed to him were insufficiently linked to him. We review the amount of loss, to the extent it is a factual matter, for clear error. <em>United States v. West, </em>2 F.3d 66, 71 (4th Cir.1993). This deferential standard of review requires reversal only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir. 2005). A sentencing court may consider any evidence that \u201chas a sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 6A1.3(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">Here, there was testimony at the sentencing hearing that all the money orders attributed to Carter met several criteria: (1) they were purchased in either California or South Carolina during a specific two-month period; (2) they were purchased for nominal amounts; (3) they were negotiated in North or South Carolina; and (4) they were altered by exactly $900. In addition, most were traced directly back to Carter by interviews with the purchasers or negotiators. We find that this testimony was sufficient to show by a preponderance of the evidence that each of the money orders attributed to Carter was a foreseeable part of the conspiracy. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in adopting the calculation of loss in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">Carter next argues that, because some of the banks were reimbursed for their losses from the people who negotiated the altered money orders, these banks did not suffer a loss and should, therefore, not be considered victims for Guidelines pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>poses. In support, Carter cites to <em>United States v. Yogar, </em>404 F.3d 967, 971 (6th Cir.2005), which held that an individual suffering a monetary loss that was short-lived and immediately covered by a third party is not a victim for sentencing purposes. Carter did not raise this issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Under the Guidelines, a \u201cvictim\u201d is \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. (n.l). \u201cActual loss\u201d is in turn defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. (n.3 (A)(i)). A defendant is only entitled to a credit against loss where money or property is returned \u201cby the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant, to the victim before the offense was detected.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. (n.3 (E)(i)). Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit held that a defendant who is entitled to credit by definition has caused an initial loss to a third party, thus making the third party a victim, albeit a reimbursed victim. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 895 (11th Cir.2005) (criticizing and distinguishing <em>Yagar). </em>We have not addressed the question of the reimbursed victim, and we decline to do so at this juncture because, even applying <em>Yager, </em>Carter is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Here, there was no evidence that the reimbursements were made immediately or prior to the time the offense was detected. To the contrary, according to Carter\u2019s brief and the evidence at trial, some of the repayments were made by court order (clearly AFTER the offense was detected), some were not complete, and none were alleged to have been made in conjunction with Carter. Given the lack of argument or evidence from Carter at the sentencing hearing and the lack of agreement amongst the courts that have looked at this issue, we conclude that the district court did not commit either significant procedural error or plain error in counting victims \u2022 who had subsequently been reimbursed by third parties. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (holding that error is \u201cplain\u201d when it is \u201cclear under current law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Finally, Carter argues that the victims listed in the presentence report, but not mentioned at trial, were not specifically linked to him. The presentence report included a detailed report of all the money orders involved in the case. According to the report, the conspiracy, of which Carter was a driving force, passed money orders to sixteen financial institutions. There was testimony at the sentencing hearing that these money orders were included because they all fit the specific, detailed pattern of the conspiracy. Carter did not challenge the accuracy of the report and failed to provide any evidence that any of the money orders which had been included in his relevant conduct were included incorrectly. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s conclusion that there were more than ten victims was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201cA mere objection to the finding in the presentence report is not sufficient.... Without an affirmative showing the information is inaccurate, the court is free to adopt the findings of the [presentence report] without more specific inquiry or explanation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Carter\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
