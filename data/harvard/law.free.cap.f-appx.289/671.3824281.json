United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court then considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-18\">Because Nicoli did not challenge either the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence imposed or the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, these issues should be reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2008). Nicoli contends for the purpose of preserving the issue for further review that <em>Peltier </em>was wrongly decided and that he should not have been required to object specifically to the reasonableness of his sentence in order to preserve the issue for review. However, this court is bound by its decision in <em>Peltier </em>until it is changed by this court acting en banc or until the Supreme Court clearly holds or teaches to the contrary. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">Nicoli has not shown that the district court plainly erred by failing to sufficiently state its reasons for sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>See Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 806. The district court\u2019s adoption of the presentence report and its statement that it had considered Nicoli\u2019s arguments for a downward departure and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining his within-guidelines sentence constituted sufficient reasons for imposing his sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Nicoli also has not shown that the district court plainly erred in imposing a sentence that was substantively unreasonable. Nicoli\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462. Although Nicoli contends that the district court did not take into account certain mitigating factors, Nicoli made these arguments at sentencing, and the district court stated that it had taken into consideration these arguments, as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in sentencing him. Nicoli also argues that his sentence did not meet the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) requirement that it reflect the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide just punishment because the 16-level increase in his offense level based on his prior convictions of armed robbery caused his sentence for an \u201cinternational trespass violation\u201d to be more severe than the sentences for other more serious crimes. However, a district court\u2019s refusal to deviate from the guidelines range based on the severity of a guidelines provision has not been held to be unreasonable. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 570-76, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Nicoli also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
