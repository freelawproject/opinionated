McKenzie appeals the final decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) affirming the denial by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) of his claim for entitlement to service connection for his post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). <em>McKenzie v. Peake, </em>No. 06-2108, 2008 WL 373231 (VetApp. Jan 15, 2008). We <em>affrnwt,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">Mr. McKenzie served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1970 to January 1972, with service in the Republic of Vietnam. He was diagnosed with PTSD in October 2001. Mr. McKenzie\u2019s medical records indicate that he reported experiencing several stressors during his service in Vietnam, including his shooting and killing a Vietnamese citizen while performing guard duty and his being victim to an enemy attack at a noncommissioned officers club.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">In December 2001, Mr. McKenzie filed a claim for entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) disability compensation based upon his PTSD. Under VA regulations, service connection for PTSD requires (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD, (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor aetual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ly occurred, and (3) medical evidence establishing a nexus between the claimed in-service stressor and the current symptoms of the PTSD. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f). Combat related stressors may in certain cases be established by the veteran\u2019s own lay testimony, whereas stressors unrelated to combat require additional corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.304(f)(1); <em>Nat\u2019l Org. Of Veterans\u2019 Advocates, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y of Veterans Affairs, </em>330 F.3d 1345, 1351 (Fed.Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The VA Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) denied service connection for PTSD in a May 2002 rating decision. On review, the Board remanded Mr. McKenzie\u2019s claim for PTSD and instructed the RO to attempt to verify his alleged in-service stressors. When the matter was returned to the Board, it concluded that the criteria for service connection for PTSD had not been met. In particular, the Board determined that although Mr. McKenzie had been diagnosed with PTSD, \u201che did not engage in combat and there are no service records or other supporting documents corroborating the occurrence of any of [his] alleged in-service stressful experiences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On appeal to the Veterans Court, Mr. McKenzie argued that the Board erred in denying service connection for PTSD because, among other things, it failed to consider his \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d as a relevant stressor. He pointed to a March 18, 2003 letter, wherein Edwin Hoeper, M.D. relayed findings from a psychiatric evaluation of Mr. McKenzie. In the letter, Dr. Hoeper (1) summarized the patient history that Mr. McKenzie gave to him, (2) discussed the symptoms reported by Mr. McKenzie, and (3) concluded that Mr. McKenzie suffered from chronic PTSD. Mr. McKenzie argued that the Board erred by failing to account for the following statements contained in the March 18 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">He served in the Army from 1970 to 1972. He served in Viet Nam for 10 months in a transportation unit as a land-craft crewman. <em>He also had frequent guard duty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">(emphasis added). Mr. McKenzie explained that the Board\u2019s decision did not mention this evidence regarding \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d in analyzing his claim for service connection for PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The Veterans Court noted that the Board was not required to discuss all evidence of record in its decisions; it was only required to discuss all relevant evidence. With respect to the mention of Mr. McKenzie\u2019s \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d in the March 18 letter, the court determined that Dr. Hoeper \u201c[did] not indicate that it was the source of, or a contributing factor to, [Mr. McKenzie\u2019s] PTSD.\u201d In other words, the court concluded that the Board was not required to explicitly address Dr. Hoe-per\u2019s statement regarding \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d because nothing in the record suggested a nexus between it and Mr. McKenzie\u2019s PTSD symptoms, making it irrelevant to the issue of whether Mr. McKenzie\u2019s PTSD was service connected. Accordingly, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Our authority to review decisions of the Veterans Court is governed by statute. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c), we have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under this section, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d However, \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that an appeal under this chapter presents a constitutional issue, [we] may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On appeal to this court, Mr. McKenzie again argues that the Board erred in failing to discuss his alleged \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d as a relevant stressor. He contends that the Veterans Court and Board misinterpreted 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(a) and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.7, which require decisions of the Board to be based on a review of the entire record. In addition, he apparently argues that the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d principles set forth in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b) apply to the determination of whether the Board considered the entire record \u2014 i.e., that when it is unclear whether the Board considered the entire record, he should be afforded the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d that it did not do so. Finally, he requests that we grant him service connection for PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We cannot conclude that the Veterans Court misinterpreted any statute or regulation. The court did not, as Mr. McKenzie alleges, hold that the Board was not required to <em>consider </em>all of the evidence of record. Indeed, the court concluded as a factual matter: \u201cIt is clear from the decision on appeal that the Board considered all of the medical evidence of record. ...\u201d The court merely noted that the Board was not required to <em>discuss </em>all of the evidence of record, which is fully consistent with our jurisprudence. <em>See, e.g., Lowder v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>504 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2007). Nor is Mr. McKenzie entitled to the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d that the Board failed to consider any evidence not explicitly discussed in its decision. Quite the contrary, it is presumed that the Board has considered the entire record in reaching its decision unless specific evidence indicates otherwise. <em>See Gonzales v. West, </em>218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201c[W]e hold that absent specific evidence indicating otherwise, all evidence contained in the record at the time of the RO\u2019s determination of the service connection must be presumed to have been reviewed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and no further proof of such review is needed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court\u2019s conclusion that the Board did not err when it failed to discuss \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d as a relevant stressor. That is because such a review would involve the application of law to fact \u2014 i.e., it would require us to review the court\u2019s factual determination that there was no indication in the March 18 letter of a nexus between Mr. McKenzie\u2019s \u201cfrequent guard duty\u201d and his PTSD symptoms. We do not have jurisdiction to consider issues involving the Veterans Court\u2019s application of law to the particular facts of Mr. McKenzie\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Cook v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 937, 938-41 (Fed.Cir.2003) (concluding that we did not have jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court\u2019s decision not to remand in light of an alleged failure of the Board to consider certain facts in the record, where the Veterans Court determined that the omission was not erroneous because the omitted facts were \u201cneither favorable nor unfavorable\u201d to the veteran\u2019s claim for benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the final decision of the Veterans Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">. This includes Mr. McKenzie's argument in his reply brief that, under <em>Kirwin v. Brown, </em>8 Vet.App. 148 (1995), the March 18 letter should be construed in his favor because it is \u201cambiguous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
