Laredo-Mendez argues that his prior California robbery conviction under CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 is not a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Laredo-Mendez acknowledges that this court held that a California robbery conviction is a crime of violence in <em>United States v. Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d 813, 814 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(June 16, 2008) (No. 07-11483). However, he argues that <em>TellezMartinez </em>was incorrectly decided. A panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of intervening contrary or superseding authority by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). This issue is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the motion for extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b857-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
