Wagner, challenges his convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and for unlawfully possessing an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871. Specifically, he argues that his convictions must be vacated because the district court erroneously denied his request for an evidentiary healing and his motion to suppress the evidence against him. We find no basis for disturbing Wagner\u2019s conviction, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">During the week of September 3, 2006, The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agents, with the help of a confidential informant (Cl), arranged for a controlled buy of crack cocaine from Wagner. The Cl told ATF agents that he had witnessed Wagner trafficking drugs in the past and had seen Wagner in possession of firearms. The Cl identified Wagner\u2019s photo and provided agents with Wagner\u2019s address and vehicle information. ATF agents independently corroborated the Cl\u2019s information by contacting Wagner\u2019s parole officer and a postal inspector, and obtained information on Wagner\u2019s previous firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Sometime around September 6, 2006, the Cl, wearing an electronic monitoring device, met Wagner in the parking lot of Wagner\u2019s apartment complex. The Cl handed cash to Wagner, who stated that he had to go up to his apartment and would return shortly. Upon returning to the parking lot, Wagner handed the Cl a quantity of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">On September 8, 2006, ATF agents applied for a warrant to search Wagner\u2019s apartment for drug trafficking items. In the affidavit accompanying the request, an ATF agent detailed the foregoing information regarding the Cl, the controlled buy, and the agent\u2019s independent investigation. On September 13, 2006, officers executed the issued search warrant. As the officers were approaching Wagner\u2019s apartment building, they encountered Wagner in the parking lot, stopped him, and ordered him back into the apartment. Officers handcuffed Wagner and detained him for the duration of the search, which turned up a .38-ealiber revolver, ammunition, a 16-gauge sawed-off shotgun, and miscellaneous drugs and drug trafficking paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">In October 2006, an indictment issued against Wagner, charging him with two firearms violations. Wagner filed a motion to suppress the evidence, and requested an evidentiary hearing. The district court denied both the request for an evidentiary hearing and the motion to suppress. Wagner then entered into a conditional plea agreement, offering to plead guilty to the charges in the indictment, and reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The district court accepted Wagner\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">Wagner first argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied him an evidentiary hearing regarding the constitutionality of his detention during the execution of the search warrant. Specifically, Wagner contends that officers ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>rested him in the parking lot of his apartment complex without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>Abdus-Samad v. Bell, </em>420 F.3d 614, 626 (6th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 380, 166 L.Ed.2d 269 (2006). We review factual findings for clear error and the legal conclusion of whether a seizure occurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment <em>de novo. United States v. Buchanon, </em>72 F.3d 1217, 1223 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Wagner maintains that he presented a sufficient factual basis to warrant an evidentiary hearing regarding the constitutionality of his detention. Wagner bears the burden of demonstrating that there are contested issues of fact that might be resolved at an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Abboud, </em>438 F.3d 554, 577 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 446, 166 L.Ed.2d 309 (2006). The only issue Wagner disputes is that he was \u201carrested\u201d and not \u201cdetained,\u201d which is not a question of fact, but a question of law. Because Wagner failed to present any factual disputes, we think the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wagner\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\"When officers execute a search warrant at a suspect\u2019s home, they enjoy an implicit, limited authority to detain the occupants at the premises \u2014 even with handcuffs \u2014 without making an arrest. <em>Muehler v. Mena, </em>544 U.S. 93, 98-99, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005). An officer\u2019s right to detain a suspect who is in the process of leaving his home when the officer arrives to execute a valid search warrant is not limited by the suspect\u2019s geographic proximity to his house; rather, police may detain a suspect as soon as is practicable under the circumstances. <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>939 F.2d 337, 339 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Here, the officers preparing to execute the search warrant encountered Wagner in the parking lot of his apartment complex. Before executing the search, the officers used reasonable force to effectuate Wagner\u2019s detention: They handcuffed him and escorted him back into his apartment, where he was detained for the duration of the search. We agree with the district court that the actions of the officers constituted a detention, not an arrest, and we see no violation of the Fourth Amendment arising out of these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">Wagner argues that the district court erred by denying his request for a hearing under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">A defendant is entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing on the veracity of a search warrant affidavit if he makes a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing that specified portions of the affiant\u2019s averments are deliberately or recklessly false <em>and ... </em>[that] a finding of probable cause would not be supported by the remaining content of the affidavit when the allegedly false material is set to one side.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>878 F.2d 170, 171 (6th Cir.1989) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a <em>Franks </em>hearing, we apply \u201cthe same standard as for the denial of a motion to suppress: the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error and its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Graham, </em>275 F.3d 490, 505 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">Warrant affidavits carry a \u201cpresumption of validity\u201d and the challenger\u2019s attack must focus on statements made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>affiant, and not statements the affiant states were made by a nongovernmental informant. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Wagner does not allege that the affiant made any false statements in the affidavit. Instead, he devotes his argument to the credibility of the Cl, and the ATF agent\u2019s failure to identify the Cl in the affidavit. Because he fails to show that specific portions of the affiant\u2019s averments are deliberately or recklessly false, we think the district court correctly concluded that Wagner was not entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Finally, Wagner argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant because, he argues, the affidavit presented to the magistrate judge did not demonstrate the requisite probable cause to support issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo, United States v. Foster, </em>376 F.3d 577, 583 (6th Cir.2004), viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Coffee, </em>434 F.3d 887, 892 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">A magistrate judge reviewing an application for a search warrant must consider the totality of the circumstances and \u201cmake a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Probable cause may derive from information provided by a Cl, so long as the information is \u201csufficiently detailed and corroborated by the independent investigation of law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Lumpkin, </em>159 F.3d 983, 986 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, we think the magistrate judge had a substantial basis to conclude that there was a fair probability that contraband would be found in Wagner\u2019s apartment. The affidavit in support of the search warrant contained adequate detail regarding the controlled buy and substantially corroborated information provided by the Cl, which was enough to support the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
