Bennett appeals the district court\u2019s judgment sentencing him to ten months\u2019 imprisonment and twenty-six months\u2019 supervised release after finding he violated terms of his supervised release. The term of imprisonment was within the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of imprisonment. Bennett\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there exist no meritorious grounds for appeal and conceding the sentence was reasonable. Bennett was notified of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief but chose not to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). In making this determination, we first consider whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable, and if so, whether it is \u201cplainly\u201d so. <em>Id. </em>While the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">We find no error with respect to the district court\u2019s decision to revoke Bennett\u2019s supervised release and sentence him to a term of ten months\u2019 imprisonment. There was also no error with respect to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines in determining Bennett\u2019s advisory guidelines range of imprisonment. Likewise, we find no error with the direction that Bennett serve five months of his supervised release in a residential reentry program.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-17\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Bennett\u2019s supervised release and imposing a ten month sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
