The district court sentenced Flores-Sanchez to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Flores-Sanchez argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level upward adjustment based on his prior Wisconsin conviction for false imprisonment. He contends that under Wisconsin law, false imprisonment is not a crime of violence as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, and so there was no basis for the adjustment. Because Flores-Sanchez waived this argument, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-25\">Flores-Sanchez was removed from the United States on December 3, 2004. He returned without permission and was found in Madison, Wisconsin, on May 2, 2007. The next month a grand jury in the Western District of Wisconsin returned an indictment against Flores-Sanchez, charging him with having been found in the United States after having been removed. He pleaded guilty the following September.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-26\">The probation officer recommended a 16-level upward adjustment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on Flores-Sanchez\u2019s 2004 conviction under a Wisconsin statute providing that \u201c[wjhoever intentionally confines or restrains another without the person\u2019s consent and with knowledge that he or she has no lawful authority to do so is guilty of a Class H felony.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.30. Flores-Sanchez objected, arguing that \u201cthe Wisconsin false imprisonment statute does not constitute a crime of violence\u201d under the guidelines. For an offense to qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b), Flores-Sanchez maintained, the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d must be an element of the offense. The Government responded that Flores-Sanchez\u2019s crime was indeed a crime of violence because the judgment of conviction showed that he was convicted of unlawfully \u201crestrain[ing]\u201d another, rather than simply \u201cconfining\u201d her, and thus the crime of which he was convicted necessarily involved the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">At sentencing, after the Government explained its position to the court, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">MR. CARRANZA: Judge, I guess briefly I would just state that before going on the record Mr. O\u2019Shea and I did discuss the issue raised by my objection and he did provide to me or share with me those documents that he just tendered to the Court. I think I would agree at that point \u2014 at this point the exhibit, especially with the information that my client entered a plea to, clarifies things to the point where I would agree with Mr. O\u2019Shea there is no longer any ambiguity as to whether at least the false imprisonment conviction that Mr. Flores-Sanchez has on his record qualifies as a criminal violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-6\">THE COURT: And would you then withdraw your objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">MR. CARRANZA: I would, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-8\">THE COURT: Does the Defendant, Mr. Sanchez, do you withdraw your objection that has previously been stated by your attorney to the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-9\">INTERPRETER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">After noting that Flores-Sanchez\u2019s objection to the 16-level increase had been withdrawn, the court sentenced Flores-Sanchez to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, in the middle of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Flores-Sanchez raises only one issue: whether the district court erred in determining that his state conviction for false imprisonment constituted a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Flores-Sanchez waived this argument, and so his sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">\u201c Waiver occurs when a criminal defendant intentionally relinquishes a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Clements, </em>522 F.3d 790, 793 (7th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Brodie, </em>507 F.3d 527, 530 (7th Cir.2007)). \u201cThe touchstone of waiver is a knowing and intentional decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>529 F.3d 390, 394 (7th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Jaimes-Jaimes, </em>406 F.3d 845, 848 (7th Cir.2005)). Waiver \u201cextinguishes any error and precludes appellate review.\u201d <em>Bro-die, </em>507 F.3d at 530; <em>United States v. Haddad, </em>462 F.3d 783, 793 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Murry, </em>395 F.3d 712, 717 (7th Cir.2005). \u201cWe have found waiver where either a defendant or his attorney expressly declined to press a right or to make an objection.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, 243 F.3d </em>411, 416 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">Both Flores-Sanchez and his attorney wei\u2019e asked by the district court if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>withdrew the objection to the 16-level upward adjustment, and each responded that they did. Flores-Sanchez knowingly and intentionally relinquished his right to challenge the applicability of the adjustment. Because he did so, there is nothing left for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Shortly before this case was orally argued, another panel of this court decided <em>United States v. Billups, </em>536 F.3d 574 (7th Cir.2008). <em>Billups </em>held that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.30 \u2014 the same Wisconsin false imprisonment statute at issue in this case \u2014 is a crime of violence for purposes of determining whether a defendant is a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The career offender guideline, however, differs markedly from \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline at issue here. Both guidelines define \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d subject to certain qualifications, as an \u201coffense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d see U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. (l)(B)(iii); 4B1.2(a)(l). But only the career criminal guideline \u2014 not the illegal re-entry guideline \u2014 adds that a crime of violence is <em>also </em>any felony that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2); <em>Billups, </em>536 F.3d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\"><em>Billups </em>held that a conviction under \u00a7 940.30 \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another,\u201d but it held that \u00a7 940.30 did not have as an element the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d <em>Billups, </em>536 F.3d at 577. <em>Billups </em>thus rejected the interpretation of \u00a7 2L1.2 adopted by the Government at Flores-Sanchez\u2019s sentencing hearing. If he had not waived the point, Flores-Sanchez may have had a valid argument that the district court miscalculated the advisory guideline range for his sentence. Recognizing that the Government had the option of standing on the waiver or foregoing it, we asked at oral argument which course the Government wished to take. It responded that it wished to stand on the waiver and, if necessary, litigate the sentencing issue after Flores-Sanchez files a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for ineffective assistance of counsel (as he almost assuredly will).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Flores-Sanchez\u2019s sentence is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
