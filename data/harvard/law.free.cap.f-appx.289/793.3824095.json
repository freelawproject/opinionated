The district court sentenced Leach to 140 months of imprisonment, which was the minimum sentence under the advisory guidelines range. Four days after Leach\u2019s sentencing, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the Sentencing Guidelines, lowering the base offense levels for offenses involving crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">After briefing was completed in this case, Leach moved to dismiss appointed counsel and proceed pro se on appeal. Leach\u2019s assertion of her right to self-representation is untimely. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir. 1998). Leach\u2019s motion to dismiss counsel and proceed pro se is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Leach argues for the first time on appeal that her sentence should be vacated and the case should be remanded for re-sentencing in light of the amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. Because Leach did not ask the sentencing court to consider the pending amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007). The district court imposed the sentence pursuant to an advisory guidelines range that was properly calculated based on the Guidelines that were in effect at the time Leach was sentenced. <em>United States v. Rodarte-Vasquez, </em>488 F.3d 316, 322 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>167 F.3d 889, 893 (5th Cir.1999)); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(a), (b)(1). Accordingly, the district court did not err by failing to consider the effect of the then-pending amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. Our review does not preclude future consideration of this issue in a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Fields, </em>72 F.3d 1200, 1215 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">Leach also argues for the first time on appeal that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and because the district court imposed the sentence without engaging in a significant and meaningful analysis of the mitigation evidence she presented. Leach\u2019s argument is unavailing. The district court\u2019s sentence is within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range and is, therefore, presumptively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentencing is not required to address every \u00a7 3553(a) factor specifically and analyze its application to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-19\">The district court heard counsel\u2019s arguments in support of a sentence below that recommended by the guidelines, which included a discussion of her family support and her physically abusive marriage. Thereafter, the district court gave a thorough explanation for its decision to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. The transcript shows that the district court adequately considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, Leach has not shown that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
