In particular, Martin alleges a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction, urges that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to give a requested jury instruction, and faults the district court\u2019s sentence. Clark asserts that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions were improper, and claims prejudice from allegedly incorrect applications of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2003). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">Clark, Martin, and seven co-defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury with conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute over 500 grams of a mixture containing methamphetamine from approximately 1997 until 2004. Martin was also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. At trial, the government presented testimony from law enforcement officers and cooperating defendants alleging a criminal organization through which co-conspirator Sergio Solis imported large amounts of methamphetamine from Mexico, and distributed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>narcotic to individuals including Clark and co-defendant Michael Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Solis testified that he provided Clark half-pound amounts of methamphetamine every week for three or four months, and witnessed Holland sell Clark four-ounce quantities of methamphetamine on at least ten occasions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Solis also claimed that Clark participated in the transportation of six pounds of methamphetamine from Mexico in 2002, and stored one to four pounds of methamphetamine five or six times. In all, the government urged that Clark was responsible for no less than 14,052.8 grams of a mixture including methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Holland testified that he supplied one-quarter pound amounts of methamphetamine to Martin on a weekly basis for eighteen months from the summer of 2001 through early 2003. Martin was claimed by conspirator Tom White to be involved in meetings with other conspirators to advance the methamphetamine distribution operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Officers searched Martin\u2019s residence twice during the alleged conspiracy. On May 1, 1998, they recovered forty-two grams of methamphetamine, containers of a methamphetamine cutting agent, a scale, and multiple firearms from his home. On June 29, 2004, the searching officers found drug paraphernalia, a small amount of methamphetamine, two sets of scales, two shotguns, several hundred rounds of ammunition for a handgun, forty to fifty plastic baggies, $5,795 in cash, and a partial recipe for manufacturing methamphetamine. The government argued that Martin was responsible for no less than 7,392 grams of a mixture of methamphetamine, an amount that resulted from an incorrect calculation of half of the weekly purchase of one-quarter pound amounts of methamphetamine for eighteen months. Martin\u2019s counsel raised the prosecutor\u2019s mathematical error during his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">The trial court instructed the jurors about the elements necessary to prove a drug trafficking conspiracy, largely adopting the language of Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Charge 2.89. However, the court denied Martin\u2019s request for a \u201cbuyer-seller\u201d instruction, which would have indicated that a defendant cannot be convicted of conspiracy based solely on evidence of being a buyer or seller of narcotics. The court submitted a special verdict form, asking the jury to \u201cdetermine the quantity of methamphetamine or a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, if any, attributable to each defendant.\u201d The jury found Clark, Martin, and another co-defendant guilty of the narcotics conspiracy, and convicted Martin of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Clark was held responsible for 14,052.8 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine; 6,224.4 grams was attributed to Martin; and their co-defendant was deemed responsible for 597.9 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">At Clark\u2019s and Martin\u2019s sentencings, the trial court adopted the findings of fact contained in the Presentence Investigation Reports, which included as relevant conduct the methamphetamine amounts determined by the trial jury. Overruling Clark\u2019s objection, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">Of course, one of your objections is about the quantity of the drugs. The jury heard all of that evidence and the jury made a finding about the quantity of drugs that this Defendant was responsible for and I cannot fault the jury\u2019s finding in that regard. I think the evidence supported it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Based on the drug quantity, the district court calculated a Guidelines sentencing range of 292 to 365 months imprisonment for Clark. However, the court imposed a below-Guidelines sentence of 236 months imprisonment, explaining that it was reasonable considering \u201call of the factors\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly Clark\u2019s age and the small likelihood of recidivism upon release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">At Martin\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court (1) overruled Martin\u2019s objection that the jury\u2019s drug quantity finding was unreliable due to inadequate instructions in the special verdict form; (2) determined that the mathematical error during closing argument did not affect the quantity determination; and (3) held Martin responsible for the 6,224.4 grams of methamphetamine found by the jury. The court\u2019s calculations resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of 262 to 327 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 190 months of imprisonment, explaining that it had considered the sentences of \u201cever[y] other defendant in this case,\u201d as well as Martin\u2019s age and the other sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">A. Martin\u2019s Speedy Trial Act Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We first address Martin\u2019s claim that his conviction should be vacated due to a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 (1990). Whether a district court has complied with the Speedy Trial Act is a matter of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Jackson, 30 </em>F.3d 572, 575 n. 2 (5th Cir.1994). The Speedy Trial Act requires that a defendant be tried within seventy non-excludable days from the date he appears before a judicial officer of the court in which the charge is pending. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1), (h). However, a defendant\u2019s failure to move for dismissal prior to trial constitutes a waiver of the right to dismissal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2) (1975). Here, Martin acquiesced to the district court\u2019s grant of a co-defendant\u2019s motion to continue, and did not object to the court\u2019s finding of excludable time under an \u201cends of justice\u201d analysis. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Martin entirely failed to assert a speedy trial violation until after his guilty verdict and subsequent sentencing. Accordingly, any violation of the Speedy Trial Act was waived. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 420 (5th Cir.2006) (because of failure to assert speedy trial rights until after the verdict, section 3162 \u201cmanifestly provides that Appellants have waived the right to dismissal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">B. Martin\u2019s Sufficiency Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Martin next asks us to reverse the jury\u2019s conspiracy verdict for insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Martin preserved his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Payne, </em>99 F.3d 1273, 1278 (5th Cir.1996). Sufficiency is considered \u201cin the light most favorable to the jury verdict,\u201d and we should affirm \u201cif a rational trier of fact could find that the government proved all essential elements beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>117 F.3d 255, 258 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>174 F.3d 515, 522 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 669-70 (5th Cir. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Martin was convicted of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of a mixture containing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1988). To establish Martin\u2019s guilt for the conspiracy charged in count one of the indictment, the government must have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) there was an agreement between two or more persons to distribute or possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine; (2) Martin knew of the conspiracy and intended to join it; and (3) he voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 768-69 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 297, 169 L.Ed.2d 212, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 869, 169 L.Ed.2d 736 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The government submitted evidence that Martin received well over 500 grams of methamphetamine from conspirator Randall Thomas Clark during an eighteen month period; that he participated in meetings to advance the goals of the broader narcotics distribution conspiracy; and that two searches of his residence recovered methamphetamine, items consistent with drug sales (including baggies, cutting agent, and scales), cash, firearms, and large amounts of ammunition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">Martin argues that such trial testimony was insufficient to tie him to the crime, that no evidence was submitted that he sold narcotics during the conspiracy, and that the testimony of cooperating defendants was biased and unreliable. However, the weight and credibility of the evidence are the sole province of the jury. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>961 F.2d 1169, 1173 (5th Cir.1992). \u201cAs long as it is not factually insubstantial or incredible, the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator, even one who has chosen to cooperate with the government in exchange for non-prosecution or leniency, may be constitutionally sufficient evidence to convict.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 872-73 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Westbrook, </em>119 F.3d 1176, 1190 (5th Cir.1997)). Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, the testimony of Holland, substantiated by the evidence recovered from Martin\u2019s residence, amply supports the finding that Martin was guilty of all elements required to prove his participation in the methamphetamine conspiracy. We therefore conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Martin was guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">C. Martin\u2019s Challenge to Denial of a Buyer-Seller Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">Martin next challenges the district court\u2019s jury instructions, and specifically faults the court\u2019s refusal to provide a \u201cbuyer-seller\u201d instruction in the jury charge. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>discretion. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>12 F.3d 1350, 1365 (5th Cir.1994). A district court abuses its considerable discretion by denying a defendant\u2019s request when (1) the proposed instruction is substantially correct; (2) it was not substantially covered in the charge as a whole; and (3) omission of the requested instruction \u201cseriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present a given defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Cain, </em>440 F.3d 672, 674 (5th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Martin correctly observes that evidence of a buyer-seller relationship is not, by itself, sufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy. <em>United States v. Maseratti, </em>1 F.3d 330, 336 (5th Cir.1993). However, Martin\u2019s broader argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>491 F.3d 237, 241-42 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1219, 170 L.Ed.2d 75 (2008); <em>United States v. Asibor, </em>109 F.3d 1023, 1035 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>12 F.3d at 1365-66. In <em>Mata, </em>the trial court refused to give a buyer-seller instruction, because the jury charge contained a conspiracy instruction tracking Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 2.89. <em>Id. </em>at 242. Since that instruction adequately summarized the law of conspiracy and covered the proposed buyer-seller language, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to give the jury the additional buyer-seller instruction. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Asibor, </em>we explained, \u201c[s]o long as the jury instruction given by the court accurately reflects the law on conspiracy, this court will conclude that the buyer-seller relationship has also been adequately covered.\u201d <em>Asibor, </em>109 F.3d at 1035. As in <em>Mata </em>and <em>Asibor, </em>the district court here provided a correct definition of conspiracy to guide the jury in its deliberations. <em>See Mata, </em>491 F.3d at 242 (Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 2.89 \u201cis clearly an adequate instruction on the law of conspiracy\u201d). Had the jury concluded that Martin was merely a buyer or seller, the elements necessary to prove a conspiracy would be lacking, and Martin would have been found not guilty. <em>Maseratti, </em>1 F.3d at 336. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing Martin\u2019s requested buyer-seller instruction, and did not err by providing Pattern Jury Instruction 2.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">D. Clark\u2019s and Martin\u2019s Challenges to the Special Verdict Form</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Clark and Martin fault the district court for failing to elaborate on the meaning of \u201cattributable\u201d in the special verdict form, and for neglecting to require a jury finding of foreseeable drug amounts. Such complaints regarding the special verdict form reveal no error. Whether or not the jury understood the concept of foreseeability, it is the judge, not the jury, who determines relevant conduct for the purposes of Guidelines sentencing. <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 511, 513-14, 118 S.Ct. 1475, 140 L.Ed.2d 703 (1998); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Although the special interrogatory was a reasonable manner of ascertaining relevant conduct prior to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a jury finding of drug quantity beyond a' reasonable doubt was not required by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) \u00a7 2.89, application note (2001) (citing <em>United States v. Keith, </em>230 F.3d 784, 787 (5th Cir.2000)) <em>(Apprendi </em>doctrine inapplicable to court\u2019s determination of each conspirator\u2019s liability, because the sentences did not exceed the statutory maximum). The reliability of the facts found by the district court and reasonableness of the resulting sentence do not require that the jury understood the meaning of \u201cattributable,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>fully appreciated the Guidelines definition of foreseeability. Accordingly, any error in such a charge is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">E. Sentencing Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">1. Procedural</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Clark and Martin contest the district court\u2019s reliance on the jury\u2019s drug quantity findings, alleging error in the determination of the applicable base offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and review factual findings at sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Yi, </em>460 F.3d 623, 635 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The Supreme Court has structured our sentencing review as a two-step process. First, we are to review the sentencing process for \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We require a district court to provide adequate justifications so that our review is meaningful and sentencing is perceived as fair. <em>See id. </em>An \u201cunusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence\u201d requires the district court to explain why its conclusion \u201cis appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. Second, we are to consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Clark and Martin appear to make a procedural challenge that the district court erred in calculating the drug quantity amount and, therefore, the concomitant Guidelines level. We find no error in the district court\u2019s reliance on the jury\u2019s drug quantity finding in assessing relevant conduct. It is well-settled that a sentencing judge has substantial discretion in sentencing, and is \u201centitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. Indeed, we have previously deemed appropriate a district court\u2019s adoption of jury-determined drug amounts using a similar special interrogatory. <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>416 F.3d 349, 362 (5th Cir.2005) (affirming district court\u2019s sentence where drug quantity was found <em>\u201csolely </em>based on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) (emphasis in original). As the Seventh Circuit has observed, our foremost concern upon review is that the district court\u2019s fact findings are based on reliable evidence. <em>United States v. Bequette, </em>309 F.3d 448, 450-51 (7th Cir.2002) (affirming district court\u2019s adoption of drug quantities found by jury\u2019s special verdict). \u201cGiven this concern with reliability, it seems incongruous to suggest that a jury\u2019s drug quantity finding, made using only admissible evidence and found beyond a reasonable doubt, is inadequate for sentencing guidelines purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Here, the district court calculated Clark\u2019s and Martin\u2019s applicable offense levels by adopting the jury\u2019s finding of drug quantities attributable to each defendant as relevant conduct for purposes of USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). These values were found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, appear to be conservatively limited to each defendant\u2019s direct involvement in the conspiracy, and find support in the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>presented at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court did not blindly accept the jury\u2019s verdict-he found that the quantities were supported by considerable evidence. They certainly constitute a sufficiently reliable estimate of the relevant conduct of each conspirator to be \u201cplausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Accordingly, the district court did not err in its fact-finding or resulting Guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Clark complains that the district court insufficiently explained the reasons behind his sentence of imprisonment. We find no error in the district court\u2019s explanation of its application of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court twice explained at Clark\u2019s sentencing that it considered \u201call of the factors\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and particularly cited Clark\u2019s age and the small likelihood of recidivism once he was released from prison. In fact, the district judge ordered a sentence of imprisonment significantly below the applicable Guidelines range. We have explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">The court ... need not engage in \u201crobotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Lamoreaux, </em>422 F.3d 750, 756 (8th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Simpson, </em>430 F.3d 1177, 1186-87 (D.C.Cir.2005) (finding no requirement for the district court to \u201cspecifically refer to <em>each </em>[section 3553(a) ] factor\u201d) (emphasis in original). Congress never intended sentencing \u201cto become a hyper-technical exercise devoid of common sense.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, a checklist recitation of the section 3553(a) factors is neither necessary nor sufficient for a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\"><em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). The district court gave adequate reasoning for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">2. Substantive</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Martin also objects that the district court\u2019s sentence was unconstitutionally disparate from his co-defendants, which appears to be a challenge to the overall reasonableness of his sentence. The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">The district court conducted a relatively lengthy sentencing hearing for Martin, and considered written and oral testimony that reflected the mitigating factors of section 3553(a). In imposing sentence on Martin, the court specifically cited rehabilitation, the sentences of co-defendants, Martin\u2019s age, and \u201cthe other sentencing factors set out in Section 3553,\u201d before departing from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines in Martin\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record is sufficiently clear that the district court gave due con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>sideration to the trial testimony and factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) for each conspirator, and Martin has failed to demonstrate that his ultimate sentence was unreasonable when viewed against the totality of the 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Martin claims that his term of imprisonment resulted in an unconstitutional sentencing disparity. He argues that his sentence was significantly longer than those imposed on conspiracy leader Sergio Solis and co-conspirator Mike Holland, both of whom were allegedly more culpable. However, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) bars only <em>unwarranted </em>sentencing disparities among similarly-situated co-defendants. We have recognized that an individual who chooses to go to trial and contest guilt is not similarly-situated to a conspirator \u2014 even one more involved in criminal conduct\u2014 who has pled guilty and provided information to law enforcement authorities. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 767 &amp; n. 51 (5th Cir.2008). That Solis and Holland cooperated with the investigation, accepted responsibility, and testified against their co-conspirators, establishes that they were not similarly situated to Martin. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600 (\u201cFrom these facts, it is perfectly clear that the District Judge considered the need to avoid unwarranted disparities, but also considered the need to avoid unwarranted similarities among other co-conspirators who were not similarly situated.\u201d). In any case, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the sentences imposed on \u201cevery defendant in the case\u201d in determining Martin\u2019s below-guidelines sentence. Taking into account the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion, or that the resulting sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">For the reasons stated above, Clark\u2019s and Martin\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b68-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. Testimony at trial indicated that one to two ounces would be \u201cdealer quantities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A3\">. This section excludes from the time computation \"[a]ny period of delay resulting from a continuance ..., if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-13\">. Martin does not challenge as insufficient the evidence supporting his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Accordingly, any such claim is waived. <em>See United States v. Pompa, </em>434 F.3d 800, 806 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005) (citing Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\">. We have frequently recognized that firearms are \"tools of the trade\u201d of those engaged in illegal drug activities. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, </em>808 F.2d 1050, 1057 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. The mathematical error of the prosecutor was explained to the jury in closing argument, and was apparently not relied upon by the jury (as they found a lesser drug amount than requested by the government). The error was again raised at Martin\u2019s sentencing, and the district court specifically concluded that it did not affect the jury\u2019s quantity determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. The trial judge also explained, \"So, that the record will be clear, I have imposed a semtence below the advisory guidelines because of the Defendant\u2019s age. I do think that he does have some medical problems which should be taken into consideration. But I think at his age the sentence that I have imposed is sufficient to impose just punishment for tire crime that he's been \u2014 or crimes he\u2019s been convicted of. It's sufficient to keep him from committing further crimes if released. And it imposes just punishment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
