R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Florentino Villegas-Delgadillo appeals from the 135-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and heroin, distribution of methamphetamine and heroin, and being a deported alien found in the United States, all in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Villegas-Delgadillo challenges the district court\u2019s application of a four-level aggravating role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. The district court\u2019s four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) was not clearly erroneous because the unchallenged evidence supports the district court\u2019s determination that Villegas-Delgadillo was an organizer or leader. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>497 F.3d 964, 969-70 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Avila, </em>95 F.3d 887, 889 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Villegas-Delgadillo contends that he is entitled to a limited remand for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1074 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), because the district court sentenced him under the then-mandatory Guidelines. However, with the exception of a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum or resulting from \u201can incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines to which the defendant filed a proper and timely objection,\u201d Villegas-Delgadillo \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d waived the right to appeal his sentence or \u201cthe manner in which the sentence was imposed.\u201d Villegas-Delgadillo\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s treatment of the Guidelines as mandatory was not raised in the district court and is therefore precluded by the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Cortez-Arias, </em>425 F.3d 547, 547-48 (9th Cir.2005), <em>amending </em>415 F.3d 977 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b195-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
