Jones argues that the 10-year supervised release term is unreasonable. He argues that this \u201cextraordinarily long\u201d term exceeds that required to effectuate Congress\u2019s sentencing goals stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that his steady employment history, his personal characteristics, his limited criminal history, and the circumstances surrounding his offense all show that a 10-year term of supervised release is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals, making his term of supervised release unreasonable. He notes that he had no prior history of engaging in such behavior and that no pornographic materials were found among his possessions or on his computer. He contends that this offense is an anomaly and not one he is likely to engage in again.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Because Jones did not object to his term of supervised release in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (plain error review applied to unraised issues concerning the reasonableness of a sentence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008); <em>see also United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 405 (5th Cir.2006) (plain error applied because defendant first objected to term of supervised release on appeal). Plain error review \u201crequires considerable deference to the district court and erects a more substantial hurdle to reversal of a sentence than does the reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">Statutorily, the authorized term of supervised release was a minimum of five years and a maximum of life. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a term of supervised release of five years to life for this sex offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b)(2) and (c). The policy statement contained in \u00a7 5D1.2(b) recommends the statutory maximum term of supervised release for a sex offense, which in this case is life. \u00a7 5D1.2, p.s.; <em>Allison, </em>447 F.3d at 405. In <em>Allison, </em>we held that a term of supervised release for life was reasonable for a defendant convicted of production and possession of child pornography offenses. 447 F.3d at 405-07. We noted that Congress and the Sentencing Commission \u201cintended to impose life terms of supervised release on sex offenders\u201d due to the \u201chigh rate of recidivism in convicted sex offenders, especially child sex offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405-06. In <em>United States v. Armendariz, </em>451 F.3d 352, 358-62 (5th Cir.2006), we vacated the district court\u2019s sentence which did not include a term of supervised release for a defendant convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), the same offense for which Jones was convicted. We held that the district court\u2019s failure to impose a term of supervised release was unreasonable because it failed to account for the Guidelines or to account for the statutory factors of the need to deter criminal conduct, to protect the public, and to provide correctional treatment to the offender. <em>Id. </em>at 359-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Jones\u2019s arguments concerning his employment history, his personal characteristics, and his limited criminal history do not address the reasons why Congress and the Sentencing Commission have recommended supervised release for life for child sex offenders, namely recidivism and the need for treatment of sexual disorders. <em>See Armendariz, </em>451 F.3d at 361; <em>Allison, </em>447 F.3d at 405-07. It was not plain error for the district court to impose a term of supervised release of 10 years. <em>See Allison, </em>447 F.3d at 405-07 (term of supervised release for life reasonable); <em>see also United States v. Presto, </em>498 F.3d 415, 420-21 (6th Cir.2007) (term of supervised release for life reasonable for defendant convicted of receiving child pornography), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2958, -L.Ed.2d-(2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
