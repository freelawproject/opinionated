Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). This petition for review is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">To the extent petitioner seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, the court dismisses this petition in part for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-18\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1005-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
