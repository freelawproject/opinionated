We <em>dismiss </em>the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">On February 28, 2005, the Acting Chairman of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) submitted to the VA\u2019s General Counsel a request for an opinion on an issue of law which had arisen in an appeal pending before the Board. The Acting Chairman asked whether the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.105(e) apply when a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is reinstated, for a limited period, following a determination that there was clear and unmistakable error in the original termination of the rating. The Acting General Counsel provided his opinion by memorandum dated January 17, 2007 (\u201cGeneral Counsel\u2019s opinion\u201d). Subsequently, on February 7, 2007, the opinion was published in the Federal Register. Summary of Precedent Opinions of the General Counsel, 72 Fed.Reg. 5801, 5803 (Feb. 7, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">On April 9, 2007, petitioners filed with this court a petition for review of the General Counsel\u2019s opinion. Petitioners contend that the opinion is procedurally invalid because it was not issued pursuant to the notice and comment procedures prescribed in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. They also contend that the opinion is substantively invalid because the conclusions stated in it are inconsistent with the plain language of section 3.105(e) and the policy considerations underlying it. The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider the petition. Alternatively, the government argues that we should uphold the validity of the General Counsel\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">We agree with the government that we lack jurisdiction to consider the petition for review of the General Counsel\u2019s opinion. This case is squarely controlled by our decision in <em>Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, </em>308 F.3d 1262 (Fed.Cir.2002). In that case, a veterans\u2019 organization filed in this court a petition for review of an opinion of the General Counsel of the VA. <em>Id. </em>at 1263. The General Counsel\u2019s opinion had been rendered in response to a request by the Chairman of the Board for legal advice on issues involved in a pending case before the Board. <em>Id. </em>Because the General Counsel\u2019s opinion involved the Board\u2019s consideration of a specific appeal by a particular veteran, <em>id. </em>at 1266, and was not a statement of general applicability and future effect designed to implement or prescribe law or policy, <em>id. </em>at 1267, we determined that it was not a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of section 552(a)(1)(D), so as to make it reviewable by this court, <em>id. </em>at 1265. Accordingly, we dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1265. In so doing, we observed that the correct approach was for the veteran in the case before the Board to appeal any adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>decision by the Board to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The General Counsel\u2019s opinion in this case is no different from the opinion at issue in <em>Paralyzed, Veterans. </em>Both were issued in response to a request from the Board for an opinion on a question of law which had arisen in a pending appeal. Just as we lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition in <em>Paralyzed Veterans, </em>so too we lack jurisdiction to consider the petition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction petitioners\u2019 request that we review the General Counsel\u2019s opinion pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
