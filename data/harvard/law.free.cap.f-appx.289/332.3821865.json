The district court denied reconsideration, as well as attorney fees then sought by Judge Sanchez. Mr. Doran alleges that Judge Sanchez improperly dismissed a state court case adjudicated before him. The district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ-P. 12(b)(6) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) <em>&amp; </em>(ii) pursuant to the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity on the claim against Judge Sanchez and because the claims against the other defendants were unintelligible. Doc. 23, 26. We agree for substantially the same reasons given by the district court. Judge Sanchez was acting in his judicial capacity in presiding over the state court case, and those actions are entitled to absolute immunity even when \u201calleged to have been done maliciously or corruptly.\u201d <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (quotations omitted). Any claims against other defendants were properly dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) as insufficiently developed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b354-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-22\">. The motion for reconsideration, which the court treated as a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>59(e), is not under review because Mr. Doran did not amend his notice of appeal after the district court\u2019s ruling on that motion.
