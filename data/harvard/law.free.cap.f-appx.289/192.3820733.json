We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Tubalado contends that his father\u2019s lawful admission can be imputed to him, and that this additional time allows him to satisfy the seven-year continuous residence requirement. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). The IJ and BIA did not have the advantage of <em>Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir.2005), when they decided Tubalado\u2019s case. At oral argument, Tubalado\u2019s counsel suggested Tubalado\u2019s father had resided continuously in the United States for seven years prior to his service in Japan. Under these circumstances, we believe these proceedings should be remanded to the BIA to consider Tubalado\u2019s case anew in light of the teachings of <em>Cuevas-Gaspar. </em>The BIA should consider whether the reasoning of <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>extends to a situation where the alien did not reside in the United States with his parent during the applicable time period, and whether the reasoning of <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>does or does not affect the BIA\u2019s hesitance to impute 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b215-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b215-16\">BEA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJm\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">I concur in the panel\u2019s remand of this case to the BIA to determine in the first instance whether <em>Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir.2005), allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Tubalado, a permanent resident, to impute the admission date of his father to meet the cancellation of removal statute\u2019s requirement of seven years\u2019 continuous United States residency after lawful admission. I dissent from the panel\u2019s remand to the BIA to \u201cconsider\u201d whether <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>permits Tubalado to impute his father\u2019s qualification for the \u201cmilitary exception\u201d to the cancellation of removal statute\u2019s residency requirements, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As I read that statute, it is not ambiguous, but clear, as a matter of law, that the \u201cmilitary exception\u201d applies only to the person who served in the armed forces \u2014 not his or her children. As I read <em>Cuevas-Gaspar, </em>no one in that case, much less the mother whose residency status was imputed, served in the United States military.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The principle behind the <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>imputation rule is to avoid separating children from their permanent resident parents with whom they have resided for a significant period of time in the United States. <em>See Cuevas-Gaspar, </em>430 F.3d at 1024 (\u201c[W]e are instructed ... that our immigration statutes and regulations are replete with provisions \u2018giving a high priority to the relation between permanent resident parents and their children.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Lepe-Guitron v. INS, </em>16 F.3d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir.1994) (holding, in the primary case on which <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>relied, imputation of a parent\u2019s residency status to a child may be justified where deportation would \u201csever[] the bonds between parents and their children who had resided legally in the United States for the better part of their lives....\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The so-called \u201cmilitary exception\u201d of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(3), however, has nothing to do with keeping families together. Rather, the statute simply rewards individuals who personally serve on active-duty status in the United States military for two years or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Imputing his father\u2019s qualification for the military exception in the manner Tubalado suggests would mean that a child who does not live with an active-duty military parent \u2014 even a child who is estranged from, <em>or never met, </em>his parent \u2014 and who does not reside in the United States, could come to the United States, commit a removable offense, and have a leg up on the residency requirement for cancellation of removal because his parent served in this nation\u2019s military.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Congress\u2019s intent is clear from the language of the statute: individuals who serve on active duty in the United States Armed Forces need not show seven years\u2019 continuous residency to cancel removal if they commit a crime. Congress said nothing about their offspring.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">The non-applicability of the \u201cmilitary exception\u201d to the <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>rule is a question of law that does not require factual analysis and is not based on an ambiguous statute, so remand is unnecessary under <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002), or <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Accordingly, I dissent from the panel\u2019s remand order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>would hold the \u201cmilitary exception\u201d does not apply to Tubalado as a matter of law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(3) provides: \"The requirements of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the United States under [the cancellation of removal statute] shall not apply to an alien who (A) has served for a minimum period of 24 months in an active-duty status in the Armed Forces of the United States and, if separated from such service, was separated under honorable conditions, and (B) at the time of the alien\u2019s enlistment or induction was in the United States.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-14\">. <em>Lepe-Guitron </em>also did not involve the United States military.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
