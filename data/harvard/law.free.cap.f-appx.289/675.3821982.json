He presents two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-19\">First, he contends: pursuant to <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), the IJ erred when he determined Serrano was convicted of an aggravated felony and therefore was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), federal courts lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony. However, such courts have jurisdiction to consider whether Serrano\u2019s prior offense qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>See Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-20\">The definition of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). A \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d includes \u201cany felony punishable un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>der the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). A state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act only if it involves conduct punishable as a felony under federal law. <em>Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 629-33. Serrano\u2019s delivery of marijuana would subject him to a potential maximum federal sentence of five years in prison. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). Because his offense was <em>punishable </em>by imprisonment for more than one year, it qualifies as an aggravated felony under federal law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">For his other issue, Serrano contends he was denied due process because the IJ failed to hold a merits hearing before issuing an order of removal. To the extent that he is asserting he was entitled to a merits hearing to present evidence about the drug quantity involved in his offense, he waived the claim because he never requested a hearing on this ground. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 346-47 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, Serrano\u2019s contentions about the drug quantity would not have affected the finding that his prior conviction constituted an aggravated felony. To the extent that Serrano is asserting he was entitled to a hearing to present evidence relating to his request for cancellation of removal, he has no due process right to a hearing for discretionary relief. <em>See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 610 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
