The IJ determined that this conviction is one that \u201crelates to\u201d a controlled substance. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where, as here, the BIA\u2019s interpretation of law is contained in an unpublished decision of a single Board member that does not bind third parties, we owe that interpretation only <em>Skidmore </em>deference. That is, we defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation only to the extent that contains \u2122dicia of Pei\" \u201ceness. See <em>Ortega-Cervantes v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir<em>. </em>2007); <em>see also Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944) (the deference owed to an agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cwill depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d). We grant the petition in 04-73268 and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Apc\">Reyes-Floriano\u2019s conviction under section 23152(a) does not categorically constitute a crime \u201crelating to a controlled substance\u201d as defined in section 802 of Title 21 [Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) ]. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 U82(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The statute of con-fiction does not identify any particular controlled substance. It therefore could involve any one of the \u201cnumerous substances\u201d that California regulates but \u201cthat are n\u00b0t similarly regulated by the CSA.\u201d <em>See Ruiz-Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1072&gt;1078 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">Nor does the limited analysis of the record permitted under the modified cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>gorical appi\u2019oach, <em>id. </em>at 1078, establish that Reyes-Floriano has been convicted of a crime related to a controlled substance. Although the complaint charged ReyesFloriano with being \u201cunder the influence of a controlled substance, to wit: OPIATES/METHAMPHETAMINE,\u201d that count was dismissed and he pleaded guilty to a different count in the complaint, i.e., driving \u201cwhile under the influence of drugs.\u201d Because Reyes-Floriano \u201cpleaded ... to an offense different from the one charged\u201d we cannot \u201cconnect the references to [methamphetamine] in the charging document with the conviction\u201d and are \u201cleft only to speculate as to the nature of the substance\u201d involved. <em>See id. </em>at 1079. Such speculation is insufficient to prove that \u201cthe particular substance\u201d underlying Reyes-Floriano\u2019s conviction \u201cis a controlled substance as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Reyes-Floriano is not deport-able under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae for having been convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"APz\">On this same analysis, Reyes-Floriano\u2019s conviction under section 23152(a) does not make him statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). <em>See Kepilino v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1057, 1060-62 (9th Cir. 2006) (under a modified categorical approaeh, conviction under state prostitution statute penalizing conduct other than sexual intercourse did not render alien inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"Abs\">We grant the petition in 04-73268, reverse, and remand the matter to the Board to consider whether Reyes-Floriano has satisfied the eligibility requirements for adjustment of status, and for any other relief to which he may be entitled. The petition in 04-75113 is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Z\">PETITION IN 04-73268 GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"Adu\">PETITION IN 04-75113 DISMISSED ^g MOOT</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Our jurisdiction in this case is governed by the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (Sept. 30, 1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) because immigration proceedings were initiated by the INS before IIRIRA\u2019s general effective date of April 1, 1997, and the final deportation or exclusion order was filed after October 30, 1996. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c); <em>Magana-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 607 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AVE\">. Reyes-Floriano also petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision denying his motion to reconsider. Because of our disposition in No. 04-73268, however, we dismiss Reyes Floriano\u2019s petition in 04-75113 as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
