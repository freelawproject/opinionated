We have jurisdiction to review the denial of a SAW application pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3). We will reverse a decision of the AAU where it abuses its discretion or makes findings that are contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the record considered as a whole. <em>See Perez-Martin v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 752, 758 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-21\">The AAU did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Olea\u2019s witness affidavits were of little probative value and did not establish Olea\u2019s eligibility for relief in light of the government\u2019s evidence that called into question her claim of employment by Cayetano Godina. <em>See Perez-Martin, </em>394 F.3d at 759-60 (to overcome derogatory government evidence, an applicant must provide enough evidence to show qualifying employment \u201cas a matter of just and reasonable inference\u201d) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(b)(3)(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Olea\u2019s contention that the government denied her due process is not supported by the record. The relevant regulation states that the government shall attempt to secure employment records where, among other conditions, the applicant\u2019s testimony credibly supports her claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.3(b)(4). Because Olea\u2019s claim was refuted by her employer, the AAU\u2019s determination that she did not provide credible testimony is supported by the record, and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.3(b)(4) did not require the government to attempt to secure her employment records.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b199-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
