In our prior consideration of this case, we affirmed all findings of the ALJ except those related to the crediting and discrediting of various medical opinions, and we remanded to the ALJ for reconsideration of the medical opinion evidence. On appeal, Westmoreland again contends that the award of benefits to Mr. Amick must be set aside because the ALJ\u2019s decision to give more weight to the opinions of Mr. Amick\u2019s doctors and less weight to those of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors was irrational and unsupported by substantial evidence. Because the decision to award benefits to Mr. Amick is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the order of the BRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The Black Lung Benefits Act (\u201cBLBA\u201d) provides benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled because of pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung disease, and to the surviving dependents of coal miners who have died from the disease. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a) (2000); <em>Mullins Coal Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>484 U.S. 135, 138, 108 S.Ct. 427, 98 L.Ed.2d 450 (1987). A coal miner or his surviving dependent may seek benefits under the BLBA by filing a claim with the District Director in the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, who determines whether a particular claimant is eligible for benefits and which employer will be responsible for those benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 725.301-725.423 (2007). After the District Director makes a determination about benefits, either party may appeal and request a hearing before an ALJ. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 725.450-725.480. The ALJ\u2019s decision is appealable to the BRB, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 725.481, and then to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the respiratory impairment occurred. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) (2000); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.482.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The BLBA defines pneumoconiosis as a \u201cchronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(b) (2000). As of January 2001, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(c) made clear the long-held understanding by the courts of appeals that pneumoconiosis is a \u201clatent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Mullins Coal Co., </em>484 U.S. at 151, 108 S.Ct. 427; <em>Labelle Processing Co. v. Swarrow, </em>72 F.3d 308, 314 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Lovilia Coal Co. v. Harvey, </em>109 F.3d 445, 450 (8th Cir.1997); <em>Orange v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>786 F.2d 724, 727 (6th Cir.1986); <em>Consolid. Coal Co. v. Chubb, </em>741 F.2d 968, 973 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">As of January 2001, federal regulations also made clear what courts had long recognized, namely, that pneumoconiosis as defined by the BLBA has both a \u201cclinical\u201d and a \u201clegal\u201d manifestation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(l)-(2); <em>see, e.g., Nat\u2019l Mining Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t. of Labor, </em>292 F.3d 849, 869 (D.C.Cir.2002) (noting that the distinction between clinical and legal pneumoconiosis is recognized by all the circuits that considered the issue); <em>Gulf and Western Industries v. Ling, </em>176 F.3d 226, 231-32 (4th Cir.1999). Clinical pneumoconiosis, also known as \u201cmedical pneumoconiosis,\u201d is \u201ccharacterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(1). Legal pneumoconiosis is defined much more broadly, and includes \u201cany chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.201(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Charles Moore Amick, now deceased, worked as a coal miner for thirty-three years. From 1946 until 1962, Mr. Amick worked in strip mining, and from 1962 until he retired in 1983, he worked underground. During those years, he performed numerous jobs: truck driver, mechanic, electrician, bulldozer operator, timberman, cutting machine operator, and scoop operator. During his last eleven years as a coal mine employee, Mr. Amick ran a supply motor, which required him to load and unload roof bolts, timbers, and other supplies. Mr. Amick also had smoked roughly one pack of cigarettes each day from 1941 until around 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In December of 1980, Mr. Amick filed a claim for black lung benefits, which the District Director denied in July of 1981. Mr. Amick applied again in April 1983, and the District Director denied his claim in May of 1984. Mr. Amick applied for benefits a third time in March of 2000, and this time the District Director awarded benefits. On appeal to the ALJ, the award was affirmed, on the grounds that Mr. Amick had proven the existence of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In affirming the District Director\u2019s award of benefits, the ALJ considered the opinions of numerous physicians, all of whom agreed that Mr. Amick had a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which rendered him \u201ctotally disabled\u201d as defined by federal regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(1). The doctors disagreed, however, as to the cause of Mr. Amick\u2019s impairment. Mr. Amick\u2019s doctors \u2014 Drs. Cohen and Koenig, as well as a doctor for the Department of Labor, Dr. Rasmussen \u2014 found that his COPD was due, at least in part, to exposure to coal mine dust during his coal mine employment. Westmoreland\u2019s doctors \u2014 Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, Castle, Spagnolo, and Morgan, as well as a doctor for the Department of Labor, Dr. Daniel \u2014 all opined that Mr. Amick\u2019s impairment was the result of his long-time smoking habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The ALJ found the opinions of Mr. Amick\u2019s doctors more persuasive than those of Westmoreland\u2019s physicians, and thus awarded benefits to Mr. Amick. The BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Amick v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>BRB No. 03-0256 BLA (Jan. 21, 2004). On appeal, this court affirmed the BRB\u2019s holdings that one, Mr. Amick\u2019s claim was timely filed, that two, the ALJ did not err in applying amended portions of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718 and 725 to Mr. Amick\u2019s claims, and that three, the ALJ applied the correct test to determine whether Mr. Amick had established a material change in condition. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Amick, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 525, 527-530 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">However, this court vacated the award of black lung benefits to Mr. Amick and remanded the case for further consideration on the grounds that, although the BRB\u2019s conclusions regarding the credibility of the doctors \u201cmight be supported by substantial evidence,\u201d the reasons given by the ALJ for discrediting Westmoreland\u2019s doctors were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>On remand, the ALJ' again awarded benefits to Mr. Amick. In that opinion, the ALJ noted that the opinions of Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, Castle, Spagnolo, Cohen, and Koenig were entitled to the most deference because those physicians were board-certified in pulmonary disease. Again, though, the ALJ found the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Koenig more persuasive than those of the other physicians, noting that those opinions \u2014 unlike those of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors \u2014 discussed the latent and progressive nature of pneumoconiosis, were well supported by medical literature most consistent with the findings of the Department of Labor regarding the nature of pneumoconiosis, and took into account the possible effects of both cigarette smoking and coal mine dust exposure on Mr. Amick\u2019s condition. The BRB affirmed, noting that the ALJ had followed this court\u2019s directives on remand and had properly exercised his discretion in determining which medical opinions were most persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Westmoreland timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Westmoreland attacks the ALJ\u2019s reasons for awarding benefits to Mr. Amick as irrational and unsupported by substantial evidence. We must affirm the decision of the BRB if it properly determined that the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. <em>See, e.g., Doss v. Dir., OWCP, </em>53 F.3d 654, 658 (4th Cir.1995). In so doing, we bear in mind that it is the role of the ALJ \u2014 who has familiarity with this field\u2014 to make factual findings, to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and to weigh conflicting evidence. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we note that \u201ca reviewing body may not set aside an inference merely because it finds the opposite conclusion more reasonable or because it questions the factual basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. Guided by these principles, we turn to Westmoreland\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Westmoreland first contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Koenig was irrational and unsupported by substantial evidence. Contrary to Westmoreland\u2019s argument, however, the evidence in the record supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusions is sufficiently substantial \u201cas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\u201d the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>see also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A) (requiring an ALJ to provide an adequate explanation for his findings and conclusions). In particular, the ALJ first noted that both Drs. Cohen and Koenig, unlike Westmoreland\u2019s physicians, recognized and discussed the latent and progressive nature of pneumoconiosis. For example, as the BRB pointed out, both Drs. Koenig and Cohen considered the relationship between the progressive nature of Mr. Amick\u2019s disability (as shown by Mr. Amick\u2019s worsening pulmonary function test results from 1983 to 2001, his worsening diffusion impairment from 1991 to 2001, and his worsening hypoxemia at rest) and the progressive nature of legal and clinical pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The ALJ also explained that the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Koenig included a thorough discussion of (and were well supported by) medical literature that was consistent with the Department of Labor\u2019s findings that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease, and that an obstructive impairment may be \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d In fact, Dr. Koenig\u2019s conclusions were supported by forty-two published, peer-reviewed articles. Finally, the ALJ credited the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Koenig because, in contrast with the opinions of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors, they both specifically and clearly addressed the possible contribution of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>cigarette smoke and coal dust to Mr. Amick\u2019s disability. <em>See Peerless Eagle Coal Co. v. Taylor, </em>107 F.3d 867, 867 (Table) (4th Cir.1997) (approving the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit a physician for failing to explain his conclusions \u201cthat smoking was the sole cause of the miner\u2019s breathing impairment ... and that coal dust exposure played no role at all.\u201d) As Dr. Koenig\u2019s report explained, the importance of considering both possible contributing factors is highlighted by the findings of numerous medical studies, which indicate that the symptoms, pulmonary function tests, and chest x-ray appearance of COPD are identical regardless of whether the COPD is caused by coal dust, cigarette smoke, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Nonetheless, Westmoreland contends that the ALJ\u2019s reasons for crediting the opinions of these two doctors were invalid. To begin, Westmoreland argues that the black lung regulations do not demand that physicians discuss the latent and progressive nature of pneumoconiosis, and thus, the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Koenig for doing so was error. While true that the regulations do not impose such a requirement, considering that both the black lung regulations-as well as numerous, long-standing decisions of the courts of appeals recognize the progressivity of pneumoconiosis, the ALJ was not precluded from considering as more persuasive the opinions of those doctors who took that characteristic of pneumoconiosis into account. This is especially true in this case, given that the worsening of Mr. Amiek\u2019s symptoms did not occur until eight years after he retired from his coal mining employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Westmoreland also insists that Drs. Cohen and Koenig\u2019s thorough discussion of medical literature cannot provide a basis for the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit his opinion, because the ALJ failed to \u201cresolv[e] the conflicts\u201d between the literature cited by Drs. Cohen and Koenig and that cited by Drs. Zaldivar and Morgan. However, as the ALJ recognized, and as the BRB explained in detail, the Department of Labor already reviewed the medical and scientific literature before promulgating its revised regulations. <em>See generally </em>65 Fed.Reg. 79,937-51 (Dec. 20, 2000). The ALJ\u2019s decision to credit Drs. Cohen and Koenig for their thorough discussion of the medical literature was therefore valid, in that it was, as the ALJ and BRB made clear, more consistent with the Department of Labor\u2019s findings that pneumoconiosis is latent and progressive and that an obstructive impairment may be \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Westmoreland next contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Westmoreland\u2019s doctors was irrational and unsupported by substantial evidence. Again, however, the ALJ\u2019s decision to afford less weight to the opinions of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors is amply supported by evidence in the record. Regarding Dr. Zaldivar specifically, the ALJ found his opinion less persuasive because he made contradictory statements about the relevance of x-ray evidence in diagnosing pneumoconiosis. For example, Dr. Zaldivar acknowledged that a positive chest x-ray finding was not needed for a diagnosis of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, yet he also stated that \u201c[t]he x-ray is absolutely necessary to determine that the exposure has been high enough for [Mr. Amick] to inhale and to retain the dust.\u201d <em>See Midland Coal Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>358 F.3d 486, 492 (7th Cir.2004) (approving a similar ALJ finding on the grounds that requiring x-ray evidence of pneumoconiosis is contrary to the BLBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Moreover, regarding Drs. Daniel, Castle, Spagnolo, Stewart, and Morgan, the ALJ found their opinions less persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>because none of them took into account the latent and progressive nature of pneumoconiosis. For example, Dr. Castle concluded that Mr. Amick\u2019s impairment could not have been caused by coal dust exposure because Mr. Amick stopped working in 1983 and the deterioration of his condition began in 1991. Similarly, Dr. Stewart cited Mr. Amick\u2019s deterioration after 1991 as a basis for attributing his COPD solely to cigarette smoking. These findings, as both the ALJ and the BRB pointed out, ignore the fact that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease. <em>See, e.g., Roberts &amp; Schaefer Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>400 F.3d 992, 999 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that it is appropriate for an ALJ to give less weight to a physician\u2019s opinion when it lacked consideration of the latent and progressive nature of pneumoconiosis); <em>Sea \u201cB\u201d Mining Co. v. Dunford, </em>188 Fed.Appx. 191, 199 (4th Cir.2006) (same); <em>Four L Coal Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>157 Fed.Appx. 551, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (same); <em>see also Lewis Coal Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>373 F.3d 570, 580 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cLittle weight can be given to medical findings that conflict with the BLBA\u2019s implementing regulations,\u201d including the finding that pneumoconiosis is a \u201cprogressive disease.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Finally, the ALJ found the opinions of all of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors less persuasive than those of Drs. Cohen and Koenig because they failed to take into account both cigarette smoking and coal mine dust exposure as potential causes of Mr. Amick\u2019s COPD. In particular, the ALJ discredited the opinions of Drs. Daniel, Castle, Spagnolo, and Stewart for failing to explain why no part of Mr. Amick\u2019s disability was due to thirty-three years of coal dust exposure. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 213 (4th Cir. 2000) (approving as valid a similar ALJ finding). Relatedly, the ALJ explained that the opinions of Drs. Daniel, Morgan, and Zaldivar relied on little more than negative x-ray findings to support their conclusion that Mr. Amick\u2019s impairment was solely the result of cigarette smoking. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b). (\u201c[N]o claim for benefits ... shall be denied solely on the basis of the results of a chest roentgenogram.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Westmoreland, however, mounts three primary challenges to the ALJ\u2019s explanations for discrediting the opinions of these doctors. First, Westmoreland contends that the ALJ erred by \u201ctrying to manufacture conflicts in Dr. Zaldivar\u2019s testimony\u201d regarding the necessity of a positive chest x-ray. As the BRB recognized, however, there is ample support in the record showing that at times Dr. Zaldivar indicated that a chest x-ray was not needed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis, and at others he indicated that a positive chest x-ray was required. <em>Amick, </em>BRB No. 05-1000 BLA at 4-5 (citing various portions of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Westmoreland also contends that the ALJ erred in discrediting the opinions of Drs. Daniel, Castle, Spagnolo, Stewart, and Morgan for not discussing the latent and progressive nature of pneumoconiosis. However, we already discussed above that the ALJ may consider medical opinions less persuasive if they do not discuss the progressivity of pneumoconiosis. Further, we reject Westmoreland\u2019s additional argument that the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit these physicians for not discussing pneumoconiosis\u2019s progressivity constituted an impermissible retroactive application of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(c). Westmoreland has already challenged the application of the revised 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718 and 725 to Mr. Amick\u2019s claim, and in our 2004 decision, we held that the ALJ did not err in applying the amended regulations to that claim. <em>Amick, </em>123 Fed-Appx. at 530. That decision is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and we thus decline to revisit Westmoreland\u2019s challenge to the application of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201 here. <em>See Arizona v. California, </em>460 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Finally, Westmoreland argues that the ALJ impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to Westmoreland\u2019s doctors by requiring them to \u201crule out\u201d coal dust exposure as a cause of Mr. Amick\u2019s COPD. Westmoreland is of course correct that the claimant has the burden of proving every element of entitlement to benefits under the BLBA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(d); <em>Dir., OWCP v. Greenwich Collieries, </em>512 U.S. 267, 280-81, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994). However, nothing about the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Westmoreland\u2019s doctors for not discussing coal dust as a potential contributing cause of Mr. Amick\u2019s COPD relieved Drs. Cohen and Koenig of them burden to prove every element of Mr. Amick\u2019s claim for benefits. And as discussed above, Drs. Cohen and Koenig supported their conclusions that Mr. Amick\u2019s totally disabling impairment was due, at least in part, to thirty-three years of coal mine dust exposure. Nevertheless, even if such burden shifting occurred, the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless here because, as discussed, the ALJ provided numerous other valid reasons for giving less weight to the opinions of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Westmoreland sets forth additional challenges to the ALJ\u2019s determinations regarding the credibility of the physicians, all of which we have reviewed with care and find lack merit. In essence, this case required the ALJ to weigh the credibility of various opinions from a number of highly qualified doctors. In so doing, the ALJ chose which opinions he found most credible, and he provided an adequate and reasonable explanation for his choice. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A). It is not our job to serve as a \u201csuper ALJ\u201d and re-weigh all of the evidence, as Westmoreland essentially urges, in order to reach a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the BRB is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">. In particular, this court noted that, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s findings otherwise, Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, and Castle had indeed found that Mr. Amick\u2019s COPD was unrelated to his coal mining employment, and Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, Castle, and Spagnolo had in fact addressed legal pneumoconiosis in their opinions. <em>Amick, </em>123 Fed.Appx. at 532-33. Further, we held that Westmoreland's physicians were not, as the ALJ had suggested, required to consider medical literature presented by Dr. Koenig. Finally, we noted that Dr. Morgan's opinion did not contradict the BLBA, and thus the AO erred in discrediting it for that reason alone. <em>Id. </em>at 532-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\">. Westmoreland also argues that the ALJ erred in discrediting Drs. Zaldivar and Daniel on the grounds that they supported their conclusions regarding the cause of Mr. Amick\u2019s COPD with little other than x-ray evidence. Specifically, Westmoreland contends that this finding is factually inaccurate, because Drs. Zaldivar and Daniel also cited Mr. Amick\u2019s response to bronchodilator treatment to bolster their conclusions. The BRB rejected this argument on the grounds that bronchodilator treatment response is unrelated to the potential causes of Mr. Amick's COPD. <em>Amick, </em>BRB No. 05-1000 BLA at 10. Nevertheless, even if, as Westmoreland contends, the BRB's rejection of this argument constituted a medical conclusion that lacks support in the record, the ALJ articulated numerous other valid reasons for discrediting the opinions of Drs. Zaldivar and Daniel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b666-10\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1q_\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"Ankn\">The regulation defining pneumoconiosis does not require a physician to discuss the \u201clatent and progressive\u201d nature of pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201. Since the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) incorrectly discredited Westmoreland\u2019s physicians for their failure to do so, and committed several factual errors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">The parties agree that Amick suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d) that is totally disabling. Their dispute is limited to whether Amick\u2019s COPD is caused by coal mine dust, smoking, or a combination of both. The employer\u2019s doctors \u2014 Drs. Zaldivar, Stewart, Castle, Daniel, Spagnolo, and Morgan \u2014 uniformly opine that Amick\u2019s habit of smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes per day for nearly forty years was the cause of his COPD. Each of West<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>moreland\u2019s doctors provided significant testimony detailing the rationale for their decisions, yet the ALJ discounted all of the doctors\u2019 conclusions, in part, because they did not address the latency or progressiveness of pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, the ALJ dismissed Dr. Spagnolo\u2019s opinion because he \u201cdid not discuss the progressive and latent nature of coal mine dust exposure.\u201d (J.A. 674.) The majority affirmed the ALJ\u2019s reliance on this \u201comission\u201d to devalue the testimony of Westmoreland\u2019s doctors, but it does not cite to any direct precedent in support. The cases cited by the majority stand for the unassailable proposition that a doctor cannot base his opinion on the \u201cflawed premise that a miner with no apparent pulmonary impairment upon leaving the coal mines could never thereafter develop a coal dust related impairment.\u201d <em>Four L Coal Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>157 Fed.Appx. 551, 555 (4th Cir.2005). However, in the instant case, only Dr. Castle, in my view committed this error. The testimony and findings of Westmoreland\u2019s remaining physicians did not indicate that any of them disagreed with the fact that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Indeed, as the majority correctly points out, \u00a7 718.201(c) \u201cmade clear the long-held understanding by the courts of appeals that pneumoconiosis is a \u2018latent and progressive disease.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. Op. 643.) Beyond the court of appeals, both the Secretary of Labor and the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety concurred that \u00a7 781.201(c) codified the widely accepted scientific view regarding the latency and progressiveness of pneumoconiosis. The very structure of the Black Lung Benefits Act (\u201cBLBA\u201d) implicitly recognizes the latency and progressiveness of pneumoconiosis by allowing miners to refile their previously unsuccessful claims if their medical condition has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The sole question that doctors must address in evaluating a coal miner\u2019s eligibility for black lung benefits under the BLBA is whether the claimant, at the time of the exam, has clinical or legal pneumoconiosis. Neither the literal terms of the relevant regulations nor any case law provide that an employer\u2019s doctors must discuss the latency or progressiveness of pneumoconiosis presumably because \u00a7 718.201(c) explicitly provides that this is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">While there may be substantial evidence to support awarding Amick benefits, I would remand this case to the ALJ for further consideration in light of this legal error and for the reasons set forth in Judge Smith\u2019s opinion. As such, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-13\">. Judge Smith\u2019s opinion concurring and dissenting from the Benefits Review Board\u2019s (\u201cBRB\u201d) decision sets out some of these factual errors. (See J.A. 694-697.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-6\">. While many of the doctors did not explicitly address this issue, Dr. Zaldivar did so. Indeed, the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) quoted the very portion of Dr. Zaldivar's trial testimony in which he specifically addressed the progressiveness of pneumoconiosis.
