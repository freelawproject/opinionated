Lewis sought damages against Pugh, as well as Defendants-Appellees City of Jacksonville (\u201cCity\u201d) and former police chief Mark Johnson. The district court granted summary judgment to the City and Johnson, but Lewis obtained a $300,000 jury verdict and judgment against Pugh. Lewis now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City and Johnson, while Pugh appeals the jury verdict and judgment entered against him. For the following reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">In March 2005, Pugh offered Lewis a ride while she was walking home from a friend\u2019s house early in the morning. Pugh, employed at the time as a City police officer, was in uniform, armed with a gun, and driving a police vehicle. Lewis accepted the ride and Pugh took Lewis to an abandoned trailer house and raped her. Pugh then drove Lewis home.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">Lewis asserts that she contacted City Police Detective Tonya Harris<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the next day, but was unable to reach her. Lewis eventually spoke to Harris and Assistant City Police Chief John Page, and Lewis told Page that Pugh had raped her. Page told her that he would like to talk to her in person, but Lewis told him that she would prefer to speak with Harris. Subsequently, Page attempted to contact Lewis to interview her, but was unable to reach her. A day or two after the initial report, Page came to Lewis\u2019s house, but Lewis again said that she would feel better speaking to Harris. Eventually Lewis met with Harris and told her what had happened. At some point, Lewis also signed a written statement describing the rape.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Lewis later spoke with Joe Evans, an investigator for the Cherokee County District Attorney, and told him about the rape.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In October 2005, Lewis gave Evans a written statement. Lewis also spoke with the FBI about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">According to the City, on October 21, 2005, then-police chief Johnson and Page met with Evans and learned that Lewis had repeated her allegations to the district attorney. Johnson testified that he contacted Pugh that day and placed him on suspension. Johnson stated that Pugh did not serve as a City Police Department officer after that date. On February 8, 2006, after being notified by the FBI that Pugh had been arrested on charges of sexual assault, Johnson terminated Pugh\u2019s employment with the City of Jacksonville.</p>\n<p id=\"A4X\">On August 6, 2006, Pugh assaulted Lewis in retaliation for Lewis\u2019s report of the previous assault. Specifically, while driving his personal vehicle, Pugh offered Lewis a ride. When Lewis declined, Pugh confronted Lewis, wrapped his belt around her neck, and began dragging Lewis towards his van. Lewis was injured, but managed to get away from Pugh before he was able to place her in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">In September 2006, Pugh plead guilty to charges stemming from his two assaults on Lewis and his assault on another woman. Specifically, he plead guilty to two counts of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, deprivation of rights under color of law, and one count of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(b), retaliation against a witness. Pugh was sentenced to a 12 year sentence on March 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">Lewis filed suit in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on August 14, 2006, claiming that the assaults by Pugh violated her rights under the Fourth Amendment. Lewis also alleged that the City and Johnson were liable under \u00a7 1983 because of their failure to supervise Pugh, their hiring and retention of Pugh, and their tolerance of Pugh\u2019s misconduct. Lewis also alleged state law assault and battery claims against Pugh based on Pugh\u2019s August 9, 2006 attack against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">In May 2007, the district court granted the City and Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Lewis had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City and Johnson acted with deliberate indifference in the supervision, hiring, training, and retention of Pugh. The district court also concluded that Lewis failed to produce evidence that any policies or procedures were the moving force behind Lewis\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">Lewis\u2019s claims against Pugh proceeded to trial in June 2007. Pugh stipulated to liability,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so the jury determined only the amount of damages to be awarded to Lewis. On June 12, 2007, the jury returned a verdict awarding Lewis $50,000 in compensatory damages, as well as $250,000 in punitive damages. Subsequently, the district court entered final judgment against Pugh in the amount of $300,000 plus interest, and dismissed Lewis\u2019s claims against the City and Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Lewis now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>and Johnson. In addition, Pugh, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the jury\u2019s verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">As noted above, the district court granted summary judgment to the City and Johnson on three claims: failure to supervise; deficient hiring or retention; and deficient procedures for the discovery of police misconduct. As an initial matter, Lewis\u2019s brief makes no argument regarding her deficient hiring and retention claim, and, as such, we consider this issue waived. <em>See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, </em>224 F.3d 425, 445 (5th Cir. 2000) (arguments not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned); <em>In re Tex. Mortg. Sews. Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1068, 1073 (5th Cir. 1985) (\u201c[Ijssues not raised or argued in the brief of the appellant may be considered waived and thus will not be noticed or entertained by the court of appeals.\u201d). Therefore, on appeal, we will only address Lewis\u2019s claims of inadequate supervision and inadequate complaint policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d 802, 805 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is proper when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgement as matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)). \u201cThe evidence and inferences from the summary judgment record are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Minter v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>423 F.3d 460, 465 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Lewis\u2019s claims are brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must claim a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States and demonstrate the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Randolph v. Cervantes, </em>130 F.3d 727, 730 (5th Cir.1997). Lewis has brought suit against the City, as well as against Johnson. A municipality may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 when its official policies or customs violate the Constitution. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). However, a municipality will not face liability under a respondeat superior liability theory. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Instead, the plaintiff must identify the specific policy or custom, and show that the final policy maker, through its \u201cdeliberate conduct,\u201d was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the violation. <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan County v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 405, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed\u00fcd 626 (1997). Lewis sued Johnson in both his individual and official capacity. This Court has explained that official-capacity suits should be treated as suits against the government entity, <em>see Turner v. Houma Mun. Fire and Police Civil Sew. Bd., </em>229 F.3d 478, 483 (5th Cir.2000); therefore, Lewis\u2019s claims against Johnson in his official capacity merge with her claims against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Lewis first argues that the City and Johnson are liable because Johnson\u2019s failure to adequately supervise Pugh caused her injury. The same standards of fault and causation apply to an individual supervisor\u2019s liability and the liability of a municipality for failure to supervise. <em>Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dish, </em>15 F.3d 443, 453 (5th Cir.1994) <em>(en </em>banc). Thus we will analyze Lewis\u2019s claims against Johnson in his individual capacity and her claims against the municipality together. To succeed on her claim, Lewis must show that: \u201c(1) the supervisor either failed to supervise or train the subordinate official; (2) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>causal link exists between the failure to train or supervise and the violation of [her] rights; and (3) the failure to train or supervise amounts to deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Smith v. Brenoettsy, </em>158 F.3d 908, 911-12 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">With respect to the third prong, we have previously stated that: \u201cDeliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\u201d <em>Estate of Davis v. City of N. Richland, Hills, 406 F.3d 375, 381 </em>(5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382). \u201cFor an official to act with deliberate indifference, the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Proof of more than a single instance of lack of supervision causing a violation of constitutional rights is required before such lack of training can constitute deliberate indifference. <em>Thompson v. Upshur County, </em>245 F.3d 447, 458 (5th Cir.2001). Instead, the plaintiff must generally demonstrate that the municipality or supervisor had notice of a pattern of prior acts \u201cfairly similar to what ultimately transpired.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>406 F.3d at 383; <em>see also Thompson, </em>245 F.3d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The record contains the following evidence regarding Lewis\u2019s supervisory claim. First, in her deposition, Lewis states that Detective Harris told her that \u201cthey had a suspicion\u201d about Pugh prior to his rape of Lewis. Second, Lewis points to the testimony of Johnson that in June 2005 he became aware that Pugh had molested a number of women, however he did not know whether these rapes occurred before or after the March 2005 rape of Lewis. Johnson also testified that he was subsequently suspended for failing to properly supervise the police department, and that he retried in June 2006. Third, Lewis presents evidence of a number of claims stemming from Pugh\u2019s October 22, 2004 use of allegedly excessive force against a number of spectators after a high school football game at the Tomato Bowl in Jacksonville, Texas. Lewis produced the declarations of four spectators, all of whom allege that Pugh used excessive force against them and/or arrested them without probable cause. Lewis also presented evidence that Johnson was aware of at least one of the Tomato Bowl complaints. Fourth, Lewis presents evidence that Investigator Evans, in the fall of 2005, interviewed several other women who stated that Pugh had assaulted them. There is no evidence in the record that these women had reported the assaults or filed complaints against Pugh prior to March 2005. Finally, Lewis points to the testimony of Assistant Police Chief John Page, who stated that in early June 2005 he became aware that a number of women, including Lewis, were alleging that Pugh committed sexual misconduct against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Even accepted as true and taken as a whole, the above evidence is legally insufficient to support a finding of deliberate indifference. At most, this evidence shows that, prior to Lewis\u2019s March 2005 rape, Johnson had knowledge of four excessive force and unlawful arrest claims, all stemming from one incident \u2014 the Tomato Bowl arrests. There were no allegations of sexual misconduct related to the Tomato Bowl incident, nor did Lewis present any evidence that the City or Johnson had knowledge that Pugh committed any other sexual offenses prior to March 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>stressed that to demonstrate \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d a plaintiff must show \u201ca pattern of similar incidents.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>406 F.3d at 382-83. Even assuming that the four Tomato Bowl incidents, all occurring on the same date, constitute a \u201cpattern,\u201d these incidents allegedly involved the use of excessive force during arrests, not sexual misconduct. While we have cautioned that \u201cthe specificity required should not be exaggerated,\u201d our caselaw requires that \u201cthe prior acts be fairly similar to what ultimately transpired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. \u201cPrior indications cannot simply be for any and all \u2018bad\u2019 or unwise acts, but rather must point to the specific violation in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, other than the fact that both incidents involved alleged violence committed by Pugh, there is little similarity between the allegedly excessive force used to effectuate the arrests at the Tomato Bowl and the intentional, violent, rape of Lewis. Given the dissimilarity between the two incidents, we cannot conclude that Lewis established a triable issue of fact with respect to whether Johnson and the City were \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exist[ed],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 381, that Pugh was likely to commit a violent rape and assault. <em>See also Roberts v. City of Shreveport, </em>397 F.3d 287, 294 (5th Cir. 2005) (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 proffered pattern where it required \u201can excessively high level of generality\u201d). In sum, there is no conduct from which it could be reasonably concluded that Johnson or the City made a deliberate or conscious choice to endanger constitutional rights. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Lewis next argues that the City and Johnson are liable because Defendant Johnson had a policy of tolerating police misconduct, such as excessive force and unlawful arrests, and the City had inadequate procedures for documenting and investigating complaints of police misconduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court appears to have addressed these claims together, and Lewis\u2019s brief is unhelpful in determining whether she is alleging one unconstitutional policy or two. However, for the sake of completeness, we address these two distinct claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">As discussed above, a municipality faces \u00a7 1983 liability only \u201cwhen execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury....\u201d <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018. \u201cProof of municipal liability sufficient to satisfy Monell requires: (1) an official policy (or custom), of which (2) a policy maker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>tion whose \u2018moving force\u2019 is that policy (or custom).\u201d <em>Pineda v. City of Houston, </em>291 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2002). For a municipality to be liable on account of its policy, the plaintiff must show, among other things, either (1) that the policy itself violated federal law or authorized or directed the deprivation of federal rights or (2) that the policy was adopted or maintained by the municipality\u2019s policymakers \u201cwith \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 as to its known or obvious consequences.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Deep E. Tex. Reg\u2019l Narcotics Trafficking Task Force, </em>379 F.3d 293, 309 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 407, 117 S.Ct. 1382). As chief law enforcement officer during the time in question, Johnson \u201cmay be held personally liable if he implemented \u2018a policy so deficient that the policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of the constitutional violation.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibarra v. Harris County, </em>243 Fed.Appx. 830, 836 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council, </em>279 F. 3d 273, 289 (5th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">1. <em>Policy of Tolerating Police Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">First, Lewis has not sufficiently demonstrated that the City or Johnson had a custom of tolerating misconduct or inadequately responding to citizen complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In support of her claim that Johnson had a policy of tolerating police misconduct, Lewis points to the following incidents of police misconduct. First, she submitted evidence of police misconduct at the Tomato Bowl incident in 2004. In addition, she presented evidence of another incident of alleged excessive force by Pugh, occurring on October 2, 2005, when Pugh allegedly used excessive force against Larry Lacey during a traffic stop. Further, Lewis points to Johnson\u2019s testimony that Pugh committed a number of other sexual assaults. Lewis also cites to an incident in which three officers allegedly maced and beat up a man named \u201cBurke,\u201d who was being held in the city jail for DWI. Finally, Lewis presented evidence that Johnson was suspended twice \u2014 once in 2003 for allegedly lying to the City Manager and again in 2006 for improperly managing the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">However, there is simply no evidence in the record that the City \u201ctolerated\u201d these incidents of misconduct or other incidents of this nature. To the contrary, the testimony in the record indicates that each of these incidents was investigated,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in some cases, including the case of Pugh, the officers were subsequently suspended. Lewis has presented no testimony that the City or Johnson condoned officers\u2019 use of excessive force or unlawful arrests. Further, given the relatively few number of incidents of allegedly excessive force and unlawful arrests, we cannot conclude that such behavior was sufficiently \u201cwidespread and pervasive\u201d to demonstrate a pattern of unconstitutional behavior. <em>See Pineda, </em>291 F.3d at 329 (holding that eleven incidents of allegedly unconstitutional searches were insufficient to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was a custom of unconstitutional searches); <em>Castro v. McCord, 259 </em>Fed.Appx. 664, 669 (5th Cir.2007) (evidence of three shooting deaths in five years prior to trial insufficient to establish a \u201cpersistent, widespread practice\u201d of shootings by county officers); <em>Roberts v. City of Shreveport, </em>397 F.3d 287, 295 (5th Cir.2005) (evidence that officer brandished his handgun during a traffic stop, committed one other incident of deadly force, and was accused of two other claims of excessive force insufficient to establish a \u201cpattern\u201d of unconstitutional conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In addition, even if Lewis could establish that the City and Johnson had a custom of tolerating misconduct that was maintained with deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of the City\u2019s residents, she failed to present any evidence that this custom was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the complained of constitutional violation. As we said in <em>Fraire v. City of Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268,1281 (5th Cir.1992): (footnotes omitted). The actions of Pugh in raping and assaulting Lewis in March 2005 were entirely caused by Pugh. There is simply no evidence in the record that Pugh made the decision to rape Lewis for any reason related to any City policy or custom or understanding thereof which he may have had, or for any reason other than his own motivations for assaulting Lewis. In fact, Lewis herself has referred to Pugh as a \u201crogue\u201d police officer. In sum, the evidence shows no causal connection between the City\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional policy and the actions of Pugh. <em>See Johnson, </em>379 F.3d at 310-11; <em>Hardeman v. Kerr County, </em>244 Fed.Appx. 593, 597 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">[A] direct causal connection must exist between the policy and the alleged constitutional deprivation. This connection must be more than a mere \u2018but for\u2019 coupling between cause and effect. To form the basis of liability under \u00a7 1983, a municipal policy must be affirmatively linked to the constitutional violation and be the moving force behind it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Lewis\u2019s claim based on an alleged custom of tolerating police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">2. <em>Inadequate Procedures for Recording Citizen Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Second, Lewis failed to present evidence sufficient to support her claim that the City should be held liable because it lacked proper procedures to process citizen complaints of police misconduct. Lewis directs the court to Johnson\u2019s testimony that the police department logged only written complaints of officer misconduct, and did not keep records of verbal complaints.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lewis also points to the testimony of Leisha Mosley, who stated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>tried to file a complaint of excessive force with the Jacksonville Police Department, but that she was told by the woman at the front desk that they did not have any forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\u201cKnowledge on the part of a policymaker that a constitutional violation will most likely result from a given official custom or policy is a sine qua non of municipal liability under section 1983.\u201d <em>Burge v. St. Tammany Parish, </em>336 F.3d 363, 370 (5th Cir. 2003). Where, as in the present case, \u201can alleged policy or custom is facially innocuous, establishing the requisite official knowledge requires that a plaintiff establish that an official policy was \u2018promulgated with deliberate indifference to the known or obvious consequences that constitutional violations would result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 579 (5th Cir.2001)). It is undisputed that Johnson is a final policymaker and that Lewis suffered a violation of her Fourth Amendment rights, however Lewis has failed to produce any evidence that Johnson had knowledge that a Fourth Amendment violation would be a highly likely consequence of the record keeping policy. <em>See Id. </em>(affirming dismissal of \u00a7 1983 claim where plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish deliberate indifference or knowledge on the part of the Sheriff that a <em>Brady </em>violation would be a highly likely consequence of the manner in which his office managed its records). Thus, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Even assuming that Lewis could prove that the City and Johnson were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d in not documenting oral complaints of misconduct, Lewis\u2019s claims were properly dismissed because she failed to establish the necessary \u201cdirect causal link\u201d between this policy and the constitutional deprivation at issue \u2014 the rape committed by Pugh. <em>See Johnson, </em>379 F.3d at 310-11</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We now turn to Pugh\u2019s appeal of the judgment against him. On appeal, Pugh argues that both the compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury were excessive. In addition, Pugh contends that the verdict should be reversed because he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The jury awarded Lewis $50,000 in compensatory damages, as well as $250,000 in punitive damages. An assessment of damages is not reversed unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Caldarera v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>705 F.2d 778, 783 (5th Cir.1983). Only where it is \u201cso large as to shock the judicial conscience, so gross or inordinately large as to be contrary to right reason, so exaggerated as to indicate bias, passion, prejudice, corruption, or other improper motive\u201d will we reverse a jury verdict for excessiveness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Pugh argues that the award of $50,000 in compensatory damages was excessive because Lewis failed to mitigate her damages by promptly seeking treatment and failed to present sufficient evidence of pain and suffering related to the assaults. During the trial, Lewis described the March 2005 rape and the August 2005 assault, and the physical injuries she suffered. She further testified that since the attacks, she has felt humiliated, been \u201cscared to do anything,\u201d \u201cscared of the police,\u201d and \u201cscared to go out at night.\u201d Lewis\u2019s daughter, Kenzie Blow, testified that the rape was \u201cdevastating\u201d for Lewis, and that, immediately after the rape Lewis was upset and scared. Blow testified that Lewis suffered physical injuries from the rape, including bruising. Further, Blow indicated that, at the time of trial, Lewis was still affected and was \u201cvery scared and very paranoid.\u201d Finally, Lewis presented evidence that she was taken to the hospital after the August assault and treated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>physical injuries, including abrasions and multiple cuts and scrapes on her legs. Given the evidence and testimony presented at trial, the court is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence of physical injury, pain and suffering, and mental anguish to support the jury\u2019s verdict. In short, we cannot say that an award of $50,000 resulting from the rape and subsequent assault is enough to \u201cshock the judicial conscience\u201d of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In challenging the jury\u2019s award of $250,000 in punitive damages, Pugh contends that the award is excessive, unfair, and contrary to the jury instructions. We construe Pugh\u2019s argument as a challenge to the constitutionality of the size of the punitive damages award. The Supreme Court has articulated three factors that courts should consider in determining whether an award of punitive damages is constitutionally excessive: (1) the defendant\u2019s reprehensibility or culpability; (2) the relationship between the penalty and the harm to the victim caused by the defendant\u2019s actions; and (3) the sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct. <em>Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., </em>532 U.S. 424, 434-35, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001). In the present case, we have no difficulty upholding the jury\u2019s award. First, Pugh\u2019s conduct, utilizing a position of trust to rape and assault a vulnerable woman, is particularly reprehensible. Second, the ratio between the punitive and compensatory damages in this case is 5:1, a ratio not so disproportionate as to \u201cjar one\u2019s constitutional sensibilities.\u201d <em>TXO Production Coup. v. Alliance Resources Carp., </em>509 U.S. 443, 481, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993) (indicating that a ratio between the punitive award and the potential harm of ten to one was not constitutionally infirm); <em>see also Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2605, 171 L.Ed.2d 570 (2008) (adopting a punitive-to-compensatory damages ratio to determine maximum punitive damages award); <em>cf. Watson v. Johnson Mobile Homes, </em>284 F.3d 568, 574 (5th Cir.2002) (remitting punitive damages to $150,000 where jury awarded compensatory damages of $4,000, a ratio of 37.5:1). Finally, the comparable criminal sanctions for Pugh\u2019s conduct are serious, as indicated by the fact that he is currently serving a 12-year sentence for the rape and assault of Lewis. Therefore, we uphold the punitive damages award against Pugh.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Pugh also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during this litigation. This argument is without merit. It is well settled that the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel does not apply in a civil context. <em>See F.T.C. v. Assail, Inc., </em>410 F.3d 256, 267 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-13\">. In the record, Tonya Harris is also referred to as Tonya Sonntag and Sonya Sonntag. For consistency, in this opinion we will use the name Tonya Harris.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-18\">. According to the City, Page tried repeatedly to contact Lewis for an interview, but was unable to reach her until July 21, 2005. At that time she declined to repeat her accusations to Page. Page continued to try and reach Lewis to schedule her for a follow-up interview, but was unable to locate her until October 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\">. The City and Johnson contend that they initiated contact with the district attorney\u2019s office, informing the office of Lewis's allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">. However, at trial, Pugh denied committing either of the assaults against Pugh. He admitted to pleading guilty to criminal charges and to signing a factual resume detailing the assaults, but stated that he only did so for the \"benefit of his family,\u201d not because he was guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">. Lewis relies heavily on the testimony of Page and Johnson that in June 2005 they became aware of allegations of sexual misconduct by Pugh, and that some of the misconduct may have occurred prior to Lewis\u2019s rape. However, this awareness arose only after Pugh\u2019s rape of Lewis, and thus could not have put Johnson or the City on notice of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>propensity for sexual violence by Pugh. <em>See, e.g., Cano v. Bexar County, </em>280 Fed.Appx. 404, 406 (5th Cir.2008) (\"Of course, the investigations subsequent to the instant incident are not relevant because such incidents could not have informed [the] County\u2019s judgment with respect to the instant claim.\"). Lewis also produced other evidence of various claims of excessive force and sexual misconduct arising after the March 2005 rape of Lewis. However, again, because these incidents all occurred after Lewis\u2019s rape, they could not have provided the City or Johnson with the required notice, and are not relevant to Lewis\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\">. Lewis's briefing on this point is particularly confusing. Although Lewis identifies this argument as an issue in her \u201cStatement of Issues,\u201d she fails to specifically identify the exact policy or custom complained of and her argument section seems to focus only on her supervisory liability claim. Nonetheless, Defendants have briefed this issue, so despite the inadequacy of Lewis\u2019s briefing, we will attempt to discern Lewis\u2019s argument and address it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\">. Lewis argues that no investigation was taken after the Lacey incident, but her citation to Johnson\u2019s deposition testimony does not support that assertion. During Johnson\u2019s deposition, counsel for the City stated that he was unwilling to stipulate that no investigation had occurred, but would stipulate that \"at this time I have seen no formal file of an internal affairs investigation.\u201d Johnson then testified that he ordered Lieutenant Page to investigate the incident, but that he \u201d[did]n't remember if there was an actual internal affairs investigation, or if it was said, \u2018Hey, turn this over to the FBI.' I know we turned it over to the FBI immediately.\u201d Nothing in the record supports Lewis\u2019s assertion that the department never investigated the incident. Further, it is undisputed that the City held a community meeting in response to the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">. Regarding the police department's handling of complaints, Johnson testified that if a person came into the police station complaining of officer misconduct, the lieutenant would listen to the complaint, ask him to fill out a \"packet,\" and then to return the \"packet\u201d so the department could investigate the misconduct. If the \"packet\" was returned, the complainant would keep a copy, the officer accused of misconduct gets a copy, and the officer\u2019s supervisor would get a copy in order to determine what investigation was necessary. Johnson testified that complaints made verbally of police misconduct were not documented or kept on file by the police department, but that written complaints were filed in the personnel file of the individual officer accused of misconduct. He testified that there was no central place where all complaints of excessive force or unlawful arrest were filed and that he wasn\u2019t aware of whether the department\u2019s current computer system contained a database of complaints. He indicated that the department was in the process of updating the computer system so that there would be a data bank of complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\">. In addition, Pugh did not move for a new trial or remittitur in the district court, thereby depriving the district court of the opportunity to correct any alleged imperfections in the jury award. Therefore, arguably, Pugh did not preserve this issue for appeal. <em>See Carlton v. H.C. Price Co., </em>640 F.2d 573, 577 (5th Cir.1981) (\"We have held that \u2018there can be no appellate review (of allegedly excessive or inadequate damages) if the trial court was not given an opportunity to exercise its discretion on a motion for new trial.' \") (quoting <em>Baker v. Dillon, </em>389 F.2d 57, 58 (5th Cir.1968)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
