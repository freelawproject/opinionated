The district court, over Adams\u2019s objection, set a base offense level of 20 on the assumption that his Indiana felony conviction for driving under the influence is a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) cmt. n. 1. The court sentenced Adams to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the imprisonment range. Had the court sustained Adams\u2019s objection, his base offense level would have been 14, and his imprisonment range, 24 to 30 months. Adams now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-22\">During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court overruled circuit precedent and held in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), that drunk driving is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as that term is defined in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). <em>Cf United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number><em>States v. Sperberg, </em>432 F.3d 706, 708 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that Wisconsin felony conviction for driving under the influence is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA). Adams was not sentenced under the ACCA, but in <em>Sperberg, </em>432 F.3d at 708, we concluded that \u201cviolent felony\u201d and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d have the same meaning, <em>compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and even before <em>Sperberg </em>we had held that felony drunk driving is a crime of violence under the pertinent section of the guidelines, <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>54 F.3d 370, 376-77 (7th Cir. 1995). As the government anticipated, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Begay </em>abrogates our holding in <em>Rutherford. </em>We thus conclude that Adams must be resentenced. His sentence on each count is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
