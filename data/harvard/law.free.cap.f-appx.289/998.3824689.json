Moms, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Appellee Cadence Design System\u2019s (\u201cCadence\u201d) motion for summary judgment and dismissing Appellant Morris\u2019s claims because Morris lacked standing to assert those claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-21\">Morris\u2019s claims arise out of his contention that Cadence breached certain provisions of a Product Purchase, Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>(\u201cCadence-Simutech Agreement\u201d or \u201cAgreement\u201d), entered into by Cadence and Simutech on November 5, 1999. It is important to note that Morris is not a named party to the Agreement. It is undisputed that Cadence did not consent to any assignment or transfer to Morris of Cadence\u2019s rights under the Agreement. Instead, Morris\u2019s case is based on the theory that a non-party entity, RaveSim, assigned to Morris \u201cby operation of law\u201d the right to sue Cadence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">We review the factual and procedural history. In 1995, Morris founded and became the chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of Simutech, a Beaverton, Oregon-based high technology company. In November 1999, Simutech entered into the Cadence-Simutech Agreement to co-develop and market a type of computer hardware called an emulator. Under the Cadence-Simutech Agreement, Simutech gave Cadence certain rights to purchase Simutech\u2019s hardware prototyping system and certain rights to resell that system, and granted Cadence a manufacturing license for related products. The Cadence-Simutech Agreement expressly prohibited either of the two contracting parties from assigning or transferring any rights under the Agreement without the express, written consent of the other party. ER 84. The Agreement was subject to some exceptions, one of which was, where an assignment is made \u201cin connection with the transfer of all, or a substantial portion[ ] of [one party\u2019s] assets,\u201d then consent by the other party is not required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">In March 2001, Cadence advised Simutech that it would no longer invest in Simutech. Simutech started to steadily \u201cdrift[ ] toward insolvency.\u201d In April 2001, Simutech secured a loan from a Cayman Islands-based company, Kirnaf, Ltd. (\u201cKirnaf\u2019). As part of that loan agreement, Simutech pledged to Kirnaf a security interest in and a lien on all of Simutech\u2019s assets. In June 2001, Cadence unveiled the <em>Palladium </em>emulator. Morris immediately realized that the <em>Palladium </em>emulator would be in direct competition with Simutech\u2019s <em>RAVE </em>emulator. Morris, the Founder and CEO of Simutech, approached Simutech\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) about bringing a lawsuit against Cadence. The Board declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">In August 2001, Kirnaf gave Simutech an additional bridge loan in the amount of $500,000. According to Morris, the Kirnaf funding was, however, \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d In September 2001, Simutech publicly announced that it had failed to secure the financing that would have enabled it to carry on its business. Simutech laid off all of its employees and shut its doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">In October 2001, when Simutech was unable to pay back Kirnaf s loan, Kirnaf demanded payment and commenced foreclosure proceedings against Simutech. Kirnaf then purchased all of Simutech\u2019s assets at a public auction and transferred them to a newly formed entity, RaveSim. Morris sued Simutech for an unpaid bonus and personal debt that he had incurred on Simutech\u2019s behalf. Monis obtained a default judgment against Simutech and then sued RaveSim to collect on that judgment. Monis and RaveSim settled that lawsuit and entered into a Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">The Settlement Agreement stated that RaveSim would be obligated to assign to Monis a claim against Cadence if, and only if, the following four conditions precedent all took place: (1) Morris provided RaveSim with information on the claims that he believed existed; (2) RaveSim de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>termined that it would not pursue a claim against Cadence; (3) an independent assessment from a mutually-selected, neutral third party determined that a valid claim existed; and (4) RaveSim still declined to bring suit against Cadence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The district court correctly concluded that the first two conditions were met: (1) Morris did provide information to RaveSim that he believed supported a claim; and (2) after reviewing that information, RaveSim declined to sue Cadence. As to the third condition precedent, however, the district court found no evidence in the record of a third-party assessment. Morris testified that he never worked with RaveSim or Kirnaf to select a third-party assessor. He also testified that he never received or obtained from RaveSim an assignment of the right to sue Cadence following the execution of the Settlement Agreement. Because RaveSim and Morris never mutually selected a third-party assessor, the third condition precedent was not satisfied, thereby obviating the need to satisfy the fourth (that RaveSim, upon obtaining information from the third-party assessor, declined again to sue Cadence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Morris contends that the Settlement Agreement obviated the requirement that he obtain formal, written assignment of RaveSim\u2019s claim against Cadence. A July 2003 letter from RaveSim and Kirnafs attorney to Morris stated: \u201cwe write to notify you that after thorough and careful consideration, RaveSim and Kirnaf each have decided not to file a legal action against Cadence .... if you desire to commence an action in your own name, please have your attorney contact us regarding assignment, indemnity in favor of RaveSim and Kirnaf and other related issues.\u201d Neither Moms nor his attorney ever acted on this instruction. Still, Morris argues that RaveSim\u2019s failure to seek a third-party assessment effectively assigned to him the Cadence claim \u201cby operation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">In February 2004, Morris\u2019s attorney contacted RaveSim stating that \u201c[i]t is now urgent that the assignment be completed.\u201d RaveSim responded: \u201cMorris is not entitled to an assignment of any potential claim that RaveSim may have against [Cadence], absent a finding by a third party that a viable claim exists.\u201d Neither Morris nor RaveSim sought third-party assessment of any valid claims. In August 2004, Morris advised RaveSim that he had nonetheless filed a claim against Cadence. RaveSim responded that it \u201cremain[ed] unwilling ... to assign any possible claim\u201d to Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">In short, Morris contends that because RaveSim neither sued Cadence nor sought a third-party assessment, per the Settlement Agreement, RaveSim effectively \u201cassigned\u201d the Cadence claim to Morris \u201cby operation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">The district court disagreed and granted Cadence\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment. <em>Balint v. Carson City, </em>180 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir. 1999). Summary judgment is appropriate when a mixed question of law and fact involved undisputed underlying facts. <em>See Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank of Am. Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>322 F.3d 1039, 1046 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">First, contract law requires that conditions precedent be met before one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>party to a contract is entitled to performance by the other party to the contract. <em>Porter v. Meier Chevrolett-Buick, Inc., </em>254 Or. 482, 461 P.2d 527, 528 (1969) (\u201cUntil the condition was met the contract did not come into operative existence.\u201d); <em>Springfield Int\u2019l Rest., Inc. v. Sharley, </em>44 Or.App. 138, 605 P.2d 1188, 1192 (1980) (\u201c[a] contract to assign a right in the future is not an assignment.\u201d). RaveSim was required to assign the claim if, and only if, the requirements of the Settlement Agreement were fully satisfied. As the district court correctly concluded, the four conditions precedent were never met and Morris\u2019s right to an assignment from RaveSim never accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Second, Morris argued that he was entitled to an assignment from RaveSim of the right to sue Cadence \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d The district court, however, correctly concluded that the Settlement Agreement \u201cclearly and unambiguously states\u201d that \u201cRaveSim <em>will assign </em>its right to pursue ... a claim against Cadence to Morris and Morris will have the right to pursue the claim and recover any damages from Cadence.\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. 14, 2006 WL 1643529. We have held that \u201cthe assignee must come forth with evidence that the assignor meant to assign rights and obligations under the contracts.\u201d <em>Britton v. Co-op Banking Group, </em>4 F.3d 742, 746 (9th Cir.1993). There is no evidence that RaveSim intended to assign to Morris its claim against Cadence without satisfying the four conditions precedent in the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Third, Morris\u2019s argument that RaveSim\u2019s failure to enlist a third party assessor automatically waived the third condition precedent is not supported by law. <em>Guardian Mgmt., LLC v. Zamiello, </em>194 Or.App. 524, 95 P.3d 1139, 1142 (2004), held that \u201cwaiver of a legal right requires a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act or inaction of the party demonstrating the party\u2019s intention to relinquish the right.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, RaveSim demonstrated every intention otherwise: it contacted Morris, stated that it would not bring a claim against Cadence, and asked Morris to have his attorney contact RaveSim\u2019s <em>to </em>discuss\u2014 and only to discuss \u2014 the possibility of assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">As the district court noted, the only authority that Morris cites is an inapposite one. In <em>Stefansson v. The Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States, </em>No. 5:04CV40(DF), 2005 WL 2277486 (M.D.Ga. Sept.19, 2005), the court held that where a claims administrator has not issued a formal benefits determination within 45 days after receiving a claim, the relevant ERISA statute deems the claim denied, the administrative remedies exhausted, and allows the claimant to seek judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>review of the claim. <em>Id. </em>at *9-10. Morris\u2019s reliance on <em>Stefcmsson </em>is misplaced. ERISA explicitly provides that \u201c[i]f notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished [within 90 days], the claim shall be <em>deemed denied.\u201d Id. </em>at *9 n. 15. The Settlement Agreement at issue here contains no such provision. The district court therefore correctly concluded that Morris\u2019s waiver argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Lastly, the district court correctly concluded that Morris\u2019s reliance on the exception to the Agreement\u2019s general statement of nonassignability is also misplaced. The Agreement states that no consent to assignment of any right is required where the assignment is \u201cin connection with the transfer of all, or a substantial portionf] of [the assignor\u2019s] assets.\u201d Morris argues that the transfer of the right to sue Cadence that passed from Simutech to Kirnaf to RaveSim to Morris falls under one of the Agreement\u2019s exceptions, thereby permitting Morris\u2019s third-party enforcement of the Cadence-Simutech Agreement and conferring upon him standing to bring this suit. Cadence does not dispute that there was a valid transfer of assets between Simutech and RaveSim. As the district court correctly noted, there is no evidence that RaveSim ever transferred any assets to Morris in connection with the purported assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Absent evidence that RaveSim explicitly assigned any rights to Morris; that RaveSim waived any of the conditions precedent in the Settlement Agreement; or that the asset-transfer exception to the Simutech-Cadence Agreement was triggered (which it was not), it is clear that the district court correctly granted Cadence\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Cadence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1021-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">. If and when RaveSim assigned to Morris its rights against Cadence, Morris was then required by the Settlement Agreement to protect RaveSim by indemnifying it against all costs and attorneys\u2019 fees that RaveSim incurred from any lawsuit and any claims brought by Cadence in response to such action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">. <em>Sharley </em>is instructive. In that case, a buyer of a restaurant, who held a judgment against a third party, agreed with the seller of that restaurant to assign that judgment as part of the purchase of the restaurant. 605 P.2d at 1190. The buyer executed an assignment, which was reviewed by the seller and then placed into escrow pending the closing of the sale of the restaurant. <em>Id. </em>The court found that the assignment was only one part of the larger sale, \"with the formal delivery of the assignment ... not intended until the transaction closed in escrow; and with closing dependent on numerous conditions that had not yet occurred at the time of execution of the assignment.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1192. Permitting the seller to review the assignment before it was placed into escrow \"was not a formal delivery of the assignment to [the seller].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, RaveSim never consummated a \"formal delivery\u201d to Morris of the right to sue Cadence. Instead, the Settlement Agreement provided only that \"RaveSim <em>will assign </em>its right\u201d if the conditions precedent were all met.
