(\u201cGEGLAC\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s judgment awarding disability benefits to Robert Dunn, a beneficiary under a group disability plan. We conclude that the district court gave an overly restrictive interpretation to the plan administrator\u2019s discretion. We REVERSE, RENDER and REMAND this case to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of GEGLAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">I. Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b800-23\">Robert Dunn had been an employee of ProAmerica for less than one year when he suffered a disabling stroke on September 23, 1997. After suffering the stroke, Dunn applied for disability benefits under ProAmeriea\u2019s long term group disability plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The Plan was insured and administered by GEGLAC. GEGLAC approved Dunn\u2019s application and arrived at a monthly benefit based on Dunn\u2019s \u201cBasic Monthly Earnings\u201d (\u201cBME\u201d) prior to his stroke. The Plan defines BME as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-24\">\u201cBasic Monthly Earnings\u201d means your gross monthly compensation from your employer including the gross monthly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>rate of commissions and Bonus Pay during the calendar year(s) prior to your Period of Disability as specified below. It includes employee pre-tax contributions to a deferred compensation plan which is defined by a documented predetermined formula. It does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">1. overtime pay; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">2. any other fringe benefit or extra compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Calendar year(s) earnings will be averaged for the lesser of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">1. the prior calendar year(s) before the date your Period of Disability begins or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">2. the period of employment if less than one calendar year(s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">ProAmerica reported that Dunn\u2019s monthly salary prior to his stroke was $4,000.00. Based on this information, GEGLAC calculated Dunn\u2019s BME to be $4,000.00 and paid him the correlative monthly benefit from December 1997 to October 2002, the maximum period of eligibility under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">In November 2002, Dunn requested a review of his monthly benefit calculation. Dunn argued that GEGLAC\u2019s BME calculation erroneously omitted $6,171.00 in commissions that were <em>paid </em>to Dunn by ProAmerica prior to his stroke. GEGLAC agreed with Dunn and adjusted his BME from $4,000.00 to $4,508.53. This increase accounted for the previously omitted commissions. GEGLAC issued a check in the amount of $20,225.79, representing the additional amount of monthly benefits owed during Dunn\u2019s period of eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">In February 2003, Dunn requested another review. This time he argued that his BME should be adjusted to account for an additional $9,600.00 in commissions that he <em>earned </em>prior to his stroke, even though those commissions were not paid by ProAmerica until after his stroke. GEG-LAC denied Dunn\u2019s request for a recalculation because the additional commissions were not actually paid \u201cprior to [Dunn\u2019s] Period of Disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Dunn sued GEGLAC in Texas state court, alleging only state law causes of action. GEGLAC removed on the basis of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) preemption, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>and Dunn amended his complaint to allege only an ERISAbased cause of action. GEGLAC\u2019s summary judgment motion was denied. The court conducted a bench trial which resulted in a judgment against GEGLAC. The parties stipulated that the benefits under Dunn\u2019s interpretation would be $36,618.46. Judgment in that amount was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">GEGLAC appeals, arguing that the district court erred by (1) finding that GEG-LAC\u2019s interpretation of the plan was not \u201clegally correct\u201d and (2) holding that GEG-LAC\u2019s decision to include only those commissions actually paid in the BME calculation constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Au09\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>High v. E-Systems Inc., </em>459 F.3d 573, 576 (5th Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). However, because the language of this ERISA plan grants GEGLAC the discretion to interpret the Plan and determine a claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits, we will set aside GEGLAC\u2019s benefits decision only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">This court applies a two-step analysis to determine whether the plan administrator abused its discretion in construing plan terms. <em>Pylant v. Hartford Life and Acci</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number><em>dent Ins. Co., </em>497 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2007). First, we determine whether the administrator\u2019s interpretation is \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If so, there is no abuse of discretion and the inquiry ends. <em>Id. </em>However, if the administrator has not given the plan a legally correct interpretation, we must consider whether the administrator\u2019s interpretation constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.-, see High, </em>459 F.3d at 577 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Our precedents recognize that we need not take the first step in the analysis if we can determine that the administrator\u2019s benefits decision was not an abuse of discretion. <em>High, </em>459 F.3d at 577; <em>MacLachlan v. ExxonMobil Corp., </em>350 F.3d 472, 481 (5th Cir.2003). This means that GEG-LAC\u2019s interpretation of the Plan, even if legally incorrect, will be affirmed so long as it constitutes a reasonable exercise of interpretive discretion. When reviewing the exercise of discretion, we must \u201canalyze whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously.\u201d <em>Meditrust Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Sterling Chems., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 214 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cA decision is arbitrary only if made without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215 (quotation marks omitted). This court\u2019s \u201creview of the administrator\u2019s decision need not be particularly complex or technical; it need only assure that the administrator\u2019s decision fall somewhere on a continuum of reasonableness \u2014 even if on the low end.\u201d <em>Corry v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston, </em>499 F.3d 389, 398 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We will explain the reasons that we find GEGLAC did not abuse its discretion when it interpreted the Plan to include only commissions actually paid in the BME calculation. That conclusion means we need not determine whether the interpretation was also \u201clegally correct.\u201d We note, however, that the decision to skip the first step is not tantamount to endorsing the district court\u2019s conclusion that GEG-LAC\u2019s interpretation of the Plan was not a legally correct one. Instead, it is a recognition that an analysis of legal correctness is superfluous in a case such as this, where the minimally-conflicted administrator has given a reasonable interpretation to ambiguous plan language. In accordance with our precedent, we turn directly to the second step in our analysis and consider whether GEGLAC abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">\n<em>B. GEGLAC\u2019s discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">We structure our review around GEG-LAC\u2019s objections that the district court (1) improperly applied the rule of <em>contra proferentem </em>to construe the Plan terms against GEGLAC and (2) gave GEGLAC\u2019s interpretation of the Plan insufficient deference under the abuse of discretion analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">1. <em>Contra Proferentem</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">The district court found the Plan language ambiguous and applied the doctrine of <em>contra proferentem, </em>i.e., interpreting a contract against the drafter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this Circuit\u2019s \u201cunique two-step approach to applying] the abuse of discretion standard, [] <em>contra proferentem </em>may properly be used under the first step.\u201d <em>Rhorer v. Raytheon Engineers and Constructors, Inc., </em>181 F.3d 634, 642 (5th Cir.1999). GEG-LAC correctly notes that the rule of <em>contra -proferentem </em>is inapplicable under the second step of our analysis, because GEG-LAC\u2019s discretion to interpret the Plan necessarily includes the power to resolve any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ambiguities therein. <em>High, </em>459 F.8d at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Here, the district court was confronted with two reasonable interpretations of the Plan and applied <em>contra proferentem </em>to resolve the ambiguity, construing the language against GEGLAC. His application of the rule was confined to determining whether GEGLAC\u2019s interpretation of the Plan was \u201clegally correct,\u201d the first step in the analysis. This was a proper use of <em>contra proferentem </em>under our ERISA precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">2. Conflict of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Dunn argued and the district court agreed that GEGLAC was operating under a conflict of interest because it was both the insurer and the administrator of the Plan. Courts must account for any conflict when reviewing an administrator\u2019s benefits decision. The Supreme Court has noted that when \u201ca benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator ... who is operating under a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighed as a facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 108 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">When a conflict of interest is identified, this court applies a \u201csliding scale\u201d to assess the potential impact of the conflict. <em>Lain v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>279 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cThe greater the evidence of conflict on the part of the administrator, the less deferential our abuse of discretion standard will be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018When a minimal basis for a conflict is established, we review the decision with only a <em>modicum less </em>deference than we otherwise would.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original; quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">According to the district court, GEG-LAC\u2019s dual role created a conflict \u201cnear that end of the sliding scale continuum approaching an absolute conflict of interest and compels a finding that its interpretation of this contract term is entitled to minimal deference.\u201d The district court supported its decision with the following language from an Eleventh Circuit opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">[W]hen a plan beneficiary demonstrates a <em>substantial conflict of interest </em>on the part of the fiduciary responsible for benefits determinations, the burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove that its interpretation of plan provisions committed to its discretion was not tainted by self-interest. That is, a wrong but apparently reasonable interpretation is arbitrary and capricious if it advances the conflicting interest of the fiduciary at the expense of the affected beneficiary or beneficiaries unless the <em>fiduciary justifies </em>the interpretation on the ground of its benefit to the class of all participants and beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-12\"><em>Brown v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc., </em>898 F.2d 1556, 1566-67 (11th Cir.1990) (emphasis added). GEG-LAC does not dispute that its dual role as insurer and administrator creates a conflict of interest under this court\u2019s precedent, <em>see Pylant, </em>497 F.3d at 539, but argues that the district court improperly weighed that conflict under this court\u2019s \u201csliding scale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">As an initial matter, the <em>Brown </em>test from another Circuit is at odds with this court\u2019s settled treatment of administrator conflicts under ERISA. In fact, we have expressly rejected <em>Brown\u2019s </em>\u201cpresumptively void\u201d standard. <em>Vega v. National Life Ins. Sens., </em>188 F.3d 287, 296-98 (5th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Under our precedent, the burden remains on the claimant to muster any evidence of a conflict that would undermine the administrator\u2019s benefits decision; it does not shift to the administrator to prove that its decision was not self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>interested. <em>See id. </em>at 298-99. GEGLAC\u2019s dual role as administrator and insurer is merely one factor in the overall abuse of discretion analysis. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. </em>Glenn,-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2348-49, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Further, Dunn has not demonstrated that GEGLAC\u2019s decision was tainted by a \u201csubstantial\u201d conflict of interest. GEG-LAC\u2019s dual role as administrator and insurer creates only a <em>minimal conflict, </em>not a substantial one. <em>Corry, </em>499 F.3d at 398. Dunn has offered no other evidence of a conflict of interest. In such a case, where the claimant has identified GEGLAC\u2019s dual role as administrator and insurer but has pointed to no further evidence of a conflict, we review GEGLAC\u2019s decision with \u201conly a modicum less deference\u201d than would otherwise be afforded under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id.; Pylant, </em>497 F.3d at 539. Quite contrary to the standard announced in <em>Brown, </em>under these circumstances we will defer to GEGLAC\u2019s interpretation of the Plan, even if that interpretation is \u201cwrong\u201d (in the sense that it is legally incorrect), so long as GEG-LAC\u2019s interpretation \u201cfall[s] somewhere on a continuum of reasonableness.... \u201d <em>Corry, </em>499 F.3d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">In summary, two equally rational interpretations of the Plan language are involved in this dispute. Under the Plan, \u201c \u2018Basic Monthly Earnings\u2019 means your gross monthly compensation from your employer including the <em>gross monthly rate of commissions </em>and Bonus pay <em>during the calendar year(s) prior </em>to your Period of Disability....\u201d The term \u201ccommissions\u201d is not qualified in any way <em>(e.g., </em>\u201ccommissions <em>paid\u201d </em>or \u201ccommissions <em>earned\u201d). </em>Dunn\u2019s interpretation of BME to include all commissions earned during the year prior to his stroke is certainly reasonable; but, GEGLAC\u2019s interpretation of BME to include only those commissions actually paid is also reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this classic example of ambiguous plan language, GEGLAC was permitted to apply an interpretation of the Plan that was reasonable and not arrived at in an arbitrary and capricious manner. We find reasonableness and no caprice.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Therefore, we REVERSE the judgment in favor of Dunn, RENDER judgment for GEGLAC, and REMAND for entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>REVERSED, RENDERED, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The rule of <em>contra proferentem </em>is a rule of last resort under which ambiguities in contract language are resolved against the drafter. <em>High, </em>459 F.3d at 578-79; <em>see </em>11 Samuel Williston <em>&amp; </em>Richard A.

In <em>Glenn, </em>the Supreme Court confirmed that \u201cthe fact that a plan administrator both evaluates claims for benefits and pays benefits claims\" creates a conflict of interest that must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. 128 S.Ct. at 2348-49 (citing <em>Firestone, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948). In addressing how such a conflict must be accounted for under an abuse of discretion review, the Court eschewed \"special burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or evidentiary rules, focused narrowly upon the evaluator/payor conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2351. The Court's treatment of the evaluator/payor conflict as merely one factor in the overall abuse of discretion analysis is more closely aligned with this court\u2019s \"sliding scale\u201d approach than the Eleventh Circuit's \"presumptively void\u201d standard. <em>Compare id. </em>at 2350-52 <em>with Vega, </em>188 F.3d at 298-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-12\">.
