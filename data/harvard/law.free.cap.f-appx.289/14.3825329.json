The district court upwardly departed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and sentenced Garcia to 110 months of imprisonment three years of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently, and ordered him to pay $2,620 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Garcia argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in upwardly departing pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and that his sentence was otherwise unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">An appellate court\u2019s review of a sentence must start with the issue whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court then considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, where the defendant fails to object, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679, 681 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Garcia argues that the district court procedurally erred in upwardly departing pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 because he already had received criminal history points for the prior offenses pointed out by the district court in its decision to upwardly depart and for the proximity of two of those prior offenses to the instant offense. However, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in upwardly departing because Garcia\u2019s recidivism and dangerousness are independent factors warranting an upward departure, and the district court sufficiently considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in upwardly departing. <em>See Jones, </em>489 F.3d at 681; <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Medina-Gutierrez, </em>980 F.2d 980, 984 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Garcia further argues that his sentence was otherwise substantively unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because it did not take into account his cocaine addiction, his medical condition, his motive of supporting his family, his need for drug treatment, or the fact that deterrence was unwarranted. However, the district court considered these factors and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing, and thus Garcia has failed to demonstrate that the district imposed an unreasonable sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 442 and n. 62 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
