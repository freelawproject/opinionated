TYMKOVICH, United States Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Jorge Munoz-Chavez pleaded guilty in federal court to the following three counts:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">(1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, (2) possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, and (3) reentry of a removed alien. He was sentenced to a total of 120 months in prison. After Munoz-Chavez filed a timely notice of appeal, his counsel filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief and moved to withdraw his representation. Munoz-Chavez did not file any materials on his own behalf. Because we agree that Munoz-Chavez has no meritorious claims on appeal, we GRANT his counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, and AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">Prior to sentencing, the probation office completed a presentence investigation report (PSR) for Munoz-Chavez\u2019s case. The PSR concluded Munoz-Chavez had a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of IV. Based on this offense level and criminal history, the PSR calculated a United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) range of 70 to 87 months. The PSR concluded, however, that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court adopted the PSR without change and sentenced Munoz-Chavez to 120 months in prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On appeal, Munoz-Chavez argues the district court should have imposed a Guidelines sentence of between 70 and 87 months, rather than the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. We review a federal criminal sentence for reasonableness, giving deference to the district court under \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). But we review a court\u2019s interpretation of statutes and the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We agree with Munoz-Chavez\u2019s counsel that there are no non-frivolous grounds on which to challenge the sentence. First, the district court properly concluded the provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) requiring a minimum ten-year sentence applies in this case. Section 841(b)(l)(B)(vii) prescribes a sentencing range for defendants guilty of possessing with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana. Under this section, a defendant must be sentenced to a minimum of 120 months in prison if the defendant committed the offense after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense had become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Here, Munoz-Chavez pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(vii). Furthermore, he had previously pleaded guilty to possessing with intent to distribute 50 kilograms or more of marijuana. And this previous felony conviction became final before he committed the offense at issue in this appeal. Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding the ten-year mandatory minimum provision applies to Munoz-Chavez.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Second, Munoz-Chavez does not have any non-frivolous grounds to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). We have unequivocally held mandatory minimum sentences are constitutional. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hams, </em>447 F.3d 1300, 1307 (10th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cBooker</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not preclude a court from imposing a statutory minimum established by Congress based on a defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hatch, </em>925 F.2d 362, 363 (10th Cir.1991) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that mandatory minimum sentences violate the Eighth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Third, Munoz-Chavez is not eligible for statutorily-authorized relief from his mandatory minimum sentence. Under certain limited circumstances, a district court may impose a Guidelines-range sentence, rather than a mandatory minimum sentence, for violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). To be eligible for this exception, the defendant must not \u201chave more than one criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(1). Here, Munoz-Chavez has a total of seven criminal history points. Because Munoz-Chavez is not eligible for this exception, the district court did not err in imposing the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">After a careful review of the record, we conclude Munoz-Chavez has no meritorious claims on appeal. We therefore GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b351-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
