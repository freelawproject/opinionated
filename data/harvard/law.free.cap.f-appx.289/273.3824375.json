O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Daniel Pesengulo Lucero, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the petition as well as Lucero\u2019s constructive application for a Certificate of Appealability (COA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also denied Lucero\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis (ifp) </em>on appeal as procedurally deficient. In this Court, Lucero requests a COA and again seeks leave to proceed <em>ifp </em>on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1), 24(a)(5). We deny both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b296-16\">Lucero was convicted in 1999 by a jury of two counts of first degree burglary, one count of second degree assault, two counts of menacing, two counts of child abuse, one count of harassment, and two counts of a crime of violence. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence and, on March 11, 2002, the Colorado Supreme Court denied Lucero\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. Lucero did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Accordingly, under federal habeas law, Lucero\u2019s conviction became final on June 10, 2002, when the time to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-17\">On two separate occasions, Lucero filed for post-conviction relief in state court. On July 30, 2002, Lucero sought a reduction of his sentence under Rule 35(b) of the Colorado Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state trial court denied Lucero\u2019s motion on August 9, 2002; he did not appeal. A little more than a year later, on September 5, 2003, Lucero again sought state court post-conviction relief, this time asking the court to set aside his conviction under Rule 35(c) of the Colorado Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>nied relief on October 29, 2003, and the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed on November 17, 2005. The Colorado Supreme Court subsequently denied Lucero\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari on March 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On September 26, 2006, Lucero filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in federal court asserting various constitutional violations related to his trial. The State filed an answer asserting the affirmative defense that Lucero\u2019s petition was filed beyond the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); <em>Kilgore v. Attorney Gen. of Colo., </em>519 F.3d 1084, 1089 (10th Cir.2008) (untimeliness of a \u00a7 2254 petition \u201cmust either be pled by the government as an affirmative defense, or be clear from the face of the petition itself\u2019). The district court dismissed the petition as time barred, determining Lucero\u2019s conviction became final and the limitations period began to run on June 10, 2002. <em>See Locke v. Saffle, </em>237 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir. 2001) (\u201cUnder the statute, a petitioner\u2019s conviction is not final and the one-year limitation period for filing a federal habeas petition does not begin to run until \u2014 following a decision by the state court of last resort \u2014 after the United States Supreme Court has denied review, or, if no petition for certiorari is filed, after the time for filing a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court has passed.\u201d) (quotations omitted). The district court concluded the time ran on the one-year limitation until July 30, 2002, (49 days) when it was tolled by the filing of Lucero\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion with the state trial court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (tolling the time during which a properly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review is pending). The statute of limitations remained tolled until September 23, 2002, when the time to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the Rule 35(b) motion expired. <em>See </em>Colo. R.App. P. 4(b) (notice of appeal in criminal case must be filed \u201cwithin forty-five days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from\u201d). The court then determined Lucero had 316 days from September 23, 2002, or until August 5, 2003, in which to file his \u00a7 2254 petition. He did not do so until September 26, 2006, over three years late. Therefore, his petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Lucero argued his 35(c) motion also tolled the running of the statute of limitations. The district court considered this argument but determined the Rule 35(c) motion did not toll the statute of limitations because it was filed after the limitations period had already expired. It also declined to apply Lucero\u2019s grounds for equitable tolling because they related to the late blooming Rule 35(c) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">II. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">A COA is a jurisdictional pre-requisite to our review. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA only if Lucero makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Since the district court dismissed his habeas petition on procedural grounds, Lucero must demonstrate both that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>English v. Cody, </em>241 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In support of his request for a COA, Lucero argues his conviction did not become final under Colorado law until July 26, 2002, when he filed his Rule 35(b) motion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (rather than June 10, 2002, when the time expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court). To arrive at this date, Lucero relies on a quote from the Colorado Supreme Court opinion <em>Ghrist v. People, </em>which says: \u201cThe timely filing of a 35(b) motion suspends finality of sentence while the court reconsiders the original sentence.\u201d 897 P.2d 809, 814 (Colo.1995). Under Lucero\u2019s theory, the time between when the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari (March 11, 2002) and when he filed for Rule 35(b) relief (July 26, 2002) does not count against the federal habeas one-year statute of limitations. He then asserts the statute of limitations was tolled from July 26, 2002, until September 23, 2002, the period his Rule 35(b) proceedings were pending, and from September 5, 2003, to March 13, 2006, the period his Rule 35(c) proceedings were pending. He further asserts equitable grounds warrant tolling the 196 days between the conclusion of his Rule 35(c) proceedings and when he filed for federal habeas relief on September 26, 2006. Because only 346 days elapsed between when his Rule 35(b) motion became final (September 23, 2002) and when he filed for Rule 35(c) relief (September 5, 2003), Lucero argues his petition was timely. Lucero assumes State law-trumps the federal habeas corpus finality rules. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The law is clear: \u201c[The] 1-year period of limitation ... shall run from ... the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of <em>direct review </em>or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Because Lucero did not seek direct review from the United States Supreme Court, his conviction became final and the habeas clock began to ran the day after the time for filing a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court passed (June 11, 2002). <em>See Locke, </em>237 F.3d at 1273. According to Rule 13(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, Lucero had 90 days from March 11, 2002, to file a petition for writ of certiorari. Therefore, his conviction became final on <em>direct review </em>on June 10, 2002.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lucero had one year from that date to file his habeas petition unless equitable or statutory reasons tolled the statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Lucero\u2019s Rule 35(b) proceeding from June 26, 2002, to September 23, 2002, occurred after his conviction became final and only served to temporarily suspend the running of the statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Id.; see also, People v. Rodriguez, </em>914 P.2d 230, 249 (Colo.1996) (describing Rule 35 proceedings as permissible, not mandatory, post-conviction relief). After crediting all statutory tolling, Lucero\u2019s one-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>limitations period expired on August 8, 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Attachment 1, Habeas Time-line. His subsequent Rule 35(c) motion filed on September 5, 2003, fell outside this date and cannot toll the limitations period. For the same reason, Lucero\u2019s equitable tolling arguments tied to his Rule 35(c) proceedings cannot toll the limitations period. Lucero\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief on September 25, 2006, was late by all accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We GRANT Lucero\u2019s motion to submit an amended brief in support of a COA, which we have considered. Lucero\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED and his nascent appeal is dismissed. With regard to his request to proceed <em>ifp </em>on appeal, Lucero was required to show \u201ca financial inability to pay the required filing fees, and the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991). We DENY his request because he failed to present a non-frivolous argument. We order him to immediately remit the full amount of the filing fee and remind him of his obligation to do so even though this appeal has been dismissed. <em>See Kinnell v. Graves, </em>265 F.3d 1125, 1129 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Attachment 1</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Habeas Timeline 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Event Clock</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Date Event Start</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">06/21/99 Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">10/18/01 Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">03/11/02 Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">06/10/02 90 days to file for certiorari with 06/10/02 U.S. Supreme Court expired <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">07/26/02 Lucero filed for Colorado Rule 35(b) post-conviction relief</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">08/09/02 Colorado District Court denied Rule 35(b) motion</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">09/23/02 45 days to appeal denial expired 09/23/02 under Colo.
