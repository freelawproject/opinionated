Under the terms of his plea agreement, Mims waived his right to appeal any sentence within the statutory maximum \u201con the grounds set forth in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 or on any ground whatsoever.\u201d Mims now seeks to contest the calculation of his advisory guideline range, challenging a five-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2G2.2 (b)(5) (2006), on the ground that the conduct underlying the enhancement was a separate crime. The government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on the waiver of appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Mims concedes that he waived his right to appeal and that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-06 (4th Cir. 2000). He contends that the issue he seeks to raise is not within the scope of the waiver. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">We therefore grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
