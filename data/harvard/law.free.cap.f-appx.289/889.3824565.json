We reject Love\u2019s claim that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury rather than a judge to determine the applicable drug quantity. We remand for resentencing, however, because the district court neglected to first calculate Love\u2019s applicable Guidelines range and statutory maximum before imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-18\">Love participated in a cocaine-trafficking conspiracy that geographically spanned Colombia, Florida, and Michigan. In 1993 the government indicted him and twenty-three codefendants for conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 846. Six days into his eight-day jury trial, Love jumped bond and fled. The jury entered a guilty verdict in his absence, and although the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) at the time, the district court did not sentence Love until he resurfaced in California more than ten years after the trial. At the long-delayed sentencing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Government urged that Love \u2014 in keeping with an updated PSR \u2014 be held responsible for between 150 and 500 kilograms of cocaine. The court, after hearing Love\u2019s objection to the quantity, determined that he was responsible for a lesser amount\u2014 between 50 and 150 kilograms \u2014 and imposed a 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Love now appeals, challenging the propriety of the judge rather than the jury determining the drug quantity for which he was sentenced. He also presses his counsel\u2019s allegedly ineffective assistance in failing to raise this error below. We reject these two claims because our precedent permits district courts to determine applicable drug quantities that, as here, do not affect a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Love\u2019s appeal does succeed, however, on one issue. We agree with Love that, in sentencing him, the district court neglected to first calculate the proper Guidelines range within the relevant statutory framework. We accordingly vacate Love\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Love contends that the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), forbids sentencing courts from finding facts that increase a defendant\u2019s sentence for a drug offense unless a jury has designated a drug quantity by special verdict. Love infers from <em>Apprendi </em>that the jury\u2019s determination of guilt for an unspecified quantity of cocaine permits sentencing for only the minimum amount punishable under the Guidelines\u2014 less than twenty-five grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">We review Love\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge for plain error because he failed to object to the constitutionality of the sentencing court\u2019s factfinding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Highgate, </em>521 F.3d 590, 595 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that forfeited claims can only be corrected if a defendant demonstrates plain error). And although Love attempts to avoid plain-error review by categorizing judicial factfinding at sentencing as structural error, our cases foreclose that construct. <em>See, e.g., Campbell v. United States, </em>364 F.3d 727, 737 (6th Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cApprendi </em>errors are considered to be trial-type errors.\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Stewart, </em>306 F.3d 295, 319 (6th Cir.2002) (omitting a drug quantity from an indictment and jury instructions is a trial error, not a structural error).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">We find no Sixth Amendment error here, plain or otherwise. Love\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument ignores <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), which held that juries need only determine the \u201couter limits\u201d of a sentence, <em>see id. </em>at 567, 122 S.Ct. 2406, leaving the court free to make factual determinations that increase the sentence within the jury-authorized range. <em>Id. </em>Love\u2019s 240-month sentence does not exceed the maximum statutory penalty applicable to his conviction for an indefinite quantity of cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (\u201cIn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>case of a controlled substance in schedule I or II ... such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 812, Schedule 11(a)(4) (treating cocaine as a Schedule II controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">And Love is wrong to believe that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which extended <em>Apprendi </em>to federal sentencing, somehow overruled <em>Hams; </em>our decisions confirm that <em>Harris </em>remains good law. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>515 F.3d 556, 565 (6th Cir.2008) (collecting many citations showing <em>Harris\u2019s </em>continuing viability); <em>see also United States v. Sexton, </em>512 F.3d 326, 330 (6th Cir.2008) (\u201cSince defendants were sentenced under an advisory Guidelines scheme, the maximum statutory penalty that the district court could impose was determined by the statute of conviction, rather than by a Guidelines range calculated using only jury findings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Love also argues that his sentencing counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the district court\u2019s fact-finding and by conceding his responsibility for more than twenty-five grams of cocaine. Faced with fresh law and a stale record, we could leave this claim for collateral review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, as is our practice on direct review when the record is inadequate to assess the merits of the defendant\u2019s allegations. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>415 F.3d 537, 555 (6th Cir.2005). In this case, however, further factual development is unnecessary to assess Love\u2019s claim because Love had no viable <em>Apprendi </em>challenges for counsel to lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Nor do we fault counsel\u2019s decision to concede Love\u2019s responsibility for more than twenty-five grams of cocaine. Love\u2019s counsel persuaded the district court to deviate from the PSR\u2019s recommended quantity finding \u2014 reflecting some demonstrable success. Had counsel been unwilling to concede \u2014 when the trial evidence so clearly pointed to much greater responsibility\u2014 Love might not have received that beneficial deviation. We find that counsel\u2019s failure to raise untenable constitutional and evidentiary disputes did not prejudice Love and therefore does not support his claim of ineffective assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">A. Review of Sentencing Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">We next examine Love\u2019s bid for resentencing. We review Love\u2019s sentencing claims \u201cfor reasonableness, which accounts for the procedural and substantive components of sentencing.\u201d <em>Highgate, </em>521 F.3d at 595 (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">The Government correctly observes that <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc), confirmed that plain error review applies to unpreserved sentencing claims, so long as the district court asks the defendant the so-called <em>Bostic </em>question, which \u201cgives counsel a chance to ask the sentencing judge for clarifications about the proposed sentence it just announced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. In <em>Vonner; </em>the district court asked whether the defendant \u201chad any objection to the sentence just pronounced not previously raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386 (internal quotation marks and format<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>ting omitted). The district court here, however, asked, \u201cAnything else?\u201d \u2014 a spare question that we have found insufficient under <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865 (6th Cir.2004). <em>United States v. Clark, </em>469 F.3d 568, 570-71 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Thomas, </em>498 F.3d 336, 340 (6th Cir.2007) (finding \u201cDo you have anything further for the record?\u201d insufficient to satisfy Bostic). Love having been denied a proper <em>Bostic </em>opportunity to question his sentence, we review under the familiar reasonableness standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">B. Failure to Calculate a Guidelines Range</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We first determine whether the district court committed procedural errors when it imposed Love\u2019s sentence. <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 407. Love rightly points out that the district court failed to calculate his Guidelines range before announcing a sentence, rendering his sentence procedurally unreasonable and requiring a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">A properly calculated Guidelines range should be \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d in sentencing. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. The failure to calculate the Guidelines range is a \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 597, because appellate courts cannot be sure that the district judge did not \u201csimply select[ ] what the judge deems an appropriate sentence without such required consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The court\u2019s error here stems from its decision to deviate from the PSR\u2019s recommended quantity calculation (advocated by the Government) \u2014 more than 150 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 in favor of a more lenient amount assessment, between 50 and 150 kilograms. The record reflects no new Guidelines-range calculation for the court\u2019s quantity choice. After addressing Love and reviewing his history and characteristics, the court imposed a 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The court sentenced consistent with the PSR recommendation \u2014 a 240-month sentence \u2014 while rejecting the quantity upon which the 240-month sentence was based. It did not explain why it accepted the PSR\u2019s result while rejecting its reasoning, and the PSR itself is silent as to why the United States Probation Office recommended a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range, other than to say that the recommended sentence reflected its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We <em>do </em>know that the PSR recommendation did not rest on the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) because it reported a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (providing a maximum life sentence for defendants responsible for more than five kilograms of cocaine). Suffice it to say, imposing a sentence without first calculating the proper Guidelines range flaws the procedure. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The court not only failed to calculate the Guidelines range as a starting point, but also to evaluate the ending point, the statutory maximum. Love was subject to a 240-month statutory maximum sentence, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), yet the district court showed no awareness of its statutory constraints and seems only to have chanced upon a sentence equal to the statutory maximum. We cannot say whether the district court would have imposed a 240-month sentence knowing that it was Love\u2019s maximum permissible sentence. The district court accepted several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>mitigating factors, and it might have found Love did not deserve the highest sentence among drug offenders with unspecified-quantity verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The Government argues that resentencing would be futile because 240 months was Love\u2019s statutory <em>mandatory-minimum </em>sentence rather than his maximum sentence. In support of this statement, it points to Love\u2019s prior Texas felony drug conviction. Under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), a defendant who has conspired to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years, but a prior felony drug conviction that has become final increases the mandatory minimum sentence to twenty years, or 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">As it was required to do, the Government introduced records of the conviction before trial and gave Love notice that it intended to seek an enhanced minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). Love objected to the notice, arguing that the Texas conviction, a deferred adjudication, had not become final, as required under the section to enhance his sentence. The record contains no evidence that the trial court acknowledged the dispute, let alone ruled on it, perhaps because Love soon absconded.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">On top of failing to seek a ruling from the trial court about whether Love\u2019s Texas conviction had become final, the Government never drew the attention of the sentencing court to the statutory import of Love\u2019s prior felony conviction. The record belies the Government\u2019s contention that the sentencing court simply imposed a mandatory minimum sentence relying on \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The sentencing transcript contains only one reference to the Texas conviction, when the court said, \u201c[I]t appears that at the time Mr. Love was before this Court, he had a recent drug conviction from state court.\u201d The context of the statement \u2014 just before discussing some of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, such as the \u201chistory ... of the defendant\u201d \u2014 suggests the court did not view 240 months as the mandatory minimum sentence. The Government\u2019s argument that the court imposed a mandatory minimum sentence therefore fails to alter our conclusion that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Because the district court failed to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range or consider the relevant statutory constraints before imposing a sentence, we vacate Love\u2019s sentence and remand so that the district court can impose a reasoned sentence consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\">. As we discuss below, <em>see infra </em>at 894, the Government's argument that Love\u2019s prior drug felony conviction actually results in a minimum sentence of twenty years and a maximum sentence of thirty years skews the discussion because the Government never pressed the prior conviction in the sentencing court. It is true that mandatory minimum sentences avoid the need to wrestle with any impermissible factfinding, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>419 F.3d 521, 531-32 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Paige, </em>470 F.3d 603, 611 (6th Cir.2006), but the mandatory-minimum theory needlessly complicates the <em>Apprendi </em>analysis because the sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>did not exceed the baseline twenty-year statutory maximum sentence with or without the prior felony conviction and therefore did not violate <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b916-10\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEuI\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">I agree with my colleagues that the sentence imposed on Love was procedurally unreasonable, thus requiring a remand. I write separately, however, because I believe that the majority\u2019s prescription for calculating Love\u2019s sentence on remand does not sufficiently protect the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment jury trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">As I have said in many other cases, I do not agree that the sentencing judge or the courts of appeals are empowered after the <em>Blakely-Booker-Cunningham </em>line of cases to make findings of fact beyond the facts of the jury verdict or guilty pleas \u2014 new fact findings that ratchet up the sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, </em>515 F.3d 556 (6th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Phinazee, </em>515 F.3d 511 (6th Cir.2008). Indeed, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>\u201cunder the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Sixth Amendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a <em>greater potential </em>sentence must be found by a jury, not a judge.\u201d 549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 863-64, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In this case, the government charged the defendant with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. But the jury, following the instructions of the trial judge, did not make any findings regarding drug quantity in reaching its guilty verdict <em>in abstentia. </em>Absent additional facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant, therefore, the defendant would be subject to a base offense level of 12 and a statutory maximum of 20 years under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2006). Here, we have such an admission by the defendant. At the sentencing hearing in 2006, defense counsel urged the court to reject the government\u2019s contention that the defendant was responsible for 150 to 500 kilograms of cocaine, but conceded that the defendant was responsible for an amount of cocaine equivalent to a base offense level of 34 <em>(ie. </em>15 to 50 kilograms). <em>See </em>Joint Appendix at 427-28; U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2006). Consequently, on remand the district court judge may consider this amount in imposing a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the sentencing factors elaborated in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
