Because the parties are f'arr|iliar with the facts, we do not recount them here, except as necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AqFr\">Although the district court erred in styling its dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 action pursuant to the Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 22g3 ag one for lack of subjeet matter jurisdiction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we will treat the district court,s decision ag baving converted the Rule 12(b)(1) motion into a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim. <em>See Supermail Cargo, Inc. v. United States, </em>68 F.3d 1204, 1206 n. 2 (9th Cir.1995) (treating a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tion as one for failure to state a claim); <em>Retana v. Apartment, Motel, Hotel &amp; Elevator Operators Union, </em>453 F.2d 1018, 1022 (9th Cir.1972) (same). \u201c[A] party should not be bound at his peril to give the proper nomenclature for his motion. This would be a retreat to the strict common law. So long as he makes a timely motion and states the grounds therefor, the court should grant relief appropriate thereto.\u201d <em>Monte Vista Lodge v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>384 F.2d 126, 129 (9th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"ALR\">Treating defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as one for failure to state a claim, the district court did not err in granting the motion, because Plaintiffs have not ade- , . . , . quately alleged privity between the plam- ........ , f , tiffs m the state court action and the ,, _ ^ , plamtiffs m <em>Perretta v. Prometheus Deve</em>lopm<em>ent Co. </em>Plamtiffs bare allegation of privity in their complaint is insufficient to state a claim: whether parties are in \u201cprivity\u201d is a legal conclusion, <em>Headwaters Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>399 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th Cir.2005), and \u201ccourts \u2018are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quot- \u201e . \u201e . TT _ . mg <em>Papasan v. Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). Rather, the \u201c[\u00abactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Without some further factual enhancement it stops short <em>f . </em>of the lme between possibility and plausibility of \u2018entitle[ment] to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1966 (alteration in original). The mere ....... , . .... . ... .. fact that the plamtiffs m both actions , , i \u00ab . . shared a common law firm, and that counsel, in settlement discussions, alluded to the potential effect of a judgment in one action as res judicata in the other action, are insufficient to meet the <em>Bell Atlantic </em>bm\u2019den of showing coordination. While it may be \u201cpossible\u201d that Everest used its common law firm with the plaintiffs in <em>Perretta </em>to coordinate or control litigation, Plaintiffs have alleged no facts which would render the contention \u201cplausible.\u201d Without privity between the parties to the litigation, the relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act is inapplicable. <em>See Sandpiper Vill. Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., </em>428 F.3d 831, 848-49 (9th Cir.2005). Because the Anti-Injunction Act bars the sole remedy Plaintiffs geek, they have therefore \u201cfail[ed] to state a cjaim Upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">Lastly; ^ thafc the parties to thig action haye already had extensive opportu- , , , ,. . ,, , , nity to conduct discovery in the state ac- ,. ,, ,. , . , . ... , , ., tion, the district court did not abuse its ....... ..... , .. discretion m denying additional discovery on the issue of privity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag-A\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AVd\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
