He asserts that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement based upon his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. Although he recognizes our precedent that this offense is a crime of violence for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes, he argues that <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), overrules it. His argument is unpersuasive. In <em>United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 n. 1 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 156, 169 L.Ed.2d 106 (2007), we noted that <em>James </em>pertains only to a residual provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) that is absent from \u00a7 2L1.2. Consequently, <em>James </em>is not dispositive. Because we have held that the Texas offense of burglary of a habitation constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. <em>See Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d at 304 &amp; n. 3; <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance and to waive the requirement to file an appellee\u2019s brief are GRANTED, the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file an appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
