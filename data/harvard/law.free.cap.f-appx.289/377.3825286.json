After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">In 1999, Lee was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and sentence to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. This Court affirmed his conviction on appeal. Lee filed multiple collateral attacks on his conviction, which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">On June 27, 2006, Lee sent a letter to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida requesting, pursuant to FOIA and PA, all records \u201ccontained in the files of [his] Office\u201d relating to Lee\u2019s 1999 criminal conviction, as well as a \u201ccopy of the written certificate by the Attorney General ... that was obtained in advance by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and which authorized the federal prosecution\u201d of Lee\u2019s criminal case. The United States Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cUSAO\u201d) forwarded Lee\u2019s request for processing to the FOIA/PA staff at the Executive Office for the United States Attorneys (\u201cEOU-SA\u201d) in Washington, D.C. and advised Lee by letter that it had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On July 28, 2006, the EOUSA sent Lee a notice that it had received Lee\u2019s records request and asking for certification of Lee\u2019s identity. EOUSA also advised Lee he would need to resubmit his records request with his certification of identity. Lee sent a letter to EOUSA on August 28, 2006 stating that he had sent the certification of identity, but had not yet received any records. On September 20, 2006, EOUSA advised Lee by letter that his request would be processed in the order it was received due to the backlog within the FOIA department.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">EOUSA forwarded Lee\u2019s records request to the FOIA contact for the Southern District of Florida, Assistant United States Attorney Carole Fernandez. According to Fernandez, a query of Lee\u2019s name in the computer case tracking system indicated that Lee\u2019s criminal case file was a closed file located in the USAO\u2019s Miami Closed File Room. However, a support services technician\u2019s search of this room found no records relating to Lee\u2019s criminal case. Several more searches were conducted of the room without success. Unsuccessful searches were also conducted at the West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale offices and the USAO\u2019s archives shipment. At Fernandez\u2019s request, the assistant United States attorneys who worked on Lee\u2019s criminal case, as well as the USAO\u2019s Appellate Division, conducted searches, but were unable to locate any responsive records. One case file pertaining to Lee\u2019s appeal of a post-conviction motion to vacate was located. Copies of those records \u2014 29 pages \u2014 were forwarded to EOUSA, where they were processed and 26 full and 3 partial pages were provided to Lee on May 22, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">On December 20, 2006, while his records request was still pending, Lee filed a petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, seeking to compel the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and the FOIA/PA staff at EOUSA to produce the records he had requested. A magistrate judge issued an order construing Lee\u2019s petition as a claim pursuant to FOIA and PA and set a deadline for filing summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that they had conducted a thorough search in good faith and had sent Lee all available records. Lee responded that defendants were deliberately stonewalling and their efforts to locate the requested records were \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and lacked good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) concluded the undisputed record showed that defendants conducted a thorough search in good faith and used appropriate methods to locate the requested records, but were unable to locate the criminal file. The R&amp;R found that Lee\u2019s claims of bad faith and inadequate search were \u201cconclusory[,j unsupported statements or beliefs.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over Lee\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the R&amp;R and granted summary judgment. The district court denied Lee\u2019s subsequent Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Lee filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">FOIA requires a federal agency, upon a request for records that reasonably describes documents held by that agency, to make those documents promptly available unless the information within the records is protected from disclosure by a statutory exemption. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3), (b). A plaintiff may bring a private cause of action under the FOIA in federal court to enjoin a federal agency that has improperly withheld its records. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B); <em>Ray v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>908 F.2d 1549, 1559 (11th Cir.1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State v. Ray, </em>502 U.S. 164, 112 S.Ct. 541,116 L.Ed.2d 526 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Similarly, the PA \u201cgoverns the government\u2019s collection and dissemination of information and maintenance of its records and generally allows individuals to gain access to government records on them and to request correction of inaccurate records.\u201d Pe<em>rry v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>371 F.3d 1304, 1304 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation and alteration omitted). Under the PA, a plaintiff may bring a civil action against an agency that fails to comply with his request, and the district court has jurisdiction to order the agency to produce agency records that were improperly withheld. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(B), (3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201cThe adequacy of an agency\u2019s search for documents requested under FOIA is judged by a reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>908 F.2d at 1558. The search need not be exhaustive. Rather, \u201cthe agency must show beyond material doubt ... that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). This burden can be met by producing affidavits that are \u201crelatively detailed, nonconclusory, and submitted in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Once the agency meets its burden to show that its search was reasonable, the burden shifts to the requester \u201cto rebut the agency\u2019s evidence by showing that the search was not reasonable or was not conducted in good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Here, defendants produced detailed affidavits explaining the method of processing Lee\u2019s records request and showing that they conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover the requested documents. Specifically, defendants searched where the criminal case file should have been stored and, when it did not turn up at that location, searched in the other locations it might reasonably have been found, such as in the offices of the government attorneys who worked on Lee\u2019s criminal case, the other offices of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and the archives.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Lee provided no evidence to rebut the adequacy of the search or to support his claim that defendants acted in bad faith. Lee\u2019s assertion that defendants deliberately removed his criminal case file from the storage room is mere speculation and insufficient for summary judgment purposes. Contrary to Lee\u2019s argument, defendants were not required to search the files of the Attorney General or the United States Department of Justice. Lee\u2019s records request was directed to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and specifically requested documents maintained by the USAO. <em>See Ray, </em>908 F.2d at 1558-59 (\u201cFOIA does not require an agency to exhaust all files which conceivably could contain relevant information.\u201d). Furthermore, the fact that defendants did not respond to Lee\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>within 20 days of receipt does not support his claim of bad faith. Defendants explained the reasons for any delays in processing Lee\u2019s request, and Lee presented no evidence rebutting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Because Lee failed to show a genuine issue of material fact as to the reasonableness of the search for responsive records or defendants\u2019 good faith in conducting the search and providing responsive records, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. Lee did not submit a declaration or affidavit in opposition to summary judgment, but appended to his summary judgment response a statement that, under penalty of perjury, the facts and information contained within it were true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court and viewing all evidence and factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>516 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2008). Sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>mary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-17\">. We also reject as without merit Lee\u2019s claims that defendants\u2019 failure to provide the requested documents violated his constitutional rights and voided his conviction. To the extent Lee challenges the denial of access to records under the PA, that claim is moot as defendants released the documents in their possession. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(B), (3)(A) (providing for injunctive relief for improperly withheld documents).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
