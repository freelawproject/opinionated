Texas submitted the MCR SIP to satisfy one of the enforceable commitments contained in a previously approved State Implementation Plan for the HGB area. GHASP contends that (1) the EPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the MCR SIP because it does not demonstrate attainment of specified emissions reductions; (2) the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in relying on weight of evidence analysis to excuse modeled nonattainment; and (8) by approving the MCR SIP, the EPA violated the noninterference or anti-backsliding provision of the Clean Air Act. For the following reasons, we deny the petition for review. GHASP also petitions this court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, which we deny as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">A. <em>Clean Air Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), enacted in 1970 and revised in 1977 and 1990, establishes a comprehensive program for controlling and improving the nation\u2019s air quality through a combination of federal and state regulation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401(a)(4). Under Title I of the CAA, the EPA is responsible for identifying air pollutants that endanger the public and formulating the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d), which establish maximum permissible concentrations of those pollutants in ambient air. <em>U2 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7408-7409. The EPA Administrator has promulgated NAAQS for various pollutants, including ozone. The standard for the one-hour NAAQS for ozone is .12 parts per million (although EPA often refers to it as 124.5 parts per billion (\u201cppb\u201d)), and an area attains the standard when maximum measured hourly average ozone concentrations exceed the NAAQS no more than one day per calendar year. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Under the Act, the EPA designates areas of the country as \u201cattainment\u201d or \u201cnon-attainment\u201d based on whether the area meets the NAAQS for a particular pollutant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(d). Nonattainment areas are further classified as \u201cmarginal,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d \u201csevere,\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d based on the severity and duration of their noncompliance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a). Based on an area\u2019s classification, the Act establishes the stringency of the measures that the area must implement to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) and nitrogen oxides (\u201cNOx\u201d), both of which are precursors to the formation of ozone in the ambient air. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a. This qualification also establishes deadlines for attainment of the NAAQS depending upon an area\u2019s nonattainment classification. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7502, 7511(a). If an area fails to attain the one-hour NAAQS by the applicable deadline, the EPA must reclassify it to a higher classification. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2). Generally, reclassification grants the area a later attainment deadline, but requires it to comply with the more stringent pollution control measures applicable to the higher classification. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1), (b)(2); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Although the EPA determines the standards of air quality, under the CAA, states have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the NAAQS are met for each identified pollutant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(a). This responsibility includes a requirement that states adopt State Implementation Plans (\u201cSIPs\u201d), specifying the way in which the state will implement, maintain, and enforce ambient air quality standards in the various regions throughout the state. <em>Id. </em>For areas designated from moderate to extreme, the SIP must contain an \u201cattainment demonstration\u201d that shows that the area will achieve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>NAAQS by the area\u2019s statutory attainment deadline. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(c)(2)(A); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.112. The attainment demonstration is based on the state\u2019s control strategy for ozone-precursor emissions, which must \u201cinclude enforceable emissions limitations, and such other control measures ... as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of such standard in such area by the applicable attainment date.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(c)(6). The EPA may approve an attainment demonstration if it is \u201cbased on photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined by the Administrator, in the Administrator\u2019s discretion, to be at least as effective.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(c)(2)(A). The SIP, and any revisions to the SIPs, are to be adopted by each state after reasonable notice and public hearing and thereafter submitted to the EPA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). The EPA reviews each proposed SIP and must approve the SIP if it meets all of the CAA\u2019s requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(k)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">B. <em>Houston/Galveston/Brazoria Area Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The HGB area has not complied with the federal one-hour health standard for ground-level ozone since the inception of the CAA in 1970. After the 1990 amendments to the CAA, the HGB area was classified as a \u201cSevere 17\u201d area. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(2), such areas were required to come into compliance with the one-hour standard by November 15, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\u201cTCEQ\u201d) prepared and submitted the Texas SIP, which projected compliance with the one-hour ozone standard by the November 15, 2007 attainment deadline. The EPA approved the SIP in 2001. The 2001 SIP contained an emissions control strategy including federal control measures, state emissions limitations that would reduce NOx from industrial sources by 90 percent, an expanded inspection and maintenance program for vehicles, a \u201cClean Diesel Program,\u201d speed limit reductions, voluntary mobile emission programs (VMEP), controls on airport ground equipment, control requirement for non-road, large spark-ignition engines, and commercial lawn equipment operating restrictions. <em>See generally </em>66 Fed.Reg. 57160.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">In 2003, the Business Coalition for Clean Air Appeal Group (BCCA Appeal Group), GHASP, and several other groups challenged the EPA\u2019s approval of Texas\u2019s 2001 SIP before this court. <em>See BCCA v. EPA, </em>355 F.3d 817 (5th Cir.2003). In that case, this court concluded that: (1) the EPA was not unreasonable in approving Texas\u2019s photochemical modeling which excluded certain ozone characteristics from the modeling; (2) \u201cweight of evidence\u201d analysis is consistent with the CAA\u2019s requirements and reasonably applied to Texas\u2019s attainment demonstration modeling results; and (3) the use of \u201cenforceable commitments\u201d is consistent with the CAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">One of the enforceable commitments contained in the 2001 SIP approved by this court in <em>BCCA </em>is the subject of the present petition for review, specifically the MCR SIP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both parties agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the MCR contains several revisions to the 2001 SIP. In particular, the MCR SIP relaxed the controls on industrial NOx emissions from the 90 percent level established in the 2001 SIP to 80 percent and supplemented this action by including controls on the release of highly reactive volatile organic compounds (\u201cHRVOCs\u201d). 71 Fed.Reg. at 52,674/2. The MCR SIP also dropped four requirements that had been included in the 2001 SIP: (1) the requirement for vehicle inspection and maintenance in three rural counties; (2) restrictions on morning operations for commercial lawn services; (3) planned reductions in speed limits; and (4) restrictions on idling for heavy duty diesel vehicles. 71 Fed.Reg. 52,-674/1. GHASP contends that: (1) the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the MCR SIP because it does not demonstrate attainment of specified emissions reductions; (2) the use of weight of evidence analysis, as applied here, to excuse modeled nonattainment of the four days modeling exceedances was unreasonable; and (3) by approving the MCR SIP, the EPA violated the non-interference provision of the Clean Air Act. We will address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">This court may reverse any action of an EPA Administrator that it finds \u201carbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); <em>see also BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 824. A rule is considered arbitrary and capricious \u201cwhere the agency has considered impermissible factors, failed to consider important aspects of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that is contrary to the record evidence, or is so irrational that it could not be attributed to a difference in opinion or the result of agency expertise.\u201d <em>BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 824 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Where the agency is interpreting a statute it administers, that interpretation must be scrutinized under the framework established in <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Thus, where Congress has \u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question at issue,\u201d this court must give effect to the unambiguous intent of Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. However, if the statute is silent or ambiguous on a particular issue, the question then becomes whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Reversal is warranted only if the agency\u2019s construction is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Deference must be given where the agency\u2019s construction is permissible. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">This court has previously acknowledged that photochemical grid modeling is a complex scientific determination. <em>See BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 834. \u201cA reviewing court must remember that the agency is making predictions, within its area of special expertise, at the frontiers of science. When examining this kind of scientific determination, as opposed to simple findings of fact, a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832 (citing <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. NRDC, </em>462 U.S. 87, 103 S.Ct. 2246, 76 L.Ed.2d 437 (1983)). Thus, this court must determine whether the EPA\u2019s conclusions \u201crepresent arbitrary or capricious exercises of its authority, not whether they are accurate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere is a presumption of regularity to the EPA\u2019s choice of analytical methodology, so challenging parties must overcome a \u2018considerable burden.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">An SIP must contain an \u201cattainment demonstration\u201d that shows that the area will achieve the NAAQS by the area\u2019s statutory attainment deadline. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(c)(2)(A); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.112. The attainment demonstration must be \u201cbased on photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined ... to be at least as effective.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(c)(2)(A). Here, TCEQ selected a nineteen day episode from August 19 through September 6 on which to perform photochemical modeling in order to determine whether the control strategy contained in its MCR SIP would meet the NAAQS. 71 Fed.Reg. 52,688. TCEQ determined that it was necessary to exclude nine of the nineteen days before modeling due to model performance issues. Three of the nine days excluded before modeling contained exceedances of NAAQS.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">GHASP argues that the EPA was arbitrary and capricious because it approved TCEQ\u2019s exclusion of those three days showing exceedances from modeling without adequate explanation. Citing <em>Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, </em>249 F.8d 1032, 1053 (D.C.Cir.2001), GHASP argues that although courts routinely defer to agency modeling of complex phenomena, model assumptions must have a \u201crational relationship to the real world.\u201d This court has previously explained that agency decisions will be upheld if the agency has examined the relevant data and articulated a reasonable explanation for its conclusions. <em>BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 834. Thus, GHASP must show that the Agency\u2019s decision was unreasonable in order for this Court to conclude that the EPA acted arbitrarily or capriciously in approving Texas\u2019s modeling despite the exclusion of those days. <em>Id. </em>at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">GHASP has failed to offer sufficient support for its assertion that the exclusion of three days showing exceedances necessarily leads to the conclusion that TCEQ\u2019s modeling bears no resemblance to the real world. In its final rule, the EPA explained that it approved TCEQ\u2019s decision to exclude nine days (of which three days showing exceedances were included) from its modeling analysis due to \u201cmodel performance issues.\u201d GHASP responds that merely citing model performance issues is an inadequate explanation for the exclusion of the three days and that the existence of these issues provides further support for its contention that there are \u201cmajor flaws\u201d in the MCR SIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The EPA determined, however, that the ten remaining days provided a sufficient basis for performing the attainment demonstration modeling, noting that the meteorological conditions present in the HGB area were sufficiently represented in the remaining ten days. <em>See </em>Technical Support Document for Approval of SIP Revisions to the One-Hour Ozone Attainment Plan for the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria Nonattainment Area Final Clean Air, at 21 (Sept.2005) (\u201cTSD\u201d). This court has previously acknowledged that modeling in the HGB area is exceptionally complicated due to the unique environmental factors of the area. <em>Id. </em>at 823 n. 1 (noting that Texas\u2019s unique land-sea breeze meteorological conditions create a \u201clevel of complexity ... not seen anywhere else in the country\u201d (citing 66 Fed. Reg. at 57,164)). Similarly, in the present case, the EPA explained that complexity of the meteorology of the HGB area was difficult to replicate in the modeling, <em>see </em>TSD, at 5, 21; for example, the EPA stated that the model performed poorly on the first four days of the extended episode, i.e. August 18-22, because it did not generate enough ozone to correspond to the historic data, TSD, at 20. However, the EPA determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">The need for further studies does not mean, however, that the modeling relied upon today was unable to estimate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>amount and type of emissions reductions needed for attainment. [The] EPA believes because the diagnostic/sensitivity tests do not reveal serious flaws in model formulations and the model generally predicts the right magnitude of the peak which is confirmed by the statistical measures and graphical analysis, that the model does provide an acceptable tool for estimating the amount of emissions reductions needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">72 Fed.Reg. at 52,682/2.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We conclude that the EPA offered a rational explanation during the administrative process for its determination that it was necessary to exclude the three days at issue from modeling. This court has repeatedly stated that we will not substitute our judgment for that of the EPA, especially where, as here, the agency\u2019s decision is based on \u201cits evaluation of complex scientific data within its technical expertise.\u201d <em>BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 824. In light of this deferential standard and given that the EPA specifically considered and rejected GHASP\u2019s argument, GHASP has failed to carry its heavy burden of showing that the EPA was arbitrary or capricious for approving the attainment demonstration that excluded certain days from modeling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">We next consider the EPA\u2019s weight-of evidence analysis. Texas\u2019s photochemical grid modeling did not demonstrate attainment on four of the ten modeled days, namely: August 31, September 2, 4, and 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Using weight of evidence analysis, the TCEQ supplemented the modeling with other evidence to show that the HGB area would reach its attainment deadline. Specifically, it determined that: (1) based on certain control strategies which could not be modeled, September 2, 4, and 6 would reach attainment although they modeled nonattainment, and (2) August 31 should be excluded from the attainment demon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>station because of the anomalous meteorological conditions present on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The CAA requires that an attainment demonstration be \u201cbased on photochemical modeling or any other analytical method determined ... to be at least as effective,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(c)(2)(A); the EPA has interpreted the statute to allow states to supplement their photochemical modeling results with additional evidence to demonstrate attainment due to the inherent uncertainties in air quality modeling. 66 Fed.Reg. at 57,170; <em>see also BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 834. This court has held that where the weight of evidence analysis is set forth in notice-and-comment rulemaking, it is entitled to deference if it is reasonable. <em>BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">GHASP does not dispute the ability to consider weight of evidence analysis in evaluating attainment demonstrations, rather it contends that the manner in which the EPA applied it here was arbitrary and capricious. Specifically, GHASP asserts that the EPA applied the weight of evidence analysis in a \u201ctotally qualitative\u201d manner, rather than the quantitative approach approved by this court in BCCA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner maintains that the EPA\u2019s application of weight of evidence analysis here is not only arbitrary and capricious but violative of EPA guidance, which provides that \u201cthe weight of evidence provided from other analyses will need to be very compelling to overcome that resulting from the photochemical grid model.\u201d EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Guidance on Use of Modeled Results to Demonstrate Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS, EPA-454/ B-95-007 (June 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">As an initial matter, we consider the EPA\u2019s contention that GHASP has waived any argument regarding the application of weight of evidence analysis to modeling results for September 2, 4, and 6 because it failed to object during the administrative proceedings. \u201c[Ojnly in exceptional circumstances should a court review for the first time on appeal a particular challenge to the EPA\u2019s approval of a state implementation plan that was not raised during the agency proceedings.\u201d <em>BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 829 (noting that where a petitioner has not challenged \u201can obligation expressly imposed by the CAA, [the petitioner] needed to raise its objections during the administrative proceeding [in order to] provide EPA an opportunity to consider the issue before asserting, after the fact, that EPA was arbitrary for failing to do so.\u201d). GHASP does not dispute that it failed to raise an objection to the application of weight of evidence September 2, 4, 6; nor does it assert that it raised a more general challenge to the allegedly \u201cquantitative manner\u201d in which TCEQ applied the weight of evidence. Further, after our review of the administrative record, we were unable to find such an objection. Accordingly, we find that GHASP has in fact waived review concerning the application of weight of evidence analysis to results for September 2, 4, and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>This court considers only, therefore, whether the EPA was arbitrary or capricious in approving TCEQ\u2019s exclusion of August 31 under its weight of evidence analysis. We conclude that it was not. While this court has yet to consider a similar circumstance where the EPA has declined to include a date in its attainment analysis because it is \u201catypical,\u201d in <em>Sierra Club v. EPA, </em>356 F.3d 296 (D.C.Cir.2004), the D.C. Circuit upheld a similar action by the EPA. In that case, the D.C. Circuit not only approved the use of supplemental statistical analysis to correct for over-predictions in modeling, it also concluded that the EPA could exclude a day from the attainment analysis that presented unusual conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 305. In that case, the EPA determined that the excluded date was \u201ctoo anomalous to demonstrate nonattainment\u201d after finding that the date was the \u201c13th most severe ozone producing day in 44 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In upholding the EPA\u2019s decision, the D.C. Circuit explained that this adjustment merely accounted for a \u201cbase day that appeared] to be a statistical outlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Similarly, here, the EPA explained that August 31 was excluded because the temperature was a record high and the heat taken together with atypical wind patterns created an unusually high ozone level in the Houston area. 70 Fed.Reg. 58,125/1. Texas submitted the following analysis as weight of evidence: August 31 rare meteorology; additional reductions that were not modeled; comprehensive ozone metrics and ambient trends; alternative design value and addressing short-term excursions; and unusual wildfire activity. 70 Fed.Reg. at 58,124/1. Based on this explanation and the substantial deference given to the EPA on these issues, we are unable to conclude that the Agency was unreasonable for allowing TCEQ to exclude August 31 during its application of the weight of evidence analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">GHASP argues that the changes to Texas\u2019s control strategy approved in the MCR SIP violate the non-interference language of Section 110(Z) of the Clean Air Act. In support of this contention, GHASP relies primarily on the fact that the MCR SIP relaxed the controls on industrial NOx emissions from the 90 percent level established in the 2001 SIP to 80 percent and dropped four requirements that had been included in the 2001 SIP including: (1) the requirement for vehicle inspection and maintenance in three rural counties; (2) restrictions on morning operations for commercial lawn services; (3) planned reductions in speed limits; and (4) restrictions on idling for heavy duty diesel vehicles. GHASP argues that these actions by themselves are sufficient to show a violation of Section 110(7). CAA section 110(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">Each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under this chapter shall be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. The administrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with an applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress (as defined in section 7501 of this title) or any other applicable requirement of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">42U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">\u201cReasonable further progress\u201d is defined by statute to mean \u201csuch annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable national ambient ah* quality standard by the applicable date.\u201d <em>1$ U.S.C. </em>at \u00a7 7501(1). Because the definition of reasonable further progress is defined within the statute, the question of whether the MCR SIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>violates Section 110(7) turns on the meaning of \u201cwould interfere.\u201d The statute itself does not define \u201cwould interfere.\u201d Because Congress has not directly spoken on this issue, under <em>Chevron </em>step two we will defer to the EPA\u2019s interpretation unless it is arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">GHASP contends that the EPA must show that results under the MCR SIP are better than results under the 2001 SIP to comply with Section 110(7 )\u2022 However, nothing in the plain language of Section 110 (l) supports this interpretation. The EPA and BCCA Appeal Group in its amicus brief, urge this court to adopt the interpretation of interference accepted by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Kentucky Resources Council, Inc. v. EPA, </em>467 F.3d 986 (6th Cir.2006), in which that court held that the EPA may approve a SIP revision \u201cunless the agency finds it will make air quality worse.\u201d According to the EPA, under Section 110(Z), the EPA\u2019s approval of Texas\u2019s MCR SIP does not constitute interference as long as the revisions to the SIP were properly substituted by new measures that would offset the effect of those measures removed from MCR SIP. Thus, changes to a SIP, either dropping measures or reducing measurement requirements, are not by themselves sufficient to prove interference. Rather, one must show that the substitute measures are not at least equivalent to the previous measures in achieving attainment. We find the EPA\u2019s interpretation of Section 110(\u00ed) reasonable and thus refuse to substitute our judgment for that of the Agency\u2019s. This court need now determine only whether the EPA\u2019s determination that the new measures would offset changes to the 2001 SIP are also entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">GHASP contends that the reduction in NOx controls from 90 percent to 80 percent and the removal of four requirements from the control strategy are alone sufficient to demonstrate violation of Section 110(Z)\u2019s non-interference language. Based on modeling, the EPA concluded that the reduction in NOx controls and the removal of the four requirements were offset by the addition of controls for HRVOCs. 71 Fed. Reg. 52,675. GHASP offers nothing to contradict the EPA\u2019s conclusion, rather it argues that this argument is not compelling because the EPA should have required Texas to compare \u201chow the 2001 SIP controls compare with the MCR SIP controls in achieving the one-hour standard.\u201d However, again, GHASP provides no support for its claim that a particular type of comparison must be made. Further, the statute does not indicate any specific methodology which must be applied to determine interference. The record shows that the EPA based its noninterference determination on modeling based on the 2001 SIP control strategy as compared to the MCR SIP. 71 Fed.Reg. At 52,689/1 (explaining that \u201cthe noninterference modeling included the control strategies listed in the December 2000 SIP together with updated inventories and updated methodologies utilizing the 2000 episode.\u201d). Because the EPA\u2019s scientific determinations are entitled to deference, and the Agency\u2019s approval of the MCR SIP was based on modeling supporting this determination, its conclusions are not arbitrary or capricious. <em>See BCCA, </em>355 F.3d at 833-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Finally, GHASP argues that under the MCR SIP, Texas fares worse with regard to the eight-hour strategy than it did under the 2001 SIP. GHASP correctly points out that analysis of the eight-hour standard showed that a number of monitors showed higher ozone levels under the MCR SIP than under the SIP. 71 Fed. Reg. 52,688. However, even in light of this fact, the EPA determined that overall, the new strategy performed better under the eight-hour standard. 71 Fed.Reg. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>52,689/1. In support of this, the EPA noted that two of the three ozone metrics showed improvement under the new strategy. <em>Id. </em>This scientific determination is reasonable and entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Section 307(f) of the CAA provides that in a proceeding for judicial review of an emission standard promulgated under the Act, a court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwhenever it determines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d Having denied GHASP\u2019s petition for review, we have no choice but to deny its request for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 694, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983) (holding that \u201cabsent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for a federal court to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 307(f)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">For the foregoing reasons, GHASP\u2019s petition for review is denied and its request for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees is also denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

A photochemical grid model is a computerized mathematical model that predicts ozone levels on the attainment date based on monitoring data, meteorology, planned emission reductions, the area\u2019s projected growth, and other factors. <em>See BCCA Appeal Group v.

Texas was supposed to submit a MCR SIP by May 1, 2004 that would demonstrate, based on updated modeling information, that the HGB area would attain the ozone standard by the 2007 attainment date. After Texas failed to submit this MCR by the required date, GHASP filed suit to compel TCEQ to file the MCR. On December 13, 2004, TCEQ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>filed the MCR. Thereafter, GHASP withdrew its legal challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">. GHASP also contends that the MCR SIP does not demonstrate timely attainment of the one-hour ozone standard as mandated by the CAA, citing monitored data from 2003, 2004, and 2005 indicating that ozone levels in the HGB area exceeded the NAAQS. According to GHASP: \"Modeled data cannot be used to document compliance in the HGB area when the monitoring data clearly show that the HGB area was violating the national standard at the time of EPA approval and still is.\u201d GHASP argues therefore that the EPA approval of TECQ\u2019s attainment demonstration was arbitrary and capricious because the State failed to submit sufficient control measures to achieve the emissions reductions needed for attainment, and the state failed to demonstrate attainment using photochemical modeling or another analytical method. GHASP has not made out an argument here, nor has it cited to any relevant case law that might support its position. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>See also City of Seabrook v. EPA, </em>659 F.2d 1349, 1359-60 (5th Cir.1981) (concluding that a petitioners naked assertions that there is no evidence to support the EPA's conclusion does not merit review).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">We acknowledge that the EPA measures attainment over a three year period and the NAAQS is violated if an area exceeds the standard more than once each year. However, to the extent that GHASP is attempting to argue that Texas cannot show attainment in 2007 because it failed to show attainment in the two years preceding its attainment deadline, this argument is without merit. <em>See Environmental Defense </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>369 F.3d 193, 207 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that a nonattainment area may demonstrate attainment where it complies with the NAAQS by the relevant attainment deadline and is eligible for the two one-year extensions under Section 181(a)(5), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(5)); <em>see also Sierra Club v. EPA, </em>356 F.3d 296, 307 n. 9 (D.C.Cir. 2004)(same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b773-13\">. Modeling indicated that on August 31, September 2, 4, and 6, the MCR SIP would result in daily one-hour maximum ozone levels of 147.6, 128.6, 125.2, and 125.1 ppb, respectively, all in excess of the 125 ppb NAAQS for ozone. 70 Fed.Reg. 58,122/1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. GHASP also argues that the EPA did not consider evidence weighing against a showing of timely attainment. Specifically, GHASP argues that the EPA did not consider the following negative information: (1) ozone monitoring from 2004 or 2005 prior to the final approval of the SIP in September 2006; (2) GHASP\u2019s comments submitted in November 2005 regarding the proposed MCR SIP which noted that the 2005 ozone season had resulted in 4 or more exceedances at 6 monitors in the HGB area; and (3) indications from the photochemical grid modeling that attainment would not be reached until 2020, rather than the November 15, 2007 deadline imposed by statute. This argument is without merit. The administrative record shows that the EPA reasonably and adequately responded to each piece of negative information identified by GHASP here. <em>See generally </em>71 Fed. Reg. 52670 (Sept. 6, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
