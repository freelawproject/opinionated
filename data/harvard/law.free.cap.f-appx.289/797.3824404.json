Perkins, Texas prisoner # 704129, has moved for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court denied Perkins IFP status on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith under \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Perkins is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Probable success on the merits is not required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Perkins argues that he lacks funds to pursue his appeal, but he fails to brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s certification decision or, in particular, its dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Perkins has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Accordingly, we deny his IFP motion, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Perkins\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Perkins previously accumulated a strike in another case. <em>Perkins v. Blackwell, </em>No. C-960526 (S.D.Tex. May 20, 1998), <em>aff'd sub nom. Perkins v. Dial, </em>No. 98-40798, 2000 WL 1598085 (5th Cir. Oct.4, 2000) (unpublished); <em>see Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387; <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 461-64 (5th Cir.1998). As Perkins has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
