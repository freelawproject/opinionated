Gebhart appeals the final decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) denying his petition for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of mandamus. We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-25\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-26\">On July 2, 2007, Mr. Gebhart filed a petition for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of mandamus, asking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Veterans Court to order the Secretary to comply with a June 6, 2006 remand order from the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d). On September 27, 2007, 2007 WL 2989002, the Veterans Court denied Mr. Gebhart\u2019s petition, concluding that mandamus was not warranted under the circumstances, noting that \u201c[t]he Secretary has complied with the terms of the Board\u2019s remand without unreasonable delay, the petitioner has been informed of his appellate rights, and his appeal will be certified to the Board in due course.\u201d On November 14, 2007, the Veterans Court denied Mr. Gebhart\u2019s motion for reconsideration and entered judgment. Mr. Gebhart appeals the judgment of the Veterans Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals of Veterans Court decisions. In review of a Veterans Court decision, this court decides \u201call relevant questions of law, including interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions\u201d and sets aside any regulation or interpretation thereof \u201cother than a determination as to a factual matter\u201d relied upon by the Veterans Court that is \u201c(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or in violation of a statutory right; or (D) without observance of procedure required by law.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1). Except to the extent that an appeal of a Veterans Court decision presents a constitutional issue, this court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">On appeal, Mr. Gebhart does not address the decision of the Veterans Court denying his petition for mandamus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As previously noted, the Veterans Court explained its denial of mandamus by stating that \u201c[t]he Secretary has complied with the terms of the Board\u2019s remand without unreasonable delay, the petitioner has been informed of his appellate rights, and his appeal will be certified to the Board in due course.\u201d While we have jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court\u2019s denial of mandamus in some circumstances \u2014 including those involving the interpretation of a regulation or statute, <em>see Lamb v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2002) \u2014 we do not have jurisdiction to consider Mr. Gebhart\u2019s appeal of the Veterans Court decision in this case because any such challenge would involve factual determinations and/or the application of law to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Mr. Gebhart\u2019s brief on appeal also raises allegations unrelated to the Veterans Court\u2019s decision denying mandamus, including an argument regarding the denial of Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (\u201cROTC\u201d) credits at Washington University. While Mr. Gebhart\u2019s arguments on this point are far from clear, he appears to argue that the denial of ROTC credits violated, inter alia, equal protection rights and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We note that the Veterans Court decision, however, did not decide any constitutional issues. Additionally, we note that Mr. Gebhart\u2019s characterization of a question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack. <em>See Heifer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Cir.1999) (explaining that an appellant\u2019s characterization of a question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack). In these circumstances, we conclude that Mr. Gebhart\u2019s undeveloped references on appeal to the Constitution are insufficient to provide a basis for this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we must dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. Similarly, Mr. Gebhart did not address the decision of the Veterans Court in his previous appeal to this court from an order of the Veterans Court denying an earlier petition for mandamus. <em>See Gebhart v. Nicholson, </em>154 Fed.Appx. 207, 209 (Fed.Cir.2005) (\"Gebhart does not address the decision of the Veterans Court or reference his petition.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
