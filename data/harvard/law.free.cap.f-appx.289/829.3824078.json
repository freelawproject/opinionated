The case has a long history, and we previously remanded it for reconsideration in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47,127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). The BIA determined on remand that the Immigration Judge (the \u201cIJ\u201d) correctly determined in his original decision that Lucio\u2019s prior conviction for possession of marijuana was not an aggravated felony and that the IJ denied Lucio\u2019s application for cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. The issue before us now is whether we have jurisdiction to review the decision by the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">This is not the first time we have confronted a question about our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reconsider, or reopen and remand, a case. We have previously said that \u201cwhere a final order of removal is shielded from judicial review by a provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2), so, too, is the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen that order.\u201d <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is axiomatic that if we are divested of jurisdiction to review an original determination by the [BIA]\u201d on a matter within its discretion, \u201cwe must also be divested of jurisdiction to review the [BIA\u2019s] denial of a motion to reopen\u201d that rests solely on a matter within its discretion. <em>Rodriguez v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.3d 797, 800 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, in order to determine whether we possess jurisdiction to review Lucio\u2019s motion to reopen and remand, it is necessary to determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the underlying decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">We have already determined that this court lacks jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision regarding cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. But we have not, in a published opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> grappled with the precise issue at hand, whether the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae also applies to discretionary decisions regarding cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). There is not, however, any principled reason, on the arguments before us, to treat discretionary decisions under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) and \u00a7 1229b(a) differently.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>1252(a)(2)(B)(i) provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b ... of this title.\u201d We do not see a parsing of that language, which on its face does not distinguish between subsections of \u00a7 1229b, that admits a different result for \u00a7 1229(b)(a) than we have already reached for \u00a7 1229(b)(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Accordingly, because we do not have jurisdiction over the underlying discretionary issue, we also do not have jurisdiction over the appeal of the instant decision to deny the motion to reconsider or reopen and remand. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>253 F.3d at 800. But as in <em>Assaad, </em>we do not today attempt to \u201cresolve the thorny question whether \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial review of <em>all </em>motions to reopen.\u201d The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b851-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-5\">. Lucio urges us to view this case through the lens of our remand in light of <em>Lopez. </em>The argument is good as far as it goes \u2014 if there were any issue in this appeal as to the BIA's interpretation of <em>Lopez, </em>we would have jurisdiction. But the BIA's interpretation of <em>Lopez </em>does not aggrieve Lucio in the sense that we require for appellate standing. The BIA has now determined that Lucio is eligible for cancellation of removal, as the IJ did initially. The legal question that permitted us to hear Lucio's first appeal, whether he had statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal, is no longer present. The IJ made the correct determination initially, and the BIA\u2019s error, affirming the IJ on an alternative, and incorrect, ground, was remedied by its reconsideration after our remand. Instead, Lucio is aggrieved by the BIA's affirmance of the IJ\u2019s discretionary decision not to cancel removal. The issue before us, therefore, is one of discretion, not statutory eligibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b852-12\">. That is, of course, unless we are presented with a question of law or a constitutional issue. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (Supp. V 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b852-13\">. We did address the issue in <em>Mancha-Chairez v. Reno, </em>No. 99-60157, 2000 WL 992442, at *2 (5th Cir.2000) (per curiam), an unpublished opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-14\">. Though not briefed in the case before us, and so we do not reach the issue, we have previously noted that there is an argument that the language \"any judgment regarding the granting of relief,\" in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) strips only our jurisdiction over judgments that <em>grant </em>relief. We did reject that argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>in <em>Mancha-Chairez, </em>but that is not a precedential resolution of the issue under 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
