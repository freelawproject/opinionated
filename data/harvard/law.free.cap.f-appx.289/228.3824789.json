Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and upheld if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, they are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See SEC v. Rubera, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>350 F.3d 1084, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation and construction of a federal statute are questions of law reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d SEC v. Gemstar-TV Guide Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the investment offered by USRBT was a security but conclude that it was unnecessary for the district court to reach the issue of whether USRBT is a \u201cbank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Whether USRBT is a \u201cbank\u201d is not relevant to whether it offered a \u201csecurity\u201d because both banks and broker-dealers of bank-issued securities are subject to the antifraud and broker-dealer registration requirements embodied in \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and \u00a7 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(a)(l), which are the provisions at issue in the underlying enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The plain language of Securities Act \u00a7 17(c) provides that the exemptions for bank securities in \u00a7 3(a)(2) do not extend to the antifraud provisions of \u00a7 17. Further, because the plain language of \u00a7 3(a) provides that the limited exemptions thereunder extend only to the Securities Act, \u00a7 3(a)(2) does not exempt banks from the Exchange Act, including the antifraud provisions of \u00a7 10(b) and the broker-dealer registration requirements of \u00a7 15(a)(1). Therefore, even if USRBT were a \u201cbank\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3(a)(2), USRBT and the broker-dealers of its securities would nevertheless be subject to the securities laws at issue in this enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">For the same reason, we need not reach the question of whether USRBT is exempted from the securities laws at issue here either as a public instrumentality of a U.S. \u201cterritory\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3(a)(2) or as a tribal entity under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 461-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The district court did not err when it found that the investment offered by USRBT, which consisted of a certificate of deposit (\u201cCD\u201d) and a leveraged profit-sharing agreement, was a security. \u201cThe term \u2018security\u2019 means any note ... [or] investment contract____\u201d Securities Act \u00a7 2(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(a)(l); Exchange Act \u00a7 3(a)(10), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10). The instrument was a note, and that conclusion is bolstered by the following facts: (1) its purpose was to raise funds for USRBT\u2019s financial investments; (2) the buyers\u2019 interest was in the profits to be generated by it; (3) Defendants-Appellants were retained by USRBT to sell it to as many buyers as possible; (4) it was sold to at least twenty investors or investor groups comprising several hundred underlying investors; (5) it was advertised in at least one newspaper; (6) a reasonable investor was likely to regard it as an investment since it was marketed as offering the greater of a fixed rate of return of 6.5% or 20% of the profits gained by use of the leveraged funds; and (7) unlike a CD issued by a national or state-chartered bank and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the investment was not insured, guaranteed or subject to any alternative regulatory scheme that would reduce its risk. <em>See Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>494 U.S. 56, 66-67, 110 S.Ct. 945, 108 L.Ed.2d 47 (1990); <em>Marine Bank v. Weaver, </em>455 U.S. 551, 558-59, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982) (emphasizing that investment in CD linked to profit-sharing agreement was \u201cabundantly protected under the federal banking laws\u201d where CD was FDIC-insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The investment was also an investment contract, and thus a security, because purchasers were required to make an investment of money in a common en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>terprise with the expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others. <em>SEC v. W.J. Howey, </em>328 U.S. 293, 299, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Finally, the instrument should be characterized as a security because its economic risk required the protections provided to investors by the federal securities laws. <em>See Tcherepnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b251-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and ma not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
