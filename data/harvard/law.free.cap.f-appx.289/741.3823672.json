The district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of Appellees, enjoining Appellant South Mississippi Urgent Care, Inc. from using the term \u201cUrgent Care\u201d in its name, signs, telephone greetings, or promotional materials. For the reasons below, we REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Lydia King Rayner (\u201cRayner\u201d) began operating Urgent Care, Inc. in the Mississippi Gulf Coast area in 1985. On March 30, 2001, the Mississippi Secretary of State registered the service mark \u201cUrgent Care, Inc.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Rayner for use in the \u201cMedical Services\u201d arena. Rayner did <em>not </em>register the \u201cUrgent Care\u201d service mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). Rayner also set up a corporation named \u201cUrgicare, Inc.\u201d in the Mississippi Gulf Coast area. Rayner registered the service mark \u201cUrgiCare\u201d with the Mississippi Secretary of State on April 21, 2006, and with the USPTO on April 17, 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rayner alleged in her complaint that the pronunciation of \u201cUrgicare\u201d is very similar to \u201cUrgent Care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Dr. Ronnie Ali (\u201cAli\u201d) previously worked in Michigan at Henry Ford Urgent Care, Oakwood Hospital Urgent Care Clinic, and Lincoln Park Urgent Care Clinic. He moved to Mississippi and opened Apple Urgent Care Occupational Clinic with three other physicians. Ali relocated to the Mississippi Gulf Coast area and opened South Mississippi Urgent Care, Inc., shortly after Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">Rayner sent Ali and South Mississippi Urgent Care (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d) a cease-and-desist letter demanding that Appellants cease use of the mark \u201cUrgent Care.\u201d Ali continued to operate his clinic as South Mississippi Urgent Care, and Rayner filed suit in state court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition under the Lanham Act and Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 75-24-5. After removal to federal district court, Rayner filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction requesting that Appellants be enjoined from using the mark \u201cUrgent Care.\u201d The district court granted the preliminary injunction on December 6, 2007. Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">We review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Paulsson Geophysical Servs., Inc. v. Sigmar, </em>529 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir.2008). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error whereas legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">To obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued, (3) that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 309 (internal quotations omitted). In a trademark infringement suit, the party seeking a preliminary injunction must: (1) \u201cprove that the name he seeks to protect is eligible for protection\u201d; (2) \u201cprove he is the senior user\u201d; (3) \u201cshow a likelihood of confusion between his mark and that of the defendant\u201d; and (4) \u201cshow that the likelihood of confusion will actually cause him irreparable injury for which there is no adequate legal remedy.\u201d <em>Union Nat\u2019l Bank of Tex., Laredo, Tex. v. Union Nat\u2019l Bank of Tex., Austin, Tex., </em>909 F.2d 839, 844 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">In determining whether the mark at issue is protectable, the court must determine whether the mark is generic, descriptive, suggestive, or arbitrary/fanciful. <em>Id. </em>Assigning the mark into one of these categories \u201cdetermines whether or not, or in what circumstances, the word or phrase is eligible for trademark protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA generic term is one which identifies a genus or class of things or services, of which the particular item in question is merely a member.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845. In other words, \u201c[a] generic term connotes the \u2018basic nature of articles or services\u2019 rather than the more individualized characteristics of a particular product.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zatarains, Inc. v. Oak Grove Smokehouse, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 786, 790 (5th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>494 F.2d 3, 11 (5th Cir.1974)). A generic term is <em>never </em>eligible for protection under trademark law. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, a descriptive term \u201cidentifies a characteristic or quality of the article or service\u201d and is entitled to trademark protection only if secondary meaning is established.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Union Nat\u2019l Bank of Tex., </em>909 F.2d at 844-45 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Categorization of a mark is a factual issue that we review for clear error. <em>See id. </em>at 846. In determining whether a mark is generic, the mark \u201cmust be compared to the product or service to which it is applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo paraphrase Judge Learned Hand, the question is, \u2018What do the buyers understand by the word for whose use the parties are contending?\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 847 (quoting <em>Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., </em>272 F. 505, 509 (S.D.N.Y.1921)). In determining whether a mark is generic, we may consider the dictionary definition and consumer surveys, although neither is dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 847. Furthermore, we may consider \u201cwhether others in the same business would generally need the word to adequately describe their product or service\u201d and \u201cevidence regarding how many other businesses, <em>in the same industry, </em>use the term to describe their product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">Here, the district court found that Appellees established all of the required elements for preliminary injunctive relief, highlighting the likelihood of confusion be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>tween the parties\u2019 marks. Although the district coui't did not explicitly assign the marks \u201cUrgent Care\u201d and \u201cUrgiCare\u201d into a category, because it found a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, it can be assumed that the district court found the marks protectable (i.e., the marks are not generic and, if descriptive, they have acquired secondary meaning). We now address each mark in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">A. Urgent Care</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The \u201cUrgent Care\u201d mark is not federally registered and Appellants \u2014 the alleged infringers \u2014 argue that the mark is generic. In such a situation, Appellees had the burden to establish that the mark is not generic. <em>See, e.g., Filipino Yellow Pages, Inc. v. Asian Journal Publ\u2019ns, Inc., </em>198 F.3d 1143, 1146 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also 2 </em>J. Thomas McCarthy, <em>McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>12-30 (2003) (collecting cases). We find that Appellees failed to meet this burden and the district court\u2019s implicit finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Appellants argue that \u201cUrgent Care\u201d is a generic term for the provision of non-emergency medical services and point to its widespread use in the healthcare industry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants note that: (1) according to state registrations, more than twenty corporations in Mississippi and neighboring states use the term \u201cUrgent Care\u201d in their name; (2) at least ten medical providers in Mississippi registered with the UST-PO have the term \u201cUrgent Care\u201d in their name; (3) the American Medical Association adopted the code \u201cUCM\u201d (\u201cUrgent Care Medicine\u201d) for physicians who wish to designate themselves as urgent care specialists; and (4) several medical journals include the term \u201cUrgent Care\u201d in them title.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">We find that the term \u201cUrgent Care\u201d has not \u201cbecome distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce\u201d and, thereby, is a generic term that is not entitled to trademark protection. <em>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 763, 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992) (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f)). In other words, the term \u201cUrgent Care\u201d is used so extensively that \u201cothers should be equally entitled to use such nondistinctive words.\u201d <em>Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>494 F.2d at 11. Therefore, Appellees\u2019 mark is not protectable and the district court\u2019s grant of preliminary injunctive relief was in error. Accordingly, we need not address the district court\u2019s findings of likelihood of confusion and irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">B. UrgiCare</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">The mark \u201cUrgiCare\u201d is federally registered and, thereby, enjoys a presumption of validity. <em>Id. </em>at 10. In contrast to the \u201cUrgent Care\u201d mark, Appellants do not argue that \u201cUrgiCare\u201d is not protectable. Thus, we assume it is a valid mark. However, Appellees maintain the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion. <em>See Union Nat\u2019l Bank of Tex., </em>909 F.2d at 844. The district court\u2019s analysis in finding likelihood of confusion centered exclusively on Appellees\u2019 \u201cUrgent Care\u201d mark, not the \u201cUrgiCare\u201d mark. Appellees argue that, because \u201cUrgiCare\u201d sounds like the phrase \u201curgent care,\u201d Appellants\u2019 use of the phrase \u201curgent care\u201d is infringing and diluting its \u201cUrgiCare\u201d mark. This argument lacks merit. Because we find that \u201cUrgent Care\u201d is a generic term, Appellees cannot prevent use of the term by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>registering a similar-sounding, but differently spelled mark. <em>See Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>494 F.2d at 11 (noting that \u201cothers should be equally entitled to use such nondistinctive words\u201d). We find that South Mississippi Urgent Care is sufficiently distinct from UrgiCare such that Appellees\u2019 trademark rights are not infringed upon. Therefore, the preliminary injunction also fails with respect to the \u201cUrgiCare\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In light of the foregoing, we find that the district court\u2019s grant of preliminary injunctive relief was an abuse of discretion. The district court\u2019s judgment is REVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\">. The registration with the Mississippi Secretary of State\u2019s Office provides that the mark in question is \"URGENTCARE INC.\u201d However, both parties and the district court primarily refer to the mark as \"Urgent Care\u201d and sometimes as \"URGENTCARE.\u201d Our findings here apply with equal force to all three iterations of the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-16\">. The registration with the Mississippi Secretary of State\u2019s Office provides that the mark in question is \"URGICARE.\u201d However, the mark is identified in the USPTO registration as \"UrgiCare.\u201d The parties primarily utilize the latter version. Our findings here apply with equal force to both iterations of the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. In <em>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">Secondary meaning is used generally to indicate that a mark or dress has come through use to be uniquely associated with a specific source. To establish secondary meaning, a manufacturer must show that, in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">505 U.S. 763, 766 n. 4, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">.
