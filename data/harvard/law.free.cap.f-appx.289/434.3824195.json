Goldberg, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In May 2003, Plaintiff-Appellant Dona J. Jackson filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging deprivation of her civil rights by various individuals and entities, including past and current New York State Police Officers. Her suit was thereafter transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Jackson filed a \u201ccombined motion\u201d before that court. The District Court denied the motion, and Jackson now appeals pro se from this denial. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">To date, the District Court has not entered a final judgment in Jackson\u2019s case. Jackson nonetheless appeals from the District Court\u2019s interlocutory order (1) dismissing Jackson\u2019s RICO and conspiracy claims, (2) denying Jackson\u2019s motion for the recusal or disqualification of the magistrate judge, (3) denying Jackson\u2019s motion for a default judgment, (4) denying Jackson\u2019s motion challenging the District Court\u2019s transfer order, (5) denying Jackson\u2019s motions for the impanelment of a federal grand jury, investigation of matters asserted in her complaint by a federal grand jury, and the appointment of the special prosecutor, and, finally, (6) denying Jackson\u2019s motion to enjoin the Office of the Attorney General, including his staff, from representing the defendants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the courts of appeals \u201chave jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States ... except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\u201d Generally, a final decision is a \u201cdecision by the [district [cjourt that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, this Court may hear appeals of interlocutory orders certified by the district court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), subject to the collateral order doctrine, <em>see Shelter Realty Corp. v. Allied Maintenance Corp., </em>574 F.2d 656, 659 (2d Cir.1978), or pertaining to injunctions that affect the substance of the plaintiffs basic claim, <em>see 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); <em>Int\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Prods. Corp. v. Koons, </em>325 F.2d 403, 406 (2d Cir.1963). Where these exceptions do not apply, we are without jurisdiction to review non-final decisions of a district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">With one exception, the District Court\u2019s order as to Jackson\u2019s \u201ccombined motion\u201d did not \u201cend [ ] the litigation on the merits,\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>437 U.S. at 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, and so we are without jurisdiction to consider these claims on appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal as it pertains to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We may assert jurisdiction to hear Jackson\u2019s appeal from the denial of her motion to enjoin the Office of the Attorney General from representing the defendants in this case, insofar as this motion is construed as a request for a preliminary or permanent injunction against the defendants for conduct related to that which Jackson seeks to enjoin in her complaint. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). We may not, however, consider Jackson\u2019s other claims as pendant to this appealable order, as those claims are not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d such that an exercise of such jurisdiction is appropriate. <em>See Swint v. Chambers County Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>See Forest City Daly Housing, Inc. v. Town of North Hempstead, </em>175 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.1999). We are satisfied that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jackson\u2019s request for injunctive relief. We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court as it pertains to this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s claims and find them to be unavailing. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment denying Jackson\u2019s motion for injunctive relief, and we DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction Jackson\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
