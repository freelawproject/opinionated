On appeal, he contends that the distiict court, in calculating his guideline sentencing range, erred by applying a four-level enhancement for violation of commodities laws, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(15)(B). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Lozano, </em>490 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2007). Clear error exists where we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Section 2Bl.l(b)(15) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a four-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">If the offense involved \u2014 [...]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">(B) a violation of commodities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant was (i) an officer or a director of a futures commission merchant or an introducing broker; (ii) a commodities trading advisor; or (iii) a commodity pool operator [\u00b6]... ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeU\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(15). Comment 14 notes that \u201ccommodities trading advisor\u201d and \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d have the meanings given to those terms by the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 la. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 14. That statute defines the terms as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">(5) Commodity pool operator. The term \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d means any person engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in any commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility, except that the term does not include such persons not within the intent of the definition of the term as the Commission may specify by rule, regulation, or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">(6) Commodity trading advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">(A) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the term \u201ccommodity trading advisor\u201d means any person who\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">(i) for compensation or profit, engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications, writings, or electronic media, as to the value of or the advisability of trading in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-15\">(I) any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">(II) any commodity option authorized under section 6c [7 USCS \u00a7 6c]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-17\">(III) any leverage transaction authorized under section 23 [7 USCS \u00a7 23]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-18\">(ii) for compensation or profit, and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>concerning any of the activities referred to in clause (i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 la(5) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We find no merit to Ramunno\u2019s argument. As an initial matter, the definitions of commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor do not require that a person who qualifies as one be registered or licensed as one. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 la(5) and (6). Thus, Ramunno\u2019s assertion that he was not registered as either entity has no bearing on whether the district court correctly applied the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Moreover, the district court found that Ramunno was both a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor based on its uncontested factual findings that Ramunno (a) solicited money from investors by holding himself out as a successful commodities trader, (b) accepted money from investors, (c) advised investors in the merits of trading in commodities, and (d) issued earning reports to investors. Because Ramunno did not contest any of these underlying facts, which plainly support the district court\u2019s finding that Ramunno was a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor, the district court did not err by finding that he was eligible for the commodities law enhancement in \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(15)(B). Accordingly, we affirm Ramunno\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
