Favors based his claims on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), Fed.R.Cbim.P. 35, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K1.1 &amp; 5K2.0, and <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), and he contended that he was entitled to a sentence reduction because he rendered substantial assistance to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-23\">The statutes and Guidelines cited by Favors do not apply. Some require a government motion that is lacking in this case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(e); Rule 35(b); \u00a7 5K1.1. Another does not pertain to a downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-24\"><em>Wade </em>likewise provides no legal basis for Favors\u2019s claim. The Government has \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Moreover, \u201ca claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
