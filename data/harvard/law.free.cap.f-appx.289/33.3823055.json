In that complaint, Rutherford alleged various acts of misconduct by the nursing homes owned and operated by the defendants, acts that included poor caregiving by the nursing home staff that resulted in significant injuries to Dobbs. The district court understood Rutherford\u2019s complaint to allege professional negligence claims and dismissed it due to Rutherford\u2019s failure to comply with Mississippi law related to such claims. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">On appeal, Rutherford argues that the district court misunderstood the complaint in that the complaint actually alleged causes of action sounding in contract and related legal theories and asked for corresponding relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our review of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is <em>de novo. Sw. Bell Tel. v. City of Houston, </em>529 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.2008). The statute at issue, section 15-1-36(15) of the Mississippi Code, requires that any actions against health care providers \u201cbased upon the health care provider\u2019s professional negligence\u201d be preceded by a 60-day notice of the intention to file the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Rutherford did not give this notice, although the original \u2014 but now dismissed\u2014 plaintiff, William Glass, did.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Characterizing a professional negligence or malpractice claim as a contract claim is a strategy aimed at avoiding the limitations imposed on the former causes of action by statutes such as the one here. But the Mississippi Supreme Court has rejected this practice in the medical malpractice context. <em>See McMichael v. Howell, </em>919 So.2d 18, 23-24 (Miss.2005). In <em>McMichael, </em>the plaintiff sought to avoid the requirement that she introduce expert medical testimony, a medical malpractice requirement, by alleging a contract claim. <em>See id. </em>The court noted that the plaintiff relied on medical malpractice cases and made arguments in her brief that would require medical judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 23. The court accordingly found that \u201cMcMichael\u2019s argument to support her \u2018breach of contract\u2019 claim is nothing more than medical malpractice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We are faced with a similar situation here. Most importantly, the complaint gives substantial attention to the specific personal injuries suffered by Dobbs and Glass, including malnourishment, substantial physical injuries, and grotesque living conditions, all of which are clearly related to negligence with respect to the quality of caregiving both men received. The complaint also makes repeated general references to Beverly providing inadequate care; indeed, in the complaint section alleging \u201cConcealment and Deceit\u201d \u2014 a putatively non-negligence cause of action\u2014 Rutherford refers to Beverly\u2019s failures generally as \u201cviolations in the standard of care.\u201d And finally, as the district court noted, Glass did provide the notice required by the statute, indicating that Glass, as the original plaintiff, considered the complaint to state a professional negligence claim. And Rutherford simply joined Glass\u2019s complaint as a plaintiff not subject to arbitration; Rutherford\u2019s subsequent characterization of her omission as an independent litigation strategy is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Of course, we do not hold that purely contractual claims or other clearly non-negligence claims may not be brought against these defendants. But the allegations of the complaint before us are much too closely aligned with professional negligence to be treated as anything else; the judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-11\">. Rutherford also alleged claims related to civil conspiracy, concealment and deceit, and failure to treat the nursing home residents with dignity and respect, and asked for declaratory and injunctive relief in addition to actual and punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-14\"><em>. </em>Federal jurisdiction exists here owing to the parties\u2019 diversity. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. And, \"[ujnder the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\u201d <em>Foradori v. Harris, </em>523 F.3d 477, 486 (5th Cir.2008). Rutherford makes no argument that \u00a7 15 \u2014 1\u2014 36(15) is procedural; we do not decide that issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
