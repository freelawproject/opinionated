SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Rafael Rodr\u00edguez-Barajas petitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), arguing that the BIA erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal because he had voluntarily left the country while his habeas corpus petition was pending in federal court. We must decide whether an alien subject to removal proceedings who voluntarily departs the United States after the BIA has issued a decision on his appeal, but while his habeas petition is pending, is deemed to have withdrawn his appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4 (2010). We conclude that the regulation does not apply to departures occurring after a BIA decision on appeal and while a habeas petition is pending, so the BIA has jurisdiction to review Rodriguez-Barajas\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">In 1990, Rodr\u00edguez-Barajas was admitted into the United States as a lawful permanent resident. In 1998, he was convicted in state court of possession of marihuana and sentenced to four years of deferred adjudication. In 2001, he applied for admission as a returning resident alien but was found ineligible for admission because of his conviction. He was served with a notice to appear alleging he was subject to removal for the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">Rodr\u00edguez-Barajas appeared with counsel before an immigration judge and conceded the allegations in the notice to appear. After a hearing, the immigration judge ruled that Rodr\u00edguez-Barajas was ineligible for cancellation of removal because of his aggravated-felony conviction. The BIA dismissed his appeal for failure to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">Rodr\u00edguez-Barajas filed a habeas petition in federal district court challenging the denial of his application for cancellation of removal. That petition was transferred to this court, which, in 2007, granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion to remand to the BIA in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). On remand, the government submitted documents showing that, during the pendency of his habeas petition, Rodr\u00edguez-Barajas had voluntarily removed himself to Mexico. The BIA dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4, Rodriguez-Barajas\u2019s voluntary departure constituted a withdrawal of his appeal. Rodriguez-Barajas filed the instant petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s rulings of law <em>de novo. Alvarado de Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 227, 233 (5th Cir.2009). We may not affirm the BIA\u2019s decision except on the basis of the reasons it provided. <em>Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 798, 803 n. 6 (5th Cir.2007). We must defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>own regulation \u201cunless an \u2018alternative reading is compelled by the regulation\u2019s plain language or by other indications of the Secretary\u2019s intent at the time of the regulation\u2019s <em>promulgation.\u2019,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We grant the BIA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations \u201cconsiderable legal leeway.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATG\">The regulation on which the BIA relied states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">Departure from the United States of a person who is the subject of deportation or removal proceedings ... subsequent to the taking of an appeal, but prior to a decision thereon, shall constitute a withdrawal of the appeal, and the initial decision in the case shall be final to the same extent as though no appeal had been taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4. Rodriguez-Barajas argues that \u00a7 1003.4 is not applicable, because his departure after the BIA\u2019s decision on appeal, but while his habeas petition was pending, was not \u201csubsequent to the taking of an appeal, but prior to a decision thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">No court appears to have addressed whether the language \u201csubsequent \u2018to the taking of an appeal, but prior to a decision thereon\u2019 \u201d covers departures occurring after a decision by the BIA but while a habeas petition is pending. The government argues that this case is controlled by <em>Long v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 516 (5th Cir.2005). <em>Long </em>did not, however, address the issue we face, because the petitioner there departed the country before the BIA rendered a decision. <em>Id. </em>at 518. Rather, the issue in <em>Long </em>was whether \u00a7 1003.4 covered involuntary as well as voluntary departures. <em>Id. </em>at 520-21. That we considered the petitioner in <em>Long </em>to have waived his appeal, <em>id. </em>at 520, tells us nothing about whether a petitioner does so if his departure follows the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Without any precedent on point, we turn to the plain language of \u00a7 1003.4, which says that if an alien departs \u201csubsequent to the taking of an appeal, but prior to a decision thereon ... the initial decision in the case shall be final to the same extent as though no appeal had been taken.\u201d From this language, it is evident that the BIA\u2019s decision on appeal is \u201ca decision\u201d under the regulation despite being subject to habeas review. If, according to \u00a7 1003.4, the immigration judge\u2019s decision counts as a \u201cdecision,\u201d albeit an \u201cinitial\u201d one, despite being subject to BIA review, then surely the BIA\u2019s decision to dismiss an appeal counts as \u201ca'decision\u201d despite being subject to habeas review. And because the regulation makes a distinction between \u201cinitial decision[s]\u201d and those that are \u201cfinal,\u201d it is manifest that a BIA decision on appeal is \u201ca decision\u201d even if it is not \u201cfinal\u201d in the sense that it is subject to habeas review. Therefore, departure after a BIA decision on appeal, while a habeas petition is pending, is not \u201cprior to a decision\u201d in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">A contrary interpretation, in which \u201ca decision\u201d would occur only once the case was conclusively decided, would also render the words \u201cprior to a decision thereon\u201d superfluous. This is so because once the case is conclusively decided, there is no longer an appeal to waive. Therefore, any departure subsequent to the taking of an appeal by a person subject to removal proceedings would constitute a waiver of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Comparing \u00a7 1003.4 to a similar provision, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) (2010), is also instructive. Under \u00a7 1003.2(d), any departure from the United States after filing a motion to reopen or reconsider by a person subject to removal proceedings precludes BIA jurisdiction to consider the motion. The government argues that because the same policies underlie \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(d) and 1003.4, the two sections should be interpreted analogously. But there is a critical difference between the two provisions: Section 1003.2(d) says that \u201c[a]ny departure from the United States ... occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, shall constitute a withdrawal of such a motion.\u201d By contrast, \u00a7 1003.4 says that a departure constitutes a withdrawal of an appeal only if it occurs \u201cprior to a decision thereon.\u201d The presence of such limiting language in \u00a7 1003.4, but not in \u00a7 1003.2(d), suggests that the former regulation should not be interpreted to mirror the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">A contrary holding would also conflict with <em>Nken v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 1761, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009), holding that the burden of removal alone does not by itself constitute irreparable injury for purposes of granting a stay of removal. The Court so held because the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 permitted judicial review of a petition by a removed alien.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without BIA jurisdiction on remand, consideration of a removed alien\u2019s habeas petition would be pointless, because the sole remedy available under habeas review in the case of a removed alien is to vacate the removal order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, <em>contra Nken, </em>removal from the United States would result in irreparable injury, because an alien would not be able to obtain any relief from the BIA on remand after the order was vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">The government admits that \u201cthere is a tension between this [cjourt\u2019s jurisdiction over petitions for review and the regulation that controls the [BIA\u2019s] jurisdiction\u201d and concedes that an alien removed while his habeas petition is pending \u201ccould nonetheless pursue his appeal before the [BIA]\u201d on remand. The government argues that the BIA nevertheless does not have jurisdiction over Rodriguez-Barajas\u2019s appeal, because his departure from the United States was voluntary. The plain language of \u00a7 1003.4, however, makes no distinction between voluntary and involuntary departures<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 neither is covered by \u00a7 1003.4 if it does not occur \u201cprior to a decision\u201d on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">In sum, \u00a7 1003.4 unambiguously does not bar the BIA\u2019s jurisdiction over the appeal of an alien who departs, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, after the BIA has decided his appeal but while his habeas petition is pending.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the government\u2019s interpretation of the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tion is not entitled to deference. <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ., </em>512 U.S. at 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED for further proceedings as needed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v.

The government argues, in the alternative, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AumM\">even assuming the [BIA] had jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s appeal, he is not eligible for any form of relief. Because he relinquished his lawful permanent resident status ..., he is not eligible for cancellation of removal under INA section 240A(a) ..., and he is not eligible for cancellation of removal under INA section 240a(b) ..., because of his controlled substance conviction. We express no view on that assertion, which the BIA is free to consider on remand. By a post-submission letter filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), Rodriguez-Barajas claims support from <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), and <em>Dada v. Mukasey, </em>554 U.S. 1, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008). We likewise do not opine on the applicability, if any, of those decisions, nor do we limit the matters that the BIA may consider, as appropriate, on remand.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
