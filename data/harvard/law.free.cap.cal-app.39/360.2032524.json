There is no merit in this contention. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rippe, </em>32 Cal. App. 514, [163 Pac. 506] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>34 Cal. App. 641, [168 Pac. 574]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>36 Cal. App. 63, [171 Pae. 442].) The record also sufficiently indicates that the evidence taken at the preliminary examination clearly showed the commission of the offense as charged in the information as amended. Furthermore, the court offered the defendant a reasonable continuance to enable him to prepare to meet the situation, but he did not avail himself of the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">One of the witnesses for the prosecution was shown to have made at other times statements contrary to her testimony given in court. The jury heard and passed on her credibility and there was sufficient evidence in the whole case to warrant the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The criticism by the court of the prosecuting officer in connection with the amending of the information in no way prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The judgment and orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Richards, J., and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
