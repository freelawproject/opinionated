Defendant issued the policy set forth in the complaint, by the terms of which it insures William J. Bennetts against \u201cdeath or disability, while sane, and resulting directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries, effected through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d The policy was issued on the twenty-sixth day of June, 1909, to be in force for a period of twelve months from said date. The insured died on August 11, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The ground upon which this action was brought was that the death of the insured \u201cresulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries, effected through external, violent, and accidental means.\u201d This contention was denied by defendant. There were two other defenses interposed by defendant, but as no evidence was offered in support thereof, they are immaterial here.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The case was tried by the court without a jury. The court found \u201cthat the death of said William J. Bennetts did not result directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means\u201d; and further found that the death of said William J. Bennetts did not result from \u201cexternal means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>. . . violent means,\u201d or \u201caccidental means,\u201d and judgment went for defendant accordingly. This appeal is from the order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\">On the day of the alleged accident it appears without conflict that the said insured was assisting one M. B. Craig in pulling out of a sump-hole a swing-pipe, which had gotten clogged therein. The said insured took hold of the pipe a little ahead of the place .where said Craig had hold thereof, and with said Craig pulled on it. The said Craig cautioned him to pull slowly, and told him that the pipe \u201cwould have to come slow.\u201d While so engaged both men were leaning in front of a rail, pulling, and while so doing Craig heard the insured \u201cgive a kind of a grunt, but didn\u2019t say anything then.\u201d Then they continued to pull, and, in the language of Craig, \u201cpulled it out easily.\u201d That night, or the next morning, the insured was taken ill. From this illness, regardless of the cause, he never recovered, his death occurring on August 11, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">It appears that his physical condition and state of health prior thereto for a long time, with one exception, had been very good. That'exception was that either in 1905 or 1906 he had undergone a successful operation for appendicitis, since when \u201che had never made any complaint of illness. Never had an ache or pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">After being taken from the hospital, on the occasion of his last illness, another operation was performed by the attending physician and surgeon, within the abdominal cavity, where there was found \u201ca band surrounding a portion of the small intestine, and which condition was relieved by the operation\u201d; but the insured died on the fifth day thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Two points urged by appellant need our consideration. The proper answer to the question: \u201cDid the death of the insured, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence here, result from bodily injuries effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means?\u201d\u2014will dispose of both. Obviously, if the answer be in the affirmative, the order granting a new trial herein was properly made; otherwise it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The supreme court of this state, in the well-considered case of <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>172 Cal. 462, [L. R. A. 1916E, 1196, 156 Pac. 1029], in a learned opinion written by Justice Sloss for and adopted by that court, sitting in Bank, has, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>we view it, construed the phrase \u201cbodily injury effected through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d The facts in that case were more favorable to the plaintiff there than are the facts in the case at bar to the plaintiff here. The views there expressed are, we believe, determinative of the points here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">Paraphrasing some of the language of that case to fit the facts here, briefly stated, the case at bar is simply this: Bennetts undertook to help Craig, the foreman, to lift a pipe out of the sump-hole. In doing so he did not slip, or lose his hold, or become unbalanced; nor did the pipe, or anything else, strike or touch him in any way. The record does not disclose that anything of an unusual or unexpected nature occurred in the course of lifting the pipe out of the sump-hole. The entire operation, so far as disclosed by the evidence, was carried out in precisely the manner intended by Bennetts. The subsequent happenings have already been set forth,</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On these facts, which in the case at bar are without conflict, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff failed to sustain the burden, which was upon her, of proving that the death \u201cresulted directly and independently of all other causes, from bodily injuries, effected through external, violent, and accidental means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">On the authority, therefore, of <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., supra, </em>we conclude that the answer to our question must be in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">It follows, therefore, that the findings of the trial court were sustained by the evidence, and that a new trial should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Order granting a new trial reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Finlayson, P. J., and Sloane, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
