Still if I would make money, and see my way through, I would send you some money, and I will the first chance that I make something I will help you. ... I loaned a party some money which he promised sure by next month I would get $300 of it. Should I succeed in this I will send you sure $150 or $200 of this. At the present time I cannot do anything on account I have not it. I Imow, Mrs. Snyder, the disposition how you feel, and I hope Willard makes some money soon. He has been working hard always the same as I and you know if I got it I would help you, but it is impossible to do so at the present time.\u201d The case of <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Petch, </em>166 Cal. 329, [136 Pac. 55], wherein a number of authorities are cited, is authority for the statement that the written acknowledgment of a debt, within the contemplation of section-360 of the Code of Civil Procedure, sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the statute of limitations, must be a distinct, unqualified, unconditional recognition of the obligation for which the person making such admission is liable. Tested by this rule, it is clear that there is nothing contained in the letter which can be construed as an unconditional promise on the part of defendant to pay the outlawed debt. While it is true the writer refers to money which he got from plaintiff\u2019s husband, there is no unconditional promise to pay the same. On the contrary, he says it is impossible to pay at the present time, but if he succeeds in collecting money promised him, he will send her $150 or two hundred dollars. The case is very similar to that of <em>Van Buskirk </em>v. <em>Kuhns, </em>164 Cal. 472, [Ann. Cas. 1914B, 932, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 710, 129 Pac. 587], where the promise was to pay when able to do so. It does not appear that any of the conditions upon which defendant promised to pay, if his language can be construed as a promise, ever happened. Plaintiff\u2019s right of action must-be measured by the promise made, and, since it is not alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>nor shown that the condition upon which the promise was made was fulfilled, it cannot be claimed that such promise extended the time to sue upon the original obligation. At most, it was a substituted conditional promise and not a renewal of the outlawed original promise upon which the obligation was based. (See <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento, </em>70 Cal. 412, [11 Pac. 748]; <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>127 Cal. 528, [60 Pac. 42].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Appellant has cited a number of authorities from other states, some of which appear to be inconsistent with the views expressed. However that may be, we feel compelled to follow the decisions of the supreme court of this state touching like questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Conrey, P. J., and James, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
