Assuming the amendments to be made and after certain evidence was received thereunder, defendants withdrew their motion to amend and elected to stand upon their answer as made. Thereupon the \u2022 court set aside the order permitting the amendment. The trial proceeded to completion, when findings were made adverse to the plaintiff and judgment rendered thereon for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">From what we are able to glean from the confused statement of plaintiff, who appears <em>in p^'opria persona, </em>she claims to have been prejudiced by the ruling of the court in permitting the amendment, thus raising new issues, to meet which she was not prepared. At the time, however, the court, recognizing that necessity therefor might arise, stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>would grant her time within which to procure her evidence touching the issues raised by the amended answer. Defendants\u2019 waiver of their right to amend, and their election to stand upon their answer, left the issues exactly as they were at the beginning of the trial; hence we are unable to see how plaintiff could have been surprised to her prejudice by the rulings of which she complains.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">A further complaint is based upon the claim that, notwithstanding the admissions contained in defendants\u2019 answer, the court, upon the evidence received on the theory that the answer would be amended, based thereon certain findings adverse to plaintiff. Conceding this to be true, the error, if plaintiff was prejudiced thereby, could not be reached by a motion of this character. Her remedy was a motion for new trial or an appeal. The mere vacation of the judgment, which she sought, would leave the findings standing upon a completed trial upon which it would be the duty of the court to enter judgment in accordance therewith, and that necessarily and concededly must be adverse to plaintiff. Section 663 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for the vacation of a judgment and the entering of a new one where it is not in accordance with the findings; but that is not this case. Appellant, conceding the findings to be adverse to her, simply asks that the judgment be vacated. While appellant may have just cause for complaint, due to erroneous rulings made by the court in the course of the trial, or based upon the fact that the findings are not within the issues or not supported by the evidence, such errors cannot be reviewed upon a motion to vacate the judgment, made under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on account of excusable neglect, inadvertence, or surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Conrey, P.
