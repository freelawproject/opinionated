The Board ordered the Frontier to reimburse the unions for their negotiation costs and to pay the litigation costs\u2014primarily attorney\u2019s fees\u2014incurred by both the unions and the NLRB General Counsel. The employer petitions for review, arguing that the Board erred in assessing negotiation costs, that the Board lacks the power to assess litigation costs, and that if the Board does have the power to assess litigation costs, then it erred in assessing them in this case. The Board cross-applies for enforcement of its order. We deny the petition and enforce the order with respect to the payment of the unions\u2019 negotiation costs, but grant the petition and deny enforcement with respect to the employer\u2019s payment of litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b840-24\">Unbelievable, Inc., purchased the Frontier Hotel &amp; Casino, located on the Las Vegas Strip, in 1988. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Union of Operating Engineers each represented certain groups of employees at the Frontier. Athough the contracts between the Unions and the Frontier\u2019s previous owner had expired in 1987, Unbelievable continued to implement the terms of the expired contracts for some time. In April 1989, however, Unbelievable imposed new contract terms upon the two groups of employees represented by the Teamsters.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>In May 1990 Unbelievable hired Joel I. Keiler to negotiate new contracts with both Unions. Keiler has long had a troubled history. He was briefly suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia, <em>see Matter of Keiler, </em>380 A.2d 119 (D.C.1977), and he has run afoul of the Board on several occasions. <em>See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., </em>315 N.L.R.B. 882 (1994); <em>CWI of Maryland, Inc., </em>321 N.L.R.B. No. 101, 1996 WL 395875 (1996). In March 1995 Keiler was suspended from practicing before the Board for one year because of his misconduct in representing another Las Vegas casino. <em>See In re Joel I. Keiler, </em>316 N.L.R.B. 763. <em>See also NLRB v. Unbelievable, Inc., </em>71 F.3d 1434 (9th Cir.1995) (sanctioning Frontier and Keiler for filing frivolous appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">After Unbelievable hired him, Keiler asked the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to set up meetings between the Company and the Unions. Keiler and the mediator each left messages for Robert Fox, who represented the Operating Engineers, and for Richard Thomas, who represented the Teamsters, but they were unable to set up a meeting. Although the Company had not yet informed the Unions that Keiler represented it, he sent letters to both Fox and Thomas in late June complaining about their lack of response to his overtures. He enclosed with the letters proposed contracts and wrote that if they did not contact him in order to arrange a bargaining session by August 1, then the Frontier would implement the proposed terms unilaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The proposed contracts were significantly less attractive to the Unions than were their previous contracts. For example, the Company proposed to reduce the wages of some Teamsters to $6.50 per hour from $11.92 per hour, and to cut by 5% the wages of most employees represented by the Operating Engineers. Both proposed contracts would have made it difficult for an employee ever to receive holiday or vacation pay, eliminated the pension plan, and substituted a new health plan for those of the Unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Keiler and the Operating Engineers held three bargaining sessions from July to November. At the first meeting Fox told Keiler that the proposals were so outlandish that no union would ever agree to them and Keiler (according to Fox, whom the Board credited) responded that the Frontier\u2019s General Manager did not care and would not mind if the proposals led to a strike. Keiler did not consider the Union\u2019s counter-proposal, which closely paralleled the terms of the standard union contract in use on the Las Vegas Strip. Little happened at the second meeting. At the third meeting Keiler declared the two sides at an impasse and told Fox that the Company would implement its proposal, to which Fox responded that they were not at an impasse because the Company had not bargained in good faith. Keiler did later agree to retain the union\u2019s health and welfare plan, but on December 1, 1990 the Company implemented the other terms of its proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Negotiations with the Teamsters followed a similar course. Of the discharge language in the proposal, Keiler said (according to Thomas, whom the Board credited), \u201cIt means we can virtually fire anybody for anything.\u201d Again Keiler indicated that the Frontier\u2019s General Manager wanted a strike so that he could replace the employees and get rid of the Unions. Keiler did agree to some changes'\u2014for example, in the vacation and holiday pay proposal\u2014and the Union agreed to certain of the Company\u2019s minor proposals. After the union membership unanimously rejected the proposal in a secret ballot vote, Keiler told Thomas that the Frontier would implement its proposals unilaterally if the Teamsters did not accept them by November 1. Again Keiler later agreed that the Company would continue contributing to the Union\u2019s health insurance plan, and again on December 1 the Company implemented its other proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The Unions filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board. After several days of hearings, an Administrative Law Judge issued findings and conclusions in May 1992. The ALJ held that the Company violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1), (3), and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>by failing to bargain with the Unions in good faith and by unlawfully discharging a union supporter. The ALJ dismissed the charges that the Company had unlawfully withheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>certain information from the Unions and that it had unlawfully withdrawn its health plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The charge that the Company had not bargained in good faith consumed the bulk of the hearing and of the ALJ\u2019s recommended order. Because he found that Keiler\u2019s testimony was not credible, the ALJ relied for his factual findings almost entirely upon the testimony of the General Counsel\u2019s witnesses. The ALJ concluded that Keiler\u2019s negotiation strategy was to reach an impasse so that the Company would be able to implement its proposals unilaterally and force the Unions into a strike. First, Keiler submitted a proposal that differed substantially from the previous contract and gave the Union only a month to respond to it. Second, the Company did not promptly inform the Unions that Keiler was representing it. Third, Keiler\u2019s use of the federal mediator \u201cseems to [have been] designed only for the purpose of setting the foundation for an argument that it was the [Frontier] which was operating in good faith by first contacting the mediator.\u201d The ALJ, finding that Keiler, at the Frontier\u2019s direction, never really sought to reach agreement with the Unions, deemed the Company\u2019s conduct \u201cclassic surface bargaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law. Further, the Board held that it would require the Company to pay the Unions\u2019 negotiating expenses because the Company had \u201cengaged in egregious and deliberate surface bargaining\u201d with the Unions, which \u201cunnecessarily diminished their economic strength.\u201d <em>Unbelievable, Inc., </em>318 N.L.R.B. 857 (1995). The Board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\">In cases of unusually aggravated misconduct ... where it may fairly be said that a respondent\u2019s substantial unfair labor practices have infected the core of a bargaining process to such an extent that their effects cannot be ehminated by the application of traditional remedies ... an order requiring the respondent to reimburse the charging party for negotiation expenses is warranted both to make the charging party whole for the resources that were wasted because of the unlawful conduct, and to restore the economic strength that is necessary to ensure a return to the status quo ante at the bargaining table.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">Applying this standard to the ALJ\u2019s findings, the Board determined that through Keiler the Frontier had engaged in \u201cdeliberate and egregious bad faith conduct aimed at frustrating the bargaining process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858. In particular, the Board stressed (1) Keiler\u2019s pre-negotiation conduct; (2) the wide gap between the status quo and the Company\u2019s initial proposals; and (3) Keiler\u2019s conduct at the bargaining table. The Board concluded that because Keiler \u201clost no opportunity to goad the Unions to strike,\u201d his \u201cconduct rendered the bargaining between the parties merely a charade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Board ordered the Frontier to pay the expenses incurred by the Unions for their fruitless negotiations with Keiler.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">The Board also required the Frontier to pay both the Unions\u2019 and the General Counsel\u2019s litigation expenses: the Company\u2019s presentation of frivolous defenses \u201cdepleted the [Unions\u2019] resources\u201d and \u201cneedlessly wasted\u201d those of the Board; and compensation was required because \u201ceven a bargaining order accompanied by reimbursement of the charging party\u2019s negotiation expenses is insufficient to restore a charging party\u2019s economic strength and to ensure meaningful bargaining.\u201d 318 N.L.R.B. at 857, 862. The Board explained further that its policy is to order a respondent to pay the charging party\u2019s litigation expenses \u201conly where the defenses raised by the respondent are frivolous rather than debatable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860. Constrained by the principle that \u201cBoard orders must be remedial rather than punitive,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Board would not order a respondent to pay the charging party\u2019s litigation expenses if the respondent\u2019s defense turned upon an issue of credibility or if the respondent raised any defense that was not frivolous. In the present case, however, credibility was only technically at issue; Keiler\u2019s incredibility was so apparent that ordering the Company to pay the Unions\u2019 litigation expenses was consistent with the applicable principles, if not with the Board\u2019s precedents. <em>Id. </em>at 861. In addition, the Board noted that, although two of the charges filed against the Frontier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>were dismissed\u2014indicating that the Company\u2019s defenses to those charges were hardly frivolous\u2014the charges themselves were insignificant compared to the charge of surface bargaining, which had been the dominant subject of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Because the Company\u2019s \u201csole defense\u201d to the charge of surface bargaining rested upon Keiler\u2019s testimony, the Board focused upon his part in the hearing. Keiler\u2019s testimony, particularly during cross-examination, was \u201cunresponsive, aggressive, and flagrantly disrespectful.\u201d 318 N.L.R.B. at 860. For example, when asked whether he was getting paid for his time testifying, Keiler responded, \u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen? We could all be dead tomorrow.\u201d When shown a document and asked \u201cHow did you arrive at the writing on the right-hand corner here?\u201d Keiler responded, \u201cBy airplane.\u201d The Board concluded that Keiler\u2019s conduct as a witness showed \u201chis intent to make a charade of this proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board also stated that \u201cKeiler\u2019s flagrantly unlawful course of conduct as the [Company\u2019s] agent in negotiations with the Unions\u201d constituted a \u201cfurther basis\u201d for requiring the Frontier to pay the Unions\u2019 litigation costs (although not those of the General Counsel). <em>Id. </em>at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The Company does not contest the Board\u2019s conclusions that it violated the NLRA by failing to bargain in good faith and by unlawfully discharging a union supporter. Accordingly, we shall enforce the Board\u2019s order insofar as it relates to those charges. In addition, we find substantial evidence in the record supporting the Board\u2019s finding that the Company engaged in \u201caggravated misconduct\u201d during its negotiations with the Unions and we affirm the order directing the Frontier to pay the Unions\u2019 negotiation expenses. We also hold, however, that the Board lacks authority under the NLRA to order a respondent to pay the litigation expenses incurred by a charging party or by the General Counsel of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">A. Negotiation Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The Frontier does not question the Board\u2019s authority to order a respondent to reimburse the charging party for negotiation expenses if the respondent\u2019s misconduct has been unusually aggravated and its unfair labor practices have infected \u201cthe core of the bargaining process to such an extent that their effects cannot be eliminated by the application of traditional remedies.\u201d The Company does argue, however, that there is not substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">We uphold the Board on this point. As to credibility, we accept the ALJ\u2019s finding that Unbelievable lived up to its ill-chosen name. <em>See Exxel/Atmos v. NLRB, </em>28 F.3d 1243, 1246 (D.C.Cir.1994) (ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations conclusive unless \u201cpatently unsupportable\u201d). The testimony of the General Counsel\u2019s witnesses provides substantial evidence for the Board\u2019s finding that the Company did not intend to reach an agreement with the Unions. Keiler\u2019s statement that the General Manager of the Frontier wanted the Unions to strike so that he could replace the employees surely qualifies as \u201caggravated misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Nonetheless, the Company argues, the order should not stand because (1) the Company has no history of violating the Act; (2) it is not responsible for Keiler\u2019s behavior; and (3) the Unions engaged in misconduct as well. None of these challenges has any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">First, a respondent\u2019s labor history, good or bad, is not a factor that the Board need consider in determining whether to order the respondent to pay the charging party\u2019s negotiation expenses. The rationale for ordering a respondent to reimburse the charging party for its negotiation expenses is to restore the charging party to the status quo ante; the respondent\u2019s prior record of compliance with the Act is irrelevant to the propriety of such relief. Indeed, to consider the respondent\u2019s history would strongly suggest that the assessment of negotiation costs is a punitive rather than a compensatory measure. <em>Cf. Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>311 U.S. 7, 10, 61 S.Ct. 77, 78-79, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940) (NLRA is remedial, not punitive).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Second, although the Company comes not to praise Keiler but to bury him, it cannot escape responsibility for the misconduct of its former attorney. The Frontier argues that the Board erred in focusing upon Keiler\u2019s conduct and not upon that of the Company itself in determining whether the employer must pay the Unions\u2019 negotiation costs. The Company\u2019s contention ignores the most basic principles of the law of agency. <em>See </em>O.W. Holmes, Jr., <em>The Common Law </em>180 (1881) (principal bound by terms of contract formed by agent); <em>Local 1814, Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, </em>735 F.2d 1384, 1394-95 (D.C.Cir.1984) (upholding Board in decertifying union due to illegal kickback agreement between union officials and employer), <em>citing </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(1) at 504 (1957). A company may not hire an attorney to represent it in negotiations, and then by claiming ignorance of the attorney\u2019s tactics avoid paying the price for the attorney\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Finally, the Company argues that the Board should have refrained from granting the Unions an extraordinary remedy because they have unclean hands. For one thing, the Frontier points to the violent behavior of certain members of both Unions while on strike over the past five years; but the conduct of union members after negotiations broke down is not relevant to whether the Company is liable for the Unions\u2019 pre-strike negotiation costs. If the Unions are implicated in misconduct by strikers, then the Company may file its own charges against the Unions. For another, the Frontier argues that by insisting upon the terms of the standard Las Vegas Strip contract the Unions were partly to blame for the parties\u2019 failure to reach an agreement. The Unions had little reason to do more, however, when Keiler presented his proposals as non-negotiable diktats, <em>see NLRB v. General Electric Co., </em>418 F.2d 736, 756-59 (1969) (take-it-or-leave-it approach to bargaining in context of anti-union animus violates Act), and informed the Unions that the General Manager of the Company hoped the Unions would strike so he could hire replacements. As it was, both Unions sought additional meetings even when Keiler could not wait to declare the negotiations at an impasse. In sum, substantial evidence in the record shows that inflexibility on the part of the Unions does not explain, let alone excuse, surface bargaining by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">B. Litigation Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The Board claims that it has the authority, under \u00a7 10(c) of the NLRA, to order a respondent to pay the litigation costs\u2014 including principally the attorney\u2019s fees\u2014incurred by both the charging party and the General Counsel.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Company argues that the statute is insufficiently specific to authorize a departure from the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that (with few exceptions) each side must bear its own legal expenses. <em>See Arcambel v. Wiseman, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 306, 1 L.Ed. 613 (1796).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">1. Circuit precedent and the American Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">For the first 35 years in which the Board administered the NLRA, it never claimed that it had the power to order a respondent to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of a charging party. Indeed, it declared that it would be inappropriate for the Board to assess attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin the light of the basic principle[ ] that Board orders must be remedial not punitive ... [T]he public interest in allowing the Charging Party to recover the costs of its participation in this litigation does not override the general and well-established princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>pie that litigation expenses are ordinarily not recoverable.\u201d <em>Heck\u2019s, Inc., </em>191 N.L.R.B. 886, 889 (1971). Nonetheless, having been prompted by this court (when reviewing a different decision), to reconsider its policy, <em>see Electrical Workers, IUE v. NLRB, </em>426 F.2d 1243, 1253 n. 15 (1970), the Board changed its mind, holding in <em>Tiidee Products, Inc., </em>194 N.L.R.B. 1234 (1972), that it did have the authority to shift the burden of attorney\u2019s fees in certain cases. When we came to review the decision in <em>Heck\u2019s, </em>in which the Board had refused to assess attorney\u2019s fees against a respondent, the court took the occasion to pre-approve the contrary approach that the Board had later adopted in <em>Tiidee. See Food Store Employees Union v. NLRB, </em>476 F.2d 546 (1973).<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The court did not, however, analyze whether the Congress had given the Board the authority to order a respondent to pay attorney\u2019s fees. Instead, deferring even more than we would today understep II of the analysis in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), the court simply recounted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">the Board reasoned that the Congressional objective of achieving industrial peace through collective bargaining \u201ccan only be effectuated when speedy access to uncrowded Board and court dockets is available .... [I]n order to discourage future frivolous litigation, to effectuate the policies of the Act, and to serve the public interest we find that it would be just and proper\u201d to order reimbursement of both the Board and the Union for their expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation, presentation, and conduct of the cases before it and the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-6\"><em>Food Store Employees, </em>476 F.2d at 550-51, <em>quoting Tiidee Products, Inc., </em>194 N.L.R.B. at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Then came <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), which, as a leading commentator put it, \u201calter[ed] dramatically the developing law on attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d 10 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d \u00a7 2675 (1983). In <em>Alyeska, </em>the Supreme Court rebuffed efforts by plaintiffs and some courts alike to chip away at the American Rule, declaring categorically that \u201cthe circumstances under which attorney\u2019s fees are to be awarded and the range of discretion of the courts in making those awards are matters for Congress to determine.\u201d 421 U.S. at 262, 95 S.Ct. at 1624. Nor may a court infer a congressional intent to override the presumption that the American Rule erects against the award of attorney\u2019s fees without \u201cclear support\u201d either on the face or in the legislative history of the statute. Rather, as the Supreme Court made clear again in <em>Summit Valley Industries, Inc. v. Carpenters, </em>456 U.S. 717, 726, 102 S.Ct. 2112, 2117, 72 L.Ed.2d 511 (1982), a court may award attorney\u2019s fees only when expressly so authorized by the legislature. In the latter case the unanimous Court rejected the argument that \u00a7 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187, authorizing the courts to award \u201cdamages\u201d to an injured plaintiff, allowed for the award of attorney\u2019s fees as well: \u201cIn the absence of clear support for [that] construction in the language or legislative history of \u00a7 303 we decline to adopt such a broad exception to the American Rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Although the Court in <em>Summit Valley </em>dealt not with the NLRA but with a different part of the LMRA and therefore did not overrule our decision in <em>Food Store Employees, </em>the Court later indicated that a lower court must consider the implication of <em>Summit Valley </em>for the Board\u2019s claim of authority to award litigation expenses. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>when the Fourth Circuit became the only court to follow our holding in <em>Food Store Employees, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the court of appeals for reconsideration in the light of <em>Summit Valley. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>458 U.S. 1118, 102 S.Ct. 3505, 73 L.Ed.2d 1381 (1982), <em>vacating </em>668 F.2d 767 (1982). (The case settled before the court of appeals had a chance to reconsider the issue.) At the very least, therefore, we are obliged to ask whether we should follow <em>Food Store Employees </em>in the wake of <em>Summit Valley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Clearly, before <em>Summit Valley, </em>we had held in <em>Food Store Employees </em>that the Board had the authority to assess a losing party for attorney\u2019s fees without finding the express statutory authorization that the Court would later, in <em>Alyeska </em>and <em>Summit Valley, </em>require in order to overcome the presumption that the American Rule applies. Reference to \u201cthe Congressional objective of achieving industrial peace through collective bargaining,\u201d 476 F.2d at 550, simply does not invoke a clear source of statutory authority for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Although the petitioner emphasized the standard of clarity required under <em>Summit Valley </em>in its opening brief the Board tried to distinguish <em>Summit Valley </em>with only the inapt observation that, in purported contrast to \u00a7 303, \u201cthe express terms of Section 10(c) ... do not limit the Board\u2019s broad authority to order appropriate remedial measures to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d At oral argument the Board was understandably quick, therefore, to embrace Judge Wald\u2019s observation that <em>Summit Valley </em>may not be controlling here because that case involved attorney\u2019s fees awarded by a court, whereas \u00a7 10(c) of the NLRA broadly authorizes an administrative agency to remedy unfair labor practices. We see nothing in the rationale of <em>Summit Valley, </em>however, to indicate that it does not apply equally to a statute granting remedial power to an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">On the contrary, the wide range of cases since <em>Food Store Employees </em>in which the Supreme Court has reaffirmed its adherence to the American Rule gives us reason to believe that the presumption against fee-shifting does apply to the NLRA. <em>See, e.g., Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160,183-85, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2600-02, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976) (court may not award attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for want of express authority; nor is implied authority for such award provided by generalized command of \u00a7 1988 to furnish suitable remedies to vindicate rights conferred by Civil Rights Acts); <em>Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 271, 95 S.Ct. at 1628 (reversing grant of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs as private attorneys general because only Congress, not courts, can authorize exception to American Rule); <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 126, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2163-64, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974) (reversing award of attorney\u2019s fees under Miller Act because it does not \u201cexplicitly provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful plaintiff\u2019); <em>cf. Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984) (discussed below).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Since the Supreme Court first made it clear that only the Congress and not the courts can override the American Rule, the Congress has in recent years expressly authorized fee-shifting in a number of statutory provisions, starting with the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which was passed in direct response to the <em>Alyeska </em>decision. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (1990) (fee shifting under Americans With Disabilities Act); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 216(b) and 626(b) (fee shifting under Age Discrimination in Employment Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The Supreme Court, in turn, treats congressional silence in a particular statute as an indication that the legislature did not intend to authorize fee shifting. For example, in <em>Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 809, 114 S.Ct. 1960, 128 L.Ed.2d 797 (1994), the Court held that \u00a7 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607, does not authorize the award to a private litigant of attorney\u2019s fees associated with bringing a cost recovery action. Yet \u00a7 107 provides rather expansively that a private litigant may recover \u201cany ... necessary costs of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>sponse\u201d and even defines \u201cresponse\u201d to include \u201cenforcement activities related thereto.\u201d The Court, noting its \u201cadherence to a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority,\u201d and observing that the Congress had expressly provided for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in certain amendments to the CERCLA, at 818-19, held that \u00a7 107 does not provide for the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwith the clarity required by <em>Alyeska.\u201d Cf. Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 262, 95 S.Ct. at 1624 (that Congress expressly provides for award of attorney\u2019s fees in some statutes is evidence that it did not intend to provide for attarney\u2019s fees in other statutes). In <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984), the Supreme Court again indicated the importance to be attached to the absence of explicit authority for fee shifting in a particular statute (or its legislative history). In that case a student brought a successful claim under the Education for the Handicapped Act, which does not provide for fee shifting, and also under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and a provision of the Rehabilitation Act, both of which do provide for fee shifting. Disallowing the student\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, the Court reasoned that where the EHA is available to a child asserting a right to public education, that statute provides his sole remedy; to allow him to proceed under provisions that allow for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees would undercut the decision by the Congress not to provide for fee shifting in the EHA. <em>Id. </em>at 1012-13, 1020-21, 104 S.Ct. at 3468-69, 3472-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Moreover, the mechanics of an action to enforce the NLRA suggest that the requirement that the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees be express applies <em>a fortiori </em>to this statute. The reason is simply this: the charging party\u2019s participation in the litigation is strictly voluntary. The union, employee, or employer filing a charge with the Board need not play any role in the proceedings beyond serving the respondent with a copy of the charge. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 101.2, 101.4. Although the charging party may, if the General Counsel issues a complaint, participate in the hearing, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.10, nothing in the Act or in the Board\u2019s regulations requires it to do so. If the General Counsel calls the charging party as a witness, as he called certain union officials in this case, then the General Counsel must pay the witness a fee for his time. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.32. In short, a charging party need not incur any litigation expense. Of course, the charging party may (and often does) intervene in the proceedings before the Board, but it does so as a volunteer, not a party haled into litigation willynilly. We think it would be passing strange for the court to hold that, although a statute authorizing an individual to bring a court case at his own expense will not be read to authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees absent clear Congressional intent, a statute that provides a federal agency to prosecute a case on behalf of a charging party will be read to authorize the agency to award that party\u2014 should it choose to intervene\u2014its attorney\u2019s fees based solely upon the agency\u2019s general remedial authority \u201cto take such affirmative action as will effectuate the policies\u201d of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In sum, since our decision in <em>Food Store Employees </em>the Supreme Court has emphasized in several contexts that a federal court is to apply the American Rule unless the Congress has explicitly said otherwise. Nothing in the Court\u2019s decisions suggests that the standard set for the courts does not apply equally to a statute giving a federal agency rather than an individual the right to institute proceedings. We did not apply such an exacting standard in <em>Food Store Employees; </em>in the light of <em>Alyeska </em>and <em>Summit Valley, </em>however, we must do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">2. The search for \u201cclear support\u201d in \u00a7 10(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Looking at the issue afresh, then, we find no support for the Board\u2019s position in the terms of the NLRA, in its legislative history, or in Supreme Court precedent interpreting the extent of the Board\u2019s remedial discretion. Section 10(c) of the NLRA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-10\">If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall be of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of [the Act],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In its opinion the Board acknowledges that this section, like the statutory provision at issue in <em>Summit Valley, </em>\u201cdoes not expressly provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d 318 N.L.R.B. at 863. Nevertheless, the Board argues that we should defer to its interpretation of its authority under \u00a7 10(c) of the Act. We can defer only so far as \u201cthat interpretation is rational and consistent with the statute.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Food &amp; Commercial Workers, </em>484 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 413, 421, 98 L.Ed.2d 429 (1987). It is not rational to interpret congressional silence in \u00a7 10(c) as implicitly sanctioning fee shifting when the Supreme Court has expressly stated that fee shifting is allowed only when a statute provides \u201cclear support\u201d for such authority. According to the Board, however, because the NLRA \u201crefrains from particularizing the scope of the Board\u2019s remedial powers,\u201d and because it \u201ccontemplates the exercise of broad discretion by the Board in fashioning a range of remedies suitable to remedy various unfair labor practices,\u201d the award of attorney\u2019s fees is not inconsistent with the statute. 318 N.L.R.B. at 863. The absence of a prohibition is not, however, equivalent to an authorization, much less \u201cclear support\u201d therefor. As the Supreme Court put the matter in <em>Runyon, </em>to determine that the Congress \u201cintended to set aside this longstanding American rule of law\u201d there must be more in the statute than \u201cgeneralized commands\u201d or a \u201cbroad [remedial] commission.\u201d 427 U.S. at 185-86, 96 S.Ct. at 2602.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The Board also relied upon the legislative history of the NLRA, but it succeeded only in showing that it does not have Clio on its side in this matter. The Senate Labor Committee considered two versions of what is now \u00a7 10(e). One version, S. 2926, provided a list of rather specific remedies. The second version, S.1958, was more general. The Committee pointed out that \u201cto substitute express language such as reinstatement, back pay, etc., necessarily results in narrowing the definition of restitution, which may include many other forms of action.\u201d Comparison of S. 2926 (73rd Congress) and S.1958 (74th Congress), Senate Comm. Print, <em>reprinted in </em>1 Leg. Hist. 1360 (1935). Incredibly, however, immediately after acknowledging the Committee\u2019s point, the Board asserted that, \u201c[ajlthough the final bill in fact substituted \u2018reinstatement of employees with or without backpay\u2019 for \u2018restitution,\u2019 the change was made without any suggestion of an intention to narrow the discretion of the Board in remedial matters.\u201d 318 N.L.R.B. at 863. The Congress\u2019s substitution of the phrase \u201creinstatement of employees with or without backpay\u201d in place of \u201crestitution\u201d is hardly evidence (let alone clear support for the proposition) that the Congress intended to authorize the Board to order a respondent to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the charging party and the Board. <em>Cf. International Union of Electrical, R. &amp; M. Wkrs., </em>502 F.2d at 353 n. * (individual opinion of J. MacKinnon) (\u201cin all the 39 years of legislative history surrounding section 10(c), none of it gives any support for the interpretation that Congress intended to allow the Board to award attorney fees and litigation expenses to prevailing parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Because neither the plain text nor the legislative history of \u00a7 10(c) provides \u201cclear support\u201d for the authority of the Board to order the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, the Board can argue only that the phrase \u201csuch affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies of the Act\u201d has been interpreted so broadly by the Supreme Court that it encompasses that remedy in this case. Of course, the Board\u2019s remedial power is not limited to the single example of affirmative action instanced in the statute, namely, reinstatement with or without backpay. Still, the other remedies that the Supreme Court has approved are closely related to the expertise of the Board and to its statutory mission. For example, in <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the Court held that the Board may issue a bargaining order when (1) a union has shown by informal means that it enjoys majority support among the employees in a unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>and (2) the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices have so tainted the atmosphere with coercion of the employees as to make it unlikely that the Board could hold a fair election. In contrast, by imposing an award of attorney\u2019s fees the Board moves away from its expertise in labor relations and exercises a discretionary power entrusted to a court only when specifically legislated.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The Board\u2019s primary justification for ordering the Frontier to pay the litigation costs of its adversaries\u2014namely, its presentation of a frivolous defense to the unfair labor practice charges\u2014is especially problematic for the simple reason that it is not itself an unfair labor practice to present a frivolous defense to an unfair labor practice charge. A <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order responds directly to an unfair labor practice, the refusal to bargain. An award of attorney\u2019s fees against a party that has presented a frivolous defense effectuates the policies of the Act only indirectly. Relatedly, the Board strays from its area of expertise when it determines whether fee shifting is appropriate in a particular case. In determining whether to order an employer to bargain with a union, the Board addresses delicate issues of labor-management relations clearly within its delegated purview and its field of expertise. By contrast, in considering whether to order an employer to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of a union (or vice versa), the Board focuses not upon the dynamics of the workplace but upon the employer\u2019s (or union\u2019s) conduct in litigation. <em>See Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Department of Defense, 87 </em>F.3d 1356, 1361 (D.C.Cir.1996) (court does not defer to agency decision in matter outside of agency\u2019s expertise).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Not only is there a problem with the nature of the conduct at which the Board\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is aimed, there is also a problem with the limited purpose for which the Board may award any remedy. The Board gives two rationales explaining why its order effectuates the policies of the Act, but neither of these, nor their combination, is sufficient to overcome the American Rule. First, the Board states that the company\u2019s \u201creliance on frivolous defenses in its litigation of these allegations ... depleted the Charging Parties\u2019 resources.\u201d 318 N.L.R.B. at 857. To the extent that the Board is relying upon the idea that a party is not made whole unless it recovers its attorney\u2019s fees, however, that is but a criticism of the American Rule\u2014indeed, a criticism that the Supreme Court has heard and rejected. <em>See Summit Valley, </em>456 U.S. at 724-25, 102 S.Ct. at 2116-17 (\u201cEven assuming that attorney\u2019s fees are necessary to achieve full compensation, this justification alone is not sufficient to create an exception to the American Rule in the absence of express congressional authority\u201d), <em>citing F.D. Rich, </em>417 U.S. at 128-29, 94 S.Ct. at 2164-65 (\u201cThis argument merely restates one of the oft-repeated criticisms of the American Rule\u201d). The Board\u2019s \u201cmake whole\u201d rationale, therefore, does not show that fee shifting effectuates the policies of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The Board\u2019s other reason for ordering a respondent to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the charging party, to discourage frivolous litigation, is essentially punitive. 318 N.L.R.B. at 860. As counsel put the matter at oral argument, the Board requires the power to tax a party with attorney\u2019s fees in order \u201cto ensure that its processes are not abused by parties asserting frivolous defenses\u201d and \u201cto keep its docket clear.\u201d To the extent that the power to shift fees is justified as a deterrent to frivolous litigation, however, the power is punitive and therefore beyond the Board\u2019s delegated authority. <em>See Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 5, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 1946, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973) (underlying rationale of fee shifting in cases of bad faith is punitive).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The Supreme Court has consistently invalidated Board orders that are not directly related to the effectuation of the purposes of the Act or are punitive. In <em>Consolidated Edison v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938), the Court held that the Board lacks authority to invalidate a contract between a labor organization and a company because the \u201cauthority to order affirmative action does not go so far as to confer a punitive jurisdiction\u201d upon the Board. Thus, the Board may not \u201cinflict upon the employer any penalty it may choose because he is engaged in unfair labor practices, even though the Board be of the opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>policies of the Act might be effectuated by such an order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235-36, 59 S.Ct. at 219. Likewise, in <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>311 U.S. 7, 61 S.Ct. 77, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940), the Court invalidated a Board order requiring an employer to deduct from back pay the amount of money that employees had earned on work relief projects prior to their reinstatement and to pay the same amount to the government agencies that had employed the workers. The Court rejected the Board\u2019s claim to authority because neither possible rationale for the order\u2014to further the programs to which the money would go or to punish the employer\u2014is consistent with \u201cthe spirit and remedial purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 61 S.Ct. at 79. Finally, in <em>Carpenters Local 60 v. NLRB, </em>365 U.S. 651, 81 S.Ct. 875, 6 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961), the Court struck down as punitive a Board order that a union reimburse its members for all dues and fees that it had collected under an unlawful closed-shop agreement. As Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in that case makes clear, in order to uphold a remedy, the Board \u201cmust show more than that the remedy will tend to deter unfair labor practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 81 S.Ct. at 879. <em>See also Grondorf, Field, Black &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>107 F.3d 882, 888 (D.C.Cir. 1997) (Board order must be remanded if it may be punitive rather than remedial). Whether the Frontier\u2019s misconduct lay in its presentation of a frivolous defense to an unfair labor practice charge or in its misconduct during bargaining, or both, a fair reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions suggests to us that the order that the employer pay its adversaries\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees is punitive and is not directly related to effectuating the policies of the Act.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The American Rule is \u201cdeeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy.\u201d <em>Alyeska, </em>421 U.S. at 271, 95 S.Ct. at 1628. Therefore, we may not lightly allow an administrative agency, any more than a court, to depart from the Rule; rather, there must be \u201cclear support\u201d for the agency\u2019s claim that the Congress authorized the agency to order one party to pay the fees of another party or of the agency itself. Finding no such support in the terms or the legislative history of \u00a7 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, we conclude that the Board lacks that authority. We note with interest, moreover, that notwithstanding the protestations of our dissenting colleague, neither she nor the Board can cite a single case, aside from our own <em>pre-Alyeska </em>precedent, in which a court has upheld any agency order shifting responsibility for attorney\u2019s fees in an agency proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Accordingly, we hold that although the Board may order a respondent to pay the negotiation costs incurred by a charging party if it properly finds, as it did here, that the respondent engaged in aggravated misconduct, the Board may not order a respondent to pay the litigation expenses incurred by the charging party or by the General Counsel in the subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding. Consistent with the foregoing opinion, the Company\u2019s petition and the Board\u2019s cross-application are each granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\"> In its opinion the Board states that the award of litigation costs is \"consistent not only with the American Rule, but alternatively with the bad-faith exception to that rule.\u201d 318 N.L.R.B. at 864. Although our dissenting colleague reads this statement as indicating that the Board was relying in the alternative upon its inherent power to control its own proceedings, in its brief the Board relies upon \u00a7 10(c) alone for authority to make Unbelievable pay the Unions' attorney's fees. When questioned at oral argument, counsel for the Board explained that the Board's opinion referred to the bad-faith exception to the American Rule not in order to posit an alternative rationale should it lack the power under \u00a7 10(c) to assess attorney\u2019s fees but only in order to point out that the Board\u2019s approach is consistent with the practice of the federal courts. Accordingly, we have no occasion in this case to address whether the Board might have such inherent power notwithstanding its lack of punitive authority (on which, see pp. 805-806).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\"> The Supreme Court reversed <em>Food Store Employees </em>on a different ground, 417 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 2074, 40 L.Ed.2d 612 (1974), expressly declining to \u201caddress the question whether the Board's broad powers under \u00a7 10(c) ... to fashion remedies include power to order reimbursement of litigation expenses and excess organizational costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 2079 n. 9.

Critically, the Court explicitly left intact the equitable power to award attorney\u2019s fees under pre-existing common-law exceptions to the American Rule against fee-shifting. <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 95 S.Ct. at 1621-22; <em>see, e.g., Central Railroad &amp; Banking Co. v.

The remedial scheme contemplated by Congress in enacting section 10(c) of the NLRA, however, is dramatically different than section 303 of the LMRA. Section 303 contains an explicit damages provision that entitles an employer who has been injured \u201cin his business or property\u201d by a union\u2019s unfair labor practice to \u201crecover the damages by him sustained and the cost of the suit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187. Starting with the premise that, under the American Rule, the ordinary meaning of \u201cdamages\u201d does not include attorney\u2019s fees, the Supreme Court examined the legislative history of section 303(b) and found a Senate floor exchange persuasively indicating that the term \u201cdamages\u201d was not intended to include attorney\u2019s fees in this section either. As the Sixth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have recognized, <em>Summit Valley </em>\u201crested ... on factors peculiar to section 303(b) [of the LMRA], which ... expressly states its remedies and was not intended to encompass attorney\u2019s fees, according to the \u2018persuasive evidence\u2019 of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Local Union No. 66, Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO, </em>958 F.2d 1429, 1440 n. 9 (7th Cir.1992); <em>see Wilson v.

United Can Co., </em>812 F.2d 443, 454-55 (9th Cir.1987). In short, none of the intervening cases relate to the Board\u2019s authority under the NLRA to award litigation expenses as a remedy and as a deterrent to prevent bad faith abuse of its processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">In a case like this one, where an employer has flagrantly refused to collectively bargain in good faith, a union is compelled to vindicate its statutory rights in proceedings before the Board. As the Board itself has recognized, \u201c[a]n aggrieved party\u2019s outlay of legal ... expenses is likely to be a prime ingredient in or motivation behind, a refusal to bargain for which there is no arguably meritorious justification. Logic suggests little reason for such a refusal other than the belief that to do so may create an economic imbalance beneficial to the party undertaking the refusal.\u201d <em>Wellman Industries, Inc., </em>248 N.L.R.B. 325, 326 (1980); <em>see Seattle-First National Bank v. NLRB, </em>638 F.2d 1221, 1227 n. 9 (9th Cir.1981) (surface bargaining by employer involves use of economic power to \u201ctalk a union to death\u201d). Wasting the union\u2019s time and depleting its resources through presentation of a frivolous defense at a Board proceeding is a tactical maneuver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>designed to deepen the economic wound already caused by the surface bargaining. <em>Koval Press, Inc., </em>241 N.L.R.B. 1261, 1263 (1979) (\u201cThe only logical inference to be drawn from [presentation of a frivolous defense is that Respondent] seeks to delay the proper effectuation of the policies of the Act by its unlawful refusal to bargain.... \u201d). It is merely continuation of the same bad faith recalcitrance employed at the bargaining table in a new forum. A diehard respondent can go up the chain of decisionmaking causing greater economic burdens to the union at each stage by employing dilatory tactics during the administrative adjudication by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), the Board\u2019s review of the ALJ\u2019s recommendation, and, finally, appeal of the Board\u2019s order to a United States Court of Appeals. The whole process can take years. In addition to exhausting the charging party\u2019s legal war chest, the delay often leads to employee frustration and eventual loss of employee support due to attrition or loss of confidence in a seemingly ineffectual union, and it often permits continued employer anti-union activity. <em>Cf. Ex-Cell-O Corp., </em>185 N.L.R.B. 107, 108 (1970). Ironically, by the purposeful presentation of an entirely frivolous defense, an employer turns the Board\u2019s processes into an instrument of its own unlawful conduct. Even though the union wins the usual remedy for surface bargaining\u2014an order to bargain in good faith\u2014the impact of an employer\u2019s persistent and pervasive bad faith over years of administrative proceedings may effectively dissipate the impact of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The majority readily admits the force of the evidence that led the Board to conclude that Unbelievable, Inc., \u201cengaged in egregious and deliberate surface bargaining\u201d in order to diminish the charging parties\u2019 economic strength and relied on \u201cfrivolous defenses in its litigation\u201d in order to \u201cfurther deplete[] the Charging Parties\u2019 resources and needlessly waste[ ] the resources of [the NLRB].\u201d The Board characterized Unbelievable\u2019s surface bargaining as \u201cflagrant, aggravated, persistent, and pervasive\u201d misconduct, and described the deliberate adherence to frivolous defenses as \u201cegregious bad faith.\u201d While relying on section 10(c) of the NLRA as its principal authority for awarding attorney\u2019s fees against Unbelievable, Inc., the Board expressly noted such a remedy paralleled the bad faith exception to the American Rule as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a remedy is undoubtedly \u201crational and consistent with the statute.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Food &amp; Comm\u2019l Workers Union, </em>484 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 413, 421, 98 L.Ed.2d 429 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Section 10(c) directs the Board, upon finding that a respondent has engaged in unfair labor practices, to issue an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices and authorizes it further \u201cto take such affirmative action including the reinstatement of employees, with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).

In this regard, reimbursement for expenses of litigation is no different from compensation for the costs of bad faith negotiation, which the majority approves in this very case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Using baseless, sham litigation to retaliate against or interfere in an employee\u2019s exercise of protected rights under the NLRA has been condemned by the Supreme Court as a violation of the NLRA and the Court has approved the Board\u2019s using its section 10(e) authority to order \u201cthe employer to reimburse the employees whom he had wrongful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>ly sued for their attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses ... [and] order any other proper relief that would effectuate the policies of the [NLRA].\u201d <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>461 U.S. 731, 747, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 2172, 76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983). The Court further noted in <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s </em>that the Board needed such power despite the availability of state-court malicious prosecution remedies because the Federal Government has its own strong interest in enforcing the federal labor laws. <em>Id. </em>at 747 n. 14, 103 S.Ct. at 2172 n. 14. As the Seventh Circuit recently recognized in a case enforcing the Board\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees for a frivolous state court suit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">Whether a union is subject to frivolous litigation as a part of the underlying unfair labor practice or during the adjudication of another unfair labor practice allegation, there can be a similar impact on the rights of the workers under the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">iji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">A baseless and retaliatory lawsuit against a union can be a powerful weapon in the hands of an unprincipled employer. Such an employer need not win its lawsuit against a union to thwart the Union\u2019s attempts to organize workers; rather, the employer need only impose substantial costs and delays upon the Union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-11\"><em>Geske &amp; Sons, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>103 F.3d 1366, 1378-79 (7th Cir.1997). The tactic is the same whether the litigant is before the Board or in court; only the forum differs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It would be an anomalous result indeed if bad faith negotiation can be remedied by a grant of attorney\u2019s fees, and bad faith court proceedings as well, but bad faith Board proceedings merit no comparable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Fee-shifting power has been exercised by the Board only in cases that fall within the conf\u00ednes of the bad faith exception to the American Rule. In the few cases in which the Board has exercised it, the offending parties have acted outrageously in flaunting the Act\u2019s directives and abusing the Board\u2019s processes. <em>See, e.g., Texas Super Foods, </em>303 N.L.R.B. 209 (1991); <em>Autoprod, Inc., </em>265 N.L.R.B. No. 42 (1982); <em>Wellman Industries, Inc., </em>248 N.L.R.B. 325; <em>Koval Press, Inc., </em>241 N.L.R.B. 1261. Paradoxically, the majority uses the Board\u2019s reimbursement <em>of </em>expenses for its own proceedings to argue that it has exercised its power for punitive rather than remedial reasons, a power not included within its authority to effectuate the policies of the NLRA. <em>See Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>311 U.S. 7, 61 S.Ct. 77, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940). This sounds like doublespeak to me. When Congress determined that an aggrieved party must present unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>labor practices to the NLRB rather than to a court, surely it did not intend for the NLRB to become a dupe, exploitable at will by employers to intensify the harm stemming from their original violation of the labor laws. Inherent in any agency\u2019s authority to carry out its designated functions is the power to ensure the fairness, efficiency and integrity of its processes and the appropriateness of the conduct of the parties appearing before it. <em>See Checkosky v. SEC, </em>23 F.3d 452, 455 (D.C.Cir.1994) (Silberman, J., concurring); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. SEC, </em>609 F.2d 570 (2d Cir.1979). Moreover, decisions of the NLRB are reviewed and enforced by the courts and conduct that dishonors and undermines the Board\u2019s processes dishonors and undermines the review process as well. <em>Cf. ABF Freight System, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>510 U.S. at 326, 114 S.Ct. at 841 (Scalia, J., concurring). An agency\u2019s power to protect the integrity of its processes has not been held to be limited to the sanctions specifically provided by the statute that defines the agency\u2019s power to remedy violations of law. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. C.H. Sprague &amp; Son Co., </em>428 F.2d 938 (1st Cir.1970); <em>NLRB v. American Art Indus., Inc., </em>415 F.2d 1223 (5th Cir.1969); <em>Uniroyal v. Marshall, </em>482 F.Supp. 364 (D.D.C.1979); <em>see also Checkosky, </em>23 F.3d at 455-56 (agencies have inherent power to discipline officials appearing before the agency because it protects the administrative process and thus is reasonably related to the purposes of the laws that the agency is entrusted to enforce) (Silberman, J., concurring); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co., </em>609 F.2d at 582 (agency disciplinary rules authorized despite the absence of express statutory authority in order to protect the integrity of agency\u2019s own processes); <em>Gonzalez v. Freeman, </em>334 F.2d 570, 576-77 (D.C.Cir.1964) (Commodity Credit Corporation may debar irresponsible, defaulting or dishonest contractor despite the absence of explicit congressional authorization because such action is a necessary means for accomplishing congressional purpose of developing foreign markets for agricultural commodities). The imposition of attorney\u2019s fees on a party who grossly abuses the Board\u2019s processes is a defensive measure, equally justifiable as these other examples when invoked to protect the agency\u2019s integrity and to deter future abuses and distortion of its resources from more worthy cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In sum, I can find no convincing reason why the Board should not be allowed to construe its remedial mandate in section 10(c) so as to include an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a proceeding where a party has presented a frivolous defense to a serious unfair labor practice charge and in so doing has depleted the union\u2019s treasury, time and effectiveness, and misused the Board\u2019s process. We affirmed the Board\u2019s authority to do just that 24 years ago and I can find nothing in intervening Supreme Court cases that conflicts with such an interpretation by the Board of its authority. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion holding to the contrary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">. The Board indicated that litigation costs and expenses include: reasonable counsel fees, salaries, witness fees, transcript and record costs, printing costs, travel expenses and per diem, and other reasonable costs and expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">. The majority\u2019s observation that, subsequent to <em>Alyeska, </em>Congress enacted a number of fee-shil'ting provisions in civil rights statutes. Majority opinion (\"Maj. op.\u201d) at 802-803, proves only that Congress wished to actively encourage private attorneys general to enforce those statutes. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>S.Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 2, 6 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5909, 5910, 5913. No one has suggested that Congress thought <em>Alyeska </em>had eliminated or affected in any way traditional exceptions to the American Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">To bolster its contention that attorney's fees may never be awarded under the NLRA in the absence of express statutory authorization, the majority cites several cases in which the Supreme Court found no authorization for fee-shifting. Each one states only the obvious: the American Rule restricts fee-shifting unless there is express statutory authority or an exception applies. As in <em>Alyeska, </em>the <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), Court reasoned that, \"but for a few well-recognized exceptions not present in these cases,\u201d there must be explicit authorization for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees as a cost of litigation. <em>Runyon, </em>427 U.S. at 185, 96 S.Ct. at 2602. In <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974), <em>see </em>Maj. op. at 802-803, the lower court construed the Miller Act to permit an attorney\u2019s fees award when the \"public policy\u201d of the state in which the lawsuit was brought \"allows for the award of fees in similar contexts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 94 S.Ct. at 2163. The Supreme Court reversed on the ground that there was no evidence of congressional intent to incorporate state law into Miller Act litigation and permitting such incorporation would upset the reasonable expectations of litigants and lead to disparate remedies for different litigants. Finally, the Court explained that although the Miller Act term \"sums justly due\u201d does not encompass attorney's fees, the American Rule permits \"several exceptions to the general principle that each party should bear the costs of its own legal representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 94 S.Ct. at 2165. Thus, I disagree with the majority's suggestion that cases such as <em>Runyon </em>and <em>F.D. Rich </em>rule out fee-shifting by the Board under the NLRA in the case of bad faith defenses by charged companies. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 801-803.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b853-5\">. The majority insists that we cannot consider the relevance of the bad faith exception to the American Rule because counsel for the Board at oral argument stated that the Board relied solely on section 10(c) of the NLRA. Whatever the scope or intent of Board counsel's admission, the post hoc rationalization rule works to prevent counsel from adding to or subtracting from an agency\u2019s stated rationale. <em>Ashland Oil, Inc. v. FTC, </em>548 F.2d 977 (D.C.Cir.1976). The Board\u2019s opinion clearly states that it \"find[s] ample support for [its] conclusion that [its] Order is fully consistent not only with the American Rule, but alternatively with the bad faith exception to that rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Ironically, the majority and I may have no real dispute over the Board\u2019s ultimate authority to render its ruling in this case. The majority says that it does not rule out the possibility that the Board has the authority to sanction a party that has acted in bad faith. Maj. op. at 800 n*. The Board, however, has only asserted its authority to assess fees in a frivolous defense case and has never attempted to broaden its authority beyond such circumstances. Thus, the majority\u2019s reversal means that, although the Board may well be justified in assessing attorney\u2019s fees in this case and, although it specifically cited the bad faith exception to the American Rule as consistent with its ruling, because it relied on its broad authority under section 10(c) to effectuate the purposes of the NLRA as the main support for its action, its action must be nullified. This makes no sense to me.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b854-5\">. The majority's suggestion that the substitution of \u201creinstatement of employees, with or without back pay\u201d as an example of an affirmative action in the final bill for the term \"restitution,\u201d which had appeared in earlier versions, evinced an intent to narrow the discretion of the Board in remedial matters, Maj. op. at 804\u2014805, is wrong. Both \"reinstatement\u201d and \"restitution\u201d were used only as illustrations of \"affirmative actions,\u201d in no way intended to confine Board power. Actually, restitution restores to a party property or money of which the party has been deprived, <em>see </em>Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 1107 (3d ed.1969), and is thus a backward-looking remedy. Reinstatement with back pay returns a person to a formerly held position and is thus both backward and forward looking. So, if it signifies anything, the substitution of \"reinstatement\" signified a broadening of section 10(c) power in the illustration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b854-9\">. The majority contends that an award of litigation expenses as a remedy for bad faith conduct is not closely related to the Board's area of expertise or its statutory mission, but where the award of attorney's fees is targeted at a respondent\u2019s attempt to misuse the Board's processes in order to thwart a charging party\u2019s ability to bargain, the Board's expertise is very relevant. The impact that bad faith conduct has on a charging party is directly in the domain of the Board, which deals daily with the dynamics of employer-union relationships.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\">. Although a charging party is not legally required to litigate its case before the Board, the Board\u2019s rules and regulations assume that the charging party is a fully participating party in the litigation. Enforcement of the NLRA relies solely on the initiation of charges by the charging party. <em>NLRB v. Food and Comm'l Workers Union, </em>484 U.S. at 118, 108 S.Ct. at 418. The term \"party\u201d as used in the Board\u2019s regulations includes \"without limitation, any person filing a charge or petition under the [NLRA]....\" 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.8. Thus, a charging party need not take any action in order to participate fully in Board proceedings. \"Any person desiring to intervene in any proceeding,\u201d on the other hand, must explicitly move for permission to intervene. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 102.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The charging party plays an integral role in the entire NLRA proceedings. The initial obligation to identify and serve an unfair labor practice charge falls upon the charging party. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 102.14. In addition, \u201d[i]f, after the charge has been filed, the regional director [of the NLRB] declines to issue a complaint ... [or withdraws a complaint, the charging party] may obtain a review of such action by filing an appeal with the general counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 102.19. If the Regional Director of the NLRB and the respondent agree to a settlement, the charging party has a right to object to the regional director, the General Counsel and in certain cases the Board. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">Once formal proceedings have begun, a charging party is treated just like any other party. It may take depositions in connection with Board proceedings, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 102.30, and may subpoena witnesses and documents, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 102.31, just like the General Counsel and the respondent. Charging parties have the right to appear at the hearing and to examine and cross examine witnesses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 102.38. It may file briefs and files exceptions to the administrative law judge's findings. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 102.42, 102.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">These rules demonstrate that a charging party is expected to be a principal participant in the litigation of the charged unfair labor practice. The prosecution of an unfair labor practice is designed primarily to remedy the victim. Victims of unfair labor practices have no other remedy but to invoke the Board\u2019s authority. They cannot turn initially to civil courts. They must rely on and actually assist the Board\u2019s counsel in making their case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
