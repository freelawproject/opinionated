No. 104-134, \u00a7 101(d), 110 Stat. 1321-219 (enacted 1996). New Thoughts and Travelers filed a notice of appeal to this court pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">On March 10, 1992, Chilton injured his lower back when the crane he was operating \u201ctoppled over.\u201d The only dispute between the parties below and in this court is the computation of Chilton\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The average weekly wage is determined by dividing the claimant\u2019s average annual earnings by 52. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(d)(1). The parties and the ALJ agree that the computation of Chilton\u2019s average annual earnings is governed by Section 10(c) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-7\">... average annual earnings shall be such sum as, having regard to the previous earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury, and of other employees of the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring locality, or other employment of such employee, including the reasonable value of the services of the employee if engaged in self-employment, shall reasonably represent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c). Section 910(c) applies when the claimant\u2019s work is seasonal or intermittent. <em>Empire United Stevedores v. Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d 819, 822 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Gilliam v. Addison Crane Co., </em>21 BRBS 91 (1987)(citing <em>Lozupone v. Stephano Luzopone &amp; Sons, </em>12 BRBS 148, 156-57 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">The ALJ found that Chilton\u2019s average weekly wage was $467.67, which yields a weekly benefit of $311.78. The ALJ based Chilton\u2019s average weekly wage on an annual earning capacity of $24,319. Petitioners point out that although Chilton earned $24,-319 in 1988, his earnings were considerably less in the three years immediately preceding the accident. He earned $17,960 in 1991, $14,621 in 1990, and $13,735 in 1989. Chilton\u2019s testimony reflected that his work in construction industry for the previous three years had been intermittent because work was not available. He testified that he worked whenever work was available, but in recent years had been laid off frequently, even during the course of finishing a project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">The ALJ evidently chose the 1988 figure because he concluded that Chilton\u2019s earnings in the more recent years reflected a depression in the industry and that Chilton had \u201cshown that work in the industry was again available for him after the accident.\u201d Petitioners contend that the record contains no evidence to support these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">We review a decision of the Benefits Review Board using the same standard the Board applies to review a decision of the ALJ: whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. <em>SGS Control Servs. v. Director, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>86 F.3d 438, 440 (5th Cir.l996)(citing <em>Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d at 822). \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that provides \u2018a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred ... more than a scintilla ... more than create a suspicion ... such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Avondale Indus., Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>977 F.2d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Diamond M. Drilling Co. v. Marshall, </em>577 F.2d 1003, 1006 (5th Cir.1978) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Columbian Enameling and Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 299-300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 504-05, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939))). The substantial evidence standard is less demanding than that of preponderance of the evidence, and the ALJ\u2019s decision need not constitute the sole inference that can be drawn from the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">Moreover, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, nor reweigh or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>reappraise the evidence, but may only determine whether evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>SGS Control </em>Servs., 86 F.3d at 440 (citations omitted). All doubts are to be construed in favor of the employee in accordance with the remedial purposes of the Act. <em>Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d at 822 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">After careful review of the record, we agree with petitioners that the record contains no evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that $467.67 represented a reasonable average weekly wage. Contrary to the ALJ\u2019s decision, the record is devoid of evidence that Chilton at the time of his injury, unlike in the immediately preceding three years, would have had the opportunity to be employed year-round. Although Chilton testified that he was employed in building a wharf at the time of his injury, there is no indication that the existence of this project would have produced steady employment for Chilton.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, in 1991 he worked on a single project that continued for the entire year, the construction of an interstate highway bypass, but was laid off numerous times in the course of that year. Similarly, his testimony that in 1994 \u201call his friends are working\u201d does not support the inference that work was available to him year-round in 1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, no substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Chilton\u2019s annual earnings for 1988, when he was employed the entire year, reflect his average annual earnings at the time of his injury in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">Unlike Sections 910(a) and 910(b) of the Act, Section 910(c) allows the ALJ to consider more than just the year immediately preceding the injury. <em>Compare </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(a), (b) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 910(c). Nevertheless, the ALJ\u2019s task is to determine the \u201caverage weekly wage of the injured employee <em>at the time of the injury </em>.... \u201d Id \u00a7 910 (emphasis added). If the ALJ looks beyond the 52 weeks immediately preceding the injury, \u201che must take into account the earnings of all the years within that period.\u201d <em>Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d at 823 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Todd Shipyards, </em>13 BRBS 593, 596 (1981)) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">In this case, there is no evidence that would allow the ALJ to skip over the claimant\u2019s earning history for the three years immediately preceding the accident and select his last full year of employment as his average annual earnings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is not more than a scintilla of evidence in the record that there was a change in circumstances that made the claimant\u2019s average annual earnings at the time of injury greater than his actual earnings in the immediately preceding years, <em>see, e.g., Tri-State Terminals, Inc. v. Jesse, </em>596 F.2d 752, 754 (7th Cir.1979), or that claimant had recently changed his field of work. <em>See, e.g., Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">For these reasons, we REVERSE and REMAND to the ALJ for a redetermination of Chilton\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">. Chilton said that he expected to work at the New Thoughts job seven days a week because a \"business agent\" told him that it would be a \"time job\" (meaning that \"there was going to be a lot of time on the job\u201d). This, however, says nothing about the duration of this or similar jobs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">. The parties' joint exhibits included a transcript of Chilton\u2019s deposition, which was taken less than a month before the hearing. It is not clear whether the ALJ considered this deposition in reaching his conclusion: the ALJ indicated at the hearing that he would not consider the deposition, but his Decision and Order cites the deposition (Joint Exhibit 30) as part of the record. The record does not contain substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings without Chilton\u2019s deposition testimony. Even the scintilla of evidence that the record does contain without his deposition testimony is undermined if that testimony is considered. Contrary to his hearing testimony that \u201call his friends were working,\u201d he testified in his deposition that some of his friends were working, some were not, and that he \"would have to be guessing\u201d regarding the availability of work. He also testified in his deposition that work opportunities in the area were \"just steady getting worse\u201d after 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1075-14\">. As the Seventh Circuit explained in <em>Tri-State Terminals v. Jesse, </em>\"one of the primary reasons for the differentiation in \u00a7 10(c) is that it would be unfair to the employer to calculate an intermittent employee's wage under \u00a7\u00a7 10(a) or (b), since to do so would treat the claimant as a full-time worker and thereby exaggerate his loss.\u201d 596 F.2d at 756 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
