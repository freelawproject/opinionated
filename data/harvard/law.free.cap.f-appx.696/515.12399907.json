Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-23\">In 2002, James Morris pleaded guilty in the Northern District of Mississippi to cocaine-and firearm-related offenses, for which the court sentenced Morris to 230 months in prison. Morris asked the court to reduce his sentence, based on a subsequent change made by the United States Sentencing Commission to its crack-cocaine guidelines. The court, in a decision affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, denied Morris\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-24\">Morris, proceeding <em>pro se </em>in the district court below, subsequently sought declaratory relief and damages against the Sentencing Commission, two federal prosecutors, and then-Attorney General Eric Holder. Our district court held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Morris\u2019s claims against the Commission, because Congress had not waived the Commission\u2019s sovereign immunity. On the merits, the district court dismissed Morris\u2019s claim against then-Attorney General Holder, given that Morris\u2019s complaint failed to allege Holder\u2019s direct participation in any purported constitutional violations. The court also dismissed Morris\u2019s claim against the federal prosecutors, finding them protected by absolute immunity. Morris appeals only the district court\u2019s dismissal of his declaratory-judgment claim against the Commission and his claims against Holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-25\">We review de novo district court dismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>Piersall v. Winter, </em>435 F.3d 319, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and for failure to state a claim, <em>Payne v. Salazar, </em>619 F.3d 56, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Applying that standard, we agree with the district court that sovereign immunity bars Morris\u2019s claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the Sentencing Commission. Generally, the United States cannot be sued without giving its consent, <em>see United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983), and any waiver of sovereign immunity \u201cmust be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.\u201d <em>Lane v. Pena, </em>518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 (1996). Morris argues that the Administrative Procedure Act provides an express waiver of sovereign immunity for agencies, and we agree. However, the Sentencing Commission is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the APA, <em>Wash. Legal Found. v. U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, </em>17 F.3d 1446, 1450 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and the APA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Morris nonetheless contends that we must have jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions against the Commission because we previously assumed jurisdiction over the Commission in a similar case. <em>See Davis v. U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, </em>716 F.3d 660 (D.C. Cir. 2013). But neither the parties nor the court in that case raised or addressed the jurisdictional issue\u2014namely, whether sovereign immunity applied. Because we are \u201c\u2018not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned/ \u201d <em>Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., </em>473 F.3d 345, 352 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 33, 38, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952)), <em>Davis </em>does not control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Finally, we agree that the district court properly dismissed any claims Morris may have attempted to bring against then-Attorney General Holder, whether in his personal or official capacity. Put simply, Holder and the Department of Justice played no role whatsoever in the actions Morris alleged injured him, as neither promulgated the sentencing guidelines or applied the guidelines to Morris. Morris\u2019s complaint does not allege otherwise.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-19\">. The court thanks Previn Warren, counsel for court-appointed <em>amicus curiae </em>David W.
