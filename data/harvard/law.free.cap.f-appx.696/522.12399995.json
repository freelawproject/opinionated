Appellee has provided a \u201clegitimate, non-discriminatory reason\u201d for its employment decision, and appellant has not \u201cproduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer\u2019s asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee on the basis of\u2019 a characteristic protected by law. Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see also Burley v. Nat\u2019l Passenger Rail Corp., 801 F.3d 290, 296 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (applying McDonnell Douglas framework to Title VII and D.C. Human Rights Act claims); Brown v. Sessoms, 774 F.3d 1016, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (applying McDonnell Douglas framework to claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981). He also failed to show that the final decision maker reached her determination without \u201cconducting] an independent review of the evidence,\u201d Hampton v. Vilsack, 685 F.3d 1096, 1101 (D.C. Cir. 2012), or that his termination was proximately caused by the discriminatory acts of others, see Hairston v. Vance-Cooks, 773 F.3d 266, 275 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Finally, appellant forfeited arguments mentioned for the first time on appeal. See Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. District of Columbia, 602 F.3d 431, 437 (D.C. Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.
