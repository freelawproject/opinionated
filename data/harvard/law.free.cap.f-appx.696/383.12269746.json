See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\">Malcolm McCray Blackwell, appearing pro se, appeals from an order of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) dismissing his appeal as untimely. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to -28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-27\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b977-28\">On March 18, 2016, Blackwell filed a pro se Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The petition listed Bank of America as having a disputed lien in the amount of $40,479.41 against Blackwell\u2019s primary homestead, which Blackwell listed as having a value of approximately $50,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-29\">On July 7, 2016, the bankruptcy court, having received a report from the trustee indicating that there was no property available for distribution from- the estate over and above that exempted by law, issued an order of discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727. The order noted, in pertinent part, that \u201ca creditor with a lien may enforce a claim against the debtors\u2019 property subject to that lien unless the lien was avoided or eliminated,\u201d and it stated, as an example, that \u201ca creditor may have the right to foreclose a home mortgage.\u201d Bankruptcy Docket No. 31 at 1. On July 22, 2016, the bankruptcy court issued a final decree closing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-30\">On October 5, 2016, Blackwell filed a pro se notice of appeal identifying the bankruptcy court\u2019s July 7, 2016 order of discharge as the subject of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-31\">On February 8, 2017, the BAP issued a show cause order noting that Blackwell\u2019s notice of appeal was filed nearly three months after the date of the order that Blackwell was seeking to appeal, even though Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002(a)(1) requires that an appeal be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>filed within fourteen days from the date of-the order appealed from. The show cause order directed Blackwell to file within fourteen days a memorandum of law providing a legal explanation as to why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">On February 13, 2017, Blackwell responded to the BAP\u2019s show cause order by filing a pro se memorandum of law that, in large part, simply listed various cases, statutes and rules that Blackwell apparently believed were relevant to the issue identified in the BAP\u2019s show cause order. Blackwell\u2019s memorandum did not address the timeliness of his notice of appeal, and instead appeared to assert that, due to his pro se status, the BAP should essentially overlook the requirements of Rule 8002(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">On February 27, 2017, the BAP dismissed the appeal as untimely. In doing so, the BAP emphasized that pro se litigants, such as Blackwell, must abide by the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Blackwell now appeals from the BAP\u2019s order of dismissal. We review de novo the BAP\u2019s rulings on matters of law. In re Bryan, 857 F.3d 1078, 1081 (10th Cir. 2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Although Blackwell has filed a pro se appellate brief, the arguments contained therein are unintelligible and simply do not address the timeliness of the notice of appeal that he filed with the BAP. Because Blackwell is proceeding pro se, however, we have conducted our own independent review of the record and agree with the BAP that Blackwell\u2019s appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002 addresses the time for filing a notice of appeal in a bankruptcy case. Subsection (a)(1) thereof states that \u201ca notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Here, it is undisputed that Blackwell filed his notice of appeal on October 5, 2016, well past the fourteen-day deadline set by Rule 8002(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal challenging the bankruptcy court\u2019s July 7, 2016 order of discharge. Consequently, the BAP correctly dismissed Blackwell\u2019s appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">AFFIRMED. Blackwell\u2019s motions to proceed in forma pauperis and for an emergency stay pending appeal are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fe.d. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
