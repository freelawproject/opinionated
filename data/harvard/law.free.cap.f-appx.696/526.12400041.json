See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b554-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed December 19, 2016, be affirmed. The court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in denying appellant\u2019s recusal motion. See, e.g., United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31, 34 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc). Moreover, the court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s damages claims on immunity grounds. See, e.g., Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); Sindram v. Suda, 986 F.2d 1459, 1460-61 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (per curiam). Finally, appellant has forfeited any challenge to the dismissal of his claim for declaratory relief by failing to address it in his opening brief. See, e.g., Weinstein v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 831 F.3d 470, 484 (D.C. Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
