The panel has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). It is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review of the-decision of the National Labor Relations Board is DENIED and the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Brusco Tug &amp; Barge, Inc., petitions this court for review of the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s decision that it violated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (5). The Board found that Brusco violated the Act by refusing to bargain with the International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots (the union), the certified representative of the mates, engineers, and deckhands working out of Brusco\u2019s Longview/Cathlamet, Washington port. The Board cross-applied for enforcement of its decision and order. We deny the petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Brusco argues that the bargaining unit was incorrectly certified because its mates are supervisors under section 2(11) of the Act who lack the right to bargain collectively, so should have been excluded from the bargaining unit, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11). Brusco argues that its mates qualify as supervisors because they exercise \u201cindependent judgment\u201d in \u201cassign[ing]\u201d and \u201cresponsibly ... directing]\u201d deckhands and engineers. Pet\u2019r Br. 39-48; <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (enumerating twelve supervisory functions, including \u201cassign\u201d and \u201cresponsibly ... direct\u201d). In Brusco\u2019s view, the Board also abused its discretion in denying Brusco\u2019s request to proffer new evidence related to the status of the mates.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">The disposition of Brusco\u2019s certification challenge is dictated by our deferential standard of review, which requires that the court affirm the Board\u2019s findings as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. \u201c[W]ith regard to the determination of supervisory status, given the large measure of informed discretion involved and the Board\u2019s corresponding expertise in this area, the substantial evidence test \u2018takes on special significance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alois Box Co. v. NLRB, </em>216 F.3d 69, 72 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>Oil, Chem. &amp; Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>445 F.2d 237, 241 (D.C. Cir. 1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">The Board concluded, with substantial evidentiary support in the record, that Brusco\u2019s port captain assigns deckhands to particular ships and the mates make only obvious or self-evident work assignments that do not require independent judgment. <em>Brusco Tug &amp; Barge, Inc., </em>19-RC-013872, at 5-7 (Dec. 14, 2012) (Decision and Order). Brusco\u2019s boats are often staffed with only one deckhand and one engineer, in which case the mate has no option to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>choose between employees to perform significant tasks. <em>See Oakwood Healthcare, </em>348 N.L.R.B. 686, 689, 693 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Board\u2019s finding that Brusco mates do not responsibly direct other crew members was likewise supported by substantial evidence. Direction is considered \u201cresponsible]\u201d only when the supervisor is \u201cfully accountable and responsible for the performance and work product of the employees he directs,\u201d meaning \u201csome adverse consequence may befall\u201d the supervisor if the employee does not perform properly. <em>Id. </em>at 691-92; <em>see Allied Aviation Serv. Co. v. NLRB, </em>854 F.3d 55, 65 (D.C. Cir. 2017). The company, which bore the burden of proof on this issue, could not identify any occasion in which a mate was disciplined or faced adverse consequences because of a deckhand\u2019s poor performance. 854 F.3d at 65-66. Substantial record evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that the mates are non-supervisory within the meaning of the Act, under the standard articulated in <em>Oakwood, </em>348 N.L.R.B. 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In concluding that mates are non-supervisory, the Board adequately distinguished pr <em>e-Oakwood </em>cases that classified mates or mate-equivalents as statutory supervisors. It found pr <em>e-Oakwood </em>cases to be of \u201climited precedential value,\u201d particularly because the Board in <em>Oakwood </em>adopted the adverse-consequences element that it found Brusco had failed to satisfy. <em>See </em>348 N.L.R.B. at 691-92. The Board also found the earlier cases distinguishable on their facts, because in the relevant precedent the crews were larger, creating more opportunity for mates to choose between employees to complete significant tasks. Decision and Order at 9 &amp; n.20; <em>see Bernhardt Bros., </em>142 N.L.R.B. 851, 853-54 (1963); <em>Local 28, </em>136 N.L.R.B. 1175, 1192 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-1\">Given those determinations and the Board\u2019s faithful' application of the standards articulated in <em>Oakwood, </em>we conclude that it adequately cured the defect identified in our prior opinion. <em>See Brusco Tug &amp; Barge Co. v. NLRB, </em>247 F.3d 273, 278 (D.C. Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"axw-dedup-0\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"AF0h\">Brusco also challenges the Board\u2019s denial of its request to submit new evidence about the status of mates at the company. New evidence of personnel turnover is not relevant to Brusco\u2019s claim because it is \u201cwell settled that post-election turnover is an insufficient ground to set aside an election\u201d or \u201crender <em>&amp; </em>certification no longer appropriate.\u201d <em>Pearson Educ., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>373 F.3d 127, 132-33 (D.C. Cir. 2004). This rule, though perhaps vexing to employers, is essential to the integrity of representation elections. \u201cIf an employer, dissatisfied with the upshot of a representation proceeding, could manufacture circumstances sufficient to require reconsideration simply by shifting duties around, then Board certifications would be little more than hollow gestures.\u201d <em>Telemundo de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>113 F.3d 270, 277 n.5 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"Abnu\">If Brusco believes that its employees no longer wish to be represented by the union, it may file a petition to clarify the bargaining unit, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.60(b), or the current employees, after a period of bargaining, may seek to decertify the union, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c)(l)(A)(ii); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.60(a).</p>\n<p id=\"AbgK\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
