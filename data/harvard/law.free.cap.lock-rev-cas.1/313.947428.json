The Court of Errors <em>reversed </em>the decision; the court held, that no action will lie for charges against a public officer, contained in a petition to the appointing power praying his removal from office, although the words used in the petition are false, and actionable in themselves, <em>without proving express malice ; </em>or that the petition was <em>actually malicious and groundless, </em>and presented merely to injure the plaintiff's character.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">\u00a30= It would seem necessary, therefore, in a declaration for such a libel, to <em>aver express malice, </em>and the <em>groundlessness </em>of the charges, and that they were presented merely to injure the plaintiff\u2019s character.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The reporter adds a <em>semble </em>to this case, which does not appear to be authorized by any thing in the decision as reported ; as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\"><em>\u201c It seems, </em>that where a person addresses a complaint to persons competent to redress the grievance complained of, no action will lie, whether his statement be true or false, or his motives innocent or malicious.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
