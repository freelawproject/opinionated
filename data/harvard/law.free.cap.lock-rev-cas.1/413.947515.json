The goods were sold at auction to be paid for in good, approved, endorsed notes ; and under a usage or custom between auctioneers and purchasers in the city of New York, the goods were delivered to the buyer after the sale, when he called for them and the auctioneer was afterwards to send for the notes. The notes not having been given, were sent for 7 days after the sale, and the buyer having failed and made an assignment of, the goods the question was whether it was an <em>absolute </em>delivery, so as to pass the title or only a <em>conditional delivery; </em>so that on the failure to give the notes, the property revested in the vendor.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The <em>Chancellor </em>held it a mere conditional delivery and decreed that Duane, as a general assignee to secure antecedent debts, could not hold the goods against the vendor.
