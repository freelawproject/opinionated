But on writ of error in this case,</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The Court of Errors held, that the legislature had the power, and that the decision of the Supreme Court that \u201cthe act providing for the appointment of justices of the peace by the common council of <em>Rochester, was unconstitutional and void,\u201d </em>was erroneous, and their judgment in this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>reversed </em>by an almost unanimous vote; (two senators only voting to affirm.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">N. B. The case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>was held to be rightly decided, without reference to the constitutional question; (see p. 601, per the Chancellor; and p. 612, 613, per Senator Ely;) as the law under which Kane had been appointed, was <em>repealed </em>before his appointment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
