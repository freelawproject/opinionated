That the mortgage was not <em>void for </em>mere want of the possession required by the Rev. Stat., if it be made to appear on the part of the mortgagor, that it was <em>made in good faith, </em>and without any <em>intent to defraud </em>purchasers or creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\u25a0 2. That the continuance of the mortgagor\u2019s possession, affords the highest presumption of <em>fraudulent intent, </em>amounting to <em>conclusive proof, </em>unless it be <em>rebutted </em>by such evidence as to make the good faith of the <em>transaction appear </em>affirmatively. The burden of proof to rebut that presumption, is thrown wholly upon the party claiming under the mortgage, and the question of <em>intent </em>is not to he determined by the court where such <em>proof is offered, </em>but it must be submitted to the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
