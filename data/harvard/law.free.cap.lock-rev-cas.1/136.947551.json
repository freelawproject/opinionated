The premises were given to M., for life, and after her decease to the three daughters, the survivor or survivors of them, clearly referring to the event of her dea(h;\u201d and that court gave judgment accordingly. But</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The Court of Errors held, (the President of the Senate, the Chancellor, and Senator Verplanck, delivering opinions in favor of <em>reversal.) </em>that the children\u2019s estate in remainder, was a <em>vested interest </em>at the <em>death of the </em>testator, and that therefore, though at the death of the tenant for life, but <em>one </em>of them be surviving, he takes only one third of the estate and the <em>heirs at law, </em>of the two others, (they being <em>surviving </em>at the death of the testator,) take the residue between them ; that the wprds of survivorship relate to the <em>death of the testator </em>and not to the <em>death of the tenant for life, </em>unless from <em>other </em>parts of the will it be manifest that the <em>intent </em>of the testator was otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Judgment <em>reversed </em>13 to 3.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
