Gouverneur and Kemble, </em>1 J. C. 436; and <em>Bush </em>v. Livingston, 2 Caines C. E. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The laches of the assignee of the first judgment in not giving immediate notice to the judgment debtor of the assignment to him, furnished a sufficient equity for postponing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>his lien to that of the junior judgment creditor, who had lent his money, while the satisfaction of the judgment by the original judgment creditor was of record, and still in force.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
