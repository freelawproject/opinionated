On August 22, 2016, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\"the Commission\"), through Bar Counsel, filed in this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action (\"Petition\") against Respondent as a result of having received a notice from Citibank that Respondent had over-drafted his operating account ending in -XXXX. Upon investigation, the Commission discovered that Respondent had failed to disclose assets that were associated with his law firm's pension plan in his bankruptcy petition, and\n   that Respondent had outstanding federal and state tax liens totaling $35,092.72.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its Petition, the Commission alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct (\"MARPC\") \u00a7 19-301.15(a) (safekeeping property),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 19-308.1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \u00a7 19-\n   308.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 1, 2016, this Court referred the matter to the Honorable Steven G. Salant (\"the hearing judge\") in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct a hearing and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-727(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 10, 2017, the hearing judge conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding Respondent's professional misconduct. Thereafter, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, determining by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) and MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4(a), (c), and (d).On April 4, 2017, this Court entered a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order disbarring Respondent, effective immediately. For the reasons stated below we hold that the hearing judge's conclusions regarding Respondent's violations of MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) and \u00a7 19-308.4(a), (c), and (d) were supported by clear and convincing evidence and disbarment is the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n<strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n<strong>\n    a. The Hearing Judge's Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing judge rendered the following factual findings:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   During the time covered by the [Petition], Respondent maintained a general solo practice in Montgomery County.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 14, 2015, a check presented to Citibank account No. XXXXX by the Respondent was dishonored for insufficient funds. On January 26, 2015, Bar Counsel received notice from Citibank that Respondent had over-\n   drafted account No. XXXXX in the amount of $103.83. Bar Counsel informed the Respondent through letter dated January 27, 2015 that he should provide information and documentation relating to the overdraft within ten days of receipt of the letter. The letter was sent to the address maintained with the Client Protection Fund.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Respondent wrote to Bar Counsel by letter dated March 12, 2015, stating the account was an operating account, not an attorney trust account, and the overdraft was due to a stop payment.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Respondent provided a copy of the January 2015 statement for account Nos. XXXXX and XXXXX. Account No. XXXXX was Respondent's attorney trust account. The statement showed that Respondent disbursed a sum of $53,484 to \"6 Beachside LLC\" (\"LLC\") from his attorney trust account on January 7, 2015. The LLC is a Florida limited liability company owned by the Respondent. The LLC owns real property in Palm Coast, and the resident agent for the LLC is Alla March, aka, Alla Marchenko, who is Respondent's girlfriend and paralegal.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondent replied to Bar Counsel's inquiries that the transactions to the LLC were for his law firm's pension plan. After further investigation, Bar Counsel discovered that Respondent filed a Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Respondent failed to disclose all of his assets, as well as assets associated with his pension plan in the bankruptcy petition, which is signed under oath. Additionally, Bar Counsel learned that Respondent had outstanding state and federal tax liens in the amount of approximately $22,948.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondent was instructed to provide information and documentation about the tax liens and related tax liability by July 10, 2015 through a letter from Bar Counsel dated June 22, 2015. However, Respondent failed to respond in any manner after receiving the letter. Bar Counsel sent another letter on July 13, 2015 requesting a reply no later than July 27, 2015 and Respondent again failed to answer after receiving the second letter. On August 4, 2015, Bar Counsel sent a third letter to Respondent, which he did not answer.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Bar Counsel received Respondent's bank records from Citibank through a subpoena issued on June 22, 2015. Bar Counsel requested information about eight transactions pertaining to Respondent's attorney trust account and relating to client ledgers for six named individuals through letter dated January 26, 2016. Respondent received the letter on about the same day and has failed to answer.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-20\">\n<strong>\n    b.

With respect to exceptions, upon our review of the record, the hearing judge's findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. A hearing judge's factual finding is not clearly erroneous if there is any competent material evidence to support it.

We also agree that the findings of fact establish by\n   clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) and \u00a7 19-308.4(a), (c), and (d) when he failed to respond to lawful demands for information by Bar Counsel and failed to disclose assets associated with his law firm's pension plan in his petition for bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n<strong>\n    IV. SANCTION\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Commission requests that this Court disbar Respondent from the practice of law. According to the Commission, Respondent's repeated failure to respond to Bar Counsel's inquiries regarding outstanding tax liens, his attorney trust account, and his failure to disclose assets associated with his law firm's pension plan in his Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, warrant such a sanction.

On November 23, 2010, Respondent entered his appearance in the SSFMC bankruptcy case as counsel for the Law Office of Mark Kotlarsky, Esq. Pension Plan, alleging the Pension Plan was an unsecured creditor of SSFMC. Three years later, on February 6, 2013, Respondent filed a Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, in his personal capacity, in the Maryland Bankruptcy Court. Although Respondent disclosed the Pension Plan in his bankruptcy petition, the record indicates that he failed to disclose the potential SSFMC claim as an asset. Upon discovery of the Pension Plan's potential claim, Respondent's bankruptcy trustee contested the Final Report and Account in the SSFMC bankruptcy. The SSFMC bankruptcy judge subsequently held that the funds due to Respondent's Pension Plan would be distributed to Respondent's bankruptcy trustee until ownership of the funds could be determined. On August 28, 2013, $41,148.55 was distributed to Respondent's bankruptcy trustee.\n   </p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n"}}
