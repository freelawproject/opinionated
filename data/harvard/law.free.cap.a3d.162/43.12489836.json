The defendant claims that (1) the trial court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence testimonial hearsay in violation of his constitutional right to confrontation, (2) the prosecutor committed multiple\n   acts of impropriety, and (3) the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence inadmissible \"guilt by association\" evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant lived in the Bronx, New York and owned Sinclair Enterprises, a business that sold used cars. Between October, 2012, and February, 2013, the defendant and his girlfriend, Winsome Lawrence, drove to Connecticut approximately nine or ten times in a Jeep to go to a mall in Waterbury. On February 5, 2013, as they did on every other trip, the defendant drove the Jeep to Lawrence's house, and Lawrence drove the Jeep to Waterbury while the defendant sat in the passenger seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When they arrived in Waterbury, the defendant told Lawrence to get off the highway at an exit and directed\n   her to a side road. Shortly thereafter, a black vehicle parked on the same side of the road. The defendant opened the center console of the Jeep, pulled a string, and took out two white parcels of heroin. He gave the bags to an individual in the black vehicle and walked back to the Jeep with money in his hands. On his way back to the Jeep, the defendant saw a marked police vehicle, and he threw the money into a bush. Lawrence drove the defendant to a nearby gas station. At the gas station, she heard the defendant say on his cell phone, \"Jay, come and pick me up ... I'm going back for the money.\" The defendant then went into the gas station, telling Lawrence that he needed to get a black bag. After he returned to the Jeep, the black vehicle mentioned previously came and picked up the defendant. The defendant left the gas station for approximately ten minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When he returned, he had a black bag filled with money, and he told Lawrence to drive to the mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Earlier that day, at approximately 4:30 p.m., a detective with the Waterbury Police Department received an anonymous tip that \"activity\" was going to take place that night in Waterbury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detective relayed this information to Gary Angon, a sergeant with the Waterbury Police Department. On the basis of the tip, Angon assigned the officers in his unit to survey the area around the mall. At approximately 8 p.m., Angon saw the Jeep. He radioed the officers, telling them that he had observed a vehicle that fit the description of the one that they were looking for. Angon pulled the Jeep over, and the defendant appeared more nervous than most people who interact with the police because he\n   kept looking up and down the street and hesitating when answering Angon's questions. Angon asked the defendant who owned the Jeep, and the defendant replied that \"it was his friend's.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly thereafter, James Dickey, a detective with the Waterbury Police Department, and Bella, Dickey's narcotics detection canine, conducted a narcotics detection sweep of the Jeep. Bella alerted Dickey to the center console of the Jeep, and Dickey and Eric Medina, an officer with the Waterbury Police Department, found a number of prepackaged bags of heroin and a black bag filled with money in a trap in the center console. The defendant\n   and Lawrence were placed under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was charged with possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the state's case-in-chief, Angon testified about the police surveillance that ended with the arrests of the defendant and Lawrence. He also testified, over the defendant's objection, that during the course of his investigation, he learned that the Jeep had been inspected at Manny's Auto Repair, which was located next to Sinclair Enterprises, the defendant's place of business, in New York. Medina testified that he recovered approximately 10,000 bags of heroin, stored in ten bricks, that were worth approximately $45,000 to $60,000 and a black bag filled with cash worth $12,248 in the Jeep. Charmaine Henriques, Lawrence's cousin, testified that she had spoken with the defendant after the incident, and he told her that he \"was trying a thing and g[ot] fucked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lawrence testified for the state,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   describing the drug transaction and the events that took place at the gas station. Lawrence also testified that the Jeep belonged to the defendant. The state introduced into evidence a videotape that depicted Lawrence, the defendant, and the black vehicle at the gas station. The videotape also showed the driver of the black vehicle, and Angon testified, over the defendant's objection, that he recognized him as Terrence Saunders, a known heroin dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant testified on his own behalf that, contrary to Lawrence's testimony, he and Lawrence had only driven to Connecticut on two occasions, the second time being the night on which they were arrested. He testified that on the night of the arrest, he and Lawrence were going to a casino but decided to stop by the mall for dinner. Later, on direct examination, he contradicted himself, testifying that they went to Connecticut to meet a man named Paul because Paul wanted to sell a vehicle to him. He testified that Paul was in the black vehicle that picked him up at the gas station, but that there were also two other men in the vehicle whom the defendant did not know. He denied ever seeing the narcotics or the money in the Jeep prior to their discovery by the police. He also denied owning the Jeep, testifying that the Jeep belonged to Lawrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 30, 2015, the jury found the defendant guilty of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent. The court sentenced the defendant to eight years imprisonment, five years of which were mandatory. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court violated his right to confrontation when it admitted into evidence\n   Angon's testimony that the Jeep was inspected at Manny's Auto Repair, located next to the defendant's business in the Bronx, New York. Specifically, the defendant argues that evidence of the inspection information was inadmissible testimonial hearsay and that admitting the evidence was not harmless\n   error because the inspection location was a critical piece of evidence linking the defendant to the Jeep. The state argues that the evidence was not testimonial hearsay, and even if it was, the state showed that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that even if the defendant's right to confrontation was violated, any violation was harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Angon testified on direct examination that, on the basis of his training and experience, a drug dealer often uses a vehicle he owns during a drug transaction but registers it in someone else's name. The dealer will also have someone else drive the vehicle in order to \"avoid any connection with the drug.\" He also testified that narcotics are often transported from New York to Waterbury. The state then introduced into evidence a printout detailing the Jeep's registration information, but neither the place of inspection nor a code that related to the place of inspection was included on the printout.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on the printout, Angon testified that the Jeep was registered in New York to a man named Victor A. Manana. The state asked Angon where the Jeep was inspected, and defense counsel objected on the ground of hearsay because Angon would be testifying about \"information he gleaned somewhere else.\" The court overruled the objection, and Angon testified that the Jeep was inspected at Manny's Auto Repair, which was a business located adjacent to the defendant's business, Sinclair Enterprises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant questioned Angon during cross-examination about how he obtained the inspection information. Angon replied that sometime in the last two days, someone in his \"office contacted New York State police to see if they could translate ... the information that's on the printout.\" Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant moved to strike any and all of Angon's testimony relating to the Jeep's inspection information. The defendant argued that Angon's testimony was hearsay because Angon testified about information he obtained from someone in his office who obtained it from an unidentified individual in New York. He also argued that admitting the evidence violated\n   <em>\n    Crawford.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state argued that a New York officer had merely translated a \"somewhat confusing registration document ....\" The court denied the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During his case, the defendant testified that Manny's Auto Repair was located on a lot next to Sinclair Enterprises, but that the properties were separated by a fence and that he did not have any ownership interest in Manny's Auto Repair. On cross-examination, however, he admitted that he used Manny's Auto Repair to per-form repairs on the used cars he sold. The state also put into evidence Sinclair Enterprises' Internet site that advertised it as a \"used car service and auto repair facility located in the Bronx.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the court violated his constitutional right to confrontation when it admitted Angon's inspection testimony. The defendant argues that Angon's testimony was hearsay because he obtained the inspection information from an unknown individual working in his office who obtained the information from someone working for the \"New York State police,\" and the inspection information was used to\n   prove the truth of the matter asserted. He also argues that the evidence was testimonial in nature because\n   Angon received the information during the course of his investigation, and the primary purpose of the investigation was to prove events relevant to a criminal prosecution. The defendant contends that the state failed to meet its burden of showing that the constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because a critical component of the state's case was linking the defendant to the Jeep, and without the inspection information, the case \"rose and fell on Lawrence's testimony and her credibility.\" We disagree with the defendant and conclude that even if the court abused its discretion in admitting Angon's testimony, the state met its burden of showing that any evidentiary error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We will assume, without deciding, that the court abused its discretion in allowing Angon to testify as to where the Jeep was inspected because the evidence was testimonial hearsay. \"When an [evidentiary] impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    William L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734496\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/126/472/#p481\">\n    126 Conn.App. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20A.3d%201132\">\n    11 A.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778972,6779006\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/926/\">\n    300 Conn. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20A.3d%20628\">\n    15 A.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). \"That determination must be made\n   <em>\n    in light of the entire record\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086550\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/449/#p460\">\n    296 Conn. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=996%20A.2d%20251\">\n    996 A.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Whether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as [1] the importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, [2] whether the testimony was cumulative, [3] the presence or absence of evidence corroborating\n   or contradicting the testimony of the witness on mate-rial points, [4] the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, [5] the overall strength of the prosecution's case. ...

After an examination of the\n   <em>\n    entire record\n   </em>\n   , however, we conclude that the state has proved that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the overall strength of the state's case shows that the inspection information did not have a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The state presented a significant amount of evidence which directly, or indirectly, supported the charge that the defendant knowingly possessed the narcotics in the Jeep. Lawrence testified that she observed the defendant take two white parcels out from the center console of the Jeep and engage in a drug transaction with an individual in a black vehicle. After the transaction, the\n   defendant threw money into a bush and told her to drive to a gas station. At the gas station, she heard him say on his cell phone, \"Jay, come and pick me up ... I'm going back for the money.\" The defendant told her to park near a wall. He then went inside the gas station and eventually returned to the Jeep. Then, the previously mentioned black vehicle arrived and picked up the defendant. She testified that when he returned, he had a black bag filled with cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The state also presented the video recorded at the gas station, which depicted the following events. A tan Jeep with New York license plates parked in a lit area of the side parking lot. Approximately ten minutes later, the Jeep drove to the opposite side of the gas station and parked near a wall in an area with no lighting. While on his cell phone, the defendant exited the Jeep, purchased a soda from within the gas station, and returned to the Jeep. Approximately three minutes later, a black vehicle parked in front of the gas station. The defendant exited the Jeep and entered the backseat of the black vehicle without shaking hands, introducing himself, or otherwise acknowledging the individuals in the vehicle, whom he claimed not to know. Approximately ten minutes later, the black vehicle returned and parked next to the Jeep, which was still in the unlit area of the parking lot, and the defendant exited the black vehicle and went back into the Jeep. In addition, the state presented evidence that the police recovered $12,248 worth of cash in the Jeep, and, on the\n   basis of Medina's testimony that there was $45,000 to $60,000 worth of narcotics in the Jeep, the jury reasonably could have found that two bricks of narcotics was worth approximately $12,000. This supports Lawrence's testimony that she saw the defendant take out of the center console and sell two parcels of narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Whether [a witness'] testimony [is] believable [is] a question solely for the jury.

The jury was free to credit Lawrence's testimony over the defendant's testimony and draw any reasonable inferences from it. Moreover, any inconsistencies in Lawrence's testimony were fully explored by defense counsel on cross-examination and during closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The state also presented other incriminating evidence against the defendant in addition to Lawrence's testimony. The videotape showed that the driver of the black vehicle was a known heroin dealer and that the narcotics found in the Jeep were heroin. The anonymous tip that the police received revealed that \"activity\" was going to take place in Waterbury, and, on the basis of the contents of the tip, the police were instructed to survey the area around the mall to look for a Jeep with New York license plates. The police located the defendant near the mall in a Jeep with New York license plates. When Angon pulled the Jeep over, the defendant appeared more nervous than the average person who interacts with the police.

When questioned by the police about who owned the Jeep, the defendant stated that the Jeep belonged to \"a friend,\" and at the police station, he asked Lawrence, \"what did you tell police.\" A few weeks later, he told Henriques that \"I was trying a thing and I g[ot] fucked.\" He also told Henriques that Lawrence was not involved in the incident, but gave Henriques $4000 to bail Lawrence out of jail. After Lawrence was released from custody,\n   the defendant promised her that he would pay for her rent, although he never gave her any money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendant's own testimony may have been damaging to his case. He testified that he and Lawrence were on their way to a casino, but then contradicted himself and testified that they were actually going to Connecticut to speak to a man named Paul about purchasing a vehicle. In response to the prosecutor's question, \"[the mall is in] the opposite direction of the casino, [r]ight?\" the defendant responded that he did not know how to get to the casino from Waterbury. The defendant stated that he did not know Paul's last name or any of the other occupants in the black vehicle.

Lawrence's testimony and the registration printout\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   showed\n   that the defendant's actions comported with this practice: the defendant drove the Jeep to Lawrence's house, but had Lawrence drive the Jeep from the Bronx to Waterbury, and the Jeep was registered to Victor A. Manana. In addition, the defendant testified that in November, 2013, Lawrence purchased two cell phones and gave one to the defendant, but registered both phones under her name, and the defendant paid her directly for his phone. On cross-examination, he admitted that he could not recall how many cell phones he had with him on the night of the arrest, testifying that he did not \"think [he] had two cell phones\" with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We acknowledge the dissent's concern that the prosecutor used the inspection information during closing argument to prove the state's theories that the defendant owned the Jeep and that his actions comported with those of a drug dealer. The inspection information, however, was not the only piece of evidence the prosecutor used in closing argument to prove these propositions. The prosecutor relied heavily on Lawrence's testimony that the defendant owned the Jeep and that he drove it to her house on nine or ten occasions. He also used the fact that the Jeep was not registered in the defendant's name. The prosecutor's use of the inspection information was confined to a relatively small portion of his closing argument, and the vast majority of it was dedicated to bolstering Lawrence's credibility and undermining the defendant's credibility. When one considers the cumulative force of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the evidence that the state presented to prove the defendant's guilt and the impact that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the evidence had on the jury, which is the most important consideration in our harmlessness analysis, we believe the state is able to meet this burden.

The defendant did not invite the prosecutor to make the\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   violation comment because neither defense counsel's theory of the case nor closing argument pertained to the credibility of Angon or Medina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458155\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/563/#p593\">\n    269 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20A.2d%20626\">\n    849 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (comment invited because defendant's theory of case was that police lied). The defendant also did not invite the prosecutor to make the \"usually they use that against us\" comment because defense counsel never argued that the prosecutor engaged in common tactics employed by prosecutors.

Defense counsel, however, invited the prosecutor to make the \"trying to trip her up\" comment. Defense counsel argued during closing argument about Lawrence's demeanor on the witness stand, calling her \"unsophisticated,\" \"not ... very intelligent,\" and asserting that she did not \"have a very good under-standing of anything that's going on around her.\" The prosecutor was free to explain why Lawrence may have had trouble answering defense counsel's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The second factor, which is whether the improprieties were severe, weighs in favor of the state. Defense counsel did not object to or ask for curative instructions\n   for the\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   violation comment or to the \"usually they use that against us\" comment. \"[D]efense counsel's failure to make a contemporaneous objection [or ask for curative instructions] certainly permits an inference that counsel did not think the impropriety was severe, and that it is in part the responsibility of counsel that the impropriety went uncured.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20293\">\n    154 Conn.App. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20175\">\n    112 A.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20928\">\n    315 Conn. 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20923\">\n    109 A.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We recognize that defense counsel did object to the \"trying to trip her up\" comment, and he asked the court for a curative instruction, which the court denied. The existence of an objection, however, is not the sole factor in our determination of whether an impropriety was severe. \"Beyond defense counsel's failure to object, in determining the severity of prosecutorial impropriety, we look to whether the impropriety was blatantly egregious or inexcusable.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fauci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951023\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/23/#p51\">\n    282 Conn. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20A.2d%20978\">\n    917 A.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). We do not find this comment so blatantly egregious as to warrant reversal of the defendant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The third factor, which is the frequency of the comments, weighs in favor of the state. The prosecutor made three impermissible comments, and they were all confined to his rebuttal argument. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%2078\">\n    162 Conn.App. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20770\">\n    129 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (comment proper because prosecutor made remarks only once in each of his initial and rebuttal closing arguments), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20905\">\n    321 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484929\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/281/\">\n    138 A.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The fourth factor, which is whether the comments pertained to a critical issue in the case, does not clearly weigh in favor of either party. A critical issue in the case was the veracity of Lawrence and the defendant. The \"usually they use that against us\" comment did not pertain to this issue. The\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   violation comment and the \"trying to trip her up\" comment related to this\n   issue because the\n   prosecutor directly attacked the credibility of Lawrence and the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The fifth factor, which is the strength of the curative measures adopted, does not weigh in favor of either party. Defense counsel did not object to the\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   violation comment or the \"usually they use that against us\" comment.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20293\">\n    154 Conn.App. at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20175\">\n    112 A.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defense counsel, however, objected to the third comment, and the court failed to give a curative instruction. It should be noted that the court, in fact, sustained the defendant's objection. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warholic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665956\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/354/#p401\">\n    278 Conn. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20A.2d%20569\">\n    897 A.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (court took curative measures when it sustained defense counsel's objections). It also gave the jury specific instructions about weighing the testimony of accomplices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the sixth factor, which is the strength of the state's case, weighs in favor of the state. As discussed previously, the state had a relatively strong case against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   After an examination of the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors in the context of the entire trial, we conclude that the defendant was not deprived of his right to a fair trial because there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have returned a different verdict absent the improprieties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The defendant's third claim is that the court abused its discretion when it allowed Angon to testify that he knew that Saunders, the driver of the black vehicle, was a known heroin dealer. Specifically, the defendant argues that this was inadmissible \"guilt by association\" evidence. The state claims that the evidence was properly admitted because it was \"relevant and probative\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   to show possession and intent to sell the narcotics. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Before the state presented its evidence, the defendant informed the court that he had learned that the state intended to elicit testimony from Angon that he, after reviewing the videotape, recognized the driver of the black vehicle as Saunders because he had arrested Saunders in 2012, for the \"sale of heroin in the Waterbury area.\" The defendant made a motion in limine to preclude the evidence because there was no evidence that the defendant knew Saunders. The state argued that the information was relevant to show the defendant's intent to sell and possession of the narcotics. The court denied the motion in limine, but noted that the defendant could object to the testimony once the state offered to put it into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   During the state's case-in-chief, Angon testified that he viewed the videotape and recognized the man driving the black vehicle as Saunders. He did not testify as to how he knew Saunders. The next day, Lawrence testified. At the conclusion of her testimony, the state asked permission from the court to recall Angon to testify as to how he knew Saunders. The state argued that in light of Lawrence's testimony, the identity of Saunders as a known heroin dealer was relevant to whether the defendant had possessed and intended to sell narcotics. The defendant argued that the evidence was irrelevant because there was no evidence presented that the defendant personally knew Saunders. The court ruled that the state was not allowed to elicit testimony concerning any details of Saunders' 2012 arrest, but it could elicit testimony\n   that Angon knew Saunders to be a known heroin dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At the end of the state's case-in-chief, the state recalled Angon outside the presence of the jury to make\n   an offer of proof. Angon testified that on the basis of his training and experience, he knew that Saunders was a known heroin dealer in Waterbury. The defendant objected to the question, but the court ruled that on the basis of Lawrence's testimony, Angon's proffered testimony was relevant to show possession and intent to sell the narcotics, and that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. The state recalled Angon, and he testified that he knew Saunders to be a known heroin dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in allowing Angon to testify that Saunders was a known heroin dealer. The defendant contends that his testimony was inadmissible \"guilt by association\" evidence because there was no evidence presented that the defendant knew Saunders. The defendant argues that admitting the testimony was harmful because the state's case was not strong independent of the evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"As an initial matter, we review a court's decision to admit or to exclude evidence under a deferential standard, i.e., whether the court's ruling was an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1366838\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/77/152/#p160\">\n    77 Conn.App. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=822%20A.2d%20348\">\n    822 A.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913197,913365\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/910/\">\n    265 Conn. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=831%20A.2d%20252\">\n    831 A.2d 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. ...

I respectfully dissent, however, with respect to the majority's conclusion that the admission of the testimony of Sergeant Gary Angon of the Waterbury Police Department regarding the location of the inspection of the Jeep involved in the incidents at issue was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Angon's testimony regarding the inspection quite clearly was testimonial hearsay, and, thus, its admission violated the confrontation clause. See\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Angon testified that an unnamed person from the Waterbury Police Department had acquired information regarding the Jeep's inspection from an unnamed person working with the New York State police. This information was acquired in the course of Angon's investigation of the crime under circumstances that obviously contemplated its use in the prosecution. The defendant, Casey Sinclair, did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the unnamed person who requested this information, nor did he have the opportunity to cross-examine the unnamed person who responded. The information reportedly gathered from the New York police-that the Jeep's registration number showed that it had been inspected at a garage adjacent to the defendant's business-was offered by the state at trial to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The admission of Angon's testimony relaying the information about the inspection, then, quite clearly violated the defendant's rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority recognizes the problem and assumes, for the purpose of analysis, that the confrontation clause was violated, but then concludes that the introduction of the evidence was harmless. An examination of the record compels me to conclude that the state has not met its burden to show that the admission of the testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As the majority notes, the prosecution sought to prove guilt under a theory of constructive possession, because the narcotics were found in a Jeep that was not in the defendant's exclusive possession. Under this theory, the prosecution was required to prove that \"the defendant knew the character of the substance, knew of its presence and exercised dominion and control over it.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959072\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/135/#p149\">\n    285 Conn. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=939%20A.2d%20524\">\n    939 A.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%20859\">\n    555 U.S. 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%20133\">\n    129 S.Ct. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20101\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It was not necessary for the state to show ownership or exclusive control of the Jeep, and the defendant could have been found guilty, of course, without the evidence in question. But it is undeniable, from the record in this case, that the prosecutor used the inferred close connection between the defendant and the Jeep to full\n   advantage. In his closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the location of the Jeep's inspection in an effort to establish that the defendant knew about and exercised dominion and control over the heroin hidden in the Jeep\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the defendant fit the profile of a drug dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The prosecutor argued, \"I have to prove three things. That [the defendant] was in possession of heroin, he knowingly possessed the heroin, [and] he possessed it\n   with intent to sell.\" In presenting his argument on the second element, the prosecutor began by arguing: \"Knowingly possessed.\n   <em>\n    It's his Jeep.\n   </em>\n   There's some dispute about that. ... Winsome Lawrence testified nine times she came to Connecticut ... every time he picked her up in that Jeep.\n   <em>\n    There's also the evidence about the Jeep that links that Jeep to being inspected at Sinclair Enterprises, his garage right next to his business.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The prosecutor stressed not only the elements of the crime, but also that the defendant's behavior was consistent with that of a drug dealer: he \"want[ed] to separate himself from the drugs,\" a behavior consistent with that of a narcotics dealer, but \"there was a mistake ... to register a car in New York, it has to go through an inspection, and the inspection for the car was done at [the defendant's] place of business. ... There's a connection, right there, to [the defendant]. He didn't separate himself good enough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The state argues that Angon's testimony likely did not influence the jury in reaching its judgment because \"the state's case against [the defendant] was strong, independent of Angon's testimony about the inspection location.\" A review of the record, however, shows that the state's evidence was less than overwhelming on the question of whether the defendant knew about and exercised dominion and control over the 10,000 bags of heroin ultimately found in the Jeep. The direct evidence regarding the defendant's guilt was primarily Lawrence's testimony; the state conceded that \"the critical issue in the case was the credibility of both Lawrence and the defendant.\" Lawrence testified that the defendant owned the Jeep, that he had picked her up in the Jeep on several occasions, and that she had seen him open the Jeep's center console, pull a string, and retrieve two bags of heroin from inside. The defendant, by contrast, testified that Lawrence owned the Jeep\n   and that he did not know that there were drugs hidden in the car. On the issue of knowledge about and dominion and control over the Jeep's contents, Angon's testimony regarding the inspection was the only documentary and at least superficially objective evidence tending to suggest that Lawrence's testimony was more likely true than the defendant's testimony. The testimonial hearsay was not cumulative and was not corroborated by evidence other than Lawrence's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   I stress that the hearsay, surely relevant to the issue of constructive possession, was used to perhaps greater effect to show more generally that the defendant was a drug dealer. A theme of the prosecution was that the defendant created a distance between the actual dealing and himself, so that others would be blamed if the enterprise faltered. In pursuit of that strategy, he \"used\" Lawrence and a false registration for the Jeep.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the admission\n   of Angon's testimony was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   If the error were merely evidential, there may be a good argument that the defendant had not proved harm. But on the record in this case, I respectfully cannot agree that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor used the evidence to hammer home the defendant's nefarious ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The prosecutor argued: \"The tan Jeep Liberty. His car. Maybe not registered to his name, but why not? He wants to separate himself from the drugs. Let's talk about the connections with the tan Jeep Liberty to [the defendant]. It's if-if you put it in some-well, it's in someone else's name. But there was a mistake. Because there-to register a car in New York, it has to go through an inspection, and the inspection for the car was done at [the defendant's] place of business. ...\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \"So, where's it inspected?
