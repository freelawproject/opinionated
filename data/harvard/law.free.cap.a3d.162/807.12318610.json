Bar R. XI, \u00a7 11 (c) will prevail except in \u201crare\u201d cases); <em>In re Cole, </em>809 A.2d 1226, 1227 n.3 (D.C. 2002) (explaining that in unopposed reciprocal matters the \u201cimposition of identical discipline should be close to automatic\u201d). For purposes of eligibility to petition for reinstatement, the suspension will not begin to run until such time as respondent files a D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14 (g) affidavit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
