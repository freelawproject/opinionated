In the present case, the Appellate Court concluded that, under\n   <em>\n    Aquino,\n   </em>\n   the appeal of the defendant, Jerzy G., from the trial court's order terminating his participation in an accelerated rehabilitation program and ordering his rearrest on the pending criminal charge was rendered moot by his deportation because the reason for his deportation was unrelated to that program or that charge.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jerzy G\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20156\">\n    162 Conn.App. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161, 164,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Aquino,\n   </em>\n   properly construed, does not control the present case because the record establishes the reason for the defendant's deportation and there is a reasonable possibility that the trial court's orders would result in prejudicial collateral\n   consequences. Accordingly, the Appellate Court improperly dismissed the defendant's appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts. The defendant is a citizen of Poland. In April, 2006, he entered the United States on a nonimmigrant B-2 visitor's visa, which authorized him to remain in this country for a period not to exceed six months. Approximately six years later, in January, 2012, the defendant was charged with one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree, a class A misdemeanor, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a(a)(2). The defendant filed an application for the pretrial diversionary program of accelerated rehabilitation, which vests the court with discretion to suspend criminal prosecution for certain offenses and to release the defendant to the custody of the Court Support Services Division for a specified period, subject to conditions the court deems appropriate. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e(a), (b) and (d). Upon successful completion of the program for the specified period, the defendant would be entitled to dismissal of the charge. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e(f). The state opposed the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At an April, 2012 hearing on the application, the state brought information to the court's attention that it had received from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regarding the defendant's immigration status. ICE informed the state that the defendant had overstayed his visa. ICE indicated that it would commence removal proceedings if the defendant was convicted of the charge,\n   but was uncertain about what would happen if he was not convicted. The state also informed the court that the complainant, an acquaintance of the defendant, had reported that the defendant has a wife and children who are living in Poland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following argument, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J\n   </em>\n   ., granted the defendant's application for accelerated\n   rehabilitation and made no reference to the defendant's immigration status. The court made the requisite statutory findings that the offense was not serious and that the defendant was not likely to reoffend. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e(a) and (b). The court imposed the maximum statutory period of supervision, two years, and the following conditions: no contact with the complainant; mental health evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary; substance abuse (alcohol) evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary; and seek and maintain fulltime employment. The court continued the case until April, 2014, when the two year period of probation would terminate upon successful completion of the program. Thereafter, the defendant was released from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between May and August, 2012, ICE took steps to remove the defendant from the United States. In May, the defendant was taken into custody by ICE after he was served with a notice to appear. The notice stated that he was subject to removal because he had remained in the United States for a period longer than permitted, without authorization. In June, a United States Immigration Court ordered his removal from the United States. Following that order, the United States Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to the defendant, warning him that he was prohibited from entering the United States for a period of ten years from his departure date because he had been found deportable under \u00a7 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ; and ordered him removed from the United States. In August, 2012, the defendant was deported to Poland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November, 2013, the defendant's deportation was brought to the trial court's attention. Upon the request of the Department of Adult Probation, the court,\n   <em>\n    Arnold, J\n   </em>\n   ., advanced the date for a determination whether the defendant had successfully completed the terms of his\n   accelerated rehabilitation from April, 2014, to November, 2013. At the hearing, the state sought termination of the program and requested an order for the defendant's rearrest. The defendant's public defender asked the court either to continue the case to allow further investigation or to find that the defendant had successfully completed the program and dismiss the criminal charge. Ultimately, following additional hearings, the court found that the defendant had failed to successfully complete the program, ordered his rearrest, and imposed as a condition of his release that he post a $5000 cash or surety bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court explained its decision in a subsequent memorandum of decision, couching its reasoning in both jurisdictional and substantive terms. It noted that the state had informed the court that the basis for the defendant's deportation was that he had overstayed his visa's term. It thus found that the defendant voluntarily had placed himself in jeopardy for deportation and was aware of this possibility when accelerated rehabilitation was ordered for the two year period. It found that the defendant had offered no proof that his deportation was solely a consequence of either his arrest, the pendency of the criminal charge, or his entrance into the accelerated rehabilitation program. The court further noted that the defendant had not offered any proof of compliance with the\n   conditions of participation in that program. The trial court cited this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   and concluded: \"The immigration consequences of the defendant are collateral and beyond the control of this court. The court found that the defendant was unsuccessful in his completion of the ... program and has terminated his participation in said program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court had abused its discretion by (1) denying his motion to dismiss the criminal charge, or\n   2) refusing to continue the case until he could return to the state to complete the program.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jerzy G.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20156\">\n    162 Conn.App. at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court did not reach the merits of these claims, concluding that the appeal should be dismissed as moot. Id., at 161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court cited\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   and its Appellate Court progeny as prescribing a rule under which the court cannot grant practical relief unless there is evidence that the challenged decision is the exclusive basis for the deportation. Id., at 161-64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the defendant conceded that he was deported solely because he had overstayed his visa, a reason independent of his termination from the accelerated rehabilitation program, the Appellate Court reasoned that a favorable decision in his appeal could not afford the defendant practical relief with regard to his deportation. Id., at 164-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court rejected the defendant's argument that the termination of accelerated rehabilitation gave rise to collateral consequences that could satisfy mootness, namely, that the decision could prevent him from reentering this country, visiting this country, or seeking naturalization as a United States citizen. Id., at 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again relying on\n   <em>\n    Aquino,\n   </em>\n   the court concluded that because the defendant had produced no evidence to establish that, in the absence of the termination of accelerated rehabilitation, he would be permitted to reenter, visit, or naturalize, the purported collateral consequences were too conjectural. Id., at 166-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant's certified appeal to this court followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal to this court, both parties agree that\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case. Their principal focus is on the fact that the deportee in\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   had pleaded guilty to a deportable crime, whereas the defendant in the present case has not yet been convicted of any crime but is subject to arrest should he reenter the United States. The parties disagree, however, whether the distinctions between the cases are material with respect to the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   to the present case. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the present case. We further conclude that the trial court's orders in the present case gave rise to prejudicial collateral consequences from which this court can afford practical relief. Accordingly, the appeal is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is well settled that \"[a] case is considered moot if [the] court cannot grant\n   the [litigant] any practical relief through its disposition of the merits ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Moraski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Board of Examiners of Embalmers &amp; Funeral Directors,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764557\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/242/#p255\">\n    291 Conn. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%201199\">\n    967 A.2d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).

The defendant, Derek McElveen, was found to have violated the conditions\n   of his probation on charges of failure to appear in the second degree due to his arrest in connection with an alleged attempt to commit robbery.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id., at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    802 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . McElveen appealed from the judgment revoking his probation and imposing a previously suspended sentence, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had engaged in the criminal conduct deemed to violate his probation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Mootness concerns arose because, while his appeal was pending, McElveen completed serving his sentence for the probation violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We concluded that the completed sentence did not render the appeal moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id., at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    802 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court began with core principles. \"[A] case does not necessarily become moot by virtue of the fact that ... due to a change in circumstances, relief from the actual injury is unavailable. We have determined that a controversy continues to exist, affording the court jurisdiction, if the actual injury suffered by the litigant potentially gives rise to a collateral injury from which the court can grant relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id., at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    802 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court then surveyed cases in which it previously had found such prejudicial collateral consequences to exist and gleaned from them the following standard: \"[F]or a litigant to invoke successfully the collateral consequences doctrine, the litigant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will occur. Accordingly, the litigant must establish these consequences by more than mere conjecture, but need not demonstrate that these consequences are more probable than not. This standard provides the necessary limitations on justiciability\n   underlying the mootness doctrine itself. Where there is no direct practical relief available from the reversal of the judgment ... the collateral consequences doctrine acts as a surrogate, calling for a determination whether a decision in the case can afford the litigant some practical relief in the future. The reviewing court therefore determines, based upon the particular situation, whether, the prejudicial collateral consequences are reasonably possible.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id., at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    802 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   In addition to articulating for the first time a standard by which to assess collateral consequences, two other aspects of\n   <em>\n    McElveen\n   </em>\n   are noteworthy. First, the court rejected the state's argument that we should abandon our long-standing collateral consequences standard requiring a colorably present injury and instead adopt the federal standard requiring an injury-in-fact.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    Id., at 208-209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    802 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    McElveen,\n   </em>\n   this court explained: \"Unlike in the case of a criminal conviction, in which collateral consequences are presumed to exist, the court [in\n   <em>\n    Spencer]\n   </em>\n   determined that a revocation of parole is not presumed to carry detrimental consequences, and that the petitioner would be required to demonstrate the actual existence of collateral consequences to refute a finding of mootness.... Specifically, the court rejected the petitioner's assertions that his claim was not moot because his parole violation could be used to his detriment in a future parole proceeding or to increase the petitioner's sentence in a future sentencing proceeding; the court concluded that both claims were predicated on future violations of the law and were not, therefore,\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   collateral\n   consequences....

The court emphasized the lack of evidence in the record to establish the reason for Aquino's deportation and, conversely, to establish the lack of any impediment other than the guilty plea that would preclude Aquino's admission to the country.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aquino,\n   </em>\n   supra, 279 Conn. at 298 and nn.2 and 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20A.2d%201194\">\n    901 A.2d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without that information, the court apparently deemed it impossible to determine whether, even if Aquino prevailed on appeal and his conviction was reversed, such a decision would improve his chances of reentry into the country or naturalization. It is a settled principle under both federal and Connecticut case law that, if a favorable decision necessarily could not afford the practical relief sought, the case is moot. Thus, courts have held that when a conviction, other than the one being challenged, results in a deportee's\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   ban from reentering this country, the deportee cannot establish collateral injury even if the challenged conviction also is an impediment to reentry.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Aquino,\n   </em>\n   the record establishes the reason for the defendant's deportation-overstaying the term of his visitor visa without permission to do so. Indeed, the defendant's deportation could not have been based in any part on his state criminal charge because prosecution on that charge was suspended until the trial court terminated his accelerated rehabilitation following his deportation. The record also establishes that the ground for the defendant's removal does not permanently bar him from reentering the United States, but only bars his reentry for ten years from the date of his departure (almost one half of that period having already lapsed). Once that period expires, the ground for his removal imposes no legal impediment to reentry. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Aquino\n   </em>\n   does not control the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We consider, therefore, whether there is a reasonable possibility of prejudicial collateral consequences as a result of the trial court's orders. We conclude that there is a reasonable possibility of prejudicial collateral consequences should the defendant seek to lawfully reenter the United States. The order for the defendant's arrest on a pending criminal charge would not bar his admission into the United States. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(48)(A) and 1182(a)(2)(2012). Nonetheless, the fact that there is a pending criminal charge against the defendant could be a significant factor in dissuading federal\n   immigration officials from admitting him into the country, as such a decision would be discretionary. Should it not pose such an impediment to his return, the defendant would be subject to arrest upon entry into the United States. In order to obtain release, he would have to post a $5000 bond. If he was unable to do so, he would be imprisoned. All of these impediments could be removed, however, if the defendant was fully successful on the merits of his appeal.\n   We are not persuaded by the state's argument that in order to raise the existence of collateral consequences above mere speculation, a deported defendant must affirmatively evince an intent to reenter this country. We have not imposed a similar requirement in any other mootness case, even when a voluntary action by a litigant would expose him or her to the collateral consequences. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McElveen,\n   </em>\n   supra, 261 Conn. at 213,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%2074\">\n    802 A.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (future involvement with criminal justice system);\n   <em>\n    Housing Authority\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lamothe,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757732\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/757/#p765\">\n    225 Conn. at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20367\">\n    627 A.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (application for subsidized housing). To the extent that the Appellate Court cited the defendant's statement during the first hearing on the application for accelerated rehabilitation that he wanted to go to Poland, that statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -a non sequitur-cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean that he had no interest in ever returning to the United States if the legal impediments were removed. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jerzy\n   </em>\n   G., supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20156\">\n    162 Conn.App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   166 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20303\">\n    130 A.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that the defendant resided in the United States for six years, overstaying the term of his six month visitor's visa, and the lack of evidence that he had planned to return to Poland but for his arrest\n   and the disclosure of his immigration status suggest that his desire to return is a reasonable possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The state's argument that we should deem this appeal moot to preserve the status quo because the state has a continued interest in bringing a defendant to trial is confounding. The state posits that \"[i]f this court concludes that the appeal is not moot and that the status quo should not be maintained, such decision could encourage defendants to waive removal and appeal, rely on a successful appeal resulting in a termination of [accelerated rehabilitation], thus avoiding prosecution and thereafter being eligible for reentry having avoided a conviction.\" Putting aside the multiple conditions that would have to be met for such circumstances to arise, there is a fundamental flaw in this reasoning. If a defendant has successfully completed accelerated rehabilitation, he or she is statutorily entitled to dismissal of the criminal charge. Thus, the state's real concern is whether it is proper to conclude that the defendant has successfully completed accelerated rehabilitation when he has been deported prior to the termination of the period of supervision under the circumstances presented. By allowing the appeal to proceed on the merits, the state will have the opportunity to make its case on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, we note that, although the defendant is\n   <em>\n    legally\n   </em>\n   entitled to a presumption of innocence on the pending criminal charge, his reputation is subject to the stain associated with an arrest for probable cause of having committed a sexual assault in the court of public opinion, should the pending charge come to light. Thus, if the defendant's appeal is deemed to be moot, he will have been deprived of the only avenue to remove that stain. See\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ragaglia,\n   </em>\n   supra, 261 Conn. at 233,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=802%20A.2d%20778\">\n    802 A.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[i]n recognition of the importance of one's good name, this court has determined, when addressing collateral consequences, that an action that stains\n   one's reputation\n   is an injury that the court can consider in determining whether it may grant practical relief\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the present case is controlled by our traditional collateral consequences standard.

Moreover, there is no way of knowing whether, if the status quo is maintained and the arrest warrant for the defendant on the charge of sexual assault in the fourth degree remains in effect, the defendant would be barred from reentering the country on that ground, particularly when the defendant would be able to explain that he was granted accelerated rehabilitation on the charge, but was terminated from the program only because he was deported. Thus, any injury to the defendant as the result of the trial court's ruling is purely speculative. Accordingly, I would conclude that the defendant's appeal is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I recognize that, because I would conclude that the defendant's appeal is moot, and because the parties have not briefed the merits of the defendant's appeal to the Appellate Court in their briefs to this court, there is no need for me to address\n   the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to observe that, in my view, the trial court acted well within its discretion when it terminated the program of accelerated rehabilitation and ordered the defendant to be rearrested.

It was perfectly reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the defendant's deportation from this country as the result of his voluntary conduct in overstaying his visa in violation of federal law did not provide a valid excuse for his failure to comply with the conditions of the program of rehabilitation and, therefore, did not warrant either the dismissal of the charges against him based on the fiction that he successfully completed the program or an indefinite continuance of the case on the speculative assumption that he may attempt to return to this country. \"The defendant has cited no authority for the proposition that the accelerated rehabilitation program gives criminal defendants the authority to frame the conditions with which they are prepared to comply in order to demonstrate their rehabilitation. To the contrary, the law is clear that the only choice that the statute gives such defendants is to accept and to abide by the conditions set by the court, or to reject the conditions and to face further criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Callahan,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 613,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%20513\">\n    949 A.2d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although it is conceivable that this principle might not apply when a defendant is prevented by circumstances entirely beyond his control, such as a serious injury or illness, from complying with the conditions of a program of accelerated rehabilitation, that is not the case here. In my view, when the defendant chose to stay in this country illegally, he assumed the risk of the adverse consequences of that decision, including the risk that his deportation would deprive him of statutory benefits, such as participation in a program of accelerated rehabilitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e, for which he might otherwise be eligible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   this regard, I\n   would note that accelerated rehabilitation is not a right, but is purely a matter of judicial discretion.
