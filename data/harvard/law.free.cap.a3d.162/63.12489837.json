Toro, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59(a)(1) and 53a-49(a)(1), and breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his uncharged misconduct. The defendant, however, has not included an analysis in his main appellate brief pertaining to how this allegedly improper ruling was harmful. Consequently, we conclude that the defendant's claim is inadequately briefed and, therefore, unreviewable. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history inform our review. In February, 2013, the victim, Wilfredo Rivera, had been dating his girlfriend, Luz Torres, for approximately four years. Prior to their relationship, Torres had been involved with another individual, who had been a friend of the defendant. When that relationship ended, the defendant sought to date Torres, but she was not interested. Instead, she began dating the victim, which upset the defendant. The defendant then\n   began threatening the victim and Torres, telling them that he would kill them if they did not end their relationship. These threats soon escalated to physical violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 4, 2013, at approximately 8:15 a.m., the victim took his dog for a walk on the sidewalk outside of his Waterbury apartment. As the dog made its way to some bushes on the side of a building, the victim let go of its leash but followed the dog into the bushes. As the victim exited the bushes, he saw the defendant standing on the sidewalk holding a machete in his hands. The victim grabbed his dog and started running back toward his apartment. The defendant chased the victim, repeatedly saying that he was going to kill him. The victim was yelling as the defendant chased him, which caused Torres to look out of the window of the victim's apartment. Torres observed the victim running while being chased by another person, but she could not see the face of the other person. A neighbor, Roberto Millan, also heard yelling, and, when he looked out of his window, he saw the victim and a man with a machete engaged in a confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the chase, the victim fell to the ground. The defendant then swung the machete at him and hit him on the back of his leg. The victim was able to block the blow substantially by using a metal flashlight he had been carrying. As a result, the victim sustained only a minor injury to his leg. After taking the hit, the victim\n   managed to get on his feet, and he ran behind a vehicle. At that point, the defendant left the scene. The victim returned to his apartment and told Torres what had happened, and she telephoned police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested on several charges, and, following a jury trial, the jury found him guilty of attempt to commit assault in the first degree and breach of the peace in the second degree. See footnote 1 of this opinion. The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twelve years incarceration, execution suspended after seven years, five years of which were mandatory, followed by three years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary in consideration of the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of uncharged misconduct. Specifically, he asserts that the court erred in admitting the uncharged misconduct evidence that, on February 3, 2013, the day before the attack on the victim that is the subject of this appeal, the defendant had chased the victim with a knife and threatened to kill him. The defendant argues that this evidence was unduly prejudicial and that the court should have excluded it. He fails to argue in his main brief to this court, however, that the trial court's erroneous admission of this evidence was harmful error. Thus, because the defendant has failed to brief adequately how he was harmed by this allegedly improper evidentiary ruling, we decline to review the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant. Prior to trial, the state filed two notices of intent to admit uncharged misconduct. The defendant does not challenge on appeal the court's admission of various\n   uncharged misconduct evidence offered by the state in its first notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the second notice, which is the subject of this appeal, the state sought \"to introduce testimony from [the victim] that, on February 3, 2013, the defendant came at [the victim] with a knife threatening to kill him.\" In response to the two notices, the defendant filed a motion in limine asking the court to preclude the state from eliciting any testimony, or offering any evidence, as to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   uncharged misconduct on the part of the defendant, including the February 3, 2013 incident. The court denied the motion in limine, thereby permitting the state to offer evidence of the defendant's prior misconduct. At trial, the state elicited the details of the February 3, 2013 incident during its direct examination of the victim, and it relied on such testimony in its closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the evidence from the February 3, 2013 incident should not have been admitted because it was unduly prejudicial. He contends that the evidence of the February 3, 2013 incident \"made the defendant appear as a knife wielding criminal, actively attempting to stab [the victim] the day before the operative crime,\" and that it, therefore, was unduly prejudicial. Moreover, according to the defendant, the evidence of such uncharged misconduct was particularly prejudicial because the charged conduct did not \"far outweigh, in terms of severity, the character of the uncharged misconduct ....\" In his main brief, however, the defendant did not present any argument on how the court's alleged improper admission of this evidence constituted harmful error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state responds that we should not review the defendant's claim because it is inadequately briefed. Specifically, the state contends that because the defendant fails to allege in his main brief what harm he suffered, even if the court had abused its discretion by admitting this evidence, he has abandoned his claim by not adequately briefing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his reply brief, the defendant presents his harmful error analysis for the first time. He also contends in his reply brief that he had addressed the issue of harm adequately in his main brief. In particular, he argues that his discussion of the court's improper admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence focused on his contention that the evidence's probative value did not outweigh its prejudicial effect. Therefore, according to the defendant, his argument regarding the evidence's prejudicial effect was the equivalent of an argument on harmful error. We agree with the state that the defendant failed to brief the issue of harm adequately and, therefore, has abandoned this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Evidence of a defendant's uncharged misconduct is inadmissible to prove that the defendant committed the charged crime or to show the predisposition of the defendant to commit the charged crime. ...

The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-206(a), and the court declared a mistrial on that count.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Pursuant to the first notice, the state presented evidence at trial that, (1) prior to February 4, 2013, the defendant repeatedly harassed the defendant and Torres with numerous calls and text messages threatening to hurt or kill them, and (2) after the incident in question, he knocked on the window of the victim's apartment with a cane, frightening Torres.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The state also argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence because it was not unduly prejudicial and, furthermore, it was not harmful error for the court to admit it. Because we conclude that the defendant's claim is unreviewable, we do not address this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
