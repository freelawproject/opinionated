Gupton and Roberta S. Douglas, in connection with their purchase of property located in the town of Sherman. The dispositive claim in this appeal is whether the court improperly dismissed this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to his lack of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On February 6, 2015, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that in January, 2012, the defendants illegally purchased property located at 138 Rt. 37 South in Sherman (premises) \"without the owners' knowledge and for a fraction of its real value.\" In paragraph three of his complaint, he alleged that in October, 2007, he transferred his interest in the premises to his three children by means of a trust instrument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his prayer\n   for relief, the plaintiff requested the sum of $3,000,000 to compensate him for the \"agony he has suffered as a result of the defendants' fraud-cruel and illegal dealings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 13, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action and an accompanying memorandum of law on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the defendants argued that the plaintiff, as a\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   owner of the premises, lacked standing to prosecute a claim that he was defrauded as the rightful owner of the property. On April 9, 2015, the plaintiff, by means of a single filing, objected to the motion to dismiss and moved for summary judgment in his favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court heard argument on the defendants' motion to dismiss on April 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its decision granting the motion to dismiss, the court found in relevant part: \"In this action, the plaintiff\n   ... claims compensatory damages for fraudulent actions allegedly committed by the defendants when they purchased [the premises].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claims that in January of 2012, the defendants illegally purchased the premises 'without the owner's knowledge and for a fraction of its real value.' The defendants argue in support of their motion that it is undisputed (and admitted in the plaintiff's complaint) that he no longer owns any interest in the premises and, therefore, has no standing to bring the present suit. In response to the defendants' motion to dismiss, the plaintiff has filed a combined objection to the motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... essentially asserting that the manner in which the defendants came into ownership of the premises was tainted by illegality....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"After reviewing the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint and the briefs of the parties, the court is satisfied and agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to invoke the court's jurisdiction. The record indicates that the plaintiff is not the current owner of the premises which are the subject of this action, had no interest in the premises at the time of conveyance to the defendants, or any\n   time thereafter, and has not owned any interest in the premises since October of 2007.\" (Footnotes added.)\n   The court rendered a judgment of dismissal on May 12, 2016, after concluding that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring this action because he was not the owner of the premises and, therefore, was not an aggrieved party with respect to the subject matter of his complaint. On May 27, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for clarification, articulation, and reargument, which the court denied on June 1, 2015. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before we address the merits of the plaintiff's claim, we first set forth the standard of review. \"The proper procedural vehicle for disputing a party's standing is a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    D'Eramo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708636\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/610/\">\n    273 Conn. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20A.2d%20408\">\n    872 A.2d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). \"A motion to dismiss ... properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Caruso\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958121\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/618/#p627\">\n    285 Conn. 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20266\">\n    941 A.2d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). \"[O]ur review of the trial court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [granting] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo....

Because standing implicates the court's subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing standing. A trial court's determination of whether a plaintiff lacks standing is a conclusion of law that is subject to plenary review on appeal. We conduct that plenary review, however, in light of the trial court's findings of fact, which we will not overturn unless they are clearly erroneous.... In undertaking this review, we are mindful of the well established notion that, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.... This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court's decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or\n   whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\" (Citations\n   omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Success, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20153\">\n    160 Conn.App. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 162-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20A.3d%20563\">\n    124 A.3d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20952\">\n    319 Conn. 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20A.3d%20531\">\n    125 A.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Standing is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring suit or is classically aggrieved....

Although the plaintiff challenges the legality of the sale of the premises to the defendants, it is undisputed factually that he relinquished any interest, whether legal or equitable in nature, to the premises when he transferred his interest to the trust he created for the benefit of his children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After thoroughly reviewing the record, we agree with the court that the plaintiff, in his individual capacity, was not entitled to set the machinery of the court in operation to obtain redress for an injury he claims to have suffered as a result of an alleged fraudulent transfer of the premises. The plaintiff did not hold an\n   ownership interest, whether legal or equitable in nature, in the premises at the time he filed the complaint-and indeed had held no such interest since 2007. The sale occurred in 2012. An \"owner\" is \"[o]ne who has the right to possess, use, and convey something; a person in whom one or more interests are vested,\" and \"ownership\" means \"[t]he bundle of rights allowing one to use, manage, and enjoy property, including the right to convey it to others.\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th Ed.\n   2009). If the plaintiff intended to assert a claim to protect an allegedly fraudulent deprivation of the interest of the children's trust in the premises, such a claim, if viable, should have been brought by the trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The trustee is the proper person to bring an action against anyone who wrongfully interferes with the interests of a trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Naier\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beckenstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263497\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/131/638/#p646\">\n    131 Conn.App. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20A.3d%20104\">\n    27 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175177,12175159\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/910/\">\n    303 Conn. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20A.3d%20963\">\n    32 A.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).
