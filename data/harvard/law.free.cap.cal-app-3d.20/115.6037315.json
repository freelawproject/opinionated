Code, \u00a7 3201 et seq.); appellant Miller is the chairman of the Police and Fire Co-ordinating Council, an unincorporated association composed of delegates from a number of other unincorporated associations that include in their membership almost all uniformed members of the police and fire departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The fourth cause of action of the petition alleged that the City was deducting the total amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, including attorneys\u2019 fees, from the pension benefits, prayed for a writ of mandate directing the City to pay pension and disability benefits without any deduction or offset, and requested declaratory relief establishing that appellants were entitled to their pension and disability benefits without deduction. Appellants point out that where the entire amount of the WCAB award, including attorneys\u2019 fees, are offset from the disability retirement allowance, the individual is out of pocket the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Initially, we note that the Charter of the City of Oakland provides for a \u201cPolice and Fire Retirement System\u201d and that the retirement provisions of the charter constitute a part of the contract of employment between the City of Oakland and its policemen and firemen <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., </em>259 Cal.App.2d 163, 165-166 [66 Cal.Rptr. 283]; see <em>City etc. of S.F. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., </em>267 Cal.App.2d 771 [73 Cal.Rptr. 429]; <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Board of Police etc. Commrs., </em>86 Cal.App.2d 714, 716 [196 P.2d 94]).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The pertinent provisions of section 249(2) of the charter are set forth in the footnote below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>first paragraph prohibiting the cumulation of benefits and the emphasis on \u201cpaid\u201d and \u201creceived\u201d in the subdivisions creates an ambiguity that must be liberally construed in their favor to prohibit any setoff or deduction that includes the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees. They argue that in the absence of a specific provision like subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 249(2) permitting the offset of certain amounts, no deduction for attorneys\u2019 fees is permissible and that their employer, the City, should bear the cost of their attorneys\u2019 fees in matters they take to the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We are impressed by the reasoning of the trial court in its excellent memorandum opinion. Labor Code section 4903 (set forth in the footnote below)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for certain liens against any sum ordered paid as compensation by the WCAB. The statute was enacted in its present form, essentially, in 1937, and was based on earlier law without substantial change. In addition to attorneys\u2019 fees, the section provides that the WCAB may \u201cdetermine, and allow as liens against any sum to be paid as compensation\u201d various other expenses and obligations incurred by or on behalf of the injured employee. If only the net amount \u201creceived\u201d by the employee may be considered in deducting the award from pension payments, appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>reasoning would exclude not only liens for attorneys\u2019 fees but also all other categories of liens permitted in subdivisions (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of section 4903. In our opinion, no such result was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Labor Code section 4903 was a part of the law in 1951 when section 249(2) of the charter was enacted. If there is any conflict between the charter and the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code, the latter must prevail <em>(Healy </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>41 Cal.2d 118, 122 [258 P.2d 1]). Reading the charter provision in this context, no ambiguity appears to make the principles of <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Hoover, </em>41 Cal.2d 145 [258 P.2d 4], or of <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Brizee, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 97 [65 Cal.Rptr. 493], applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">This conclusion is supported by the recent decision of this court (Division One) in <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., </em>259 Cal.App.2d 163 [66 Cal.Rptr. 283], where the widow of a fireman argued that since section 249(2) of the charter did not spell out a procedure for offsetting previously paid disability allowances against a WCAB award, no such credit was legally allowable. In rejecting this argument, the court said at page 166: \u201cSuch a charter provision preventing an employee\u2019s \u2018double recovery\u2019 of indemnity for an industrial disability is legally proper. It has been repeatedly held that a city may protect itself against paying twice (through the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of. the Labor Code and its own retirement system) for the same industrial disability. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We conclude that the court below properly held that the full amount of the WCAB award, including any attorneys\u2019 fees allowed, may legally be credited and offset against a disability retirement or death allowance granted to the same individual for the same injury, illness or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Shoemaker, P. J., and Kane, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 18, 1971.
