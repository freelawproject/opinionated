Pursuant to the terms of his will, the executor of which was the Bank of America (Bank), the final decree of distribution filed November 12, 1957, provided for distribution of all of the estate and all unknown, undiscovered, or unmentioned property in equal shares to his brother Michael and to the State of California (State) in trust for his sister Cecelia, whose whereabouts were unknown. The distribution of Cecelia\u2019s interest to State was pursuant to Probate Code sections 1027-1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Ernest J. Hill (Hill) later learned that Cecelia, a nonresident alien, had died intestate on December 31, 1955. As attorney in fact for her heirs, Hill filed a petition on February 20', 1961 in San Francisco Superior Court to recover the property distributed to State. The petition was granted, without opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">On June 15, 1964, $44,750 in currency together with assorted watches and rings were discovered in the presence of Joseph La Malfa (La Malfa) and William H. Stockley (Stockley) on real property formerly owned by Wert.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">The legal procedures utilized by the various interested parties may be summarized as follows: La Malfa filed an affidavit in the local justice court describing the property and the location of discovery. Bank, as Wert\u2019s executor, filed a complaint against La Malfa seeking to recover the property as belonging to Wert\u2019s estate. Stockley filed a complaint in intervention against Bank and La Malfa, claiming to be a co-finder of the property. Michael\u2019s guardian then filed a complaint in intervention against Bank, La Malfa and Stockley, seeking recovery of one-half of the property as Wert\u2019s heir. Finally, Hill, as attorney in fact for Cecelia\u2019s heirs, and the heirs themselves, filed a complaint in a separate action against La Malfa and Stockley, seeking recovery of one-half of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Nonjury trial of the consolidated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> actions resulted in a judgment denying recovery of any property by Bank, Stockley, Hill or Cecelia\u2019s heirs, and granting recovery of equal portions of the property by Michael\u2019s guardian and La Malfa, who also recovered $7,458 from Michael\u2019s guardian for services and expenses in preserving his interest. We must consider two appeals\u2014one by Bank and Hill jointly, and one by Stockley.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\n<em>The Bank-Hill Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The trial court found that the currency and jewelry constituted lost property of Wert and that the owners were Michael and State pursuant to the decree of final distribution. Although a timely claim was filed on behalf of Michael for- one-half in the manner provided by Civil Code sections 1864 et seq. and 2080 et seq., the court found that such had not been filed by Hill, as attorney in fact for Cecelia\u2019s heirs, nor did the heirs'themselves under either Code of Civil Procedure sections 1300-1615 or Probate Code sections 1026-1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Hill contends that the 1961 petition filed on behalf of Cecelia\u2019s nonresident alien heirs constitutes compliance with Probate Code section 1026.i<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">This contention is meritorious and requires a reversal of that portion of the judgment denying recovery to Hill. Bank concedes in its brief that this result renders its appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Although the unusual factual situation has given rise to ostensibly complicated issues, the controlling one is simply whether or not the heirs of Cecelia \u201cappeared and demanded\u201d the property in compliance with Probate Code section 1026.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The California Supreme Court has recently confirmed the rule that \u201cThere is no prescribed procedure for \u2018appearing and demanding\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Horman </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 62, 72 [95 Cal.Rptr. 433, 485 P.2d 785]). The record here reveals that for some considerable time prior to actually filing a \u201cPetition By Heirs to Recover Property,\u201d Hill, as attorney in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>for Cecelia\u2019s heirs, had substantial contact with the Attorney General\u2019s office. It is significant to note that the State entered no opposition to Hill\u2019s petition which was obviously filed more than five years after the \u201ctime of succession\u201d which as used in Probate Code section 1026 means \u201cdate of death.\u201d <em>(Estate of Horman, supra, </em>at p. 68.) The only reasonable inference to be drawn therefrom is that the State, which is the only party upon whom any rights are conferred by the escheat statute (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1026; <em>Estate of Ronkendorf </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 145 [324 P.2d 941]), recognized Hill\u2019s contact as sufficient \u201cappearance and demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">It is manifestly clear that the precise property in question could not have been described in either the petition or the ensuing judgment since its existence was not discovered until almost three yeans later. However, the petition incorporated by reference the decree of distribution which by its terms distributed described assets \u201cas well as all other property not now known or discovered. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Thus, one-half of any residual property was distributed to the State in trust for Cecelia (or her heirs). La Malfa\u2019s contention that since the judgment in the San Francisco escheat action was specific, i.e., did not refer to after-discovered property, it cannot extend to such property is unsound. The judgment did, in fact, include a finding that all of the allegations of the petition were true. It is implicit in the claim as contained in the petition that Hill, on behalf of Cecelia\u2019s heirs, was claiming one-half of Wert\u2019s estate. To uphold La Malfa\u2019s contention would be to require clairvoyance on the part of Probate Code section 1026 claimants with respect to after-discovered property. Clearly, such a requirement was never contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>The Stockley Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The trial court found that Stockley was not a co-finder of the property and that no agreement was made between Stockley and La Malfa concerning ownership of any interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The evidence on these issues, while sharply in conflict, is clearly sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s determination. This conclusion terminates any further appellate consideration of Stockley\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The judgment in favor of La Malfa and against Hill (action No. 26597) is reversed with directions that upon presentation of proof of the appropriate heirs judgment be entered entitling said heirs to one-half of the property in question, plus accrued interest, less the sum of $1,491.84 to be paid to the County of Mendocino and less whatever additional sum may be determined by the trial court to be due La Malfa for saving and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>caring for the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judgment in favor of La Malfa and against Stockley (action No. 26354) is affirmed. The appeal by Bank, having become moot, is dismissed. Each party is to bear his own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Shoemaker, P. J., and Taylor, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 22, 1971, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Both actions and all complaints were eventually consolidated, including the subsequent complaint in intervention filed by the County of Mendocino seeking recovery of taxes on the found property. The disposition of the county\u2019s suit is not raised as an issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Michael was also an heir of Cecelia; but since he was not a nonresident alien, his rights are governed by Probate Code section 1027; and he did present a claim. Furthermore, Michael was specifically named in the 1961 petition filed by Hill and received his share of Cecelia\u2019s estate by the judgment which ensued. This clearly amounts to \u201cappearing and demanding\u201d as required by Probate Code sections 1026-1027. <em>(Estate of Horman </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 62, 72 [95 Cal.Rptr. 433, 485 P.2d 785].) Additionally that judgment which became final long before the present cases arose, conclusively determined the authority of Hill to act on behalf of Cecelia\u2019s heirs, including Michael. It follows that the trial court\u2019s contrary finding (Finding of Fact XVI) is not supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Probate Code section 1026: \u201cA nonresident alien who becomes entitled to prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>erty by succession must appear and demand the property within five years from the time of succession; otherwise, his rights are barred and the property shall be disposed of as escheated property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Hill/Bank contend that no additional amount should be awarded to La Malfa, who responds that the matter should be determined by the trial court. Clearly a portion of- the amount awarded against Michael\u2019s guardian covered expenses and services performed with respect to the heirs\u2019 portion of the property, but the judgment granting said award has not been appealed on behalf of Michael.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
