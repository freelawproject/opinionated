The superior court entered its order dissolving attachment on the authority of <em>Randone </em>v. <em>Appellate Department, </em>5 Cal.3d 536 [96 Cal.Rptr. 709, 488 P.2d 13]. Petitioners contend that; (1) <em>Ran-done </em>is not to be applied retroactively to permit the dissolution of writs of attachment levied prior to the date of that decision; and (2) in any event the facts of the case at bench bring it within a situation in which <em>Randone </em>declares attachment to be constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">We conclude that petitioners\u2019 contentions are without merit. Attachment is purely a creature of statute. (2 Witkin\u00a1 Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Provisional Remedies, \u00a7 120 and cases there cited.) In <em>Randone </em>v. <em>Appellate Department, supra, </em>our Supreme Court held that Code of Civil Procedure section 537, subdivision 1, the California statute authorizing prejudgment attachment is unconstitutional. (5 Cal.3d 536, 541.) It states (5 Cal.3d 536, 564) \u201cCalifornia\u2019s attachment statute violates . . . procedural due process ... by sanctioning in substantially all contract actions attachment of a debtor\u2019s property, without notice and hearing. Nor is the overbroad statute narrowly drawn to confine attachments to extraordinary circumstances which require special protection to a state or creditor interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that the rule of <em>Random </em>should not be applied to authorize a court to grant a motion to dissolve .a writ of attachment levied prior to the date of that decision ignores the nature of the motion to dissolve. That motion does not necessarily test the validity of the writ of attachment when levied. Rather it determines whether the writ should be continued. Since in the case at bench no constitutional statute authorized attachment at the time the trial court heard the motion to dissolve, its action in granting the motion was the proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that the special facts of this case distinguish it from those situations in which California\u2019s attachment statute is held to be a denial of due process is not persuasive. Our Supreme Court states in <em>Random, supra, 5 </em>Cal.3d 536, 563, \u201cWe recognize, of course, that not all attachments under the present subdivision involve deprivation of such magnitude [as those involved in <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337 (23 L.Ed.2d 349, 89 S.Ct. 1820)]. We do not doubt that a constitutionally valid prejudgment attachment statute,.which exempts \u2018necessities\u2019 from its operation, can be drafted by the Legislature to permit attachment generally after notice and a hearing on the probable validity of a creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d That language of our Supreme Court does not say that California\u2019s existing prejudgment attachment statute is valid in part nor does it purport to limit other language of the court in <em>Randone </em>declaring the statute to be unconstitutional. Since the validity of an attachment depends upon its conformity to a valid statute, the attachment here must be dissolved in the absence of such a statute despite the fact that it might conceivably be authorized by an as yet unadopted law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The petition for alternative and peremptory writs of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Wood, P. J., and Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
