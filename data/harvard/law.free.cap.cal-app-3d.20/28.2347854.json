Thernia heating and cooling blankets and mattresses (including its component parts) by defendant Rupp and others. The first amended complaint alleges four causes of action, including breach of warranty of merchantability and strict liability, as well as negligence. Our analysis applies equally to the various causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">On April 16, 1971, Rupp served on The Regents certain interrogatories, to which The Regents objected. On May 27, Rupp sought to compel The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Regents to answer the interrogatories. The trial court denied the motion to compel answers, and this petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Rupp contends that it is in the position of \u201cadverse party\u201d to The Regents and therefore is entitled to have the interrogatories answered under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030. The Regents refused to answer on the sole ground that they were not an \u201cadverse party\u201d within the meaning of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We have been unable to find any California appellate court decision construing the term \u201cadverse party\u201d contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 2030. Since this is then a case of first impression, we resort to federal decisions concerning rule 33 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, upon which section 2030 is based, for their persuasive value. (See <em>Trade Center Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>185 Cal.App.2d 409, 411-412 [8 Cal.Rptr. 345].) We note that the enactment of the Discovery Act (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2016-2035) was proposed to the Legislature as an adaptation by this state of the federal rules of procedure relative to discovery and with the express purpose of broadening discovery proceedings in California so that they would be comparable with those in the federal courts. (Report of the Committee on Administration of Justice, 31 State Bar J. 204-231.) These statutes are, in substance, counterparts of the federal rules as they existed when the Discovery Act was enacted in 1957. The Legislature must have intended that they should have the same meaning, force, and effect as given to the federal rules<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by the federal courts. <em>(Crummer </em>v. <em>Beeler, </em>185 Cal.App.2d 851, 858 [8 Cal.Rptr. 698].) In conjunction with the aforementioned criteria is the established rule that the Discovery Act is to be liberally construed. <em>(Carlson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>56 Cal.2d 431, 437 [15 Cal.Rptr. 132, 364 P.2d 308]; <em>Greyhound Corporation </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>56 Cal.2d 355, <em>377 </em>[15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266]; <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 757, 782 [66 Cal.Rptr. 776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u201cAdverse party\u201d has been construed in 2 De Meo, California Deposition &amp; Discovery Practice, section 9.07: \u201cWhether parties are or are not \u2018adverse\u2019 can generally be determined by the role in which a party is cast in the pleading (or pleadings) setting forth the claim(s) or defense(s), although where this alignment does not reveal the true adversity of the parties the realities of the litigation should control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The federal cases interpreting rule 33 (prior to the 1970 deletion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>adverse-party requirement), upon which section 2030 is based and from which Mr. De Meo derived his interpretation, are listed in 4 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (2d ed.), section 33.06, footnote 20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">The approach by the court in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Schuldt </em>(E.D.La. 1967) 42 F.R.D. 390 [11 Fed. Rules Serv.2d 33.21, Case 1],<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> footnote 2, appeals to us as one which is well reasoned on this issue. There, the court stated (at p. 393): \u201cThe judicial definition of \u2018adverse\u2019 parties is those parties who are on opposite sides of an issue raised by the pleadings or otherwise presented by the record. [Citations.] This serves well as a general principle. But it requires explanation, which has not been forthcoming, for proper application to specific situations. In determining \u2018adversity,\u2019 the focus is on issues, and not interests. Conflicting interests, without more, do not constitute \u2018adversity.\u2019 To be \u2018adverse\u2019 the parties must oppose each other on an issue in the case. \u2018Adversity\u2019 does not mean that one party <em>must </em>be seeking a judgment or recovery against the other party. But it does mean that one party strives to win a point at issue at the expense of the other. When two parties are contesting an issue, and the outcome of the litigation will be, or may be, different as to either party due to the determination of that issue, then they are \u2018adverse\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 33.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">As petitioner states, the plaintiff in his complaint raises the issue of responsibility for his alleged injuries. Each codefendant seeks to disclaim any responsibility for the alleged injuries, and argues that if there is responsibility for the alleged injuries it is due to the failure of the other. Certainly, there exists that relationship which suggests a conflict of interest. Petitioner has a vital interest in not relying solely on its lack of negligence or other avoidance of liability. Petitioner seeks to meet plaintiff\u2019s claim by showing the liability, if any, is that of another defendant. This clearly falls within the rationale of <em>Carey, </em>that an \u201cadverse\u201d party includes one who* may likely strive to win a point at issue at the expense of the other. From the facts here, it is apparent that the petitioner and The Regents are indeed in an \u201cadverse\u201d relationship as to some of the major issues in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Let the peremptory writ of mandate issue, requiring the respondent court to set aside its order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to compel answers by co-defendant-and-real-party-in-interest The Regents of the University of Cali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>fomia to petitioner\u2019s \u201cThird Set of Interrogatories,\u201d and requiring the respondent court to grant said motion and overrule the objections thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Kaus, P. J., and Aiso, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-12\">Other named defendants are V. Muller &amp; Company, a corporation, V. Muller &amp; Company, a copartnership, V. Muller, individually and doing business as V. Muller &amp; Company, and Does I through XL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 2030 was the same as Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 33 prior to rule 33\u2019s change in 1970. In that year, the rule was changed to delete the requirement that written interrogatories are to be served on adverse parties only. They now may be served on any party. Our Legislature has not yet adopted this progressive step.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The cases are: <em>Anuszewski </em>v. <em>Toepfer </em>(D.Md. 1970) 48 F.R.D. 433 [13 Fed.
