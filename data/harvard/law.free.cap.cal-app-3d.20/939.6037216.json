Farmers and Merchants filed an action for declaratory relief naming Bank of America in the complaint\u2019s first count and Peerless Insurance Company, its bonding company, in the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The Bank of America appealed from the judgment against it, and Farmers and Merchants filed a protective cross-appeal against Peerless Insurance Company (hereinafter called Peerless) to provide for the possibility that the appellate court might reverse the judgment against Bank of America. Peerless is a corporation which undertook to hold Farmers and Merchants harmless in an amount not exceeding $1,000,000 for loss of property through larceny, theft or false pretenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">This litigation arose as a result of a check kiting scheme perpetrated against both the Bank of America and Farmers and Merchants by Luther Hester. Upon discovery of the scheme, the Bank of America attempted to dishonor 11 checks totaling $72,562.32, while Farmers and Merchants returned 5 checks totaling $26,392.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>The parties below stipulated that Farmers and Merchants suffered a loss of $15,358.09 when the checks introduced into evidence as Exhibits A-F were charged against Hester\u2019s account with Farmers and Merchants after Bank of America refused return of the checks. (The total of checks A-F was $27,016.90, but the final overdraft with Farmers and Merchants amounted to a loss of $15,358.09.) Farmers and Merchants suffered a further loss of $20,536.42 when checks drawn on Hester\u2019s account with Bank of America (Exhibits 1-4) were returned, dishonored, to Farmers and Merchants by Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Eleven checks (Exhibits 1-11) had been delivered by Farmers and Merchants to a Bank of America messenger who delivered the checks to the Bank of America\u2019s Southwest Erma Computer where the checks were sorted out. These checks were then sent to the Montebello computer where most of the branches\u2019 bookkeeping services were performed. The Montebello computer did such things as: place the checks in numerical sequence according to the depositor\u2019s account number; match the balance against the amount of the check; reject the check if the amount was more than the balance; deduct the check from the balance if the amount was sufficient; automatically prevent processing of a check where there was a stop payment; print the status of accounts and perform other bookkeeping functions that used to be performed at the branch. The checks were later sent to Bank of America\u2019s Harbor-Orangewood branch, where Hester maintained an account.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The court found that Bank of America failed to dishonor checks, represented as Exhibits 1-4, in the sum of $20,536.42, within the time allowed by law. The court also found that Bank of America did not timely dishonor two checks that were Exhibits 8 and 9, totaling $10,686.58. The court also found that checks drawn on Farmers and Merchants, and introduced into evidence as Exhibits A through F, were not dishonored by Farmers and Merchants within the time allowed by law. The court ordered judgment against Peerless for $4,671.51, and interest, which was the difference between the stipulated loss of Farmers and Merchants in the total sum of $35,894.51, and the amount of $31,223, plus interest, which Farmers and Merchants was entitled to recover from Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The central issue before the court below was whether both the Bank of America and Farmers and Merchants were barred from returning their respective sets of checks to each other because each of them held the checks beyond the time limits prescribed by section 1013 of the Finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>cial Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to decide the correctness of the court\u2019s holding it becomes necessary to determine whether the time set forth under section 1013 begins to run when the checks were delivered to Bank of America\u2019s Montebello computer center (as held by the court below), or whether the statutory time begins to run after their arrival at the Harbor-Orangewood branch, as appellant, Bank of America, urges upon us. Assuming that receipt of the checks by the Montebello computer center was receipt by the drawee branch within the meaning of section 1013, then the trial court correctly found that Exhibits 1-4 and 8 and 9 were not dishonored in time, since these checks were returned after midnight of the next business day after receipt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Bank of America argues that the Harbor-Orangewood branch is a separate bank under section 1012 and section 1018 of the Financial Code, and that time should run from receipt at that office and not from receipt at the Montebello computer. Section 1012 of the Financial Code provides in part: \u201c. . . (c) each branch or office of a bank shall be deemed a separate bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Section 1018 of the Financial Code, as in effect at the time of the transaction involved, provides in part: \u201cAn item . . . received for . . . collection ... at any other office of the same bank, shall be deemed for all the purposes of this article as . . . payable at another bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The fact that the Harbor-Orangewood branch is a \u201cbranch or office\u201d and therefore a \u201cseparate bank\u201d within the meaning of the above code section, in no way negates the fact that the Montebello computer center is part of that branch for purposes of section 1013. The testimony set forth in the facts clearly shows that the Montebello computer center mainly performed the Harbor-Orangewood branch\u2019s bookkeeping functions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>those acts that were performed by the computer were not performed in the Harbor-Orangewood office. Prior to the formation of the Montebello computer center, the acts being performed by the Montebello computer were performed manually by employees at the Harbor-Orangewood branch. All these facts tend to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the Montebello computer was part of the Harbor-Orangewood branch within the meaning of former section 1013 of the Financial Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Statutes in other states similar to Financial Code section 1013 have been strictly construed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as to the time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Since the Bank of America failed to return checks 1-4, 8 and 9, and A through F before midnight of the next business day after receipt by the Montebello computer center, those checks were returned beyond the time limit of section 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The Bank of America argues that the evidence does not support a judgment as to exhibits 8 and 9 because, by stipulation of the parties, exhibits 8 and 9 (totaling $10,686.58) should not have been considered in arriving at the total for which the Bank of America was to be held liable to Farmers and Merchants. It is apparent that this is correct. Under the stipulation, only Exhibits 1-4, totaling $20,536.42, were to be considered in connection with the Bank of America returns. It follows that the judgment against it should, as to those items, have been in that amount and no more. However, the stipulation also provides that the total loss to Farmers and Merchants was $35,894.51. Therefore, the judgment in favor of Farmers and Merchants as against Peerless was less than it should have been; the proper amount of that judgment should have been $15,358.09, plus interest (the amount of the checks drawn on Farmers and Merchants and not returned by it within time).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Bank of America\u2019s final argument is that any judgment for Farmers and Merchants should be entered against Peerless and not Bank of America because Peerless is, in substance, a surety seeking subrogation to the rights of Farmers and Merchants against Bank of America with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>out sustaining the burden of proof which would entitle Peerless to such right of subrogation. Bank of America argues that Peerless, as a compensated surety, has the burden of proof placed upon it before it can shift the loss to the Bank of America. <em>(Patent Scaffolding Co. </em>v. <em>William Simpson Constr. Co. </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 506, 509-510 [64 Cal.Rptr. 187].) The contention is without merit. \"Peerless is not suing Bank of America for subrogation, but is defending itself in a suit brought to determine how much of the loss was incurred by each of the banks under the Financial Code. This case does not involve a shifting of loss to a wrongdoer, but rather a fixing of loss on each bank, and therefore is not a suit for subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">It is true that, by refusing to pay its insured, and inducing the insured to sue the drawee bank directly, Peerless secures an economic position better than if it had paid its insured and then sued as subrogee. But that is not the only situation in which the law restricts a party seeking affirmative relief more severely than it does the same party acting only defensively. We note that, in the case at bench, the ultimate tactical decision, which results in the judgment against Bank of America, was that of Farmers and Merchants and not of Peerless. Farmers and Merchants could have sued Peerless on the bond, without joining or involving Bank of America. By the same token, Farmers and Merchants could have elected to sue the Bank of America, only, in which action the Peerless bond would have been immaterial. We can see no reason why the Bank of America can or should complain of the result herein achieved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The judgment is modified by deleting paragraphs 1 and 2 thereof and substituting the following paragraphs in lieu thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201c1.
