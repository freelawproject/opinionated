(Bank), for damages resulting from an alleged breach of an instrument of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">In 1961, C.G.O. Enterprises, Inc. (CGO) purchased a 60-acre parcel of unimproved, agricultural land located about six miles southwest of Marysville for the purpose of constructing inexpensive single-family residences for personnel at nearby Beale Air Force Base. A tentative map proposing a subdivision containing 298 lots was thereafter filed, and financial commitments were obtained from Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The proposal was later revised to encompass merely a portion of the 60-acre parcel, containing 50 lots and designated Tract 120. County\u2019s Board of Supervisors (Board) approved a final map of Tract 120 and accepted streets and easements offered therein for dedication on August 8, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Later, CGO initiated plans for construction of a similar development on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the remaining portion containing 52 lots and designated Tract 131. On May 6, 1963, pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 11611,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a County ordinance, CGO and County executed a subdivision agreement in which County agreed to approve the final map of Tract 131 and accept lands, rights of way and easements offered therein for dedication on condition that CGO complete required improvement work upon streets and drainage facilities within 12 months and, pursuant to section 11612, file an acceptable instrument securing the faithful performance of the improvement work in the sum of $35,020. An instrument of credit for said sum was executed and filed by Bank, and County\u2019s Board approved a final map of Tract 131 and accepted streets and easements offered therein for dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">At about this time, however, a major program at Beale Air Force Base was discontinued, resulting in considerable reduction of base personnel. Consequently, CGO was unable to sell all houses built in Tract 120 and some loans extended by Bank to CGO respecting Tract 120 were foreclosed. Moreover, CGO was unable to obtain financing for Tract 131, and no construction or development of it was ever begun. At the date of trial, February 1969, Tract 131 remained as unimproved agricultural land.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">As a result of CGO\u2019s failure to commence any improvement work, County demanded payment from Bank of $35,020 pursuant to the instrument of credit executed by Bank on May 6,1963. County\u2019s complaint in the present action followed Bank\u2019s refusal to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\n<em>Trial Court\u2019s Findings and Conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The trial court found in part that all parties contemplated that Tract 131 would be built as a residential subdivision, that construction of streets would serve no useful purpose in the absence of such a subdivision, and that none of the parties intended streets to be constructed except as part of construction of such a subdivision. The court concluded that to require Bank to pay County \u201cwhen no part of the work of improvements\u201d had begun would be to uphold \u201can illegal forfeiture,\u201d that substantial reduction of the value of the Bank\u2019s performance as a result of uncontrollable conditions made the doctrine of \u201c \u2018frustration of purpose\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018commercial frustration\u2019 \u201d applicable, and that an \u201cimplied condition\u201d of the instrument of credit was that Bank\u2019s liability would arise \u201conly if work were actually commenced on Tract 131.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The issue on appeal is whether Bank remains liable to County in the absence of commencement of any development of Tract 131 or any construction of the improvements therein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons we hold that Bank is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">First, the language of the instrument of credit executed by Bank indicates that the parties intended to provide security for full completion of improvements whose construction had already begun. Said document expressly provided a \u201cguarantee\u201d that the sum of $35,020 was on deposit \u201cpledged to meet the performance of completed street improvements\u201d and that \u201cIn the. event the work is not completed\u201d in accordance with the appropriate County ordinance and within the time limits of the subdivision agreement, then Bank would pay said sum \u201cfor the completion of said improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Secondly, to the. extent that these provisions do not clarify whether \u201ccompletion\u201d necessarily presumes! initial commencement of construction, the record contains the uncontradicted testimony of CGO president Ortiz that he communicated his belief to County surveyor Mlcoch that the property would merely revert to acreage under the instrument of credit if construction did not begin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, since the purpose for requiring security for street improvement work is to insure faithful performance of a subdivider\u2019s obligation to place streets in a proper condition for use by the public <em>(Evola </em>v. <em>Wendt Construction Co. </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 21, 25 [338 P.2d 498], cited with approval in <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 334, 336 [22 Cai.Rptr. 366]; <em>City of Buena Park </em>v. <em>Boyar </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 61, 67 [8 Cal.Rptr. 674]), no purpose is served by construing a security instrument to relate to construction of streets where development of neither the subdivision nor the streets has ever commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In this vein it may also be observed that County\u2019s interest in the streets and easements offered for dedication was necessarily limited by the conditional nature of its acceptance thereof, which depended for finality upon a subsequent acceptance after satisfactory completion of the street improvements. <em>(Hoover </em>v. <em>County of Kern </em>(1953) 118 Cal.App.2d 139, 142-143 [257 P.2d 492], cited with approval in <em>County of Kern </em>v. <em>Edgemont Dev. Corp. </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 874, 879 [35 Cal.Rptr. 629].) This fact is demonstrated by the subdivision contract executed by County and CGO.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">That contract contained County\u2019s agreement to approve the final map for Tract 131 and to accept all offers of dedication \u201cin accordance with the conditions hereinafter set forth.\u201d Then followed CGO\u2019s agreement \u201cto complete the work of improvement\u201d required in the subdivision within 12 months and County\u2019s agreement, \u201cUpon satisfactory completion of all improvements\u201d in accordance with local specifications, \u201cto accept for maintenance the work of improvement within the dedicated parcels\u201d and to remedy any defects in construction of the improvements occurring within 12 months \u201cafter acceptance thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Thus, the underlying contract itself demonstrates that the sole basis for the relationship between County, CGO and Bank was the development of Tract 131 as a residential subdivision. All of the parties\u2019 transactions must therefore be construed with reference to\u2019 this basic purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The foregoing shows that the instrument of credit was executed by Bank and County with the expectation that the performance it secured related to improvement work which would at least have commenced. The purpose of the instrument was to insure full completion of streets and drainage facilities in order to protect and serve the public. The existence of this purpose, the inclusion in the instrument of credit of references to \u201ccompleted street improvements\u201d and \u201ccompletion of said improvements,\u201d and the presence of the parties\u2019 one mutual interest in development of a residential subdivision, support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that at least partial improvement of the land and construction of the streets was contemplated as a prerequisite to the emergence of the obligations owed by Bank and CGO to County. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1655, 1656; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1960) Contracts, \u00a7 241, p. 270, and cases cited; <em>Addiego </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 842, 847 [48 Cal.Rptr. 240]; <em>Lozano </em>V. <em>Jollensten </em>(1963) 211 Cal.App.2d 845, 849 [27 Cal.Rptr. 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In addition to the absence of any breach of contract, the record discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>no damage whatsoever to County. We agree with the trial court that to permit recovery in the circumstances of this case would be to uphold an \u201cillegal forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Shoemaker, P. J., and Taylor, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 20, 1971, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 18, 1971.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">All citations to code sections refer to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise designated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">These factors distinguish the present case from others relied upon .by County, including <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Margulis </em>(1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 57, 59 [44 P.2d 608], <em>Morro Palisades Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 397, 401 [340 P.2d 628], and <em>City of Glendale </em>v. <em>Roseglen Constr., Inc. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 777 [89 Cal.Rptr. 219].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\"> Evidence that this interpretation was communicated to Mlcoch prior to execution of the agreement for Tract 131 distinguishes it from testimony considered immaterial in <em>Stewart Title Co. </em>v. <em>Herbert </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 957, 964 [85 Cal.Rptr. 654], cited by County. Additionally, County was authorized under section 11640 to revoke approval of the final subdivision map after two years without construction of the improvements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
