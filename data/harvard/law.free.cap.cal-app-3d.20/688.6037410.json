Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and request for probation were denied, and he was sentenced to state prison with the minimum term specified to be six months (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202b). Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">The errors alleged to have been committed by the trial judge pertain to evidentiary matters and to inadequate instructions of the jury, more specifically, (1) evidence tending to prove Officer Bentley\u2019s bias was improperly excluded, (2) the testimony of witness Hornbeck was not proper rebuttal, (3) the evidence did not establish that Officer Bentley was engaged in the performance of his duties at the time of the alleged battery, (4) the instructions pertaining to battery were inadequate, (5) the court erred in not instructing on the lesser included offense of assault on a police officer in violation of Penal Code sections 240 and 241, and (6) the court erred in not giving the instruction as to the presumption of innocence and the quantum of required proof being that beyond a reasonable doubt in its formal instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">We think it unnecessary to encumber the opinion with a detailed narration of the evidence. Suffice it to state that it was highly in conflict whether defendant was able to ambulate without his crutches and whether he was the one who wielded the crutch which injured Officer Bentley\u2019s hand and damaged his watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Officer Bentley of the Los Angeles Police Department (alleged victim of count I) was \u201cmoonlighting\u201d as a security guard \u201c[bjasically to keep the peace\u201d at a dance held at the San Fernando High School<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on December 12, 1969. He was paid for his services by the school, but was in uniform and armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">His fellow officer, Heider (alleged victim in count II), was at the dance on \u201cspecial assignment at the [high] school as an officer to keep the peace.\u201d He was in mufti, but carried his gun, badge, and police identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">An assistant boys\u2019 vice-principal (hereafter vice-principal) was the school administrative officer in charge of the student activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Several times prior to 11 p.m. defendant had sought to get into the dance, but each time was warned by the vice-principal, Officer Bentley, Officer Heider (who displayed his badge and identification to defendant and apprised defendant that he was a police officer), or by Officer Ontriveros (a third officer in attendance) that since defendant was not a member of the student body he could not be admitted and that he had to leave the premises. Defendant did not comply by staying permanently away.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Officers Bentley and Heider testified that around 11 p.m. defendant and a companion, identified by his jacket as Jerry Amos Otis, and who testified for the defense at the trial, again tried to gain entrance, but were physically removed from the entranceway by the police officers. Thereupon, defendant became angered and propelled a crutch through the glass portion of an entrance door, reamed out the broken aperture, and tried to hit the rebuttal witness, instructor Hornbeck, and the two officers. A piece of the shattering glass lodged in Officer Heider\u2019s eyelid and another caused a slight laceration in the area of his eyes. Medical attention was not required as a cafeteria worker was. able to remove the piece of glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Officer Bentley managed to get the broken door shut and then reached for his baton. It fell to the ground, however, and as he bent down to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>trieve it, something hit his left hand, causing a minor laceration and breaking his wristwatch. At that moment, he saw a crutch \u201cdrop away\u201d and \u201cdefendant . . . holding the crutch.\u201d Officer Heider heard Officer Bentley cry out in pain at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Thereafter, a steel trash can was hurled through the damaged door window. Officer Bentley stated it was defendant who hurled it and that defendant was at that time moving about without his crutches. Both officers testified that defendant appeared able to get about without crutches when enraged, although at other intervals he would rest upon them. Both officers testified to a scuffle that defendant had with a third party outside, during which he did not use crutches while engaging in a wrestling type of tussle.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Defendant, his mother, and his companion, Jerry Amos Otis, testified that defendant was not able to ambulate without crutches that evening. Defendant had suffered a broken leg in an accident in September and his cast was removed only three days prior to the fracas. Both defendant and Otis testified that defendant did not hurl his crutch either through the window or against Officer Bentley, that it was another person who did so. Otis testified that he, not defendant, threw the trash can through the door window.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Against defense objections that it was improper rebuttal, William Hewitt Hornbeck,. a mathematics and physical education teacher who helped supervise the dance, testified that he saw defendant that evening but defendant did not appear to need his crutches to walk with and that it was defendant who put a crutch through the window portion of the outside door.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Other details will be alluded to where necessary in the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">I. <em>Matters pertaining to evidence:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">A. <em>Evidence re bias. </em>The trial judge did not err in sustaining objections during cross-examination of Officer Bentley with reference to questions seeking to develop facts that another person who was a participant in the fracas at the high school dance who hit Officer Bentley was charged with a misdemeanor only\u2014defendant contending that this proves bias of Officer Bentley against defendant. The matter of permitting impeachment evidence on collateral matters such as this is now in the discretion of the trial judge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eisenberg </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 606, 615 [72 Cal.Rptr. 390].) Furthermore, the decisions as to whether any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>shall be prosecuted and as to whether the charge is to be a felony or a misdemeanor, are matters more in the discretion of the district attorney, rather than the arresting officer. (See <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Locke </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 752, 755-757 [6 Cal.Rptr. 813]; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 6, pp. 6-7, and Hall et al., Modern Criminal Procedure (1969) ch. 14, pp. 736-787.) Thus, it is difficult to perceive how the facts sought to be elicited would have constituted impeachment of Officer Bentley.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">B. <em>Rebuttal testimony proper. </em>The rebuttal testimony of instructor Hornbeck was properly admitted. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 622, 629 [30 Cal.Rptr. 841, 381 P.2d 665], our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWhile it is improper for the prosecutor to withhold evidence which is properly a part of his case in chief and offer it after the defense has closed its case, such evidence may be used by the prosecutor where it comes within the rules of impeachment and may be admitted on rebuttal to meet evidence upon a point put into dispute by the testimony for the defense. [Citations omitted.]\u201d (See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 900, 906 [76 Cal.Rptr. 160].)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Here defendant and his companion, Jerry Amos Otis, testified in defense that defendant neither hit Officer Bentley with his crutch nor propelled the crutch through the glass portion of the door. Defendant and Otis likewise testified that defendant did not hurl the trash can through the window. Otis went to the extent of assuming responsibility for that act. Defendant, his mother (Mrs. Hettie Townsend), and Otis testified that defendant was not able to ambulate without his crutches. Under such circumstances, it was proper for the People to put on instructor Hornbeck to refute portions of the defense testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">C. <em>Officer Bentley was engaged in performance of his duty. </em>Defendant contends that a police officer who is \u201cmoonlighting\u201d is to be considered as performing his duty only when he is effecting an arrest, citing the facts in <em>People v. Hooker </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 878 [62 Cal.Rptr. 675]. In <em>Hooker, </em>defendant struck a police officer, who was working as a part-time employee of the Thrifty Drug Store to apprehend shoplifters and to prevent shoplifting, at a time when the officer was arresting defendant Hooker outside the store for shoplifting. It was held that the officer was a peace officer in the performance of his duty within the meaning of Penal Code sections 242 and 243. Although <em>Hooker </em>was disapproved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 347, 356, fn. 6 [74 Cal.Rptr. 713, 450 P.2d 33], it was only insofar as it implied that a person cannot resist an unlawful arrest, such as when excessive force is used. We think defendant\u2019s contention is too narrow a construction of a \u201cpeace officer . . . engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the performance of his duties.\u201d The main purpose of the presence of Officer Bentley and of his two colleagues was to maintain peace at the dance and to assist the school officials in keeping out intruders who were not members of the student body.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State </em>(1969) 45 Wis.2d 44 [172 N.W.2d 31], an off duty policeman in uniform was enroute home after \u201cworking in uniform as a guard at a wedding\u201d when he came upon a fight on the street and arrested the participants. It was held that he was acting in his official capacity when breaking up the fight and that defendant was, therefore, properly convicted of having committed a battery upon a peace officer acting in his official capacity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Wisconsin Supreme Court stated: \u201cIt is true that Hill [police officer] was not on duty when he first saw the fight. However, as soon as he became aware of the situation and took action he was no longer off-duty. Hill did what any officer of the law is supposed to do, and attempted to preserve public peace and order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was certainly no \u2018personal frolic\u2019 for him to ... attempt to break up a fight. There is, therefore, no merit in defendant\u2019s assertion that Hill was not acting in his official capacity when the offense took place.\u201d (45 Wis.2d at p. 48 [172 N.W.2d at p. 33].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Our Government Code sections 26600 and 27823 expressly enjoin on sheriffs and constables the preservation of the peace as part of their duties. Lcs Angeles City Charter sections 198, 200, and 201 constitute municipal legislation of similar import.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court in <em>Christal </em>v. <em>Police Commission </em>(1939) 33 Cal.App.2d 564, 567 [92 P.2d 416], stated with reference to city police officers: \u201c[Police] officers are the guardians of the peace and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>security of the community .... Among the duties of police officers are those of preventing the commission of crime. ...\u201d Breach of the peace is a crime. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 415.) More specifically, Penal Code section 626.8 made it a crime for any person who comes into any school building or upon any school ground, without lawful business thereon, and whose presence or acts interfere with the peaceful conduct of the activities of such school or disrupt its pupils or school activities, and who remains there, or reenters or comes upon the school premises within 72 hours after having been asked to leave by an accredited administrative official in charge. The high school buildings and grounds were public property and the locus of the crimes charged occurred in a public place. (Cf. <em>In re Zorn </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 650, 652 [30 Cal.Rptr. 811, 381 P.2d 635]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 766, 771 [93 Cal.Rptr. 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><em>In People v. Derby (1960) 177 </em>Cal.App.2d 626, 630 [2 Cal.Rptr. 401], the court holding that California Highway Patrol officers in uniform were still peace officers even after their official duty hours, stated: \u201cFurthermore, it is clear that a breach of the peace was committed in the officers\u2019 presence, and they were not required to ignore this conduct on the part of the appellant whether or not their particular hours of duty had been completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">When Officer Bentley was struck on his left hand by defendant wielding his crutch, he was in the act of retrieving his baton which he intended to use, in lieu of a firearm, to restore order and to prevent further damage to public property. Earlier, he was assisting the assistant boys\u2019 vice-principal in charge in enforcing provisions of Penal Code section 626.8. We hold that Officer Bentley was engaged in the performance of his duty as a peace officer and that the evidence sustains the verdict finding that defendant struck Officer Bentley and thereby violated the provisions of Penal Code sections 242 and 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">II. <em>Jury instructions:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We agree that the instructions given to the jury were either confusing or inadequate. At the time this case was given to the jury, CALJIC (3d ed. 1970) did not contain what is now CALJIC No. 9.51.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In absence thereof, the trial judge defined battery in terms of the statute. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 242.) But he accompanied it with an instruction which 'he tailored from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>CALJIC 9.04, now superseded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This instruction had the following sentence which applies to an assault<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and not a battery: \u201cThe necessary elements of the offense are the unlawful attempt with the specific intent to commit a violent injury upon the person of another, and the then present ability to accomplish the injury.\u201d Under this instruction, the jury could have found a battery without even an offensive touching of the victim\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">We think the state of the evidence also called for the giving of an instruction on an assault upon a peace officer (see current CALJIC No. 9.50), as a lesser and necessarily included offense. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 449-450 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370], had made it mandatory for the trial judge to instruct <em>sua sponte </em>on all lesser and necessarily included offenses where the evidence was within the area prescribed by <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 768, 772-773 [228 P.2d 281], Although a battery upon a police officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243) and assault upon a police officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 240, 241) are both so-called \u201chybrid felonies\u201d (those carrying alternative county jail sentences), Penal Code section 241 prescribes the alternative state prison to be \u201cby imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding two years,\u201d whereas Penal Code section 243 states that for a battery on a police officer, it shall be \u201cby imprisonment in the state prison for not less than 1 nor more than 10 years.\u201d Thus by virtue of carrying lesser minimum and maximum sentences, the assault upon a police officer is a crime of lesser gravity than a battery upon such officer. At the conviction stage, as opposed to the sentencing stage, of the criminal proceedings, the fact that defendant was ultimately given the benefit of Penal Code section 1202b, specifying a minimum sentence of six months, was immaterial. Furthermore, Penal Code section 18a provides: \u201cExcept in cases where a different minimum punishment is prescribed by any law of this state, for every offense declared to be a felony and punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, the minimum imprisonment shall be imprisonment in any of the state prisons for not less than six months.\u201d Had the jury returned a verdict finding defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>guilty of an assault on a police officer, there would have been no necessity of invoking Penal Code section 1202b.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The finding, implied in the verdict finding defendant guilty of a battery on a police officer, rests upon circumstantial evidence as to the identity of the person striking Officer Bentley\u2019s left hand, whereas the testimony of percipient witnesses establishes that defendant was threatening injury to Officers Bentley and Heider by poking his crutch through the glass portion of the door, reaming the shattered glass aperture, and trying to hit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Whether an off duty police officer, in uniform and paid by a source other than from his official employer, in preserving the peace at a public high school dance, assisting the vice-principal to keep out intruders, and protecting the public high school property from damage, is engaged in performance of his duty is a question of law, and the jury should be guided by an appropriate instruction on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The instruction as to an assault in terms of superseded CALJIC 9.00 was erroneous in its requirement of a specific intent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rocha (1971) </em>3 Cal.3d 893, 898 [92 Cal.Rptr. 172, 479 P.2d 372], handed down after the trial of the instant case), but it was error favorable to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">However, the trial judge never instructed the jury that either a simple battery or a simple assault, either of which would be a misdemeanor only, was also a lesser and necessarily included offense. He should have so instructed <em>sua sponte. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hood, supra, 1 </em>Cal.3d 444, 449; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 34 [73 Cal.Rptr. 608].)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">At the time of <em>voir dire </em>examination of the prospective jurors, three persons indicated that they \u25a0 had not previously served as jurors in a criminal case. The trial judge then stated: \u201c[F]or the benefit of the three persons, I will state that since this is a criminal case the burden or <em>[sic] </em>proof rests upon the People to establish guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt and also that in a criminal case the defendant is presumed to be innocent of the charges against him until proved guilty by the People by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. [Par.] I will give you Instructions at the appropriate time as to what constitutes a reasonable doubt. Suffice it to say at this time we use the words moral certainty, a conviction to a moral certainty. The People do not have to prove their case in all events to an absolute certainty.\u201d However, the instruction as to reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence was apparently inadvertently omitted at the time the jury was formally instructed. Penal Code section 1093, subdivision 6, permits a judge in a criminal case to instruct the jury <em>sua sponte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>\u201c[a]t the beginning of the trial or from time to time during the trial\u201d on rules of law he deems necessary for their guidance in hearing of the case and probably this inadvertent omission would not alone constitute reversible error, but the failure to instruct after a representation that he would instruct on reasonable doubt at an appropriate time is an additional factor to be considered in assessing the overall compliance with recognized due process in the trial of a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">In fairness to the trial judge, we note that much of the law in this area was definitively settled by our Supreme Court subsequent to the trial of this case and that the issue of whether Officer Bentley \u201cwas engaged in the performance of his duties\u201d is being decided upon this appeal. We also observe that the real factual dispute for the trier of fact to resolve in this case was the identity of the person who committed the acts of battery and/or assault attributed to defendant, and the corollary issue of whether defendant was able to ambulate without his crutches when enraged. Nevertheless we feel constrained to reverse the judgment for it has been held that errors of this nature deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to have the jury determine every material issue presented by the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 444, 450, and cases cited; see, also, Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error (1970) pp. 73-74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Kaus, P.
