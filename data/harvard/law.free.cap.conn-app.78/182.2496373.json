We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. During the evening hours of October 30,1999, the defendant and the victim, his wife, along with several of their friends, attended a Halloween party at a restaurant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in New Haven. Alcoholic beverages were served at the gathering and, by the time that the restaurant closed in the early morning hours of October 31, 1999, the defendant was intoxicated. At around 1:45 a.m., the victim drove the defendant to a friend\u2019s home in nearby East Haven, where they continued to socialize with friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant and the victim began to argue with one another. The defendant expressed his desire to leave the party, and the victim, believing that the defendant was too intoxicated to drive, refused to give him the keys to her automobile. The defendant struck the victim, causing her to fall to the floor. The victim thereafter left her friends\u2019 home in East Haven and, assuming that the defendant would get a ride home from someone else, drove alone to her home in North Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The victim was in her home when, at around 2:30 a.m., she heard the sound of breaking glass. The defendant had broken a small pane of glass in a side window to gain entry to the home. The victim started to run to her car in the garage, but the defendant, who had entered the home, stopped her. The defendant grabbed her by her hair and dragged her back into the house. In the ensuing struggle, the defendant struck the victim several times and, continually pulling her by her hair, pulled her to the second floor of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The victim ultimately fled back downstairs where she called the police for assistance. Two North Haven police officers arrived at the home shortly thereafter. The officers found the victim, visibly upset, in the kitchen, where she gave the police a written statement concerning those events. The defendant was subsequently arrested, brought to trial and convicted of disorderly conduct. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>set forth as they become necessary in the context of the claims raised by the defendant on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1), the use of prior inconsistent oral statements and the standard of proof it should employ in evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing the challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In regard to the elements of disorderly conduct, the court instructed the jury in relevant part as follows: \u201cIn this case, in order to convict the defendant of disorderly conduct, the state must establish that he, with the \u2018intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof,\u2019 engaged in \u2018fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior.\u2019 The words inconvenience, annoyance or alarm refer to what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider to be a disturbance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>or impediment of a lawful activity. A deep feeling of vexation or provocation or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The defendant in his principal brief argues that the court should have instructed the jury that to find him guilty under \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1), \u201cthe defendant had to engage in a physical fight or in physically violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior . . . .\u201d The defendant claims that by omitting from its instruction the phrase \u201cof a physical nature,\u201d a phrase that he, in his requested jury instructions, had asked the court to use in its definition of the conduct proscribed by the statute, the court misled the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that by \u201cnot limiting the jury to physical conduct or conduct that had a degree of physicality to it, [the court\u2019s instruction allowed] the jury as a collective body and/or each individual juror ... to apply its own subjective definition of \u2018tumultuous\u2019 and \u2018threatening\u2019 to the case such that it is reasonably possible that the defendant was convicted of conduct not proscribed by \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1).\u201d The defendant bases his claim on <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 812, 640 A.2d 986 (1994), in which our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Supreme Court stated that \u201csubdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) prohibits physical fighting, and physically violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The due process vagueness doctrine ordinarily applies to the substantive elements of the crime charged; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 439, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000); the statutory language, taken together with its judicial gloss, must give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly. <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 802. The substantive elements must be defined with reasonable clarity not only so that a defendant may guide his conduct accordingly, but also for police, judges and juries \u201cso that they may not apply the law arbitrarily.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra, 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">We do not agree that <em>Indrisano </em>stands for the proposition that the phrase \u201cof a physical nature\u201d <em>must </em>be included to modify the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). The court\u2019s instruction comported with the judicial gloss prescribed in <em>Indrisano. Indrisano </em>avoided first amendment difficulties that would criminalize mere verbal speech by clarifying that a conviction under \u00a7 53a-182 must be based on a defendant\u2019s conduct rather than on a defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Further, there is no danger, in the.present case, that the jury\u2019s verdict was not based solely on evidence of the defendant\u2019s physical conduct. The jury was not made aware of the content of the defendant\u2019s speech, but rather was presented with evidence only of his conduct, making it more than unlikely that his first amendment rights were \u201ccriminalized\u201d by the court\u2019s instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The defendant also alleges that the court improperly instructed the jury on the use of the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent oral statements. He argues that the court erred in not charging as he requested, specifically, in not limiting the jury\u2019s use of prior oral statements solely for purposes of judging credibility. Because of such claimed impropriety, the defendant posits that \u201cthe jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instruction and considered the wife\u2019s prior inconsistent oral statements as substantive evidence of the essential elements of the crimes charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">It appears that the defendant does not claim that the court improperly admitted into evidence, for substantive purposes, any prior written inconsistent statements. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). Our review of the record discloses that references made by the defendant on appeal relate either to items that were never introduced as evidence and therefore never presented to the jury, or, to a document, the family violence victim advocate\u2019s case report, which was admitted as a full exhibit for substantive pmposes, without an apparent objection, as a business record pursuant to the business records exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant\u2019s brief cites no specific prior inconsistent oral statement by the victim for which the court should have given the requested limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The defendant last claims that the court improperly instructed the jury in regard to the standard of proof, insofar as it related to evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility. The defendant argues that because the victim\u2019s truthfulness was essential to a finding of guilt, the court should have instructed the jury that it had to find that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>truthful beyond a reasonable doubt to find that the state had proven the elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The defendant requested the court instruct as follows: \u201cIn some regards deciding when someone is being truthful and when someone is not is the greatest challenge for a jury. In this case it is no different. Indeed, in order to find the factual elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt, because there is no evidence of the factual elements of the crimes apart from [the victim\u2019s] written statement of October 31, 1999, individually, each juror must decide whether you can believe beyond a reasonable doubt [that the victim] was being truthful in her statement on the evening of October 31, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The court delivered the following instructions to the jury: \u201cThe evidence from which you are to decide what the facts are consist of, first, the sworn testimony of witnesses, both on direct and cross-examination, regardless of who called a particular witness. And second, the exhibits that have been received into evidence. ... In deciding what the facts are, you must consider all the evidence. In doing this you must decide which testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe. You may believe all, none or part of any witness\u2019 testimony. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u201cYou will recall that evidence of statements of [the victim] were admitted. You should consider the facts contained in those statements together with all of the evidence and you should give those facts the weight they appear to be entitled to in view of all of the circumstances under which they were made. The believability of the facts contained within her statements are subject to the same credibility test as any other testimony given on the [witness] stand. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u201cThe burden to prove the defendant guilty of the crimes with which he is charged is upon the state. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>defendant does not have to prove his innocence. This means that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element necessary to constitute the crime charged. Whether the burden of proof resting on the state is sustained depends not on the number of witnesses, nor on the quantity of the testimony, but on the nature and quality of the testimony. Please bear in mind that one witness\u2019 testimony is sufficient to convict if it establishes all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u201cIf you find that the state has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, each of the elements of any of the crimes . . . then you shall find the defendant guilty of each crime as to which you have made such a finding. On the other hand, if you find that the state has failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, any one of the elements of those crimes, then you shall find the defendant not guilty of each such crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Our review of the charge as a whole leads us to conclude that the instructions were correct in law, adapted to the issues, and sufficient to guide the jury as to how it should assess the victim\u2019s credibility and determine whether the state had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The defendant claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction of disorderly conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u201c[W]e have consistently employed a two-part analysis in appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction. . . . First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>eluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . That the evidence is circumstantial rather than direct does not diminish the probative force of that evidence. . . . We must be mindful, however, that [although the jury may draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven, [it] may not resort to speculation and conjecture. . . . Each essential element of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Caprilozzi, 45 </em>Conn. App. 455, 463-64, 696 A.2d 380, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 937, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The record reflects that the court admitted into evidence the victim\u2019s written statement to the police. The statement was signed by the victim and dated October 31, 1999, at 2:56 a.m. The victim represented in that statement that the defendant had struck and pushed her down several times while she and the defendant were at their friends\u2019 East Haven home. She further represented that when he arrived at her home later that night, the defendant struck her several times, pulled her hair and dragged her up the stairs of her home by her hair. The record further reflects that the court admitted the statement into evidence under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, which permits certain prior inconsistent statements, which are in writing, to be admitted into evidence for substantive purposes. At trial, the victim did not testify consistently with the version of events that she provided to police in her statement. The victim testified, contrary to that version of events, that she falsely had accused her husband of physical violence toward her as an act of revenge. The court instructed the jury that it could consider the written statement for substantive purposes. The defendant did not object to the statement\u2019s admission into evidence and does not now claim that the statement does not satisfy <em>Whelan\u2019s </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Under <em>Whelan, </em>a nonparty witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement may be used for substantive purposes only if the following conditions exist: (1) the statement is in writing; (2) the statement is signed by the declarant; (3) the declarant possesses personal knowledge of the facts contained therein; and (4) the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. Id.; Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5 (1). Despite those requirements, there are rare cases in which a statement, which otherwise satisfies <em>Whelan\u2019s </em>criteria, should be excluded from evidence because it was made under circumstances that adversely affect its reliability. In such cases, it is proper for the court to act as a gatekeeper and to exclude from evidence such statements because their admission would \u201csubvert the fairness of the fact-finding process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>72 Conn. App. 804, 813, 806 A.2d 1072 (2002), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 923, 823 A.2d 1216 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The defendant posits that such a situation exists in the present case and that \u201cthis court should find that the [victim\u2019s] <em>Whelan </em>statement by itself, when reviewed upon the totality of the evidence, was unreliable and thus insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d The defendant curiously argues on appeal not that the court improperly admitted the statement under Whelan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but that the jury could not have credited the statement in reaching its verdict because it was not reliable. His claim is that the statement is not sufficient to sustain his conviction and, in that regard, is one sounding in sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">A prior inconsistent statement identifying the defendant as the perpetrator and admitted as substantive evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>able doubt where the statement possesses ample indicia of reliability. See <em>State </em>v. Newsome, 238 Conn. 588, 617-20, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal, there is nothing to indicate that the statement was not that of the victim. This was not the rare case in which, despite having satisfied Whelan\u2019s requirements, circumstances warranted the exclusion of the prior statement from evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was in writing, sworn to and given shortly after the event happened. The jury, as the finder of fact, was able to assess the factual issues, which were raised by the defendant at trial, that called into doubt the statement\u2019s merit. In meeting the <em>Whelan </em>criteria, the statement necessarily met the required indicia of reliability. If the jury, having heard evidence concerning the victim\u2019s prior written statement and having heard her trial testimony concerning the events underlying this appeal, chose to credit her written statement, such a finding alone would be sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 815. The jury is the finder of facts, and credibility issues are strictly within its province.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Our review of the record before us indicates that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict and was sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction of disorderly conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that he was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor \u201cengaged in an egregious pattern of misconduct, recklessly disregarding the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights and his right to confront witnesses against him.\u201d In support of his claim, the defendant cites several instances of alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The defendant concedes that he did not raise his claim at trial. He seeks review of his claim pursuant to <em>State v. Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We review the claim because the record is adequate to do so, and an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct in violation of the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial is of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 272, 780 A.2d 53 (2001). We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim fails under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong because the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Claims of prosecutorial misconduct trigger a two-pronged inquiry. First, we must examine the allegedly improper conduct to determine if it was, in fact, improper and rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. If it did, we will analyze the effect of the misconduct to determine if it deprived the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Minggio, </em>71 Conn. App. 656, 677-78, 803 A.2d 408, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 902, 810 A.2d 270 (2002). Generally, \u201c[i]n evaluating a prosecutorial misconduct claim, we review whether the record discloses a pattern of misconduct pervasive throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the trial or conduct that was so blatantly egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>72 Conn. App. 380, 385, 805 A.2d 142, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 914, 811 A.2d 1294 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Several of the defendant\u2019s claims concern allegedly improper argument by the prosecutor. \u201cIn determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial we must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial. ... In examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions . . . and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. . . . The defendant bears the burden of proving that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper in that they were prejudicial and deprived him of a fair trial. ... In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>67 Conn. App. 249, 267, 786 A.2d 1189 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002). Mindful of those principles, we now turn to each of the defendant\u2019s specific claims of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The defendant alleges that the prosecutor, knowing that it would cause the discharge of the public defender representing the defendant, represented to the court that the defendant was not exposed to jail time as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>result of the charges. The prosecutor made the representation prior to the time of trial. Our review of the record reveals that at the time the prosecutor made that representation, it was correct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That being the case, the claim of misconduct is unfounded. Further, the record clearly discloses that it was the office of the public defender that discovered the defendant to be ineligible for its services and filed a motion to withdraw from its representation of him. The court granted the motion and thereafter denied the defendant\u2019s reapplication. It was at that time that the court observed and the state represented that the defendant was not facing incarceration. If the defendant wants to claim that the prosecutor, knowing at the time of his representation that a part B information was going to be filed later, \u201cmisrepresented\u201d or was unethical in the representation, there exists another forum for that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant further claims that the state\u2019s filing of the part B information constituted \u201ccapricious charging practices.\u201d The defendant can cite no authority in support of his claim. The record reflects that the part B information was filed prior to the commencement of the trial, a practice permitted by Practice Book \u00a7 36-17. We conclude that the filing therefore was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor should have furnished notice of the state\u2019s application to grant immunity from prosecution to the victim sooner than it did, which was on March 8, 2001, after the trial had begun. He argues that had he known sooner of the application, he likely would have known that the part B information exposed him to incarceration and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>have applied for the services of a public defender. Despite making that claim, the defendant does not dispute the fact that counsel represented him at all times during the trial and immediately prior to jury selection. The defendant also does not dispute that the state is under no obligation to furnish notice to him of its application in the first place. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a (requiring state to make application \u201cwith notice to the witness, after the witness has claimed his privilege against self-incrimination\u2019 \u2019). It was only after the witness had invoked her privilege against self-incrimination that the state submitted its application and notified both the witness and the defendant of such fact. The state did so despite the fact that the defendant was not entitled to notice as a matter of right. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in that regard was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The defendant next claims that the state, during its remarks to panels of prospective jurors, improperly informed the jurors that the chiefs of police for different towns might either be called as witnesses or that the jury might hear their names as part of the evidence. The defendant claims that those witnesses \u201cclearly had no evidence to present in the case\u201d and that those remarks deprived him of a fair trial. The record reflects that two chiefs of police, from the towns of Norwich and Ansonia, were included in the state\u2019s potential witness list. Despite the fact that the state did not later call those witnesses to testify at trial, the defendant can cite no authority in support of his obscure claim that it is improper to name potential witnesses who are not later called to testify. Furthermore, the defendant cannot demonstrate that the state\u2019s conduct, which was not improper, caused him any degree of prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The defendant also points out that with regard to one item of evidence, the prosecutor failed to comply with the rules of discovery. The record reflects that the state did not present to the defendant a copy of a certain document, a data sheet concerning the incident generated by the family relations office, within forty-five days of the defendant\u2019s written request for discoveiy. The state provided the document to the defendant after it should have done so, and the defendant sought an appropriate remedy from the court for what he characterized as an unintentional violation on the state\u2019s part. The court determined that the late disclosure violated Practice Book \u00a7 40-5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The court observed that it would remedy the discoveiy violation either by disallowing the document as evidence or by granting the defendant additional time to prepare for the introduction of the document. The court chose the latter alternative and allowed defense counsel additional time to conduct research and to interview the document\u2019s author. The defendant\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>sel, however, later withdrew the motion that he had filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 40-5. The defendant\u2019s counsel represented that he had interviewed the document\u2019s author and conceded that the defense was not prejudiced by the delay in receiving the report. The defendant is wholly unable to demonstrate that the state\u2019s conduct caused him any prejudice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The defendant finally claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct by way of certain statements that he made to the jury during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">First, the defendant points out that during direct examination of the victim, the prosecutor inquired as to whether she had asked the state to \u201cdrop\u201d the charges against the defendant. After the victim replied that the state had in fact declined her request, the prosecutor asked her: \u201cAnd we told you that\u2019s because we believed [that the incident] occurred, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d The victim replied affirmatively. The defendant claims on appeal that this inquiry improperly conveyed to the jury \u201cthat the state believed the defendant assaulted his wife . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Second, the defendant claims that during the state\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor misrepresented the evidence. The record discloses that the prosecutor commented that the victim had told a family relations social worker that during the incident, \u201cshe ran to get into her car,\u201d \u201cwas grabbed by the hair\u201d and \u201cwas dragged upstairs\u201d by the defendant. Further, the defendant claims that during closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the victim had told the social worker, concerning the defendant: \u201cYou know, he beat me before, he beat me this time . . . .\u201d The defendant argues that the social worker testified at trial that she had no recollection of her conversation with the victim and that her handwritten notes of her interview of the victim did not support the prosecutor\u2019s summary of what the victim had told the social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the first challenged comment came in the form of a question to the victim, which included an explanation of why the state chose not to comply with the victim\u2019s request to drop the charges against the defendant. We do not view it as improper. As to the comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument concerning what the victim had recounted to the social worker, we conclude that although they are arguably a loose interpretation of the version of events, the facts alluded to therein were not outside of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">It is well settled that a prosecutor must not comment on evidence that is not part of the record, nor is he to comment unfairly on the evidence adduced at trial so as to mislead the jury. Here, the facts alluded to by the prosecutor were set forth in the victim\u2019s statement to the police, which was before the jury. We certainly do not condone paraphrasing or embellishing on a witness\u2019 testimony, but we also recognize that the parties are allowed a certain degree of latitude to express their views of what evidence was presented at trial. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>extent that those <em>isolated </em>misstatements, which were not severe, may have misled the jury, we nonetheless conclude that they certainly did not deprive the defendant of. a fair trial. The jury was well aware that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not themselves evidence. The court properly instructed the jury that its recollection and interpretation of the evidence was controlling, and the prosecutor properly referred to that fact, as well, in his argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ara\">The jury acquitted the defendant of two additional charges: reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64 (a) and unlawful restraint in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-96. Following his conviction, the defendant pleaded guilty to a part B information charging him with having committed an offense while on release in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\"> The defendant\u2019s requested charge, which preserved the issue for our review, stated in relevant part: \u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of [disorderly conduct], the state must first prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following facts: (1) That the defendant acted with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm; or (2) That the defendant recklessly created the risk of causing inconvenience, or annoyance or alarm; and, (3) That the defendant engaged in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior of a physical nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cThe words \u2018inconvenience, annoyance or alarm\u2019 refer to what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider to be a disturbance to or impediment of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation, or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201cIf the state has proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the necessary intent or recklessly, then the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the next element of the crime charged, that the defendant engaged in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior of a physical nature.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim that because the jury acquitted him of the charge of reckless endangerment in the second degree, it could not rationally have convicted him of disorderly conduct on the basis of his physical conduct, that is, one or more of the four physical acts of violence described by the victim in her statement to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> In any event, we note that having failed to object to the statement\u2019s admissibility at trial, the defendant failed to preserve such an evidentiary claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The defendant argues in his principal brief that the statement was unreliable because (1) no evidence corroborated the victim\u2019s statement, (2) the statement \u201citself further supports\u201d the victim\u2019s trial testimony that the statement was fabricated, (3) the victim testified that she was intoxicated when she gave the statement to police and (4) the victim\u2019s explanation of why she falsely accused the defendant is credible. All of those factors are fodder for the jury\u2019s consideration as to whether it should rely on the statement, but they certainly do not raise issues that call into doubt whether the statement, having met <em>Whelan\u2019s </em>criteria, was admissible for substantive purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> The defendant also argues that the jury, having acquitted him of the crime of reckless endangerment in the second degree, must have disbelieved the victim\u2019s original statement. It follows, the defendant argues, that having so found, the jury could not also have found that he acted in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>described in the statement for purposes of the disorderly conduct count. We find no merit in that argument. It suffices to observe that those two crimes are proved by different elements; the jury\u2019s verdict is not legally inconsistent. The fact that the jury acquitted the defendant of reckless endangerment in the second degree has no bearing on the issue of whether sufficient evidence supported his conviction of disorderly conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\"> The defendant was not exposed to incarceration until the state filed the part B information, charging him with having committed an offense while on release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> Although we do not find the state\u2019s conduct to have been in any way improper, we note that the court nevertheless instructed the jury that the state had named the listed potential witnesses merely to determine whether any prospective jurors were familiar with such witnesses. The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>instructed the jury: \u201cYou are not to draw any unfavorable inference for or against either party from the fact that any potential witness did not actually testify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 40-5 provides: \u201cIf a party fails to comply with the disclosure as required under these rules, the opposing party may move the judicial authority for an appropriate order. The judicial authority hearing such a motion may enter such orders and time limitations as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, one or more of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\u201c(1) Requiring the noncomplying party to comply;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\u201c(2) Granting the moving party additional time or a continuance;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">\u201c(3) Relieving the moving party from making a disclosure required by these rules;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">\u201c(4) Prohibiting the noncomplying parly from introducing specified evidence;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">\u201c(5) Declaring a mistrial;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">\u201c(6) Dismissing the charges;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-18\">\u201c(7) Imposing appropriate sanctions on the counsel or party, or both, responsible for the noncompliance; or</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">\u201c(8) Entering such other order as it deems proper.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> Further, the defendant does not claim on appeal that the court in any way abused its discretion concerning the violation of Practice Book \u00a7 40-5. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 40-5 gives broad discretion to the trial judge to fashion an appropriate remedy for noncompliance with discovery. . . . Generally, [tjhe primary purpose of a <em>sanction </em>for violation of a discovery order is to ensure that the defendant\u2019s rights are protected, not to exact punishment on the state for its allegedly improper conduct. As we have indicated, the formulation of an appropriate sanction is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. ... In determining what sanction is appropriate for failure to comply with court ordered discovery, the trial court should consider the reason why disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other relevant circumstances. . . . Suppression of relevant, material and otherwise admissible evidence is a severe sanction which should not be invoked lightly.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.
