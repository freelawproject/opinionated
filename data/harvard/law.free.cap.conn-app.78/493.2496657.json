Lambert is his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Lambert presents the following issues on appeal: \u201c(1) Did the trial court err in concluding the evidence in the trial of this matter and then requesting a written response to judicial inquiries which written answers/ position submission was not subject to cross examination? (2) Did the trial court err in entering orders modifying child custody/visitation and support without appointing an attorney or guardian ad litem to represent the minor child? (3) Did the trial court err in modifying the judgment by awarding sole legal and physical custody of the unrepresented minor child to the mother where: the mother did not file any motion to modify custody/visitation alleging a substantial change of circumstances to warrant such modification; the court did not make any finding regarding a change in circumstances to warrant a modification; and the court failed to consider the statutory criteria pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-56 concerning custody? (4) Did the trial court err in finding that the plaintiff \u2018admitted\u2019 that the child spends seventy five to eighty percent of his parenting time with the grandparents and not with him when same was not the plaintiff\u2019s testimony? (5) Did the trial court err in awarding $3,000 in counsel fees to the defendant when the court did not state the basis of such award and failed to consider the appropriate statutory criteria for such award? (6) Did the trial court err in not ruling on [motion number] 266 \u2014 the plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Contempt Post-Judgment Vacation dated June 8,1999 in that same was specifically to be decided by the court and extensive testimony was elicited and received regarding the subject matter of [motion number] 266?\u201d We affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The following facts are relevant to our resolution of Lambert\u2019s claims. By orders entered on November 12, 1993, the child was placed in the joint custody of both Lambert and Donahue with actual physical custody granted to Donahue. The court also entered visitation and support orders at that time. The parties filed a series of postjudgment motions, and hearings were held over a number of weeks, concluding on July 16, 1999. At the close of those hearings, the court asked the parties to submit written responses to the court\u2019s remaining questions regarding the schedules of each parent, the activities of their child, and facts relating to vacation schedules and vacation plans. Donahue filed her written responses on August 27, 1999, and Lambert filed his responses on October 4,1999. The court, thereafter, issued its decision on October 15,1999, awarding sole custody of the child to Donahue. The court also modified the visitation schedule and the child support payments, and it found Lambert in contempt for taking the child out of the state without notifying Donahue of the child\u2019s whereabouts. Accordingly, the court ordered Lambert to pay $3000 in counsel fees on behalf of Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Lambert filed an appeal of that decision on December 2, 1999, but shortly thereafter, on February 29, 2000, he also filed a motion with the trial court requesting an evidentiary hearing regarding the parties\u2019 responses to the court\u2019s questions. Because the court granted the motion, and the evidentiary hearing had not been held prior to oral argument on the appeal, we dismissed the original appeal for lack of a final judgment. See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>69 Conn. App. 146, 794 A.2d 547 (2002). Nevertheless, after allowing Lambert additional time to file a supplemental brief, we did consider the first amended appeal that Lambert filed, which related to the court\u2019s order that Lambert pay $4000 toward Donahue\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>expenses in defending the appeal. See id., 149; see also Practice Book \u00a7 61-9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We upheld that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In relation to Lambert\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing as to the parties\u2019 responses to the court\u2019s inquiries, on March 15, 2002, the court, after reconsideration, denied the motion for the evidentiary hearing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u201cThe standard of review in family matters is well settled. An appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berglass </em>v. <em>Berglass, </em>71 Conn. App. 771, 775, 804 A.2d 889 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Lambert\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly concluded the evidentiary phase of the proceeding, but then requested written responses to its inquiries without giving the parties the opportunity to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>each other as to those responses. Lambert argues that these court-ordered submissions were \u201cclearly hearsay, not subject to cross-examination, improperly considered by the trial court as evidence, and required by the court [in] abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in this matter.\u201d After reviewing the record, we decline to review the merits of this claim because we conclude that Lambert, through his attorney, agreed to the submission of posthearing written responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cWhether or not the trial judge shall question a witness is within [the court\u2019s] sound discretion. The extent of the examination is likewise within [the court\u2019s] sound discretion. Its exercise will not be reviewed unless [the court] has acted unreasonably, or, as it is more often expressed, abused [its] discretion. The judge must not exhibit bias or prejudice nor take sides.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>13 Conn. App. 330, 335, 537 A.2d 157, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988). \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and . . . evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the [appellant] of a substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sheiman </em>v. <em>Sheiman, </em>72 Conn. App. 193, 201, 804 A.2d 983 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. On July 16,1999, after Lambert\u2019s attorney curtailed his examination of Donahue and told the court that his case was concluded, the court stated that it still had many questions for the parties. The judge then asked the parties if they wanted to submit the responses \u201cposttrial . . . .\u201d The court explained that it would leave the evidence open because \u201cadditional information would be helpful to the court . . . and [counsel] can submit [the responses] in writing because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>... it avoids another court date.\u201d Counsel for both Lambert and Donahue responded in the affirmative, with Lambert\u2019s counsel responding, \u201cYes,\u201d and Donahue\u2019s counsel responding, \u201cFine.\u201d The court asked the parties to provide information as to the following: \u201cthe regularly scheduled vacations ... of the child; the regularly scheduled activities that are done with the child ... if there are things that happen approximately the same time during the year; the parents\u2019 work schedule and if there is a set vacation . . . .\u201d The court also asked for information regarding medical insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Donahue\u2019s attorney asked the court how it would like these submissions presented, and the court responded that it wanted them on pleading paper. After the court reviewed a temporary summer visitation agreement worked out by the parties, it then asked the parties if they had any questions. Lambert asked one question relating to telephone calls, which the court answered, and neither party responded affirmatively when asked, again, whether there was \u201canything further.\u201d Accordingly, the court adjourned the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">On August 27,1999, Donahue filed her responses with the court, and, on October 4, 1999, Lambert filed his responses. Neither party requested the opportunity to question the other party regarding the submitted responses. The court filed its memorandum of decision on October 15, 1999. Lambert filed an appeal from the judgment on December 2, 1999, but he then filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing on February 29,2000, which the court, initially, granted. His appeal, therefore, was not from a final judgment, and we dismissed it. At a hearing held on March 15,2002, the court reconsidered its granting of the motion for an evidentiary hearing and stated that the motion had been \u201cimprovidently granted.\u201d The court went on to explain that \u201cneither submission played any role in the decision that [the court] had entered\u201d because the extensive typewritten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>responses were not what the court had in mind. The court further explained that responses from both the plaintiff and the defendant were \u201ctotally disregarded\u201d by the court and that when it \u201cactually prepared the decision and entered the orders, [it] did not factor in the information from either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Although the plaintiff, on appeal, vehemently argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting and considering this requested hearsay evidence, he responded affirmatively when the court requested the submissions \u201cpost\u201d and in writing in order to avoid another court date, he did not raise an objection of any sort before the court, and he did not file a request for an evidentiary hearing until more than seven months after the court requested the submissions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This request for an evidentiary hearing did not come until more than four months after the court issued its memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u201cWhenever evidence is admitted without objection, the trier of fact can rely on its contents for whatever they are worth on their face. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. . . . These requirements are not simply formalities. They serve to alert the trial court to potential error while there is still time for the court to act. . . . Assigning error to a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on the basis of objections never raised at trial unfairly subjects the court and the opposing party to trial by ambush.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>70 Conn. App. 223, 230, 797 A.2d 599 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In <em>Fraund </em>v. <em>Design Ideas, Inc., </em>17 Conn. App. 280, 285, 551 A.2d 1279 (1989), both the plaintiff and the defendant submitted posthearing evidence, contained in their briefs, to an arbitrator. On appeal of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, \u201c[t]he court concluded that, because . . . the [appellant] failed to object to the submission of the evidence, [it] had waived its right to object.\u201d Id. In upholding this decision, we held that \u201cthe trial court did not err in finding that the [appellant] had waived any objection to the posthearing submission of evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Because Lambert did not request an evidentiary hearing until more than four months after the court rendered judgment, and he failed to object to the court\u2019s request for written submissions and, according to the record, his counsel agreed to this procedure, we decline to review this claim further. Additionally, the appellant has not shown any harm from the procedure employed by the court especially since the court made it clear that the posthearing submissions played no part in the ratiocination process leading to its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Lambert next claims that the court abused its discretion when it entered modifying orders related to the child without appointing an attorney or guardian ad litem on the child\u2019s behalf. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The court may appoint counsel for any minor child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>... if the court deems it to be in the best interests of the child .... (b) Counsel for the child . . . may also be appointed . . . when the court finds that the custody, care, education, visitation or support of a minor child is in actual controversy . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u201cThe purpose of appointing counsel for a minor child in a [custody matter] is to ensure independent representation of the child\u2019s interest and such representation must be entrusted to the professional judgment of appointed counsel within the usual constraints applicable to such representation. <em>Schaffer </em>v. Schaffer, 187 Conn. 224, 225 n.1, 445 A.2d 589 (1982). Whenever child custody is seriously contested, it is preferable to appoint independent counsel. <em>Yontef </em>v. <em>Yontef, </em>185 Conn. 275, 284, 440 A.2d 899 (1981). Generally, appointment of counsel for minor children rests within the discretion of the court . . . [and] the failure of the court to appoint an attorney [generally is] not such a clear abuse of discretion that [a party] would be entitled to reversal on that ground. <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>State, </em>[174 Conn. 244, 251, 386 A.2d 223 (1978)].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pisch </em>v. <em>Pisch, </em>7 Conn. App. 720, 725-26, 510 A.2d 455 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Lambert attempts to analogize the present case to that of <em>G.S. </em>v. <em>T.S., </em>23 Conn. App. 509, 582 A.2d 467 (1990), wherein this court held that it was an abuse of discretion not to appoint counsel for the minor children. Id., 510. In <em>G.S., </em>the issue concerning the appointment of counsel for the minor children was raised in a pretrial motion. In that case, we explained that \u201c[t]his motion was never addressed by either the court or the defendant . . . [and the] court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel went to the vital issue of custody in [the] case. . . . [W]here custody is contested and where allegations of child abuse, specifically allegations of sexual molestation, [are] known to the trial court prior to the commencement of trial and [where they become] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>abundantly clear during the first day of testimony, it [is] an abuse of discretion not to appoint counsel for the minor children.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Lambert argues that the present case is similar because the court expressed concern over one incident where Lambert pushed his child against a wall. The child had been hitting his grandmother, Lambert\u2019s mother, and, in an effort to stop the child from further striking her, Lambert pushed him. Although Lambert is correct in that the court found this incident \u201cvery troubling\u201d and \u201cinappropriate,\u201d this isolated use of \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in physically handling his child, although disconcerting, is a far cry from the allegations of repeated sexual abuse that were alleged in <em>G.S. </em>v. <em>T.S., </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 509. In the present case, the court was faced with a troubling incident that did not involve any allegations of neglect, sexual abuse or physical abuse that required Lambert\u2019s arrest. Additionally, neither party requested that an attorney or a guardian be appointed for the minor child in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-54, the appointment of an attorney to represent a minor child rests within the sound discretion of the court. Lambert has presented nothing on appeal that convinces us that the court clearly abused its discretion by not appointing an attorney in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Lambert next claims that the court improperly modified the previous judgment, awarding sole custody to Donahue, without making findings relating to changed circumstances, as required by \u00a7 46b-56, and that it did so without Donahue having filed a request for such modification. This claim is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\u201cThe authority to render orders of custody and visitation [is] found in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56, which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>vides in part: (a) In any controversy before the superior court as to the custody or care of minor children . . . the court may at any time make or modify any proper order regarding . . . custody and visitation. . . . (b) In making [or modifying] any order with respect to custody or visitation, the court shall (1) be guided by the best interests of the child. . . . Before a court may modify a custody order, it must find that there has been a material change in circumstance since the prior order of the court, but the ultimate test is the best interests of the child. . . . The sole question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in deciding that the best interests of the child would be served by [the modification]. The trial court [has] the advantage of observing the witnesses and the parties. Considerable evidence [normally is] presented concerning the activities of the parties since [the rendering of the original judgment]. In circumstances like these, whether the best interests of the [child] dictate a change of custody is left to the broad discretion of the trial court. ... A mere difference of opinion or judgment cannot justify the intervention of this court. Nothing short of a conviction that the action of the trial court is one which discloses a clear abuse of discretion can warrant our interference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sheiman </em>v. <em>Sheiman, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Although Lambert persists in arguing that Donahue did not file a request to modify custody, the record clearly establishes that, at the start of the hearing, while the court was assessing the scores of motions that had been filed in this case, counsel for Donahue explained that she had filed four motions, one of which was a motion \u201cto adopt the family relations evaluation.\u201d Counsel explained that this motion was, in essence, a motion to modify custody by adopting the report of the family relations office, which recommended that Donahue be awarded sole legal and physical custody of the child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Lambert was present at the hearing when this exchange occurred, and the record clearly reveals that he was aware that Donahue was seeking sole custody by means of the motion to adopt the family relations evaluation. Additionally, he did not object to the characterization of this motion as a motion to modify. Accordingly, we find absolutely no merit to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Lambert also claims that the court modified custody without making a finding of changed circumstances. Upon our review of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, however, we find that the court specifically stated that its orders were made in consideration of \u201cthe evidence, \u00a7 46b-56 concerning custody, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84. concerning support, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 concerning attorney\u2019s fees and General Statutes \u00a7 46b-87 concerning contempt . . . .\u201d Furthermore, the memorandum of decision is replete with references to evidence that demonstrates a change in circumstances by the parties\u2019 complete inability to communicate concerning their child. The court specifically found that these parents argue about everything from physician\u2019s visits to class photographs to Halloween costumes, all to the detriment of their child. They refer to their child by different names, with Lambert using a common nickname for the child and Donahue referring to the child by his initials. Finding that a coparenting situation was not working for these parties, the court properly awarded sole custody to the parent that it found, on the basis of the evidence, best suited to assume that very important responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that it was in the best interest of the child that sole custody be awarded to Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Lambert next claims that the court made a finding of fact that was not supported by the evidence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>argues that the \u201ccourt erroneously drew the conclusion that the child is with the paternal grandparents 75 percent to 80 percent of the time and not with the plaintiff.\u201d Although we agree that the evidence did not support this one particular finding, we conclude that the inaccuracy was harmless because it did not form the primary basis for the court\u2019s ruling as there was substantial additional evidence from which the court drew its conclusions. Furthermore, Lambert does not claim to have been prejudiced by this inaccurate finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u201cWhen the factual basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is challenged on appeal, the role of this court is to determine whether the facts set out in . . . the decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . . On appeal, the function of this court is limited solely to the determination of whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. . . . This court cannot find facts or draw conclusions from primary facts found, but can only review such findings to determine whether they could have legally, logically and reasonably been found by the trier .... Where, however, some of the facts found are clearly erroneous and others are supported by the evidence, we must examine the clearly erroneous findings to see whether they were harmless, not only in isolation, but also taken as a whole. ... If, when taken as a whole, they undermine appellate confidence in the court\u2019s fact finding process, a new hearing is required.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiNapoli </em>v. <em>Doudera, </em>28 Conn. App. 108, 111\u201412, 609 A.2d 1061 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff admitted that the child spends 75 percent to 80 percent of his parenting time with the grandparents and not with him. His parents also accompany him for most of the pickup and return of the child.\u201d Our review of the record reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that the court\u2019s finding regarding the amount of time that Lambert spends with his child on visitation lacks a reasonable basis in the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Lambert testified that his parents do, in fact, spend much time with the child, but his testimony regarding the 75 to 80 percent time allocation was made in reference to how often his parents go with him to pick up his son. Specifically, Lambert testified that his parents \u201ccome along maybe 75, 80 percent of the time\u201d when he picks up his son for visitation. His parents then take the child for the evening while Lambert remains at home. Lambert would then spend Saturday with his son, and he and his parents would have breakfast together on Sunday morning with the child before Lambert and his parents returned the child to Donahue on Sunday evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Although this testimony does not support the court\u2019s finding that Lambert\u2019s parents, and not Lambert, spent 75 percent to 80 percent of the total visitation time with the child, on the basis of our review of the record, we are not persuaded that this finding formed the basis of the court\u2019s order or that it was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Although we agree that the finding was inaccurate, we conclude that all of the findings, taken as a whole rather than focusing on this one inaccuracy, provide more than ample support for the court\u2019s decision, including, but certainly not limited to, the findings concerning Lambert\u2019s inability or unwillingness to compromise, the parents\u2019 inability to agree on anything concerning the child\u2019s welfare, the high degree of animosity between them and the necessity of police intervention at the child\u2019s school to prevent Lambert from improperly taking the child without authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Additionally, we conclude that this one inaccuracy, concerning the amount of time that Lambert\u2019s parents spend with the child during Lambert\u2019s visitation, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>not undermine our confidence in the court\u2019s fact-finding process; see id.; and we, accordingly, are not persuaded that it was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Lambert next claims that the court improperly awarded $3000 in counsel fees to Donahue without stating the basis for the award. Specifically, he argues that \u201c[t]he court failed to consider the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 in awarding counsel fees, [and] it is not apparent from the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision whether the award of counsel fees flows from the court\u2019s finding of the plaintiff in contempt of its orders or as counsel fees pursuant to \u00a7 46b-62.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 . . . provides in relevant part that \u2018[i]n any proceeding seeking relief under the provisions of this chapter . . . the court may order either spouse or, if such proceeding concerns the custody, care, education, visitation or support of a minor child, either parent to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and [the] criteria set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-82. . . .\u2019 An award of counsel fees under that statutory provision calls for the exercise of judicial discretion. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>[supra, 69 Conn. App. 150], In exercising its discretion, \u2018the court must consider the statutory criteria set out in \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82 and the parties\u2019 respective financial abilities.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>Berglass </em>v. <em>Berglass, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In the present case, the court specifically stated that its orders were based, in part, on \u00a7 46b-62. Further review, however, is precluded because the record does not reveal the court\u2019s reasoning, specifically, whether or to what extent it considered the criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-82. Although Lambert did request an articulation of that decision on November 3, 1999, the court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>his request, and Lambert failed to seek our review of that denial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u201c[W]here a party is dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation, he may, and indeed under appropriate circumstances he must, seek immediate appeal ... to this court via the motion for review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pospisil </em>v. <em>Pospisil, </em>59 Conn. App. 446, 451-52, 757 A.2d 655, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 940, 761 A.2d 762 (2000). \u201cOur rules provide a procedure for clarifying the record when rulings of the trial court are unclear. ... In addition, our rules provide a procedure for reviewing the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation. . . . When a party is dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation, he [or she] may, and indeed under appropriate circumstances he [or she] must, seek immediate appeal ... to this court via a motion for review. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u201cEven if we assume the validity of this claim, proper utilization of the motion for articulation [and the motion for review] serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal. . . . The burden of securing an adequate record for appellate review of an issue . . . rests with the . . . appellant. . . . Because it is the . . . appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide this court with an adequate record for review . . . we will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the . . . appellant should have remedied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wellington Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redding </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Group, Inc., </em>49 Conn. App. 152, 179-80, 714 A.2d 21, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 905, 720 A.2d 516 (1998). \u201cWithout an adequate record, we can only speculate as to the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision. Our role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 180-81. We, therefore, decline to address the question of whether the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees resulted from an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Lambert\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly failed to rule on his motion for contempt, number 266 in the court file, which alleged that Donahue was in contempt of court for failing to allow visitation on June 3,1999. Lambert argues that, although the court specifically stated that it would consider this motion, it failed to rule on it. Donahue argues that the court did, in effect, rule on the motion because it found that Lambert was not entitled to this visitation. We agree with Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Initially, we note that if Lambert\u2019s argument were correct, this court would be unable to review this claim. The plaintiff cites no authority, nor are we aware of any, that would allow us to decide Lambert\u2019s motion, nor are we aware of any authority that would require us to reverse the judgment on the basis of the court\u2019s failure to decide a pending motion. \u201cAlthough we do not condone a trial court taking an inordinate amount of time to rule on any motion, an appeal is not the proper remedy [for the court\u2019s failure to rule]. Practice Book \u00a7 [60-2 (l)]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> gives this court the power to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the trial court to rule on an undecided motion.\u201d <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>30 Conn. App. 803, 809, 623 A.2d 66 (1993), aff'd, 228 Conn. 436, 635 A.2d 814 (1994). If Lambert\u2019s claim were correct, his remedy, then, would have been by way of motion to this court under Practice Book \u00a7 60-2 (1) for an order to compel the trial court to decide his motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Nevertheless, we do not find Lambert\u2019s claim to be accurate. In its memorandum of decision, the court specifically found, in relation to the allegedly contemptuous event, that \u201c[t]he plaintiff . . . informed the defendant that he wanted to take the child for a long weekend where the child would miss school on the Friday and the mother\u2019s birthday on the Sunday. The mother notified the plaintiff that she did not agree. Absent an agreement as required by the court orders, the plaintiff appeared at the school on the Thursday afternoon to take the child for the weekend. Officers from the West Hartford police department had to be summoned to intervene in the dispute.\u201d The court also found that Lambert\u2019s \u201cidea of an agreement or a compromise is acquiescence to his demands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">After a careful review of the court\u2019s decision, we conclude that, although not specifically mentioned in the decision, the court did, in essence, rule on Lambert\u2019s motion for contempt, number 266, finding in favor of Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\"> As the court explained: \u201cThere have been numerous motions filed starting with the plaintiff in July, 1992, one month after the defendant moved out [of the home that she shared with the plaintiff and their child]. The parties have been engaged in litigation every year since then. They have had numerous contacts with the family services office resulting in several agreements and modifications of those agreements. On July 6, 1998, the court ordered a full custody evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">\u201cTo date, the only thing the parties have agreed on is that they do not communicate. They have been unable or unwilling to agree on anything concerning the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 333223 (October 15, 1999) <em>(Crawford, J.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Each party calls the child by a different name, and \u201cthey have used the child as a messenger between them.\u201d Id. \u201cThe parents have argued about doctor\u2019s visits, the child\u2019s first communion, the child\u2019s class pictures, his enrollment in the Boy Scouts and even his Halloween costume. . . . The child has reported that on one occasion, he overheard the father refer to the mother as a \u2018jackass.\u2019 The child also reported that the mother does not say bad things about the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff seems to believe that he can demand and should have an accounting of every minute of the child\u2019s life when the child is with the mother.
