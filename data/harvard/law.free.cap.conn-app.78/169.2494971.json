Rocque, Jr., the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), placing conditions on the town\u2019s application for permits for a municipal solid waste transfer station. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The following facts are relevant to our discussion. On November 1,1996, the town submitted an application to the waste management bureau of the department of environmental protection (department), pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a, for permits to construct and to operate a municipal solid waste and bulky waste transfer station<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Packer Road in the town. The site was obtained by lease from Yaworski, Inc. (Yaworski),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and abutted a solid waste landfill operated by Yaworski.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>On May 22, 1997, Richard J. Barlow, chief of the waste management bureau, wrote to Neil Dupont, first selectman of Canterbury, stating that the department had made a tentative determination to approve the town\u2019s permit application. Additionally, Barlow reported that due to the significant public interest in the proposal, the commissioner had decided to conduct a public hearing on the town\u2019s application. That correspondence also directed the town to place an official notice of the commissioner\u2019s tentative determination and the hearing date in a newspaper of general circulation. Thereafter, on June 9, 1997, the town caused the publication in the Norwich Bulletin of a \u201cNotice of Tentative Determination and Notice of a Public Hearing.\u201d The notice stated in part: \u201cThe Department of Environmental Protection . . . hereby gives notice [that] it has made a tentative determination to approve an application submitted by the Town of Canterbury . . . under section 22a-208a of the Connecticut General Statutes for permits to construct and operate a solid waste regional transfer station.\u201d In addition, that document informed the public that the department would hold a public hearing on the application in Canterbury on August 18, 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Subsequently, a department hearing officer conducted public hearings on thirty-three days between August 18, 1997, and June 30, 1998, and issued a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>posed final decision on March 31, 1999. During the continued hearing, on February 9,1998, the town sought to introduce, as an exhibit, a petition for a hearing signed by forty-one persons. At the conclusion of the hearings, the hearing officer proposed that the application be granted subject to several conditions, and concluded that if the town adhered to the recommended terms and conditions of the draft permits, the proposed facility would be constructed and operated in accordance with all legal requirements. The first proposed condition related to the adjacent Yaworski landfill<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and recommended that the application not be granted until the Yaworski landfill had been closed pursuant to an approved closure plan, including the installation of an approved landfill gas collection system. Additionally, the hearing officer recommended that certain named individuals and businesses associated with the Yaworski landfill, and responsible for the conditions at that landfill, should be excluded from managing the proposed facility- Finally, the hearing officer proposed that the town, prior to retaining any operator for the transfer station, should submit the name of the proposed operator to the commissioner for his review and written approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The parties filed exceptions to the proposed final decision and requested oral argument. The commissioner then appointed the director of the department\u2019s office of adjudications to render the final decision. On March 16,2001, after briefs and oral argument, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>missioner issued his final decision, granting the town the requested permits subject to the previously recommended conditions. Thereafter, the town appealed to the Superior Court from the commissioner\u2019s decision, challenging the three conditions placed on the issuance of the permits to operate and to construct the transfer station. After briefing and oral argument, the court raised, sua sponte, the issue of whether it had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The court dismissed the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that the town had no statutory right to appeal. The court reasoned that the commissioner\u2019s determination was not a final decision in a contested case under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., and, therefore, that the town was not entitled pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 to appeal to the Superior Court. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be recited as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The question for our determination is whether the statutoiy scheme relating to the permitting process for a solid waste transfer station, as set forth in \u00a7 22-208a (e), contemplates a right to appeal from an adverse determination by the commissioner under the circumstances presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">At the outset, we must first consider the applicable standard of review. \u201cA determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>71 Conn. App. 395, 401, 802 A.2d 184, aff'd, 263 Conn. 692, 822 A.2d 238 (2003). Also, \u201c[i]t is well established that, in determining whether a court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction, eveiy presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stepney Pond Estates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>260 Conn. 406, 417, 797 A.2d 494 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">To begin, we note that there is no common law right to judicial review of administrative determinations. \u201cJudicial review of an administrative decision is a creature of statute.\u201d <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 792, 799, 629 A.2d 367 (1993). \u201cThere is no absolute right of appeal to the courts from a decision of an administrative agency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>238 Conn. 361, 368, 679 A.2d 354 (1996). Therefore, for the Superior Court to have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an administrative determination, there must be statutory authority for such an appeal. Whether an administrative decision is subject to appeal is governed by \u00a7 4-183 (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court as provided in this section. . . .\u201d A \u201cfinal decision\u201d is defined as an \u201cagency determination in a contested case . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A). A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined as \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Resolution of this appeal therefore requires us to determine whether \u00a7 22a-208a requires the commissioner to determine the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party \u201cafter an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2). The question is not answered simply by reference to the fact that a hearing was, indeed, held. Our Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Court has determined that \u201ceven in a case where a hearing is \u2018in fact held, \u2019 in order to constitute a contested case, a party to that hearing must have enjoyed a statutory right to have his \u2018legal rights, duties, or privileges\u2019 determined by that agency holding the hearing. . . . [WJhere no party to a hearing enjoys such a right, the Superior Court is without jurisdiction over any appeal from that agency\u2019s determination. . . . The test for determining contested case status has been well established and requires an inquiry into three criteria, to wit: (1) whether a legal right, duty or privilege is at issue, (2) and is statutorily required to be determined by the agency, (3) through an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 800-801. In other words, the court has read \u00a7 4-166 (2) \u201cas manifesting a legislative intention to limit contested case status to proceedings in which an agency is required by statute to provide an opportunity for a hearing to determine a party\u2019s legal rights or privileges.\u201d Id., 811. \u201cIf a hearing is not statutorily mandated, even if one is gratuitously held, a \u2018contested case\u2019 is not created.\u201d <em>Dadiskos </em>v. <em>Connecticut Real Estate Commission, </em>37 Conn. App. 777, 782, 657 A.2d 717 (1995). Accordingly, if the commissioner conducted the hearing gratuitously and not pursuant to a statutory entitlement to a hearing, the mere fact of the existence of the hearing, alone, would not entitle the applicant to an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We begin our discussion by examination of the statute in question. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying an application [for a solid waste facility] if in his discretion the public interest will be best served thereby, and shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>twenty-five persons. . . .\u201d We note that this section provides a two-pronged route to a hearing: A hearing may be held if the commissioner determines prior to the disposition of an application that there is sufficient public interest to warrant a hearing. Additionally, the statute requires the commissioner to conduct a hearing on receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons. Although the parties disagree as to whether the discretionary portion of the statute establishes a statutory entitlement to a hearing so as to create a contested case, they do not disagree that if the underlying facts support the town\u2019s claim that a hearing was statutorily mandated as a consequence of the filing of a petition with the commissioner on February 9, 1998, then the town would be entitled to judicial review. The commissioner claims, however, that the hearing was conducted pursuant to his discretionary authority and not the mandatory provision. In support of that assertion, the commissioner claims that the request for a hearing was not filed in accordance with the time standard created by department regulations. The commissioner claims that \u00a7 22a-3a-6 (i) (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, pertaining to a request for a hearing concerning the commissioner\u2019s disposition of an application, sets forth the time limit in which a petition for a hearing may be filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a(e). That regulation requires, in part, that a hearing petition must be filed within thirty days of the commissioner\u2019s \u201caction.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-3a-6 (i) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That regulation, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>does not elucidate what event or activity is meant by the term \u201caction.\u201d In this instance, the town filed a petition for a hearing on February 9,1998, substantially more than thirty days after the publication of the commissioner\u2019s tentative decision on the application and his determination to conduct a public hearing due to the substantial public interest in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The court determined that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e) does not create a statutory right to a hearing unless a petition for a public hearing is filed in accordance with the time frame set forth in \u00a7 22-3a-6 (i) of the regulations. The court characterized the hearing actually conducted by the commissioner as gratuitous. Characterizing the commissioner\u2019s issuance of a notice of tentative determination as an \u201caction\u201d in the terms of \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations, the court observed in conjunction with the submission of a petition on February 9, 1998, that \u201c[t]his certainly exceeded the thirty day period for submitting a petition for a hearing, running from an action by the department. The department rule of practice does not contemplate that a gratuitous hearing may be \u2018converted\u2019 into a mandatory one by the filing of a petition for a hearing beyond the thirty day period of the rule.\u201d The court concluded that because the hearing was not mandated, there was no contested case under General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2), and, therefore, no final decision under General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A). Accordingly, the court dismissed the appeal, reasoning that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On appeal, the town argues that the Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear its appeal on the ground that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e) creates a right to a public hearing either by the commissioner\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of sufficient public interest or by the filing of a petition by at least twenty-five individuals, and that although the right to a hearing flows either from the commissioner\u2019s determination of public interest or on the filing of the requisite petition, they have satisfied both prongs of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Our analysis begins with the language of the statute itself as, in this instance, the meaning of the language appears plain and not does not appear amenable to other interpretations by reference to extrinsic sources. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 570, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (en banc). The relevant language is: \u201cThe commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying an application if in his discretion the public interest will be best served thereby, and shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e). As stated, the statute sets forth two independent circumstances in which a hearing may be warranted. They are (1) when the commissioner determines that there is sufficient public interest and (2) when a petition has been timely filed by at least twenty-five persons. Because we believe that in this instance the town\u2019s right to appeal stems from having filed a petition for a hearing on February 9, 1998, before the commissioner\u2019s disposition of the application, we need not discuss whether the discretionary portion of the statute entitling the commissioner to conduct a hearing on the basis of his determination of public interest also constitutes a statutory entitlement to a hearing so as to fit this case within the group of those entitled to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The commissioner argues that the provisions of \u00a7 22a-3a-6 are regulations of the public\u2019s right to petition for a hearing in this circumstance and that because the petition for a hearing was not filed within thirty days of the commissioner\u2019s \u201caction,\u201d the hearing held in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>instance was not statutorily mandated. We disagree. Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s and the court\u2019s assumption, we do not believe that the commissioner\u2019s notice of tentative determination constituted an \u201caction\u201d so as to trigger the thirty day time limit for seeking a public hearing. We come to that conclusion on the basis of the clear language of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e), the language of \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations and our review of the department\u2019s regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Here, the operative statute, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e), provides in relevant part that the commissioner \u201cshall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons. . . .\u201d The commissioner does not argue that this language is ambiguous, nor does he dispute that a hearing conducted pursuant to that provision would entitle a disappointed petitioner to seek judicial review. Rather, the commissioner argues that \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations, requiring that a petition for a hearing be filed within thirty days of the commissioner\u2019s \u201caction,\u201d sets a reasonable parameter to the exercise of that right to a hearing. There can be no doubt that the department is statutorily authorized to adopt rules of practice to govern the manner in which it meets its statutory responsibilities. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-167. For purposes of this discussion, we assume without deciding, that the commissioner could validly adopt a regulation to govern the procedure for submitting a hearing petition pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a. There also is no dispute that \u00a7 22a-3a-6 is a regulation validly adopted by the commissioner. The question remains, however, whether that was violated by the town in this instance. We believe it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We agree with the general proposition that if a board\u2019s time-tested interpretation of a regulation is reasonable, its interpretation should be accorded great weight by the courts. <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Pub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>lic Utility Control, </em>252 Conn. 115, 120, 742 A.2d 1257 (2000). Here, however, the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations is facially unreasonable. That can be seen by reference to the department\u2019s entire regulatory scheme as well as to the underlying procedural facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Contrary to the assertion of the commissioner, we read \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations as requiring a party seeking a hearing to file such a request with the commissioner within thirty days of the disposition of the application and not, as the commissioner urges, within thirty days of his notice of tentative determination. Thus, we believe, the \u201caction\u201d referred to in the regulation is the commissioner\u2019s disposition of the application. The regulation requires one seeking a hearing to attach to the hearing request a \u201ccopy of the commissioner\u2019s letter or other document disposing of the application\u201d and in the request for a hearing to \u201cstate specifically any findings to which the respondent objects and any other grounds for contesting the order or the Commissioner\u2019s disposition of the application. . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-3a-6 (i) (4). If, as the commissioner urges, his \u201caction\u201d is the filing of a tentative determination, one seeking a hearing could never comply with the regulation\u2019s requirement that the hearing requester attach a copy of the commissioner\u2019s disposition or set forth any basis for contesting the commissioner\u2019s disposition because, at that juncture, there would have been no disposition. One would have in hand no more than a tentative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The notion that a request for hearing should be made after the commissioner\u2019s disposition is consistent with the department\u2019s regulations. Section 22a-3a-2 (c) (2) (I) of the regulations provides in relevant part that a proceeding terminates when \u201cthe Commissioner disposes of a license application, unless an opportunity for hearing is provided with respect to such disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>. . . .\u201d Thus, in accord with that regulation, in this case, in which an opportunity for a hearing is provided by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e), the proceedings are not terminated until a hearing has been conducted if one has been timely sought within thirty days of the commissioner\u2019s determination. In sum, a hearing is timely sought if a petition for a hearing is filed within thirty days of the commissioner\u2019s \u201caction,\u201d which, in this case, means his disposition of the license application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">That understanding of the term \u201caction\u201d is buttressed by reference to the utilization of the term \u201caction\u201d in the department\u2019s regulatory scheme. If, as the commissioner urges, \u201caction\u201d means no more than a proposed disposition, the term \u201cproposed\u201d action or \u201cintended\u201d action would have been utilized as it is employed elsewhere in the regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the contrary, the rule on which the commissioner relies in this instance, \u00a7 22a-3-6 of the regulations, does not require one seeking a hearing to make a proper request within thirty days of an \u201cintended\u201d or proposed\u201d action, but rather within thirty days of the action itself. It is a well settled rule of statutory construction, also applicable to regulations, that different sections should be construed in a manner that achieves harmony. See <em>Dept. of Income Mainte</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>nance </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>211 Conn. 323, 328, 558 A.2d 998 (1989); <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 411 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>dissenting). Given the consistent use of the modifiers \u201cproposed\u201d or \u201cintended\u201d in the department\u2019s regulations to signify an event or disposition to take place in the future, it is unreasonable to claim, as does the commissioner, that the term \u201caction\u201d in \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations, without a modifier, means an intended or proposed action. In sum, we believe that the \u201caction\u201d referred to in \u00a7 22a-3a-6 of the regulations means the commissioner\u2019s disposition of the application. Thus, because a petition signed by more than twenty-five persons was submitted to the commissioner prior to his disposition of the town\u2019s application, it was timely filed. Because the petition was filed in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (e), the town was entitled to a hearing on its license application. Accordingly, the commissioner\u2019s disposition of the application was a final determination in a contested case, entitling the town to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\"> A solid waste and bulky waste transfer facility is used to transfer solid waste from a large number of smaller vehicles into a small number of larger vehicles for transportation to other sites for disposal or recycling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-11\"> The commissioner allowed the following parties to intervene in the permit application hearing: Haul of Fame, Inc., Packer Ltd., Quinnebaug Valley Regional Resources, LLC, Denis Yaworski, James Yaworski, Jr., and Rose Yaworski.

In relevant part, the rule provides that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall give prior written notice of revocation to the certified inspector and the chief executive officer or officers employing said inspector setting forth the reasons for the <em>proposed action. </em>Within twenty days of receipt of notification the inspector may request a hearing, and such hearing shall be held if requested. . . (Emphasis added.) See also \u00a7\u00a7 22a-3a-3, 22a-la-l, 22a-231-1 and 22a-39-6 of the regulations, all of which utilize the modifiers \u201cproposed\u201d or \u201cintended\u201d to signify action that has not yet been determined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
