On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly denied their motion to set aside the verdict. Specifically, they argue that the court should have granted the motion because (1) the court improperly rendered judgment against Deborah Tisdale after the jury failed to return any verdict as to her loss of consortium claim, and (2) if the jury did in fact render a verdict with respect to her claim, the verdict, awarding $40,000 in compensatory damages to Jeffrey Tisdale, while presumably awarding $0 to Deborah Tisdale on her claim, was inconsistent, against the manifest weight of the evidence and inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In January, 1977, Jeffrey Tisdale purchased from the defendant a cemetery plot containing two abutting graves. Jeffrey Tisdale\u2019s mother died shortly after he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>purchased the cemetery plot. Jeffrey Tisdale interred his mother\u2019s remains in grave number two.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In October, 1995, Jeffrey Tisdale\u2019s father, James Tisdale, died. Jeffrey Tisdale ordered his father\u2019s remains interred in the remaining grave site, grave number one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While preparing that grave site, however, the defendant\u2019s workers discovered that unknown human remains had been previously buried there. During the memorial service for James Tisdale, on November 3, 1995, but before the casket was lowered into the ground, Jeffrey Tisdale was informed privately about the discovery. Jeffrey Tisdale was assured that the unknown remains would be removed and that the grave site would be prepared for his father\u2019s remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">After the memorial service, the unknown remains were disinterred and reburied in a separate cemetery plot. James Tisdale\u2019s remains were thereafter interred in grave number one. Two years after his father\u2019s death, and after considerable concern, Jeffrey Tisdale ordered his parents\u2019 remains disinterred to ensure that the remains in the two graves were, in fact, his parents\u2019 remains. The remains were identified positively as those of his parents. Jeffrey Tisdale viewed his father\u2019s remains during the identification process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The plaintiffs commenced this action on November 13, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 13, 2001, the plaintiffs filed an amended six count complaint alleging negligence, loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>of consortium, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">After a jury trial, on September 5, 2001, the jury returned a verdict utilizing the supplied plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form. The first question on the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form inquired as to whether the jury had found unanimously in favor either of Jeffrey Tisdale or both Jeffrey Tisdale and Deborah Tisdale. The jury placed a check mark next to Jeffrey Tisdale\u2019s name and awarded him $40,000 in damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury did not complete any portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form with respect to Deborah Tisdale. The court supplied the jury with a defendant\u2019s verdict form, but the jury did not complete any portion of that form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the recording and acceptance of the verdict, the jury responded, \u201cyes,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>when asked whether the verdict, as read, was correct. The court rendered judgment in favor of Jeffrey Tisdale and against Deborah Tisdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion to set aside the verdict on the grounds that the verdict, while not awarding Deborah Tisdale any damages but awarding Jeffrey Tisdale $40,000, was contrary to law, against the weight of the evidence and inadequate. The court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly denied their motion to set aside the verdict because it rendered judgment against Deborah Tisdale after the jury failed to return a verdict with respect to her loss of consortium claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More specifically, they argue that the manner in which the jury completed, or failed to complete, the verdict forms, in light of the jury\u2019s verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>confirmation of the verdict, rendered the verdict unintelligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. During its charge to the jury, the court informed the jurors that they would receive both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s verdict forms. The court instructed the jurors on the proper use of those forms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite the court\u2019s instructions, the jury returned a verdict utilizing only the supplied plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form. The plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form indicated that the jury had found in favor of Jeffrey Tisdale, but did not indicate anything with respect to Deborah Tisdale. The jury awarded him damages totaling $40,000. The court ordered the clerk to read the verdict to the jmy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the clerk read the verdict, the clerk did not mention Deborah Tisdale. The jurors acknowledged that they had found in favor of Jeffrey Tisdale and had awarded him $40,000. The court accepted and then ordered the verdict recorded. The clerk reread the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form to the jury. This time, however, the clerk added that \u201cas to Deborah Tisdale, loss of consortium, noneconomic damages, nothing.\u201d The jury again affirmatively stated that this was its verdict. At no time did the plaintiffs object to the form or substance of the accepted verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record indicates that the court accepted the verdict without comment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The proper appellate standard of review when considering the action of a court granting or denying a motion to set aside a verdict and for a new trial is the abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Bolmer </em>v. <em>McKulsky, </em>74 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>App. 499, 510, 812 A.2d 869, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 954, 818 A.2d 780 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">During the hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the court stated that the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form required the juiy to check either Jeffrey Tisdale or both Jeffrey Tisdale and Deborah Tisdale. The court noted that the jury followed that instruction and checked only Jeffrey Tisdale. The court indicated that the jury, by checking only Jeffrey Tisdale, and leaving all portions of that form blank with respect to Deborah Tisdale, clearly indicated a verdict solely for Jeffrey Tisdale. The fact that the jury did not complete the defendant\u2019s verdict form, the court stated, was merely \u201cform over substance.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded, on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form and the jury\u2019s verbal assent, that the jury had returned a defendant\u2019s verdict as to Deborah Tisdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the verdict was unintelligible because the verdict forms were incomplete and inconsistent, resulting in a verdict that was defective, not merely as a matter of form, but rather, defective as a matter of law. To guide our analysis in determining whether the verdict was defective as a matter of law, we examine the pertinent case law. A verdict is not defective as a matter of law as long as it contains \u201can intelligible finding so that its meaning is clear.\u201d <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Kalinowski, </em>136 Conn. 405, 409, 71 A.2d 593 (1950). A verdict will be deemed \u201cintelligible if it clearly manifests the intent of the jury.\u201d <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>32 Conn. App. 373, 379 n.5, 629 A.2d 465 (1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 229 Conn. 829, 643 A.2d 1276 (1994). We note that if a verdict is defective in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>form alone, rather than as a matter of law, the parties should have objected at a time when the mistake could have been corrected. See <em>Nigro </em>v. <em>Hagearty, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 609, 610, 364 A.2d 241 (1976); see also <em>Mallinson </em>v. <em>Black, </em>41 Conn. App. 373, 381, 675 A.2d 937 (1996) (plaintiffs counsel polled jury to clarify uncertainty in verdict). \u201cWe have repeatedly indicated our disfavor with the failure, whether because of a mistake of law, inattention or design, to object to errors occurring in the course of a trial until it is too late for them to be corrected, and thereafter, if the outcome of the trial proves unsatisfactory, with the assignment of such errors as grounds of appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Shaker Real Estate, Inc., </em>47 Conn. App. 489, 497, 705 A.2d 210 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We conclude that because the verdict, as rendered, clearly manifests the jury\u2019s intent, the verdict was intelligible and the defect was only a matter of form. Turning first to the manner in which the forms were prepared by the jury, we conclude that the verdict forms are consistent. The jury prepared the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions. The jury\u2019s response on that form, read in light of the court\u2019s instructions, could indicate only a verdict in favor of Jeffrey Tisdale and a verdict against Deborah Tisdale. Had the jury intended to find iri favor of Deborah Tisdale, it would have placed a check mark next to her name. Compare <em>Bolmer </em>v. <em>McKulsky, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 508-509 (inconsistent verdict forms yield unintelligible verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Additionally, with reference to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument as to incompleteness, the fact that the jury did not fill out the defendant\u2019s verdict form does not make the verdict forms inconsistent or unintelligible. The verdict, as rendered on the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form, alone, disposes of the issues as to each plaintiff. Compare <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>143 Conn. 114, 117, 119 A.2d 912 (1956) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>(verdict forms disposed of issues as related to only one of two defendants). To support their argument that the failure to complete the defendant\u2019s verdict form resulted in an unintelligible verdict, the plaintiffs cite <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>158 Conn. 553, 264 A.2d 556 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In <em>Elliot, </em>the plaintiff brought two causes of action sounding in negligence against a defendant child and the child\u2019s parents. Id., 554. In the first count, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant child negligently had kindled a fire in the plaintiffs home. Id. In the second count, the plaintiff claimed that the parents negligently had failed to maintain control of their child. Id. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and against the child, on the first count. Id. The court accepted and recorded the verdict. Id. The jury, however, failed to return a verdict with respect to the child\u2019s parents. Id. Nevertheless, the court rendered judgment for the parents on the second count. Id. On appeal, our Supreme Court held that the trial court had given inadequate jury instructions concerning the verdict forms. Id., 555. Consequently, the court concluded that \u201cthe jury\u2019s failure to render a verdict for or against the parents cannot be interpreted in any manner other than a failure to find on one of the material issues of the case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">By citing <em>Elliot, </em>the plaintiffs appear to equate the jury\u2019s failure to complete the defendant\u2019s verdict form to the jury\u2019s failure, in <em>Elliott, </em>to fully dispose of the issues. We are not persuaded by that comparison. Significantly, in <em>Elliot, </em>the court applied the principle that \u201ca verdict, once returned, may be construed with reference to the instructions pursuant to which it was rendered.\u201d Id. The instructions in <em>Elliot </em>were deemed inadequate because the verdict, read in light of the proffered instructions, could be construed only with respect to the child. By contrast, in this case, the plaintiff does not claim that the instructions were inadequate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>verdict, read in light of the instructions given, can be construed in a manner whereby it is dispositive as to <em>both </em>plaintiffs. Compare <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>supra, 143 Conn. 117 (verdicts deemed plainly defective where completed verdict form failed to dispose of the issue concerning which of two defendants was hable); see also <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>115 Conn. 704, 704, 161 A. 100 (1932) (verdict defective where verdict did not fully dispose of issues in case).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Even if we were to conclude that the forms were inconsistent, the transcript indicates that the court clerk twice announced the verdict for the assent of the jurors. Both times the jurors orally agreed, on the record, that this was their verdict. In the absence of disagreement stated on the record, the jury is taken to have assented to the verdict as announced by the court. See <em>McCaskey Register Co. </em>v. <em>Keena, </em>81 Conn. 656, 659-60, 71 A. 898 (1909) (jurors not bound to signed verdict form; rather, verdict is what jurors assent to in open court). The clerk inquired on two occasions, in two different ways, whether the verdict, as read by him, was correct. By assenting to the verdict as read, the jury twice confirmed that the clerk\u2019s interpretation of the verdict forms was correct. Additionally, the court accepted the verdict. \u201cAcceptance of the verdict signifies that the court views it as satisfactorily responding to the issues in the case.\u201d <em>Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Millstein, </em>19 Conn. App. 283, 289, 562 A.2d 551 (1989). In that manner, a double safeguard is provided against mistake. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>120 Conn. 537, 539, 181 A. 716 (1935). Accordingly, the jury\u2019s failure to complete the defendant\u2019s verdict form did not constitute a substantive defect. See <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Hotel Pick Arms, Inc., </em>147 Conn. 72, 74, 157 A.2d 106 (1959) (\u201c[a]mple opportunity is thus afforded, and designedly so, for the court, counsel, and the jurors to comprehend the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>and to cure any misunderstanding before the final assent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Still, the plaintiffs argue that although the jury twice verbally assented to the verdict, the verdict was read to the juiy inconsistently. On the basis of that distinction and considering the manner in which the forms were completed, the plaintiffs argue that there exists an ambiguity that precludes an intelligible verdict despite the jury\u2019s verbal assent. We disagree. The clerk\u2019s use of the word \u201cnothing\u201d with respect to Deborah Tisdale, on the ground that the jury did not place a check mark next to her name, has two possible meanings: (1) the jury found in favor of Jeffrey Tisdale and not Deborah Tisdale; or (2) the clerk attempted to correct the defect, failure to complete the defendant\u2019s verdict form, in light of the jury\u2019s silence with respect to Deborah Tisdale on the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form. If it is the former, then we believe that the juiy\u2019s verbal assent vitiates any ambiguity, as the verdict is said to be what the jury assented to in open court. If it is the latter, then the clerk properly corrected the technical informality in the jury\u2019s written verdict. See <em>Watertown Ecclesiastical Society\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>46 Conn. 230 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>Watertown Ecclesiastical Society\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>following acceptance of the verdict by the court, the clerk read the jury the written verdict. Id., 232. The clerk stated that the jury had found for the appellee in the amount of $1674. Id. The jury assented to the verdict as read and accepted despite the fact that the verdict form indicated that the jury awarded the appellee \u201csixteen and seventy-four dollars.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 233. On appeal, our Supreme Court held that the clerk merely corrected an informality in the form and that the jury\u2019s acceptance of the corrected verdict, as read by the clerk, was proper. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Similarly, the clerk in this case, acting on behalf of the court, corrected the technical informality and read the verdict forms to the jury twice in open court. Each time that the verdict was read to the jury, the court asked the jurors whether the verdict, as read to them, was their verdict. \u201cUnder the procedure for receiving, accepting and recording a verdict . . . the final assent of the jurors, given after the verdict has been read aloud by the clerk, accepted and ordered recorded by the court . . . makes the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Josephson </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>180 Conn. 302, 309, 429 A.2d 877 (1980), quoting <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Hotel Pick Arms, Inc., </em>supra, 147 Conn. 74. We therefore conclude that the defect was not a matter of law, but instead a matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">With that conclusion in mind, we note that during oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff conceded the fact that he should have reviewed the verdict forms and that he would do so in the future.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we previously stated, given that the defect was one of form only, we do not look favorably on grounds for appeal arising in the absence of timely objections at trial. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Shaker Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 497 (plaintiffs not able to prevail on claim that they were entitled to new trial where, after jury discharged, court recalled jury to correct incomplete caption on verdict form).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was not defective as a matter of law. The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly denied their motion to set aside the verdict because if the jury did in fact return a verdict with respect to Deborah Tisdale\u2019s claim, the verdict, awarding $40,000 in compensatory damages to Jeffrey Tisdale, while presumably awarding $0 to Deborah Tisdale for her loss of consortium claim, was inconsistent, against the manifest weight of the evidence and inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">That claim presumes that the jury returned a plaintiffs\u2019 verdict in favor of Deborah Tisdale, but awarded her no damages. To reach the conclusion urged by the plaintiff, we (1) would have to speculate that the jury ignored the court\u2019s instructions, (2) would have to speculate that the jury reached a verdict in favor of Deborah Tisdale without completing any portion of the form as to her, (3) would have to read into the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form a check mark next to Deborah Tisdale\u2019s name and (4) would have to speculate that the jury intended its silence, concerning damages, to imply a written \u201c$0\u201d or \u201czero.\u201d Our law is clear that we are not permitted to speculate, as the plaintiff urges us to do. See <em>Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Millstein, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 290 (reviewing court will not speculate about jury\u2019s intentions); <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>51 Conn. App. 733, 753, 725 A.2d 975 (1999) (reviewing court will not speculate about trial court\u2019s impressions). Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"> Prior to November 2, 1995, there was in fact an unrecorded burial in grave number one. Jeffrey Tisdale testified that no one in the family had been buried next to his mother in grave number one. The defendant\u2019s representative, Ellen Pagliaro, indicated that the unknown person had been buried in grave site number one some time between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> In the original eight count complaint, the plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, negligence, loss of consortium, fraudulent concealment, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass, conversion and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> The jury completed the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Asg\">\u201cPLAINTIFFS\u2019 VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In this case the Jury unanimously finds in favor of: (Check either Jeffrey Tisdale or both).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u2713 Jeffrey Tisdale</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">_Deborah Tisdale</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">1) As to Jeffrey Tisdale</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Past and future economic damages: $ 25.000</p>\n<p id=\"A1K\">Past and future noneconomic damages: $ 15.000</p>\n<p id=\"AsD\">TOTAL $ 40.000</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Punitive damages, if any, $_</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">(Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">2) As to Deborah Tisdale</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">Loss of consortium noneconomic damages $_</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">fSigned bv foreperson! 9/5/2001\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-16\"> The defendant\u2019s verdict form, which was not filled out, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">\u201cDEFENDANT'S VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">(If this form is used, check the one that applies)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-19\">_The jury unanimously finds against the plaintiffs Jeffrey Tisdale and Deborah Tisdale and in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">_The Jury unanimously finds against the plaintiff Deborah Tisdale only and in favor of the defendant, on her loss of consortium claim for her failure to prove her claim by a fair preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Akb\">riJnsignedl\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"> We note that although Deborah Tisdale failed to object at trial and failed to expressly raise that specific issue in her written motion to set aside the verdict, the court raised and addressed the issue on the record during the hearing on the motion. We also note, however, that the record fails to contain either a written memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the court stating its reasons for denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict. \u201cThe duty to provide [the Appellate Court] with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant.\u201d <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 607, 710 A.2d 190 (1998). This court frequently has declined to review claims when the appellant has failed to provide an adequate record for review. See <em>Emigrant Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>46 Conn. App. 51, 53-54, 696 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 921, 701 A.2d 341 (1997). On occasion, we have reviewed claims of error in light of an unsigned transcript as long as the transcript contains a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with its decision. See <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Browder, </em>30 Conn. App. 776, 778-79, 622 A.2d 588 (1993). In this case, the parties had the opportunity to argue their respective positions concerning the motion, and the court made its ruling on the record. The transcript from that hearing adequately reveals the basis of the court\u2019s conclusions. Therefore, in light of the sufficiently detailed transcript, we consider the issue preserved for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> With respect to the verdict forms, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u201cThe Court: You will be receiving verdict forms. There will be a plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form and a defendant\u2019s verdict form. If you find the issues for the plaintiffs, you will use the plaintiffs\u2019 verdict form. On this form, you will also see a place for punitive damages, if you award them.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u201cAs to Mrs. Tisdale, if you find for her on the loss of consortium claim, you should check her name on the plaintiffs verdict form and fill in the dollar amount for her loss of consortium damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u201cIf you find in favor of the defendant, either against both plaintiffs or against Deborah Tisdale only, you should use the defendant\u2019s verdict form.

That is to say, even if you were to find against the defendant on more than one of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against it, you may make only a single award of compensatory damages and a single award of punitive damages, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">\u201cThe foreperson of the jury must sign the verdict forms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\"> \u201cThe Clerk: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is your verdict as it is read.

The court reviewed the verdict forms and, other than requesting the jurors to total the two damages figures, did not express any concern with the correctness or completeness of the forms. We can determine, therefore, that the court believed that the verdict was technically correct despite the jury\u2019s failure to complete the defendant\u2019s verdict form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b278-15\"> We note that although the plaintiffs\u2019 September 17, 2001 motion was labeled a motion to set aside the verdict, the plaintiffs should have labeled the motion as one to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. Despite the inaccurate label, the court properly considered the substance of relief sought in the subject motion that also requested a new trial. See <em>Drahan </em>v. <em>Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>of Education, </em>42 Conn. App. 480, 489, 680 A.2d 316 (when case requires court to determine nature of pleading filed by party, courts not required to accept precise label affixed to that pleading by moving party), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 921, 682 A.2d 1000 (1996). We will therefore treat it as a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> During oral argument, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we got to court on the motion to set aside that we actually saw the physical forms. . . . Both of us are going to make sure we look at the forms in future cases. At the time, they weren\u2019t viewed, and it was assumed that the clerk was reading from what he had. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
