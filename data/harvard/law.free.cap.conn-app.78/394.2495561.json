Douglas S. Young,</author>\n<p id=\"AO9\">the plaintiff in AC 23121 and the named defendant in AC 23123, appeals from the judgment of the trial court in AC 23121 denying his application for a wilt of audita querela<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the judgment of the trial court in AC 23123 denying his motion to open the judgment in a summary process action. He claims that the court improperly concluded that an escrow agreement between himself and his mother, Rosemary Young, the defendant in AC 23121 and the plaintiff in AC 23123, no longer existed and, therefore, he could not complete the terms of the agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court denying the apphcation for audita querela and dismiss the appeal from the denial of the motion to open the summary process judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">These appeals come to this court after a long history of htigation between the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fohowing facts are relevant to the resolution of these appeals. The property that is the subject of these appeals is at 28 Lighthouse Point, Fairfield. The property is owned by Rosemary Young, the mother of Douglas Young. Douglas Young currently lives in a house on the property with his wife and children. On October 19, 1994, the mother and son entered into an agreement to transfer ownership of the property to the son. At that time, the mother signed a quitclaim deed transferring ownership of the property, and the son\u2019s attorney, acting as escrow agent, was to hold the deed until the terms of the agreement were completed. The terms of the escrow agreement were not completed and, on April 22, 1997, the mother instituted a summary process action, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a, seeking to evict the son and his family from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The court found that the quitclaim deed did not divest the mother of ownership of the property because the deed was given to the son\u2019s attorney to be held in escrow until he paid $12,000 to the attorney. The court concluded that the son\u2019s prior right or privilege of possession had terminated and, on April 17,1998, rendered judgment of possession in favor of the mother. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>64 Conn. App. 651, 652-54, 781 A.2d 342, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 908, 782 A.2d 1255 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">On April 20, 1998, the son filed a motion to reargue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-11. On May 4, 1998, the trial court denied the son\u2019s motion to reargue, and the son appealed to this court. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 654.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On remand from the Supreme Court, this court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and concluded that there had been an escrow agreement between the parties, that there was no delivery of a quitclaim deed from the mother to the son and, therefore, that the son did not own the property. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 652. This court did not address the current status of the escrow agreement and whether the terms could still be completed. See footnote 6. This court\u2019s decision was officially released on July 31, 2001. On August 3, 2001, the son tendered the sum of $12,000 to the escrow agent\u2019s former law firm accompanied by a letter from his attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>son obtained the quitclaim deed and recorded it in the land records on October 1, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On May 3, 2002, the son filed a motion to open the judgment and a motion to substitute himself for his mother as the party plaintiff, alleging that he was the holder of legal record title to the property and that summary process is a remedy available only to an \u201cowner.\u201d The court held a hearing on May 22, 2002. According to the son\u2019s attorney, if the court granted his motion to open the judgment and to substitute himself as the party plaintiff, the son would then withdraw the action. The court responded, \u201cOh, come on. We can\u2019t do that. There\u2019s really a fraud on the court to even suggest that. I\u2019m concerned.\u201d On the same day, the court denied the son\u2019s motion. In AC 23123, the son appealed from the court\u2019s denial of the motion to open the judgment. The issues and arguments involved in appealing from the court\u2019s denial of the motion to open the judgment are identical to those discussed in AC 23121.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The son did not file a motion for articulation, and the brief is grossly inadequate. That appeal, AC 23123, therefore is dismissed. See <em>Rosenblit </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>57 Conn. App. 788, 796, 750 A.2d 1131, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 906, 755 A.2d 882 (2000); see also <em>Resurreccion </em>v. <em>Normandy Heights, LLC, </em>76 Conn. App. 642, 647-48, 820 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 917, 826 A.2d 1159 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We now turn our attention to AC 23121. The following additional facts are relevant to that appeal. On April 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>1998, the trial court rendered judgment of possession in favor of the mother in the summary process action. The court\u2019s judgment also addressed the current validity of the escrow agreement. The court found that there had been no delivery of the deed to the son, and that he had abandoned bis claim of complete ownership and had sought a life estate in the property. The court stated, inter alia: \u201cClearly, by this time [the son] had abandoned any notion of having acquired title by the quitclaim deed, which was executed October 19, 1994. The court infers that even [the son] realized that the deed had not been delivered and that more than a reasonable time had passed from the time of the quitclaim deed execution in October, 1994, to November, 1996, when he was willing to negotiate a rental amount for the subject premises.\u201d The court also concluded that because delivery of the quitclaim deed had not taken place, the mother was free to alter the conditions of the escrow. The court stated: \u201cSince there was no delivery, there could be not be a valid conveyance, and until the time of delivery, the [mother] could withdraw or nullify the pending transfer by her acts and deeds, such as the institution of eviction against the [son].\u201d In concluding, the court stated succinctly: \u201cThe quitclaim deed is not valid. There is no quitclaim deed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Following this court\u2019s prior decision and the son\u2019s recording of the deed in the land records, the son initiated a separate action by filing an application for writ of audita querela on May 3, 2002, claiming that he was the holder of legal record title to the property and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>therefore, that summary process execution should not be allowed to proceed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">On May 22, 2002, the court held a hearing on the application for the writ of audita querela. The court heard testimony from both the mother and the son. The court concluded that the son did not come to court with clean hands and that \u201cthe [son] knew that this court had decided in a summary process action, which preceded the audita querela, for its application now being made. [The son] knew this court had ruled there was no escrow. The escrow agreement had been revoked, if no other way than by the institution of a summary process case. There was no escrow.\u201d The court also concluded that the original escrow agreement had been altered when the mother changed her demand from $12,000 to $50,000. The court found that the son knew that the original agreement had changed and therefore that he was not acting in good faith when he acquired the deed. On the basis of those conclusions, the court denied the son\u2019s application for a writ of audita querela. The son appealed from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">On appeal, the son claims that the court improperly concluded that an escrow agreement between himself and his mother no longer existed and therefore that he could not complete the terms of the agreement. The son argues that the terms of the escrow agreement could not be altered or revoked once the deed was placed in the escrow agent\u2019s possession.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>argues that he has completed the terms of the agreement and duly recorded the deed to the property. The mother argues that the court was correct when it stated that the parties had abandoned the escrow agreement. We agree with the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion that the parties abandoned an agreement ordinarily is a question of fact. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Cormier, </em>189 Conn. 371, 373, 456 A.2d 277 (1983). The decision of the court involved a factual determination concerning the status of an escrow agreement, and our standard of review is whether the court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous. \u201c[W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . . We also must determine whether those facts correctly found are, as a matter of law, sufficient to support the judgment. . . . Although we give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses ... we will not uphold a factual determination if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Alander, </em>75 Conn. App. 864, 869, 818 A.2d 106, cert. granted on other grounds, 264 Conn. 901, 823 A.2d 1219 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">One manner in which an escrow agreement can be deemed invalid is by the actions of the parties subject to the agreement. \u201cAn escrow executed and deposited upon a valuable consideration is not revocable except according to the terms of the agreement and deposit. However, an escrow agreement may be mutually abandoned by the parties to it. The abandonment need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>be marked with a formality equal to that used in establishing an escrow; any conduct inconsistent with the escrow is sufficient for the court to conclude it was abandoned, and thus, even if parties did not expressly agree to waive the escrow conditions or to abandon the agreement, a court may consider whether the facts sustain such an implication.\u201d 28 Am. Jur. 2d, Escrow \u00a7 8 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">This court and our Supreme Court have addressed the issue of mutual abandonment of an agreement. \u201cMutual assent to abandon a contract, like mutual assent to form one, may be inferred from the attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties. . . . Our Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion . . . that parties are free to terminate an agreement by mutual assent has been followed in later cases. [T]he well-established rule [is] that rescission or abandonment of contracts, like entry into a contractual relation, depends upon the intent of the parties and that the relevant intent is to be inferred from the attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith &amp; Smith Building Corp. </em>v. <em>DeLuca, </em>36 Conn. App. 839, 842-43, 654 A.2d 368 (1995); see also <em>Herman S. Newman &amp; Partners, P. C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 762, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The court found that both parties had acted as if the escrow agreement no longer was in effect. The mother\u2019s attorney informed the escrow agent that the original demand of $12,000 for the property had been modified to $50,000. The escrow agent then communicated that modification to the son in writing and awaited the payment of $50,000. The mother altered the terms of the agreement, began eviction proceedings against the son and his wife and demanded rent. On February 19,1997, more than two years after the escrow agreement originally was executed, the son\u2019s attorney wrote a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to the mother, stating that \u201c[the son\u2019s] claim is that [the mother] wrote them a letter that they were to have use of [the property] during [the mother\u2019s] lifetime as long as they would pay the expenses relating to mortgage, insurance, etc.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The son\u2019s letter was an attempt to enforce that agreement concerning a life estate or to negotiate a new agreement. The letter does not mention ownership of the property or mention the deed held in escrow. It is obvious that the son did not consider the terms of the escrow agreement still to be effective. The court was correct when it stated that both parties had abandoned the escrow agreement to transfer the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The son cannot attempt to enforce an agreement after both parties\u2019 conduct has indicated that they have abandoned all claims to the agreement. The conclusion by the court that the parties abandoned the escrow agreement was supported by the evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The appeal in AC 23123 is dismissed and the judgment in AC 23121 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> \u201cA wit of audita querela is a writ issued to afford a remedy to a defendant against whom judgment had been rendered, but who had new matter in defense . . . arising, or at least raisable for the first time, after judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ruiz </em>v. <em>Gatling, </em>73 Conn.

Only Douglas Young appealed from the court\u2019s decision to deny his motion to open the judgment in the summary process action. The second action, AC 23121, involved an application for a writ of audita querela filed by Douglas Young, alleging that he is the true owner of the property that is the subject of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">In a third action, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff wrongfully obtained the deed to the property.

In said file is the original deed from [the plaintiff] to my client. Enclosed please find a bank check made payable to your firm as Trustee in the amount of $12,000.

The son has confused the delivery of an inter vivos gift and a deed held in escrow. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment that an escrow agreement had been formed. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 652. The son is attempting to litigate for a second time, in this court, the issue of whether the agreement between the parties to the transfer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the properly was an inter vivos gift. Res judicata, therefore, applies, and that argument will not be addressed. See <em>Nastro </em>v. <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>76 Conn.
