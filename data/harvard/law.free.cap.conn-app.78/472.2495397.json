On appeal, the defendant claims that the board improperly affirmed the decision of the commissioner because the commissioner incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>rectly applied the \u201cdate of injury rule\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> instead of the \u201cdate of disability rule\u201d espoused in <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. Electric, </em>231 Conn. 529, 651 A.2d 254 (1994). We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The commissioner found the following facts. The plaintiff suffered a compensable back injury on February 27, 1988, while employed as a bakery chef in the defendant\u2019s grocery store. On August 28,1990, the commissioner approved 117 weeks of benefits to compensate the plaintiff for a 22.5 percent permanent partial impairment incurred as a result of the 1988 injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The commissioner adjudicated the plaintiff to be totally disabled since January 3,1994, within the meaning of \u00a7 31-307. The commissioner also found (1) that the plaintiff became eligible for social security retirement benefits when he attained the requisite age of sixty-five on June 17,1998, and (2) that the social security retirement offset contained in \u00a7 31-307 (e) did not apply to the plaintiff because that statutory subsection was enacted in 1993 after the plaintiff had suffered his disabling injury. The findings of the commissioner were affirmed on appeal by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the date of total disability controls the applicability of \u00a7 31-307 (e). The defendant contends that the statute applies to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tiff because he was rendered totally disabled after the enactment of \u00a7 31-307 (e). See Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 16 (P.A. 93-228). To support its contention, the defendant argues that our Supreme Court abandoned the \u201cdate of injury rule,\u201d which traditionally applies to workers\u2019 compensation statutes, in <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. Electric, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 529. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The plaintiff contends that \u00a7 31-307 (e) does not apply because his injury occurred prior to the subsection\u2019s effective date, which was July 1, 1993. See P.A. 93-228, \u00a7 35. We conclude that the date of injury is the controlling date and, therefore, that \u00a7 31-307 (e) does not apply to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">At the outset, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the [board]. To the extent that the [board] has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the [board] draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New London </em>v. <em>Picinich, </em>76 Conn. App. 678, 683, 821 A.2d 782 (2003). Clearly, the defendant\u2019s appeal involves a question of law. We have stated: \u201cWhere ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McEnemey </em>v. <em>United States Surgical Corp., </em>72 Conn. App. 611, 614, 805 A.2d 816, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 916, 811 A.2d 1292 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal hinges on whether \u00a7 31-307 (e) applies retroactively. Before we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>reach that issue, we note <em>that Mulligan </em>is not dispositive of the issue before us. The precise issue addressed in <em>Mulligan </em>was \u201cwhether an injured employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefit rate . . . should be determined ... by reference to the employee\u2019s earnings preceding the date on which he was injured or preceding the date on which he became incapacitated.\u201d <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. </em>Electric, supra, 231 Conn. 532. The <em>Mulligan </em>court simply utilized the date of total disability as a mere component in the calculation of the workers\u2019 compensation benefit rate; therefore, it does not follow that the date of injury rule has been abandoned. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 112, 119, 687 A.2d 550 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 245 Conn. 66, 712 A.2d 938 (1998). Hence, <em>Mulligan </em>is not applicable to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We must now address the issue of whether \u00a7 31-307 (e) is applicable to the plaintiff because his injury was suffered five years prior to the enactment of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">To resolve that issue, we are guided by well defined principles of statutory construction. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 302, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). We begin by noting that a recently enacted statute, which imposes a new obligation on any person, shall not be construed to have a retrospective effect. General Statutes \u00a7 55-3. In addition, our Supreme Court has stated that when interpreting a workers\u2019 compensation statute, it is an \u201caccepted principle that a statute affecting substantive rights is to be applied only prospectively unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>250 Conn. 753, 757, 738 A.2d 618 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Our Supreme Court recently set forth the proper analysis for statutory interpretation and legislative intent in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(2003) (en banc). The analysis requires us to \u201clook to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577. Our determination of whether \u00a7 31-307 (e) applies prospectively is guided by the aforementioned principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Traditionally, the rights and obligations of the employer and employee are assessed at the date of injury. \u201cThe contract of employment incorporates the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [(act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.] . . . .\u201d <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 649, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975). \u201cThe rights and obligations of both parties to the contract are fixed and determined by the contractual and statutory provisions in force at the time the employee is injured.\u201d Id. Procedural lights under the act do not vest at the time of injury. See <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 758. Consequently, in the workers\u2019 compensation context, \u201cthe date of injury rule . . . functions as a presumption of legislative intent . . . against retroactive application of a statute.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">To determine whether the statute affects a substantive or procedural right, we look at the right or remedy involved in the legislation. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Forman School, </em>54 Conn. App. 841, 854-55, 738 A.2d 697 (1999). In <em>Dams, </em>we stated that \u201ca substantive law creates, defines and regulates rights while a procedural law prescribes the methods of enforcing such rights or obtaining redress.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We went on to state that \u201c[w]here the amendment is not substantive . . . not directed to the right itself, but rather to the remedy, it is generally considered a distinctly procedural matter.\u201d Id., 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The statutory subsection at issue clearly affects an employer\u2019s substantive right to reduce the compensation benefits of a disabled worker once the employee becomes eligible for social security retirement benefits. Hence, absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary, the defendant\u2019s right to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s compensation must have vested on the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Our Supreme Court declared \u00a7 31-307 (e) to be constitutional in <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 346-47, 819 A.2d 803 (2003). There, the Supreme Court discussed the legislative purpose and policy that gave rise to \u00a7 31-307 (e). The statute was enacted during an effort by the legislature to reform the act. Id., 346. The goal of the reformation was to ease the economic burden that the act imposed on employers. Id.; see also P.A. 93-228, \u00a7 16. \u201cThere is no legislative history referencing any specific intent with respect to the offset, now codified in \u00a7 31-307 (e). . . . The only legislative histoiy that expressly addresses the offset merely reflects that the legislature was aware of similar offset provisions in other jurisdictions . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 347. Because the legislative history is not helpful to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal, we look at the relationship of the statute to the existing legislation and common-law rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">A statute is enacted as a whole and must be read as a whole rather than as separate parts or sections. <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 760. Similarly, when the court engages in statutory analysis, it \u201cconsider[s] the statute as a whole . . . [and reconciles] its . . . parts ... to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Forman, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-307 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f any injury for which compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>tion is provided under the provisions of this chapter <em>results in total incapacity </em>to work, there shall be paid to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of his average weekly earnings <em>at the time of the injury </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, the commissioner found that the compensable injury suffered by the plaintiff in 1988 <em>resulted in </em>his total incapacity to work as of 1994. Pursuant to <em>Chieppo, </em>the rights and obligations of both parties were fixed as of the date of injury, February 27,1988. Subsection (e) of \u00a7 31-307, enacted in 1993, must be applied prospectively because it impacts substantive rights. For that reason, \u00a7 31-307 (e) does not apply to the plaintiff. We conclude that the decision of the board was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\"> Royal Insurance Company also is a defendant, but is not a party to the present appeal. We therefore refer in this opinion to Waldbaum\u2019s, Inc., as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-307 (e) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, compensation paid to an employee for an employee\u2019s total incapacity shall be reduced while the employee is entitled to receive old age insurance benefits pursuant to the federal Social Security Act. The amount of each reduced workers\u2019 compensation payment shall equal the excess, if any, of the workers\u2019 compensation payment over the old age insurance benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> \u201cThe date of injury rule is a rule of statutory construction that establishes a presumption that new workers\u2019 compensation legislation affecting rights and obligations as between the parties, and not specifying otherwise, applie[s] only to those persons who received injuries after the legislation became effective, and not to those injured previously.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>250 Conn. 753, 756 n.5, 738 A.2d 618 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> The 22.5 percent partial impairment was derived from a compromise between the 20 percent disability presented by the defendant\u2019s physician and the 25 percent impairment offered by the plaintiffs physician.
