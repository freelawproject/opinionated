We conclude that a petition for certification is required in such cases. Consequently, we dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">On September 19, 2002, the defendant zoning board of appeals of the town of Avon (zoning board) granted a variance to the defendants Audrey V. Thompson and Wheeler Service Corporation, thereby permitting the subject property to be divided into two lots without meeting the town\u2019s density requirements. Thereafter, the plaintiffs, Mark E. Christensen, Mary D. Christensen and Dorothy B. Christensen, all of whom are adjacent property owners, appealed from the zoning board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-8. The plaintiffs commenced the appeal process by serving a civil summons, a separate citation and the appeal on the defendants on October 4, 2002. The summons, citation and appeal all designated the New Britain Superior Court as the court to which the appeal was returnable and October 29, 2002, as the return date. Apparently, however, there was some confusion at the clerk\u2019s office in New Britain, and the plaintiffs ultimately returned the appeal papers to the Hartford Superior Court on October 25,2002, less than six days prior to the specified return date in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-46a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The plaintiffs attempted to cure the defects in the appeal by filing a \u201cnotice of amendment as of right to the appeal and complaint,\u201d (notice) stating that they were amending the return date to November 12, 2002, and the designation of the judicial district and court address to the \u201cJudicial District of Hartford at Hartford\u201d and \u201c95 Washington Street, Hartford, CT 06106,\u201d respectively. Attached to the notice was a copy of the amended appeal, along with a civil summons form and the original complaint, reflecting the stated changes. The plaintiffs, however, did not amend the separate citation, nor did they serve the amended documents by a proper or indifferent person in hand or at the defendants\u2019 abode<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-72, 52-54, 52-57 and 8-8 (f).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants Wheeler Service Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ration and Thompson filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On January 28, 2003, the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The court reasoned that because the plaintiffs\u2019 amended documents were not served in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 52-54 and 52-57, the amendment was of no effect. Consequently, the court found that because the original appeal was returned to the clerk of the Superior Court less than six days prior to the October 29, 2002 return date, in violation of \u00a7 52-46a, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The court, therefore, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On February 14, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a direct appeal to this court from the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal. Subsequently, on March 3, 2003, the defendants Thompson and Wheeler Service Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, arguing that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because the plaintiffs failed to file a petition for certification, as required by \u00a7 8-8 (o). The plaintiffs oppose the motion to dismiss, claiming that the certification requirement of \u00a7 8-8 (o) applies only after there has been a trial court ruling on the merits of the appeal from the zoning board\u2019s decision. The plaintiffs contend that because the court did not reach the merits of the appeal from the zoning board\u2019s decision in this case and because they are simply seeking review of the court\u2019s procedural ruling concerning their service of process, this appeal is controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 51-197b, which permits direct appeals to this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. . . It is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Konover </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>242 Conn. 727, 740-41, 699 A.2d 158 (1997), quoting <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996). The plaintiffs argue that the applicable statute in this case is \u00a7 51-197b (d), which, they claim, provides a right of direct appeal to the Appellate Court from a decision made in the first instance by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Generally, judicial review of the decision of an administrative agency is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. According to the UAPA, a party may file a direct appeal of a final decision of an administrative agency to the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, under the UAPA, a party seeking to appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s decision may also file a direct appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-184<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 51-197b (d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cJudicial review of the actions and decisions of a zoning commission, however, is governed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-9 and 8-8 rather than by the appeals provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sions of the UAPA.\u201d <em>Ensign-Bickford Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>245 Conn. 257, 263, 715 A.2d 701 (1998), citing <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 122, 129, 653 A.2d 798 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Significantly, the plaintiffs in the present case appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the zoning board pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as opposed to \u00a7 4-183 (a). Yet, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 utilization of the statutory scheme governing zoning cases when filing their appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiffs now claim that they should be allowed to proceed with a direct appeal to the Appellate Court under \u00a7 51-197b instead of following the appeal procedure set out in \u00a7 8-8 (o) for zoning cases. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Before, proceeding any further, we note that our Supreme Court has recently addressed the process by which we are to inteipret statutes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (en banc); see also <em>Bhinder v. Sun Co., </em>263 Conn. 358, 819 A.2d 822 (2003). In <em>Courchesne, </em>the Supreme Court held that it is our responsibility \u201cto determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we [must] look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 577, quoting <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>258 Conn. 733, 741, 785 A.2d 197 (2001). \u201cIn performing this task, we begin with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-9 provides that \u201c[a]ppeals from zoning commissions and planning and zoning commissions may be taken to the Superior Court and, upon certification for review, to the Appellate Court in the manner provided in section 8-8.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (o) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]here shall be no right to further review except to the Appellate Court by certification for review. . . .\u201d The plaintiffs contend that the inclusion of the word \u201cfurther\u201d in \u00a7 8-8 (o) implies that the Superior Court must have reviewed the zoning board\u2019s decision on the merits for that subsection to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Certification to appeal to the Appellate Court, like that to the Supreme Court, is considered to be \u201cextraordinary relief.\u201d See Practice Book \u00a7 81-2. Certification in zoning cases is generally granted only where (1) a new question of law or of public importance is involved, (2) the trial court\u2019s decision is in conflict with Appellate Court or Supreme Court precedent or (3) there is such a departure from the usual course of judicial proceedings that it requires the exercise of the Appellate Court\u2019s supervision. See Practice Book \u00a7 81-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The plaintiffs, in seeking to file a direct appeal from the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal, are attempting to elevate judgments concerning the court\u2019s jurisdiction above those issued on the merits of a zoning board\u2019s decision. Although questions concerning the court\u2019s jurisdiction are of great importance, their significance cannot be used to evade the certification process. See <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>205 Conn. 413, 533 A.2d 879 (1987), aff'd, 206 Conn. 374, 538 A.2d 202 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The language of \u00a7 8-8 (o) parallels that found in \u00a7 51-197f, which governs review of Appellate Court decisions by the Supreme Court. General Statutes \u00a7 51-197\u00cd provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]pon final determination of any appeal by the Appellate Court, <em>there shall be no right to further review </em>except the Supreme Court shall have the power to certify cases for its review upon petition by an aggrieved party. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court has never inteipreted the language of \u00a7 51-197f, however, t\u00f3 mean that a petition for certification to the Supreme Court must be filed only in cases in which the Appellate Court has reviewed a trial court\u2019s decision on its merits. See <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>259 Conn. 766, 792 A.2d 66 (2002) (reviewing Appellate Court\u2019s remand for factual findings regarding standing); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>257 Conn. 409, 778 A.2d 862 (2001) (reviewing Appellate Court dismissal of appeal on grounds of mootness); <em>Cantoni </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>251 Conn. 153, 740 A.2d 796 (1999) (reviewing Appellate Court dismissal of appeal for lack of final judgment). It would, therefore, be inconsistent for this court to interpret \u00a7 8-8 (o) as requiring that a petition for certification be filed only when the trial court has reviewed the zoning board decision on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The plaintiffs also ignore the basic provision found in \u00a7 8-8 (j), which squarely addresses the issue raised by the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Under \u00a7 8-8 (j), \u201c[a]ny defendant may [in a zoning case], at any time after the return date of the appeal [to the Superior Court], make a motion to dismiss the appeal. If the basis of the motion is a claim that the appellant lacks standing to appeal, the appellant shall have the burden of proving standing. The [trial] court may, on the record, grant or deny the motion. The court\u2019s order on the motion may be appealed <em>in the manner provided in subsection (o) of this </em>section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (j), if the Superior Court dismisses an appeal without reaching the merits of the issues challenging the zoning board\u2019s decision, the judgment of dismissal must be appealed under \u00a7 8-8 (o), which subsection requires that the party seeking to appeal first petition the Appellate Court for certification. The legislative history of \u00a7 8-8 (j) indicates that the reason for its enactment was to eliminate congestion in the trial courts by weeding out appeals that were taken for the sole purpose of causing delay and which would ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., p. 608. Although the legislative history is silent with respect to why the legislature required a judgment of dismissal on jurisdictional grounds to be subject to the certification process, the requirement is nevertheless clearly set forth in \u00a7 8-8 (j). We therefore conclude that pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (j), the plaintiffs should have filed a petition for certification to appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The motion filed by the defendants Audrey V. Thompson and Wheeler Service Corporation to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is granted, and the appeal to this court is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 is entitled \u201cAppeal from board to court.
