The defendant also claims that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5) is unconstitutional under the first* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution because it is vague and overbroad, and that he was convicted under that statute in violation of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 8,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6of the Connecticut constitution. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim, Stephen Ozga, had known each other since the late 1970s and had had a friendly relationship until recent years. On September 1, 2001, the parties were no longer friendly and happened to meet at about noon at the Ace Hardware Store on South Main Street in Middletown.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The defendant approached the victim, stood directly in front of him and said, \u201cI want to talk to you, motherfucker.\u201d The victim replied, \u201cSal, get away from me,\u201d and tried to walk around the defendant to get to his car. The defendant, however, pursued him and said, \u201cYou asshole, you motherfucker.\u201d The reply again was, \u201cSal, would you just get away from me?\u201d For a third time, the defendant called the victim a \u201cmotherfucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>As the victim again tried to get around the defendant, the defendant punched him in the chest near the left shoulder. At that point, the victim said, \u201cSal, let\u2019s straighten this out. Let\u2019s call a cop. Let the cop straighten this out.\u201d The defendant again punched the victim on the left side. The victim turned to retreat into the store, and the defendant kicked him in his buttocks. At no time did the victim attempt to strike the defendant. At the time of the attack, people were walking in the parking lot and passing in cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly permitted the state to amend the information after the conclusion of all the evidence in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 36-18. On appeal, our review of the court\u2019s decision to permit an amendment to the information is one of abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>49 Conn. App. 409, 416, 716 A.2d 897, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 904, 720 A.2d 516 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter commencement of the trial for good cause shown, the judicial authority may permit the prosecuting authority to amend the information at any time before a verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and no substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced. ...\u201d The only limiting requirement under that section is that the state may not charge additional or different offenses in an amendment and that the amendment may not prejudice the substantive rights of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Prat, </em>66 Conn. App. 91, 98, 784 A.2d 367 (2001). Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 \u201cis primarily a notice provision. Its purpose is to ensure that the defendant has adequate notice of the charges against which he must defend. ... It is the defendant\u2019s burden to provide a specific showing of prejudice resulting from the state\u2019s delay in providing notice of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>against which [he] must defend.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In this case, the state, on October 24, 2001, by substitute information, charged the defendant with two counts of breach of the peace in violation of \u00a7 53a-181.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial began on October 30, 2001. On November 2, 2001, after the parties had presented all the evidence, but before closing arguments and jury instructions by the court, the state filed its second substitute information, which still contained two counts of breach of the peace. In count one, however, the state eliminated the allegations of \u201crecklessly creating a risk\u201d and \u201cengaging in tumultuous behavior.\u201d Count one, therefore, alleged as relevant \u201cthat the defendant, acting with the intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, used abusive or obscene language in a public place . . . .\u201d Count two remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendant, who had requested a charge to the jury on self-defense, was told by the court during a charging conference that the court would deliver such an instruction as to count two, but not as to count one. The defendant responded: \u201cJust to put on the record, Judge, I note that when the case was originally submitted to the jury in the original information, was read to them, it did include tumultuous behavior which would connote some sort of physicality and, therefore, I understand that the state has amended that. The court\u2019s position is that it would not apply since it\u2019s only language. Just note that, I guess I don\u2019t have much of an objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tion \u2014 I don\u2019t have much of a basis to object on the current case law. I just say on the grounds of fairness, I think that the case was originally submitted \u2014 count one originally submitted as tumultuous behavior, and on that basis I\u2019d object. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair . . . [t]o the extent that the information was amended at this late stage in the game once both sides had already rested their cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The very limited record also discloses that the court stated: \u201cIt\u2019s just [the] court\u2019s belief, though, to address that issue at least briefly, that the state is allowed to amend the information up until the time the jury receives it for deliberation so long as the state does not increase or change the charge against the defendant. So, it\u2019s the court\u2019s position that the state is allowed to, in fact, conform its information to what it believes it has presented to the juiy beyond a reasonable doubt, and your exception to the state amending the information is noted, but I don\u2019t believe there is any basis to prevent the state because [it] did not increase or change the charge in any manner.\u201d The defendant argues that the court failed to make a finding of good cause and failed to find that he was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The defendant\u2019s failure to object on the basis of a lack of good cause speaks for itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The basis of the defendant\u2019s objection at trial was \u201cfairness,\u201d specifically, that his self-defense argument was taken away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>because \u201ctumultuous behavior\u201d was not proven and therefore was removed from the case. The defendant\u2019s position is without merit. The sole issue on his claim is whether the amended information gave him sufficient notice of the charges to allow him to prepare an adequate defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>226 Conn. 601, 608, 628 A.2d 973 (1993). The defendant does not claim, nor can he, that the state charged an additional or different offense by the omission of \u201ctumultuous\u201d behavior, and cannot demonstrate that a substantive right may have been prejudiced by the amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201cMoreover, an amendment to an information does not necessarily prejudice a defendant\u2019s substantive rights within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 [36-18] simply because the defendant may have evidence available to contradict a factual allegation of the original charge, and, as a result of the amendment, he no longer faces that particular factual allegation.\u201d Id., 615 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Because the amendment deleted one of the two subdivisions, the defendant would be hard pressed to show prejudice or that the amended information in any way deprived him of adequate notice for preparation of his defense. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state to amend the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The defendant next claims that prosecution under the first count pursuant to \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5) violated his constitutional right to a fair trial because the statute is vague and overbroad. The defendant did not raise that issue at trial and, thus, failed to preserve it properly for appeal. Nevertheless, a defendant may prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error if it meets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>all of the conditions set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We conclude that the record is adequate for review and that the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 800-801, 640 A.2d 986 (1994) (in reviewing unpreserved constitutional claim of vagueness, first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>met where record reflects defendant convicted under statute in question and sufficiently shows conduct that formed basis of conviction). We therefore proceed by addressing <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong, namely, whether a clear constitutional violation deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The defendant alleges that subdivision (5) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) has become unconstitutionally vague and over-broad. He claims that because our Supreme Court also has construed subdivision (1) as encompassing a proscription of \u201cfighting words,\u201d that creates an inherent ambiguity about the meaning of \u201cthe use of abusive or obscene language in a public place,\u201d and that he could not have foreseen that his actions would constitute a breach of the peace. He also claims that subdivision (5) is overbroad, as it no longer proscribes \u201cfighting words\u201d and, therefore, is susceptible to arbitrary enforcement and may be used to proscribe otherwise protected speech. We disagree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">As a preliminary matter, we note that legislative enactments carry with them a strong presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>constitutionality. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>259 Conn. 855, 876, 792 A.2d 774 (2002). A party challenging the constitutionality of a validly enacted statute bears the heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. \u201cIn the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it is improvident for the court to invalidate a statute on its face. ... In construing a statute, the court must search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 778, 629 A.2d 357 (1993). We construe statutes to give effect to all of their provisions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>237 Conn. 613, 621, 678 A.2d 473 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u201c[T]he void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. . . . [The doctrine] embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. . . . The United States Supreme Court has emphasized that the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine is not actual notice, but . . . the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement. . . . Thus, [i]n order to surmount a vagueness challenge, a statute [must] afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited . . . and must not impermissibly [delegate] basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. . . . Finally, [i]f the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>vagueness . . . for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . [T]he statute must contain some core meaning within which the defendant\u2019s actions clearly fall. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>257 Conn. 544, 551-53, 778 A.2d 847 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1130, 122 S. Ct. 1069, 151 L. Ed. 2d 972 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that the constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue.\u201d <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 105, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). \u201cTo do otherwise, absent the appearance that the statute in question intrudes upon fundamental guarantees, particularly first amendment freedoms, would be to put courts in the undesirable position of considering every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of [the statute].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 106. \u201c[W]hen an allegedly vague statute implicates the first amendment right of free speech, the statute\u2019s constitutionality is tested for vagueness on its face.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>252 Conn. 579, 584, 750 A.2d 1079 (2000). In such a case, \u201cthe defendants may challenge the validity of a statute\u2019s application to marginal situations even though [their] own conduct may clearly fall within the statute\u2019s proscriptions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>203 Conn. 682, 697, 526 A.2d 1297 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The basis of an overbreadth challenge is that a statute that proscribes certain conduct, even though it may have some permissible applications, sweeps within its proscription conduct protected by freedom of speech. <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 812, 761 A.2d 705 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(2000). Challenges for vagueness and overbreadth are closely related, but they are not identical. <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 798 n.4. In certain situations, however, they may be functionally indistinguishable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The defendant argues that our courts have introduced \u201cconfusion into the definition of \u2018fighting words\u2019 under Connecticut\u2019s breach of the peace statute [in that it] fails to provide notice of what conduct is proscribed under subdivision (a) (1) as opposed to (a) (5), and there are now insufficient guidelines to protect from arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d The defendant argues that \u201cabusive language\u201d cannot be penalized unless it consists of \u201cfighting words,\u201d but that not all forms of fighting words necessarily are \u201cabusive or obscene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 795, our Supreme Court, in considering the mens rea required by the disorderly conduct statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182, stated that \u201cthe predominant intent is to cause what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider a disturbance to or impediment of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation, or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 810. Under \u201csubdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) . . . physical fighting, and physically violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior\u201d rather than mere verbal speech is prohibited. Id., 812. In <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>a case in which the breach of the peace statute, \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) was at issue,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> our Supreme Court stated that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) \u201cdoes not require proof of actual physical conduct on the part of the defendant with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>victim,\u201d and concluded \u201cthat a fair reading of <em>Indrisano </em>indicates that speech can be proscribed not only when accompanied by actual physical conduct, but also when it can be identified as fighting words that portend physical violence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 620. Through those cases, our Supreme Court has concluded that the words \u201cengaged in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d should not reach speech protected by the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) proscribes speech that properly can be characterized as fighting words when, under the totality of the circumstances, that speech amounts to \u2018violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u2019 that portends violence, while subdivision (5) proscribes \u2018abusive or obscene language.\u2019 \u201d Id., 622. The court also made clear that all forms of fighting words were not necessarily abusive or obscene, and that the court would, \u201c[w]hen and if a case arises in which the prosecution proceeds under subdivision (5) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) . . . construe \u2018abusive\u2019 and \u2018obscene\u2019 under the particular facts of that case, taking into account, of course, the principle that the legislative language may not be considered as mere surplusage.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Although the constitutionality of subdivision (5) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) was not at issue, the <em>Szymkiewicz </em>court rejected a surplusage argument and did not disturb the fighting words gloss from the punishment of abusive speech. \u201cFighting words\u201d may consist of language that is neither obscene nor abusive. The language of the statute leads us to conclude that the distinction that may be drawn between the \u201cfighting words\u201d as contemplated under subdivision (1) and those under subdivision (5) can be found \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances,\u201d as expressed in <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>which gives rise to the use of the words. Subdivision (1) proscribes fighting words uttered in a violent, tumultuous or threatening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>manner; id., 618-20; whereas subdivision (5) proscribes fighting words that tend to induce immediate violence by the person or persons to whom the words are uttered because of their raw effect. The core meaning of subdivision (5) remains intact; fighting words may arise in different contexts not confined to abusive or obscene language. We therefore must conclude that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5) is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201cTo determine whether a statute reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, we must first interpret its language and determine the scope of its prohibitions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>232 Conn. 345, 365, 655 A.2d 737 (1995). We view subdivision (5) as not prohibiting protected speech or other expressive conduct. Speech or expressive conduct is not proscribed unless and until the words or expressive conduct rise to the level of fighting words so as to result in a breach of the peace. Subdivision (5) is not overbroad; it does not prohibit constitutionally protected speech. We therefore conclude that there was no clear constitutional violation that deprived the defendant of a fair trial and that his claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The defendant also alleges that his conviction under subdivision (a) (5) violated article first, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. The defendant in his principal brief states that \u201cConnecticut decisions have left an unsolvable ambiguity as to the meaning of \u2018abusive or obscene\u2019 under subdivision (a) (5) of the breach of the peace statute. Thus, for all the reasons the statute is vague and overbroad under federal analysis, it is so for purposes of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d Although we agree that an even greater degree of scrutiny may be applied under our state constitution, we conclude that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5) is not vague or overbroad under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the Connecticut constitution for the same reasons that it is not vague or overbroad under the federal constitution. As discussed in part II, \u201cabusive language\u201d may be interpreted as \u201cfighting words,\u201d which are not protected by our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-14\"> 1 General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 53a-181 (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior in a public place; or (2) assaults or strikes another; or (3) threatens to commit any crime against another person or his property; or (4) publicly exhibits, distributes, posts up or advertises any offensive, indecent or abusive matter concerning any person; or (5) in a public place, uses abusive or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>obscene language or makes an obscene gesture; or (6) creates a public and hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which he is not licensed or privileged to do . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\"> The first amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b122-11\"> Article first, \u00a7 5, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \u201cNo law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b122-13\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> Count one alleged, inter alia, that the defendant \u201cacting with the intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, engaged in tumultuous behavior in a public place and used abusive or obscene language in a public place ... in violation of Section 53a-181 (a) (1) and (a) (5) . . . .\u201d Count two alleged, inter alia, that the defendant \u201cdid assault or strike another person ... in violation of Section 53a~181 (a) (2)----\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> The defendant does not argue that the state may not amend an information to conform to the evidence as presented; see <em>State </em>v.
