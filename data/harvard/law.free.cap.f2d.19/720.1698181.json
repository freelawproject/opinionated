The application was opposed by the Anseo Photo-products, Inc., because of the alleged similarity of the mark with opposePs trade-mark \u201cSpeedex,\u201d which was registered for similar goods on January 18,1916. Opposer claimed that \u201cSpeedway\u201d and \u201cSpeedex\u201d so nearly resembled one another as to be likely to cause confusion in the public mind, if both were used as trade-marks for the same kind of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">It appears that the Eastman Kodak Company, since 1908, has used the word \u201cSpeed\u201d in a purely descriptive sense, having reference to quick operation and results, for certain of its films, plates, and cameras. Such goods were designed as speed films, speed plates, and speed kodaks, and were so labeled and advertised. Beginning in 1913, opposePs predecessor began the use of the trade-mark \u201cSpeed-ex\u201d for its films and cameras, and obtained registration thereof on January 18,1916. In the year 1924 the Eastman Kodak Company adopted the trade-mark \u201cSpeedway\u201d as aforesaid, and applied for its registration. The application was met by the present opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-20\">The opposition has been overruled and dismissed by concurrent decisions in the Patent Office, and we agree with these decisions. The suffixes of the competing marks, to wit, \u201cex\u201d and \u201cway,\u201d if taken alone, are of course plainly dissimilar. Therefore whatever similarity exists between the two marks must result from the use of the word \u201cSpeed\u201d which is the dominating term common to both. That word, however, is descriptive and of common right; and neither party can claim an exclusive right to its use, either alone or as the dominating element of a compound word. Such however, in effect, is the right claimed by the present opposition; it cannot be sustained. S. R. Feil Co. v. John E. Robbins Co. (C. C.
