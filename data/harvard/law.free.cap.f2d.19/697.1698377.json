Wherefore relator prays for a writ of mandamus to compel them either to furnish the list requested by relator or to permit relator to examine the pertinent records for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The defendants answered, admitting that relator had made the demands upon them alleged in the petition, and admitting that the office of the civil service commission is the only office in which all of the names of the employees under the classified service of the United States are to be found, but alleging that these records are kept on separate and individual cards approximating about 500,000 in number, and that to furnish relator the lists demanded by him would impose such labor upon their employees as to interfere with the orderly transaction of their duties, and also that many of the records contain confidential information, which should not be made public; that the demand of relator for leave to himself examine \u201cthe pertinent records\u201d is vague and indefinite, and cannot be granted without at the same time disclosing confidential information, which in the. judgment of defendants should not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Relator demurred to the answer, the court overruled the demurrer, and relator appealed. The demurrer, of course, searched the record, and the sufficiency of the petition is after all the underlying question presented by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The purpose of mandamus is not to establish a legal right but to enforce one already established; hence the legal right of relator to the performance of the particular act of which performance is sought must be clear and complete. It has been said with good reason that the right to its performance must be so clear as not to admit of reasonable doubt or controversy. The right involved must also be substantial, and not a mere abstract right. When brought against public officers in a case like this, the duty sought to be enforced must be ministerial only, and not within defendants\u2019 discretion. 38 Corpus Juris, 582 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In our opinion, the right alleged by relator in this ease is not clear and complete. It is founded upon the \u201cinalienable right\u201d of every citizen to be informed, or to be permitted to inform himself, as to the names of all persons holding office or employment under the government, except in confidential instances, and also to be informed as to the workings of the civil service system of the government. The exercise of such a right, however, must necessarily be subject to restriction and regulation. If relator is entitled to make an investigation of defendants\u2019 records, it follows that every other citizen may demand the same privilege. This likens the present ease in principle to that of Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487, 43 S. Ct. 597, 601 (67 L. Ed. 1078), wherein Mr. Justice Sutherland spoke for the court as follows: \u201cIf one taxpayer may champion and litigate such a cause, then every other taxpayer may do the same, not only in respect of the statute here under review, but also in respect of every other appropriation act and statute, whose administration requires the outlay of public money, and whose validity may be questioned. The bare suggestion of such a result, with its attendant inconveniences, goes far to sustain the conclusion, which we have reached, that a suit of this character cannot be maintained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The right alleged by relator is not certain, complete, and substantial, so as to entitle him to a writ of mandamus. Relator avers that it has been said that the Chief of the Bureau of Efficiency has failed to properly perform his duties, and that relator as a citizen proposes to make an investigation of the subject. Relator\u2019s desire for information is not a sufficient basis for a writ of mandamus. Merrill, Law of Mandamus, \u00a7 14; U. S. ex rel. Alsop Process Co. v. Wilson, 33 App. D. C. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Again, the writ sought by relator should not issue unless the law imposes a clear ministerial duty upon defendants to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the request which relator made upon them. No such <em>legal duty is </em>shown in this ease. Defendants\u2019 duties are defined by statute and regulations, whereby the records in question are intrusted to their custody and control, and no provision is shown which mandatorily requires them to furnish copies thereof to private citizens upon request, or in the alternative to grant personal access to the records to all private citizens applying therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Moreover, under the Code of the District of Columbia, as on general principle, mandamus is an extraordinary remedial process, which is awarded, not as a matter of right,' but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. It will not issue to direct an act which will work a public mischief. Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, 245 U. S. 308, 38 S. Ct. 99, 62 L. Ed. 309; U. S. ex rel. Arant v. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, 249 U. S. 367, 39 S. Ct. 293, 63 L. Ed. 650. We are convinced that sound discretion for the prevention of public inconvenience leads to the denial of mandamus as applied for in this ease. See Newman v. U. S. ex rel. Frizzell, 238 U. S. 537, 35 S. Ct. 881, 59 L. Ed. 1446; Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 42 S. Ct. 274, 66 L. Ed. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We have examined the authorities cited by relator, but they are founded in part upon special statutes, or relate to limited jurisdictions, and we do not regard them as controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The decree of the lower court' is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
