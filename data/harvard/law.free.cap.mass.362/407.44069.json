He appeals under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, assigning as error (1) the admission in evidence of an out-of-court identification, (2) the admission in evidence of hearsay, (3) the admission in evidence of in-court identifications, and (4) the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on the defence of alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We summarize the evidence submitted to the jury. Kathleen and Levi Whiteside operated a variety store (the store). At approximately 4 P.M. on September 27, 1970, while Kathleen was behind the counter, two men entered the store. Levi was in the back room. One of the men ran behind the counter, held a gun to Kathleen\u2019s head and told her to open the cash register. Levi came from the back room to his wife\u2019s assistance and was shot by that man. The two men fled the store with about $200 from the cash register. A customer, Nellie Rivera, was in the store during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The police came about 4:25 P.M. and found Levi bleeding on the floor. He was taken to Boston City Hospital, where he died at 4:30 P.M. A description of the two men was obtained from Kathleen and sent out on the police radio. At 5:15 p.m. the defendant was arrested because he fitted the description of the man who shot Levi. The arresting officer took the defendant to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The defendant arrived at the hospital at 5:25 P.M. and was transferred to another police vehicle in the parking lot. At this time Kathleen was leaving the hospital, and she identified the defendant as the man who shot her husband. Both Kathleen and Nellie Rivera also made in-court identifications of the defendant as the man who shot Levi. There was testimony by the defendant that he had been at home at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>crime, corroborated by testimony from a woman with whom he was living at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">1. <em>The out-of-court identification. </em>After a voir dire hearing the judge excluded from evidence identifications of the defendant made in a police station by Kathleen and Mrs. Rivera about 6 P.M. and 7 p.m. respectively on the day of the crime, but admitted in evidence Kathleen\u2019s identification in the hospital parking lot. The defendant argues that the latter ruling was error, maintaining that the parking lot confrontation took place in impermissibly prejudicial circumstances while he was in custody and without counsel in violation of his right to due process of law. We summarize the relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Immediately after the arrest, the arresting officer, a Boston Division 4 policeman named Frost, took the defendant in a Division 4 police wagon to the hospital, about a three minute drive from the place of arrest. He testified that he did so at the direction of the police radio dispatcher in order to meet the Division 3 policeman, Sergeant Downey, \u201cwho was in charge of the case,\u201d and to transfer the defendant' to the Division 3 police, since the shooting had occurred within their area. Frost did not know at the time whether Levi Whiteside was dead or alive, and testified that he did not intend a bedside identification. At the hospital, Frost saw a Division 3 police car with two other officers in it. He took the defendant \u201cover to District 3\u2019s car and put him in District 3\u2019s car.\u201d The defendant was without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">At this moment Kathleen came out of the emergency room door of the hospital with Sergeant Downey. She had gone to the hospital with the police and had stayed until the doctor had pronounced her husband dead. The emergency door was approximately thirty to forty feet from the Division 3 police car. The time was approximately 5:25 P.M., and it was daylight. Kathleen testified that she saw the police transferring the defendant from the Division 4 police wagon to the Division 3 police car and that she told Downey: \u201c \u2018That look like the man that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>killed my husband/ so I says, \u2018Do you mind could I take a better look, please, a closer look, please?\u2019 So he says, yes. So he walked me over to the car . . . and it was him. I says \u2018Yes, this is the man that shot my husband.\u2019 \u201d When Kathleen reached the car the defendant was in the back, and she looked in the rear window. The testimony of Downey, Frost and Kathleen as to these details of the confrontation was consistent except that Downey and Frost testified that Downey had said nothing to Kathleen at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The judge found as a fact \u201cbased upon pure inference that the reason Frost was told to take the suspect [defendant] to the Boston City Hospital was in order to arrange a face-to-face confrontation with the victim, Levi Whiteside,\u201d that neither Frost nor police headquarters knew Levi was dead, and that the confrontation in the parking lot \u201cwas not pre-arranged. The police had no plans for a confrontation or identification of the suspect by Mrs. Whiteside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The confrontation occurred after the decisions in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263, and <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, and before the decision in <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682. The evidence supports the judge\u2019s findings that the confrontation was an accident which occurred in an effort to arrange a legitimate bedside confrontation with a dying victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 623-624, cert. den. sub nom. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>400 U. S. 843; <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 302. \u201cThat an eyewitness accidentally confronts a suspect erases any problem of illegality where the police make no attempt to elicit improperly such an identification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambra, </em>357 Mass. 260, 263. See <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682, 698, n. 5; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pollack, </em>427 F. 2d 1168, 1169 (5th Cir.) ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seader, </em>440 F. 2d, 488, 496 (5th Cir.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>25 N. Y. 2d 184, 193, cert. den. sub nom. <em>Logan </em>v. <em>New York, </em>396 U. S. 1020. This \u201cchance meeting\u201d was \u201cneither avoidable, unfair, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>suggestive.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>453 F. 2d 970, 974 (1st Cir.). If Downey had acted, as suggested by defence counsel, to prevent Kathleen from crossing the parking lot the effect would have been suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In addition, the confrontation occurred less than one and one-half hours after the shooting and was \u201cin the course of (or immediately following) a criminal episode.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>354 Mass. 494, 501, cert, den. sub nom. <em>Bumpus </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>393 U. S. 1034. Even before <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>we held the <em>Wade-Gilbert per se </em>exclusionary rule inapplicable to such a confrontation. Evidence of the identification is admissible where, as in this case, the confrontation was in \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d not \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to deny due process of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, supra, </em>at 499-501, citing <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 302. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 623-624. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breen, </em>357 Mass. 441, 446-447; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>357 Mass. 771. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>361 Mass. 870. See <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682, 698, n. 5; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>399 F. 2d 948, 950-952 (2d Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 987; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>408 F. 2d 1280, 1284-1285 (D. C. Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>395 U. S. 928; <em>United States ex rel. Springle </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>435 F. 2d 1380, 1382-1383 (2d Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Springle </em>v. <em>Zelker, </em>401 U. S. 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">2. <em>The admission of hearsay evidence. </em>The defendant assigned as error the admission of testimony by Downey and Frost concerning remarks made by Kathleen to them at the time of the hospital parking lot identification and out of the hearing of the defendant. Downey testified that Kathleen told him, while going from the hospital to the parking lot, \u201cthat looks like the man who shot my husband. Can I go over and have a better look?\u201d He also testified that on reaching the car she said, \u201cThat is the man who shot my husband. I recognize the mark under his eye.\u201d Frost testified that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Kathleen arrived at the car she said, \u201cThat\u2019s the man that shot my husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Even though the evidence was hearsay as to the truth of the identification of the defendant as the man who shot Levi, it was properly admitted. Kathleen had previously testified to the identification and we have held that testimony to be admissible. The evidence disputed here was admitted under a limiting instruction to the jury that it be considered only to corroborate the fact that Kathleen did at that time and place make the identification, not as proof of the truth of the identification itself. See <em>Glassman </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>277 Mass. 376, 382; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>335 Mass. 106, 112; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>351 Mass. 534, 539; <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage &amp; Rigging Co. Inc. </em>206 F. 2d 857, 860 (9th Cir.); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ercole Constr. Co. Inc. </em>104 R. I. 362, 369; Leach and Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence, p. 184; Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">3. <em>The in-court identifications. </em>The defendant argues that the in-court identifications by Kathleen and Mrs. Rivera were tainted by impermissible out-of-court identifications. We summarize the evidence at the voir dire hearing concerning the two station house confrontations.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Both confrontations took place in the guardroom of the same police station when the defendant was without counsel. The first occured when Kathleen arrived at the station with Downey, about 6 P.M. on the day of the shooting. Downey \u201cescorted\u201d her into the guardroom where she saw the defendant. Downey first testified that neither he nor Kathleen had said anything at the time, but that she had told him \u201clater on\u201d that the \u201cman in the guardroom was the man who had shot her husband.\u201d On cross-examination he testified that he asked her when he entered the guardroom, \u201cIs that the man?\u201d and that she had replied in the affirmative. Downey also said that there were three or four uniformed police officers in the guardroom, that he did not believe the defendant was the only civilian, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>he could not remember if the defendant was the only colored man. The judge found that the defendant was \u201cprobably the only civilian and probably the only colored male in the guardroom,\u201d that the confrontation \u201cwas completely accidental\u201d and not \u201cengineered\u201d by the police, but that the confrontation was impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The second confrontation occured about 7 p.m. on the day of the crime when Mrs. Rivera was brought to the station at Downey\u2019s direction. She was brought by the police into the guardroom, saw the defendant sitting there, and identified him as the man who shot Levi. She testified that he was the only person she saw in the guardroom except the police officers. Downey testified that he was surprised to find the defendant there, that he thought the defendant had been booked and placed in a cell, and that the confrontation was not prearranged. The judge found that the defendant was \u201calone in a guard room in a police station, obviously under custody, with the presence of six or seven police officers in uniform, which I think is sufficiently suggestive as to be a denial of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The judge made further findings, however, that the in-court identifications by Kathleen and Mrs. Rivera were of independent origin from any out-of-court confrontations after the crime. We summarize the relevant evidence. Both Mrs. Rivera and Kathleen testified that they had the opportunity to observe closely the man who killed Levi during the robbery. Mrs. Rivera testified that she looked him \u201cstraight in his face\u201d from a distance of ten to fifteen feet for a period of about two to three minutes, and that her eyes were good. She noticed that he had on green pants, a black shirt, a black hat, that he was five feet nine to six feet in height and that he had a mark on the left side of his face under his left eye. This description was the same as the one she gave the police at the store, except she did not mention the mark at the store. She testified that there was no doubt in her mind that the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the man who shot Levi and that her conclusion was based on what she saw at the store, not at the police station. The judge found that Mrs. Rivera \u201chad ample opportunity to observe the man who was in the store and committed the fatal act, that she was staring at him face to face for a period of at least three minutes, . . . that she impressed upon her mind his physical characteristics, and particularly his . . . dress,\u201d that she had testified that her in-court identification \u201chas its primary origin in what she saw at the time the act is alleged to have taken place,\u201d and that her in-court identification was \u201cnot tainted by reason of an illegal out-of-court identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Kathleen testified that, for approximately seven minutes during the robbery, she was \u201cface to face\u201d with the man who shot Levi, that she had also seen him and his companion in the store about two or three days before the crime, and that they had been in the store for about one-half hour on the morning of the crime. On the morning occasion Kathleen observed them closely from \u201cnot even ten feet\u201d away and \u201cwas wondering why they kept hanging around,\u201d and she expressed suspicion of them to her husband. She testified that her husband\u2019s assailant was wearing green pants, a black shirt, a black \u201cdroopy\u201d hat, and white and black \u201csneakers,\u201d that he had a scar under his left eye, and that he was \u201ctall.\u201d This description was the same as she gave the police at the store, except that the police description gave the hat as being a \u201cblack beret\u201d or a \u201cscully cap\u201d and she did not mention the mark under the eye until later.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The judge found that Kathleen had seen the defendant twice prior to the crime and on one occasion \u201cwas paying more than casual attention\u201d to him, that at the robbery she \u201cwas within no more than a foot of him and continued to be in his presence for at least some few minutes,\u201d that she \u201chad an abundance of opportunity and did in fact carefully scrutinize both of the young men who were in the store in the morning and afternoon,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that she \u201cfixed into her mind a mental description of their physical characteristics and their clothing and attire,\u201d and that any in-court identification by Kathleen \u201chas its primary origin in the observations which she made at the time\u201d of the shooting, and \u201cis based upon substantial evidence\u201d with \u201clittle if any conflict in her story which would make it suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">There was evidence that on arrest the defendant was wearing green pants, a black shirt, a black hat \u201clike the old scully, except it\u2019s bigger,\u201d and sneakers. The judge made a finding that the defendant\u2019s clothes on arrest \u201cfitted precisely the description of the alleged assailant\u201d given at the store. At the time of the trial the defendant had a mark under his left eye. There is no evidence that either Kathleen or Mrs. Rivera ever failed to identify the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In finding that the in-court identifications were not tainted by the pre-trial confrontations the judge impliedly found that the confrontations were not \u201c \u2018so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377, 384.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>361 Mass. 431, 436-437. See <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 301-302; <em>United States ex rel. Phipps </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>428 F. 2d 912, 914-915 (2d Cir.). Those findings, which are warranted by the evidence, fully support the admission in evidence of the in-court identifications. The Commonwealth established \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identifications were based upon observations of the suspect other than\u201d the out-of-court confrontations. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 240.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>4. <em>The alibi charge. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury put the burden of proving the alibi defence on the defendant or left the jury confused as to where the burden of proof lay in violation of his right to due process of law. The defendant admits that the instructions were \u201can improvement\u201d over those given in the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 319, 324, and that they did not in express terms put the burden of proof on him. Compare <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>393 U. S. 253, 254-255; <em>Stump </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>398 F. 2d 111, 115-123 (8th Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Stump, </em>393 U. S. 1001; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>414 F. 2d 50, 51, 56 (8th Cir.). He maintains, however, that phrases in the charge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> particularly when used in conjunction with a caution that alibi evidence should be scrutinized carefully,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> suggest to the jury \u201can option to ignore the reasonable doubt test\u201d in considering alibi evidence, contrary to the holding in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>454F.2d572, 578 (5thCir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The judge\u2019s instructions, unlike those in the <em>Smith </em>case, cannot be read to shift any onus of proof to the accused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Scafati, </em>428 F. 2d 1023, 1025 (1st Cir.). There is no reasonable likelihood that the charge taken as a whole could have led the jury to ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the reasonable doubt test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>357 Mass. 333, 342-343, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">5. We have carefully reviewed the evidence as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended. We find no error. Our review of the murder case indicates that it was open to the jury to return the verdict which they did, and that justice does not require the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt than that returned by the jury or that there be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>355 Mass. 620, 621-622; <em>Commonwealth v</em>. <em>Bell, </em>356 Mass. 724; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. 250, 253-254; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balukonis, </em>357 Mass. 721, 725, denial of habeas corpus affirmed, <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>453 F. 2d 970 (1st Cir.); <em>Commonwealth v</em>. <em>Royce, </em>358 Mass. 597, 599-600; <em>Commonwealth v.
