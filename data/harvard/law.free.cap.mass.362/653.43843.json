L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G) from convictions on indictments charging him with forcible imprisonment, and assault with intent to rape and rape, of the seventeen year old victim (victim). The victim testified that she was kidnapped and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>raped on the night of October 11, 1970. The defendant admitted that he had entertained the victim at his apartment while another woman was present but denied having sexual intercourse with her. After relating the story of the attack to her mother and sister and later to the police in the early hours of October 12, 1970, the victim was examined at Wesson Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The hospital record contains the three following notations: (a) under the heading \u201cNature of Illness\u201d appear the words \u201c? Assaulted \u2014 ? Raped\u201d; (b) under the heading \u201cHistory and Physical Exam,\u201d appear the words \u201cHistory of recent rape\u201d; and (c) under the heading \u201cDiagnosis\u201d appears the notation \u201c? Rape.\u201d The sole alleged error argued by the defendant is the admission of the hospital record with these notations. When the record was offered in evidence the defendant made no objection and saved no exception to its admission. To be entitled to review by appeal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33 A-33G, \u201c[t]he first and essential step is the taking of an exception. Without that first step, the second step of filing an assignment of errors cannot be taken. An ... assignment of errors not based upon an exception cannot be treated as rightly presented to the full court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v</em>. <em>McDonald, </em>264 Mass. 324, 336. \u201cAn assignment of error has no standing unless based upon an exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Theberge, </em>330 Mass. 520, 527. Therefore, since the defendant\u2019s sole \u201cassignment of error [is] not based on an exception [it] brings nothing to this court for review,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>356 Mass. 343, 346, and \u201cwe do not take cognizance of [it].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 33. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>358 Mass. 233, 236. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 509. However, we have the power to review on the merits an assignment of error where no exceptions have been saved, but this power is only exercised when there exists a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564. \u201eNo such risk exists here. Thus, although not required to do so, we have examined the record on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>appeal in this ease and conclude that no error in fact was committed by the trial judge\u2019s admission of the hospital record in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79, as amended through St. 1959, c. 200, provides in part: \u201cRecords kept by hospitals, dispensaries or clinics, and sanatoria . . . shall be admissible ... as evidence in the courts of the commonwealth so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases . . . but nothing therein contained shall be admissible as evidence which has reference to the question of liability.\u201d The defendant argues that the admisison of the portions of the hospital record outlined above constituted error on two grounds. He asserts that (a) the notations on the hospital record contained improper opinion evidence and that (b) they had reference to the question of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We think that the first ground is ill-founded. The use of question marks to preface the doctor\u2019s notations tends to indicate that he had not yet formed an opinion of the victim\u2019s condition. Actually the hospital record raised a question as to the truth and accuracy of the victim\u2019s complaints. The statute states that the record must \u201crelate to the treatment and medical history\u201d of the person examined. The hospital record was made by the examining physician. It indicated certain medical procedures he had followed and made a notation of the laboratory test he directed to be completed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The doctor\u2019s tentative opinion is sufficiently related to the treatment and medical history so that it cannot be said that its admission constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The defendant asserts that the hospital record had reference to the question of liability and therefore should not have been admitted under the statute. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>359 Mass. 577, 579, we said: \u201cOur decisions have demonstrated liberal interpretation of the statute in the admission of hospital records. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.\u201d This court has construed the statute to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that <em>\u201ca </em>record which relates directly and mainly to the treatment and medical history of the patient, should be admitted, even though incidentally the facts recorded may have some bearing on the question of liability.\u201d <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>330 Mass. 148, 149, quoting <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>234 Mass. 480] 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In the <em>Franks </em>case we upheld the admission of a hospital record containing the following notation: \u201c[the victim\u2019s name] Assault Case 3274 6/18/69 (Taken 6/16/69) Dr. Klein Smear: occ. Sperm seen Saline: occ. Sperm seen Culture: negative.\u201d We held \u201c[t]he contested record contains only medical facts as of the date of examination on June 16, 1969, therefore, the record can be construed as part of the \u2018medical history\u2019 of the patient . . ..\u201d 359 Mass, at 580. If the notations relate to liability at all, we believe that they do so only incidentally to the medical history and thus their admission does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> The hospital record does not disclose the results of the laboratory test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
