J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC0\">The defendant appeals under G. L. c. 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from convictions on indictments charging him with unlawful possession with intent to sell a narcotic drug, cocaine, and with unlawful possession with intent to sell a narcotic drug, cannabis (marihuana). G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 \u00a7 197, 217B, both as amended. The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in admitting in evidence certain property seized and certain statements made by the defendant as a result of an alleged illegal search and seizure. Specifically, the defendant urges that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not contain facts, information, and circumstances sufficient to establish grounds for the issuance of the warrant and further that it did not establish probable cause for the date that the warrant was applied for and issued. The pertinent portions of the affidavit are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In determining the sufficiency of the affidavit, we are guided by the often quoted language in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 108, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573, 577: \u201c[Ajffidavits for search warrants . . . must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion.\u201d The affidavit is based in part on hearsay information; therefore, we must first determine its adequacy under the standards of <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>informant\u2019s tip is inadequate under the <em>Aguilar </em>case, other allegations which corroborate the informant\u2019s tip are then to be considered. ' <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 415. See <em>United States ex rel. Kislin </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>429 F. 2d 950, 952 (3d Cir.); <em>United States </em>V. <em>Fuller, </em>441 F. 2d 755, 759 (4th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The informant\u2019s reliability was established by setting forth previous examples of his assistance in apprehending drug offenders. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dunnings, </em>425 F. 2d 836, 839 (2d Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Dunnings </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U. S. 1002; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shipstead, </em>433 F. 2d 368, 372 (9th Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>334 F. Supp. 546, 550 (S. D. N. Y.). Cf. <em>Von Utter </em>v. <em>Tulloch, </em>426 F. 2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Tulloch </em>v. <em>Von Utter, </em>400 U. S. 826. The tip by itself does not contain sufficient information of the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d required to support the informant\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was selling narcotic drugs at a particular time. Although it does contain an averment that the defendant offered to sell some heroin to the informant, it fails to specify the time and location where the offer occurred. See <em>Rosencranz </em>v. <em>United States </em>356 F. 2d 310, 316-317 (1st Cir.). It does n<em>o</em>t</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Other allegations in the affidavit provided a substantial basis for crediting the informer\u2019s tip. The tip was corroborated \u201cthrough other sources of information . . . [thus reducing] the chances of a reckless or prevaricating tale . . ..\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573, 581, quoting from <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 271. See <em>United States ex rel. Kislin </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>429 F. 2d 950, 953-955 (3d Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>439 F. 2d 381, 384-385 (3d Cir.). There was a police surveillance of the premises during which time known drug users were observed entering and leaving the defendant\u2019s apartment. A magistrate is permitted to rely on a policeman\u2019s knowledge of a suspect\u2019s reputation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>at 583, and we therefore perceive no reason why reliance cannot be placed on a policeman\u2019s knowledge of the reputations as drug users of persons frequenting the defendant\u2019s apartment in assessing the reliability of the informant\u2019s tip. In addition, one officer overheard an argument outside the defendant\u2019s apartment relative to the quality of cocaine that was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Reasonable inferences may be drawn by the magistrate from all the information submitted in the affidavit in assessing its sufficiency. <em>Rosencranz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 F. 2d, 310, 314 (1st Cir.). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>354 Mass. 337, 345. The affidavit was capable of the legitimate inference that there was only one third floor apartment in the building. The defendant\u2019s argument that there was no probable cause existing on the date of the issuance of the warrant is not persuasive. The affidavit stated that the surveillance occurred \u201cwithin the past twenty-five days,\u201d and this could well include observations up to the date of the affidavit. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>at 579. The affidavit alleges that the informant \u201cnow states . . . [the defendant] is selling\u201d which indicates that the selling was presently occurring and which was corroborated by the police surveillance. Admittedly, it is difficult to state with any certainty when the \u201cone occasion . . . [the defendant] offered to sell [to] the informent [sic]\u201d occurred; however, when the statement is considered with other portions of the affidavit, it is capable of an interpretation which supports the finding of probable cause. It indicates that the defendant was a seller of narcotics even though it is not definite when a sale was made to the informant. When read in conjunction with the word \u201cnow\u201d in the first part of the sentence, the sale could be inferred to have occurred recently. \u201c[W]here . . . circumstances are detailed, where reason for crediting the source of the information is given, and when a magistrate has found probable cause,\u201d the warrant should not be invalidated \u201cby interpreting the affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 109. Sufficient allegations were made which when combined with the informant\u2019s tip \u201cwould permit ... a judgment that a crime was probably being committed.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\"> \u201cAs a result of an investigation into the 3rd floor apt. located at 29 Crest\u00f3n St. Eoxbury I have reason to believe and do believe that Narcotic Drugs are being stored in said apt. by a colored male known as Nate. My belief is based on the following facts. Known Drug users have been observed by myself and other officers within the past twenty-five days entering and leaving the above apt. On one occasion officer Thomas Moran of CID overheard 2 men engaged in an argument with a third man outside the 3rd floor apt. relative to the poor quality of Cocaine they had been sold. An informant who has proved reliable in the past in connection with the arrest and convection [sic] of Danny Griffin, Louis Jones, John L. Anderson and others for the illegal sale of Narcotic Drugs, now states that a colored male by the name of Nate is selling Cocaine and Marijuana from the above apt. and on one occasion Nate offered to sell the informent [sic] some Heroin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> \u201c[T]he magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were and . . . that the informant . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or . . . \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
