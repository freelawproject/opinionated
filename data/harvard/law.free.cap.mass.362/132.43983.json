The plaintiff\u2019s motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>mary judgment was allowed and the defendant duly excepted. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 59B. The case is before us on the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We set forth the facts as contained in the affidavits accompanying the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit stated that the \u201cinstant action presents no genuine issue of material fact and that there is no defense to the action, in that the action is in contract upon a judgment rendered by the Superior Court of New Jersey which had personal jurisdiction over the . . . [defendant], as evidenced by the certificate of said judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The certificate of judgment which was made a part of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit recited that a \u201cSettlement Stipulation\u201d was entered into by the parties in October, 1969, that the stipulation provided that Cybernetic Developments, Inc., pay to the plaintiff the sum of $37,500 in instalments of varying amounts and in accordance with a set payment schedule. The certificate further recited that certain individuals including the present defendant \u201cpersonally guarantee said payments waiving presentment notice and notice of dishonor and submitting to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of New Jersey for purposes of enforcement of the said Stipulation and said individual guarantors having appeared in open court on October 31, 1969, and having agreed to the terms of said Stipulation.\u201d The certificate further stated that one of such payments was not made, that the \u201cplaintiff then accelerated the unpaid balance of the settlement amount by notice and demand served upon the . . . [corporation] and the individual guarantors, for payment in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation and Order,\u201d and that no payments were forthcoming. Finally, the certificate stated, \u201cthe plaintiff having demanded appropriate relief by notice of motion served upon the . . . [corporation] and the individual guarantors returnable . . . [May 1, 1970]; and that Plaintiff has appeared by counsel .. . and that no one has appeared for the . . . [corporation] or for the said individual guarantors, who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>submitted to the jurisdiction of the court . . . and it further appearing by the plaintiff\u2019s uncontested affidavit of amount due that there is presently due, owing and payable ... by the said . . . [corporation] and the individual guarantors, jointly and severally, the sum of $10,050, including interest from date of default to date.\u201d The judge entered a final judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $10,050.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The affidavit of defence states, among other things, \u201cthat . . . [the defendant] was never served with process in, nor notified of, the New Jersey proceedings prior to the judgment upon which this action is based and that the New Jersey Court had no jurisdiction over the Defendant, who was a resident and citizen of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the time that said New Jersey action was commenced and judgment was entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We have stated that the purpose of the summary judgment statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59, is to avoid the delay and expense of a trial where there is no genuine issue of fact. <em>Albre Marble &amp; Tile Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 394, 397. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 59B, makes the procedure applicable when it appears by affidavit that no defence exists to an action of contract where the plaintiff seeks to recover a debt or liquidated amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In order to be entitled to summary judgment the moving party must affirmatively show that there is no real issue of fact. <em>Hub Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>357 Mass. 449, 451. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>M &amp; D Builders, Inc. </em>360 Mass. 54, 56-62. However, \u201c[i]f the affidavit of defence shows a substantial issue of fact, summary judgment should not be ordered even though the affidavit be disbelieved.\u201d <em>Norwood Morris Plan Co. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>295 Mass. 597, 603-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In the present case we are of opinion that summary judgment should not have been entered for the plaintiff since the affidavit of defence reveals the existence of a genuine issue of fact, namely, whether the plaintiff served on the defendant notice of the proceedings giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>rise to the New Jersey judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit states that the defendant voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the New Jersey court and that notice of the proceedings was served upon the defendant. The plaintiff argues, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s denial of receipt of notice is not sufficient to put in issue the question of notice and raises no defence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The stipulation and order executed by the parties on October 31, 1969, was not an agreement for judgment or a consent judgment. It was merely a settlement agreement entered into by the parties. While the defendant did submit to the jurisdiction of the New Jersey court \u201cfor purposes of enforcement\u201d he did noFwaive his right to notice of each new step in the proceeding which rfright. substantially affect his interests. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>327 U. S. 220, 229. Restatement: Judgmenfy \u00a7 6, comment f. Restatement 2d: Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 25; \u00a7 26, comment f; \u00a7 32, comment a. That hemg_so. if the plaintiff failed to employ reasonable methods to notify the defendant of the proceedings giving riseto the judgment, a defence would be established since the judgment would not be entitled to full faith -and-credit when sued upon in another jurisdiction. <em>Griffin </em>v. Griffin. 327-U. S. 220, 228-229, and-easesgjted.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">A majority of the court eonelndes-\u00fcia^ contrary to the_ plaintiff\u2019s argument, Lhe-affidavit nf defence is sufficient to put in issue the question of notice. By its terms ther defendant did all that he could reasonably have done to' contradict the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that notice had in fact been served upon him. At this stage of the proceedings the defendant is only required to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, not to establish the truth of his position. \u201cIf the affidavits on the one side and on the other are directly opposed as to the facts shown, the case must go to trial.\u201d <em>Norwood Morris Plan Co. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>295 Mass. 597, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
