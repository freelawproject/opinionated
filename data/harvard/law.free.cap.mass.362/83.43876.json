L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from convictions on two indictments each charging an unarmed robbery. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 19. He assigns as error the refusal of the judge to direct verdicts on so much of the indictments as charged unarmed robbery, on the basis that the evidence in each case disclosed at most larceny and not robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The pertinent evidence was as follows: On the evening of December 14, 1970, at approximately 6:30 P.M., Mrs. Florence Spring and her daughter, Miss Madeline Spring, left their apartment in Dorchester to go shopping by automobile. Each lady was carrying a pocketbook. Florence Spring opened both front and rear doors on the passenger\u2019s side in search of a snow scraper with which to remove snow from the car. She was unable to find it. Madeline Spring then knelt down on the front seat with feet extended outside the car and, leaning across the seat, she felt with her hand on the floor for the scraper. Meanwhile, Florence Spring opened the trunk of the car, took out a stick, and started to clean the rear window from the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Madeline Spring testified that, while feeling along the floor of the front seat, she realized she \u201ccouldn\u2019t move . . . [her] foot,\u201d that \u201c[f]or a minute\u201d she was \u201cstunned,\u201d but that then she turned back and saw \u201ca black face with eyes\u201d in the window and she \u201cknew somebody was holding the door on . . . [her] foot.\u201d Miss Spring stated that she became \u201cpetrified\u201d and screamed; that she looked up and put her hand on the horn; and that while in this position, she observed a \u201cshadow . . . [go] by the driver\u2019s side towards the back of the car.\u201d The door was then released and she got out of the car. In answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>question, \u201cAt that time, did you observe your pocketbook?\u201d she indicated, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Florence Spring testified that, upon hearing her daughter\u2019s scream, she \u201cstarted ... to the front of the car\u201d; that she saw a young man on the passenger\u2019s side by the headlight; that this young man started across the street but turned and approached her; and that he \u201cgrabbed . . . [her] pocketbook.\u201d She indicated that the pocketbook was on her arm at the time. She described the taking as follows: \u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell you what he did. All I knew he was standing there. Next thing I knew, I felt something off my arm. I realized my bag was gone.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201c[H]ow did you feel?\u201d Mrs. Spring said: \u201cPetrified. ... I was scared to death.\u201d She also testified that, after the pocketbook was taken, \u201cI said it belonged to me, and I wanted it, and he started towards the sidewalk . . . and I started after him with the stick in my hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">About two hours after the incidents described by\" the victims, the police arrested the defendant and three other males in his company. They found credit cards and other articles from the women\u2019s pocketbooks in the possession of the defendant and one of the other men.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, at trial, Florence Spring identified the defendant as the young man who had taken her pocketbook. Madeline Spring was unable to identify the defendant or any codefendant as either the face or the shadow she had seen during the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">1. We begin with a general discussion of the elements which distinguish robbery from larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The present unarmed robbery statute follows substantially the language of predecessor statutes, the first en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>acted in 1804. Compare G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 19, with St. 1804, c. 143, \u00a7 7; Rev. Sts. c. 125, \u00a7 15; Gen. Sts. c. 160, \u00a7 24; Pub. Sts. c. 202, \u00a7 24; and R. L. c. 207, \u00a7 19. We have construed this language as restating the common law of robbery. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>8 Cush. 215, 217. Under our statutes, as at common law, in order to sustain a charge of robbery, there must be proof of a larceny <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (1) \u201cfrom . . . [the] person,\u201d and (2) \u201cby force and violence, or by assault and putting in fear.\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, </em>324 Mass. 461, 464-465. See also LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law, 692; Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 545. In other words, although it carries a separate label, \u201crobbery is but an aggravated form of larceny.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallegos, </em>130 Colo. 232, 235. See <em>Common-wealth v. Mahoney, </em>331 Mass. 510, 513. See also Perkins, Criminal Law (2d ed.) 280; 46 Am. Jur., Robbery, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The common law came to regard robbery as a more serious offence than larceny because of the added element of personal violence or intimidation. 4 Blackstone, Commentaries (Cooley, 4th ed.) 242-243. 3 Co. Inst. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The exertion of force, actual or constructive, remains the principal distinguishing characteristic of the offence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, supra, </em>at 464. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>333 Mass. 640, 644. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>360 Mass. 566, 567-568. Because the requirement is stated in the disjunctive, if there is actual force, there need be no fear (constructive force), and vice versa. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Humphries, </em>7 Mass. 242, 244. Whether actual or constructive force is employed, the degree of force is immaterial so long as it is sufficient to obtain the victim\u2019s property \u201cagainst his will\u201d (G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39). Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 555-557. Similarly, in every case there must be a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s use of violence or intimidation and his acquisition of the victim\u2019s property. LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law, 696-702. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 559. 46 Am. Jur., Robbery, \u00a7 19. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, supra, </em>at 465. See generally Hale, P. C. (1847 ed.) 534; 77 C. J. S., Robbery, \u00a7\u00a7 11-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The element of \u201cfrom the person\u201d is the other distinctive aspect of robbery. Although some statutory definitions of the offence, including our own (G. L. c. 277, \u00a739), speak of a taking \u201cfrom . . . [the] person\u201d without adding \u201cor in his presence,\u201d a larceny in the presence of the victim is sufficient to constitute robbery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>331 Mass. 510, 513. <em>People </em>v. <em>Braverman, </em>340 111. 525, 530-531. <em>State </em>v. <em>Deso, </em>110 Vt. 1, 6, and cases cited. \u201c[The phrase \u2018or in his presence\u2019] adds nothing other than emphasis because, as pointed out by Coke, where deprivation is accomplished by violence or intimidation, \u2018that which is taken in his presence is in law taken from his person.\u2019 \u201d Perkins, Criminal Law (2d ed.) 282, quoting 3 Co. Inst. 69. An object is deemed to be within the presence of the victim if it is within his area of control. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>235 Mass. 526, 533. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 553. 77 C. J. S., Robbery, \u00a7 9, at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">2. The question whether the snatching or sudden taking of property constitutes robbery has arisen in other jurisdictions although not in Massachusetts. Cf. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Ordway, </em>12 Cush. 270.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Kentucky, the rule is that snatching, without more, involves the requisite element of force to permit a jury verdict on a charge of robbery. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>112 Ky. 689, 692-695; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>135 Ky. 635, 640. According to the rule prevailing in most jurisdictions, however, snatching does not involve sufficient force to constitute robbery, unless the victim resists the taking or sustains physical injury, or unless the article taken is so attached to the victim\u2019s clothing as to afford resistance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law, 696-697; Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 561; 46 Am. Jur., Robbery, \u00a7 21; 77 C. J. S., Robbery, \u00a7 17. See generally 57 L. R. A. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We prefer the Kentucky rule on purse snatching. The majority jurisdiction rule, in looking to whether or not the victim resists, we think, wrongly emphasizes the victim\u2019s opportunity to defend himself over the willingness- of the purse snatcher to use violence if necessary. See Note, 23 J. Cr. Law, 111, 115. Historically, however, the law has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>singled out the robber from other thieves because of his readiness to inflict bodily injury upon his victims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a snatching or sudden taking, so long as the victim is aware of the application of force which relieves him of his property, the crime is, at least to some degree, \u201cagainst . . . [the victim\u2019s] will.\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39. Clearly, more is involved than in a mere stealthy taking where the victim has no present realization of the theft. See Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 560. In the circumstances of a purse snatching, we believe the force applied is sufficient to make the crime a robbery, even though the application of force may, in practice, be so quick as to deny the victim any opportunity to resist.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">3. We consider first the indictment arising from the taking of Florence Spring\u2019s pocketbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The defendant argues that the evidence does not disclose the use of force, actual or constructive, to take the victim\u2019s property. It is conceded that the Commonwealth was not required to show both actual <em>and </em>constructive force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Humphries, </em>7 Mass. 242, 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Snatching necessarily involves the exercise of some actual force. For the reasons stated, <em>supra, </em>we hold that, where, as here, the actual force used is sufficient to produce awareness, although the action may be so swift as to leave the victim momentarily in a dazed condition, the requisite degree of force is present to make the crime robbery. In any event, Mrs. Spring testified that she was \u201c[p]etrified.\u201d And also: \u201cI was scared to death.\u201d Whether her fear aided the defendant in effecting the taking, or merely arose afterwards as the defendant argues, was a question properly for the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the jury. There is no reason for upsetting their factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, </em>324 Mass. 461, relied upon by the defendant, is readily distinguishable on the facts. In the <em>Novieki </em>case, the alleged robber had left the victim\u2019s presence undetected and was in the process of leaving through a door before he was noticed. At 463-464. In these circumstances, there was no basis for a jury finding that the victim\u2019s fear played a part in the larceny. By contrast, in the instant case, Mrs. Spring watched the defendant approach her, and she became aware of the taking as it occurred. The jury could permissibly infer from the totality of the circumstances that the victim\u2019s fright arose simultaneously with, and aided the defendant in, the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">4. Concerning the other indictment, the defendant contends that the evidence is inconclusive as to both where and when Madeline Spring\u2019s pocketbook was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Although no testimony was offered as to the precise location of Miss Spring\u2019s pocketbook at the moment of the taking, we think the evidence presented was ample to permit an inference that the pocketbook was inside the car with the victim when taken. It was not necessary that the Commonwealth show that she was physically in possession. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>235 Mass. 526, 533; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>331 Mass. 510, 513. The closing of the car door on Miss Spring\u2019s foot was sufficient evidence, coupled with the disappearance of her purse at approximately the same time, to allow the jury to infer the requisite causal relationship between the force and the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">5. There was no error in either case in refusing to direct a verdict of not guilty on the charge of unarmed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\"> The four suspects were tried together. In each case against the codefendant who was found with credit cards and other stolen articles, the judge directed verdicts of not guilty on so much of each indictment as charged unarmed robbery, and the jury convicted him on each indictment reduced to larceny. The other two codefendants were acquitted of any participation in the crimes, after their motions for directed verdicts were allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> Larceny as an element of robbery means \u201c[t]he taking and carrying away of [the] personal property of another . . . against his will . . . with intent to steal\u201d (G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39). See LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law, 692; Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 545. Although larceny was so restricted at common law <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>1 Pick. 375, 383), by statute it has been enlarged to include the formerly separate offences of embezzlement and obtaining money or property by false pretences. For a history of the larceny statute (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 53, n. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> Although the proposed new criminal code substantially alters the present statutory provisions (G. L. cc. 263-274), the revision commission maintains this fundamental distinction between robbery and theft. See proposed new G. L. c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 16-20, as contained in Proposed Criminal Code of Massachusetts, 118 \u2014 122. \u201cRobbery is a major offense under \u00a7 16, as it is under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 19 and 21. Section 16 (a) specifies two elements of robbery, the taking of property of another from his person or in his immediate presence, and the use of force to overcome resistance to the taking, to retain the taken property after the taking, or to compel the victim to' deliver the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"> In the <em>Ordway </em>case, the defendants were not charged with robbery but with assault with intent to rob, not being armed. Rev. Sts. c. 125, \u00a7 16 (now G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 20). The evidence was that the defendants \u201csuddenly snatched\u201d two bank bills from the hand of one Buzzell \u201cwithout any force.\u201d One defendant, however, touched Buzzell\u2019s hand, but the victim \u201cdid not think the defendants had any intention of injuring . . . his person.\u201d In the absence of any threat of bodily injury, we concluded: \u201c[T]here . . . [was] no intentional touching . . . amounting to an assault.\u201d There is no assault in these circumstances unless the force used is sufficient to produce either bodily injury or a reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. See Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 382.
