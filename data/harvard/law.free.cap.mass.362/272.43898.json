The owner of an abutting property intervened in the Superior Court and demurred to the amended petition. The case is before us on the intervener\u2019s claim of appeal under G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as amended through St. 1957, c. 155, from an order overruling his demurrer and from an order for judgment directing that a writ of mandamus be issued to the respondent building inspector.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Mandamus proceedings are reviewable according to the principles of review in equity. <em>Chartrand </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>347 Mass. 470, 473. <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Dedham, </em>354 Mass. 688, 689. The trial judge made no findings. We have before us the pleadings, various exhibits, and a condensed transcript of the testimony given in the Superior Court. Under G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, all questions of fact, law, and discretion which were open before the trial judge are open to us on appeal. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Selectmen of So. Hadley, </em>346 Mass. 158, 159. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of No. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">1. In considering the intervener\u2019s appeal from the order overruling his demurrer, we are limited to the facts set forth in the amended petition and in the exhibits appended thereto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>DeLoach </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>352 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Mass. 135, 136. \u201cFor the purposes of this discussion the facts well pleaded . . . must be assumed to be true.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Directors of the Port of Boston, </em>222 Mass. 5, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The pertinent facts alleged are as follows. On September 25, 1967, the petitioner filed an application for a building permit, together with plans and specifications, for the construction of a fifty-three unit apartment building on his land. The proposed plans and specifications complied in every respect with Quincy\u2019s building code, and the proposed use of the land was lawful under the city\u2019s zoning ordinance. While the petitioner\u2019s application was pending, however, the city council on January 22, 1968, adopted a zoning ordinance amendment which rezoned the district including the petitioner\u2019s land and made apartment buildings a prohibited use. Subsequently, the respondent building inspector denied the petitioner\u2019s application on the basis of the amended zoning ordinance. The petitioner duly filed an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13, with the board of appeals which stated in a decision dated May 22, 1968, that \u201cit . . . [had] no power to decide the validity or invalidity of . . . [a] [z]oning [ordinance or amendments thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">More than two and a half years after the board\u2019s action, this court on December 7, 1970, affirmed a Land Court decision which invalidated the 1968 zoning amendment for failure to comply with the statutory procedures for adoption (G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Trumper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>v. <em>Quincy, </em>358 Mass. 311. Immediately thereafter, on December 8, 1970, the petitioner filed a second application which was substantially the same as his first application. The building inspector responded in a letter dated December 10, 1970, as follows: \u201cBecause of . . . [the enclosed] Resolve [of the city council], I can not issue . . . you . . . [the building] permit [which you have requested].\u201d The enclosed resolve provided: \u201c[T]he City Council of . . . Quincy instructs] the Building Inspector . . . not to issue a building permit to Josden Realty Trust \u2014 Ouellette, Trustee... until the ... Council has acted on the proposed new [z]oning [ordinance.\u201d Notice of the proposed ordinance amendment referred to in the resolve was published in February, 1970, but the city council had not adopted the measure by the time the amended petition for a writ of mandamus was filed in January, 1971. The measure, if validly adopted, would reinstate the zoning change invalidated by the <em>Trumpet </em>decision and would make apartment buildings a prohibited use in the district in which the petitioner\u2019s land is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The intervener argues that his demurrer to the amended petition should have been sustained on the ground <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that mandamus does not lie because the petitioner has an adequate administrative remedy in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1963, c. 207, \u00a7 1. The petitioner maintains, to the contrary, that the statutory appeal is unavailable. In the circumstances of this case, we agree with the petitioner that mandamus is the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The pertinent statutory language provides: \u201cAn appeal to the board of appeals . . . may be taken by any person aggrieved by reason of his inability to obtain a permit from any administrative official under the-pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>visions of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a713, as amended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">While \u201c[cjourts must be careful not to invade the province of an administrative board\u201d (Si. <em>Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 470; <em>Electronics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>City Council of Cambridge, </em>348 Mass. 563, 568), we are of opinion that, in the instant case, the statute confers no jurisdiction upon the board of appeals. As we construe G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13, as amended, appeals to the board by aggrieved applicants for building permits are limited to instances where the building inspector has refused a permit \u201cunder the provisions of . . . chapter [40A]\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dennis, </em>342 Mass. 499, 501). See <em>P &amp; D Serv. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dedham, </em>359 Mass. 96, 104. Chapter 40A, \u00a7 12, provides only one ground for refusal: \u201cThe inspector of buildings . . . shall withhold a permit ... if the building ... as constructed . . . would be in violation of any zoning ordinance or by-law or amendment thereof.\u201d Cf. G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3, third paragraph. In the instant case, however, the respondent building inspector has refused the petitioner a permit not on the basis of noncompliance with zoning requirements but rather on account of improper interference with his duties by other municipal officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The intervener has not brought to our attention any statute or ordinance which enlarges the jurisdiction of the board of appeals to encompass matters in addition to those conferred by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13. See Hardy, Municipal Law &amp; Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7 168 at 188-189. Compare <em>C. &amp; H. Co. </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Medford, </em>303 Mass. 499, 500-501; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Dennis, supra, </em>at 500-501. In the absence of such legislation, the futility of an appeal to the board is apparent. It would be unreasonable, therefore, to compel the petitioner to pursue an appeal to the board as a prerequisite to judicial relief. In <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 84, in analogous circumstances, we said: \u201c[Wjhere an administrative agency cannot afford relief resort to the agency is not required.\u201d See <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 470; <em>Metropolitan Dist. Police Relief Assn. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>347 Mass. 686, 689; <em>Bearce </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brockton, </em>351 Mass. 316, 319-320.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Bowes </em>v. <em>Inspector of Bldgs, of Brockton, </em>347 Mass. 295, 296, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We hold that, where, as here, a building inspector acts outside the scope of his authority conferred by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 12, the appropriate means of redress in the absence of an adequate administrative remedy is through a petition for a writ of mandamus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mandamus, of course, will not be granted if the reason given for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>fusing a building permit comes within G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 12 (see <em>Church </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Natick, </em>343 Mass. 266, 268), or if there is an adequate administrative remedy provided in law (see <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Dedham, </em>354 Mass. 688, 690-691).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">2. We come to the intervener\u2019s appeal from the order for judgment directing the issuance of a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The intervener concedes that the resolve purporting to instruct the respondent building inspector has \u201cno validity.\u201d The law is clear on this matter. See <em>Fellsway Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Medford, </em>332 Mass. 471, 472-473.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The intervener contends, however, that, although the city council acted improperly in giving directions to the building inspector, the action of the building inspector in refusing to issue a permit should be affirmed on the basis of our decision in <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Millis, </em>343 Mass. 1, 5-8. We disagree. The rationale of the <em>Doliner </em>case has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In the <em>Doliner </em>case, this court held that, under statutes then in effect, a planning board could properly disapprove a subdivision plan as inconsistent with a newly adopted zoning amendment even before it was approved by the Attorney General under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In reaching this result, we gave dispositive weight to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe issuance of a [building] permit or the beginning of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>[thereunder] . . . , after . . . notice [of hearing on a proposed zoning amendment] has been given . . . , shall not justify the violation of a zoning . . . amendment subsequently adopted as the outcome of such hearing and in substantial accord with such notice . . . ; provided, [that] the subsequent steps required for . . . adoption . . . are taken in their usual sequence without unnecessary or unreasonable delay.\u201d We said (at page 7 of the <em>Doliner </em>case) : \u201c[H]aving in mind c. 40A, \u00a7 11, the Legislature can hardly have intended that a planning board must disregard the terms of a zoning by-law, already adopted by the town even if not yet approved by the Attorney General, when called upon to consider a subdivision plan violating that by-law. ... If the planning board were to approve such a plan, its action would be an empty gesture . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">There is a distinction between a proposed zoning amendment, such as is involved in the instant case, and an amendment which has been adopted but has not yet been approved and published, such as was involved in the <em>Doliner </em>case. While a proposed zoning amendment may undergo substantial changes or may be abandoned entirely, once the town has adopted an amendment, it will generally receive the Attorney General\u2019s approval (either actual or constructive) and, after appropriate publication, will take effect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32. Because of this fundamental difference, while a building inspector may refuse to issue a permit because of a newly adopted zoning amendment, we are unwilling to say that he may refuse to issue a permit merely because of a proposed zoning amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 12, a building inspector is empowered to \u201cwithhold a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>permit\u201d only \u201cif the [proposed] building ... as constructed . . . would be in violation of <em>any zoning ordinance or by-law or amendment therof\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). While the emphasized language is sufficiently broad to encompass an amendment which has been adopted but is not yet effective, we think that a fair construction must exclude a mere proposed zoning amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to show that the proposed zoning amendment was ever adopted. Even if, however, it was adopted in March, 1971, as the intervener asserts in his brief, and even if notice of the initial public hearing thereon was given in February, 1970, it cannot be said that \u201cthe subsequent steps required for the adoption of . . . [the] amendment . . . [were] taken . . . without unnecessary or unreasonable delay\u201d (see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11). Adoption, therefore, would not bar the issuance of the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the petitioner is entitled to a building permit and that the judge properly entered the order for judgment in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>Order overruling demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> An appeal was also claimed from the overruling of a plea in abatement, also filed by the intervener; however, since he has not argued this appeal, it is deemed to have been waived. See <em>Angelico </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>357 Mass. 407, 408, n. 2; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. </em>361 Mass. 582, 583.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\"> These consist of: A. an application for a building permit filed by the petitioner with the respondent building inspector of Quincy on September 25, 1967; B. a decision of the board of appeals of Quincy, dated May 21, 1968, relative to the petitioner\u2019s application (exhibit A); C. a (further) decision of the board of appeals of Quincy, dated February 6, 1970, relative to the petitioner\u2019s application (exhibit A); D. a letter from the respondent building inspector to the petitioner, dated December 10, 1970 (relative to exhibit E), with enclosure consisting of a resolve of the city council of Quincy, dated December 3, 1970; E. an application for a building permit filed by the petitioner with the respondent building inspector on December 8,1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> From the amended petition and appended exhibits, it appears further that the petitioner took an appeal to the Superior Court from the board of appeals\u2019 decision on his first application. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21. While this proceeding was still pending, the Land Court in July, 1969, rendered its decision in <em>Trumper </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>declaring the 1968 zoning amendment invalid, and the respondent building inspector thereupon issued the petitioner a building permit as requested in his first application. An appeal was duly taken by one Stephen P. Scheele to the board of appeals which, on February 6, 1970, reversed the action of the building inspector on the ground that \u201cthis case is before the . . . Superior Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The amended petition contains no indication of the result of the petitioner\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court from the denial of his first application. The intervener pleaded in abatement that a final decree remanding the case to the board of appeals was entered on December 21, 1970. However, the intervener\u2019s appeal from the overruling of his plea in abatement has been deemed waived. See footnote 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> The intervener\u2019s demurrer raised other grounds with respect to the sufficiency of the amended petition, but the intervener has not argued them before this court and they are therefore deemed waived. See authorities cited in footnote 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> Subsequent review would be pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as amended through St. 1970, c. 80: \u201c[A]ny person aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals . . . may appeal to the superior court ... by filing a bill in equity within twenty days after the decision has been filed in the office of the city . . . clerk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15, as amended through St. 1958, c. 381, does not enlarge upon the jurisdiction of the board of appeals with respect to building permits. It provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201cA </em>board of appeals shall have the following powers: 1. To hear and decide appeals taken as provided in section thirteen.\u201d See <em>Bearce </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brockton, </em>351 Mass. 316, 319-320.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> See also 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 605. See generally Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 20.09 (1958 ed. and 1970 Supp.); Anderson, American Law of Zoning, \u00a7 22.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> As was stated in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Billerica, </em>349 Mass. 324, 327, certiorari would not lie (despite dictum to the contrary in <em>Bice </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dennis, </em>342 Mass. 499, 502). While it is true that mandamus is usually reserved for instances of administrative inaction and certiorari lies whenever action has been taken <em>(Beading </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., ante, </em>266, 268-269, n. 3), mandamus appears to have supplanted the traditional function of certiorari in the area of building code and zoning law enforcement. See <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Bourne, </em>337 Mass. 205, 257, and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Since 1958, building inspectors have been required to issue a \u201cdecision\u201d setting forth \u201cin detail all . . . reasons for . . . refusal\u201d when_ a permit for original construction is refused for a residential building with accommodations for more than four families. See St. 1958, c. 515, amending G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3. The older view has persisted, however, that a refusal to issue a building permit is in the nature of inaction and, hence, is properly reviewable by mandamus in the absence of remedy at law or in equity. Because of the long history of exclusive reliance on mandamus in this area, we see no reason to alter our practice, even though St. 1958, c. 515, clearly indicates that refusal to issue a building permit is an action, quasi-judicial in nature, which otherwise would be reviewable by certiorari in the absence of another remedy. To alter our practice now would seem unnecessarily to introduce intricacies into the law. Cf. <em>Beading </em>V. <em>Attorney Gen., ante, </em>266, 268-269, n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> In the <em>Fellsway Realty </em>case, \u201c[t]he building commissioner would have issued . . . [certain building] permits but for the instruction of the city manager ... to hold the matter in abeyance.\u201d We indicated that the petitioner was \u201centitled ... to an order commanding the building commissioner to grant the permits.\u201d At 472. Pertinent to the instant case is our statement (at 472-473) : \u201cWhatever power, if _ any, the city manager had with reference to the granting of permits, he had no authority to induce the building commissioner to refuse to act upon the petitioner\u2019s applications.\u201d The same applies with equal force to the city council involved in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> The approval of the Attorney General may be either actual or constructive. Since the amendment of G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32, by St. 1952, c. 337, if ninety days elapse without any action by the Attorney General, \u201cit shall be presumed that the proof [of proper adoption] submitted was adequate,\u201d and the by-law amendment will take effect as if approved by the Attorney General. See <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>336 Mass. 17, 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> A publication requirement also exists for ordinances. G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32A. There is no requirement in the General Laws, however, that the Attorney General must approve an ordinance before it may take effect. Hardy, Municipal Law &amp; Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7 166. The precise requirements governing legislation by cities will depend on the charter of each city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> There is another consideration as well. Even if a proposed zoning amendment is adopted without substantial change, the amendment will still not affect building permits previously issued if there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u201cunnecessary or unreasonable delay\u201d in the adoption. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11. Thus, until an amendment is actually adopted, it is impossible to anticipate whether the amendment will have retroactive effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
