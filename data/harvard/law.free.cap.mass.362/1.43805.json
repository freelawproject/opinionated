Bettencourt,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by this bill seek to require her to convey to them certain parcels of real estate in Edgartown in accordance with undertakings which the plaintiffs assert Edna made or confirmed in a will executed by her substantially in the same form, and on the same day (February 14, 1967), as a will made by Anthony. A demurrer <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">A Superior Court judge made a report of material facts. He concluded that the wills of the widow and her late husband in fact \u201cwere wills\u201d which (as to her will) Edna \u201ccould revoke ... at her pleasure.\u201d By final decree, the bill was dismissed. The children appealed. Designated evidence is reported. See S. J. C. Rule 1:02, 351 Mass. 732-734; 353 Mass. 804. The facts are stated (except as otherwise indicated) on the basis of the report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-10\">Edna married Anthony in 1947. Including their children by earlier marriages, they had five children in all (fn. 1). Anthony and Edna made several trips to California. On a trip in 1966 they had narrowly escaped several automobile accidents! They planned to go to California again in 1967. They decided to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>vide for the children by will \u201cin case they were both killed during the trip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">A lawyer (who had done earlier work for Anthony and Edna) made a draft will for each of them and then met with them. He told them \u201cthat they could change the will at any time.\u201d The lawyer \u201cdid not inform . . . [them] that he intended to draw a trust, or an agreement.\u201d The instruments were signed simultaneously. Edna\u2019s will was placed on deposit (G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1960, c. 118; and \u00a7\u00a711 and 12) with the register of probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">On the next day Anthony and Edna left for California. While there they separated. Edna returned in the spring to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. She consulted a lawyer and began divorce proceedings in April, 1968. In November, 1968, Edna went to the court house, took her will there on deposit, \u201cput several crosses through\u201d it, and wrote \u201cRevoked\u201d on each page.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">In December, 1968, a hearing was held on Edna\u2019s libel. \u201c[N]o decree was ever issued.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Anthony died on March 27, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">Edna\u2019s will contained the following language which gives rise to the present controversy: \u201cMy husband, Anthony . . . and I own as joint tenants the real estate and personal property described in the paragraphs below . . . A, B, C, D, E and F. We have agreed with one another, in consideration of identical promises of each to the other, that following the death of the first of us to die the survivor will dispose of said jointly owned property in the manner stated in said paragraphs. By this will, and by an identical will made today by my husband, each of us confirms the agreement and provides for the disposition of said property and of our respective interests therein as joint tenants and as a survivor in the manner stated in said paragraphs ; and each of us agrees to execute whatever addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tional deeds or other instruments may be necessary to accomplish the agreed results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">After the passage just quoted follow five paragraphs marked A to E, inclusive. Each paragraph describes a parcel of land in Edgartown and gives it to one or more of the children (in one instance subject to a life interest in the survivor of Anthony and Edna).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provisions of pars. A to E, inclusive, indicate that all or most of the parcels of real estate referred to in those paragraphs were owned by Anthony and Edna as tenants by the entirety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The judge admitted, without any exception being saved (or any objection being made except on the ground of materiality), Edna\u2019s testimony about what the lawyer told Anthony and her before the will was signed. She testified that \u201cwhen we were making the will up . . . [the lawyer] said that we could have this will added to or changed in any way whatsoever whenever each one of us wanted to do it \u2014 we didn\u2019t have to do it together, or anything like that. Each one could change it according to his own will.\u201d She denied that the lawyer ever told her \u201cthat the will could not be revoked\u201d or that he ever used the word \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201cagreement.\u201d Also without exception (and over only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>general objections) she gave testimony that she \u201cbelieved that . . . [she] could change the will or do as . . . [she] pleased with it at any time,\u201d and that her husband never told her or (to her knowledge) anyone else that \u201chis understanding was any different from\u201d hers. She further testified that the \u201cwill was made up specifically for our trip to California, with the understanding that I could change or do anything that I wanted to with it at any time if I was able to get back.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The lawyer testified that he had been asked \u201cto prepare a document which would provide that the survivor [of Anthony and Edna] would not have an uncontrolled and absolute ownership of the properties which are involved in the agreement, to do with as the survivor saw fit.\u201d Such an arrangement \u201cthey did not want . . ..\u201d Instead, he said, they wanted \u201ca provision . . . allocating the properties to the children . . . upon the death of the first one of them to die.\u201d The lawyer denied that he ever told Edna \u201cthat she could change this document at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">1. The instrument, stating that it is Edna\u2019s last will (found by the judge to be identical to that of Anthony), is (with respect to the recital of an agreement with Anthony about disposal of the Edgar town real estate) somewhat unusual in Massachusetts. See Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 342, p. 397 (\u201cThere is no law or practice in Massachusetts as to either joint or mutual wills\u201d). See also Lombard, Probate Law and Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 1621, 1628. Compare, however, <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>251 Mass. 218, 220-222. Elsewhere the law is by no means uniform, but there is substantial authority that mutual or reciprocal wills, particularly those of a husband and wife, may be based upon, reflect, or express a prior or simultaneous contract (not unilaterally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>revocable) to dispose of property in a specified manner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The mere execution of simultaneous and reciprocal wills, however, \u201cdoes not, of itself, show that the parties had entered into a contract to make such wills\u201d or other disposition. See Page, Wills (Bowe-Parker ed.) \u00a7 10.4;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sparks, Contracts to Make Wills, 29-30. See also <em>Gary </em>v. <em>Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. </em>[1928] A. C. 391, 400-401; <em>Re Oldham, </em>[1924] 1 Ch. 75, 87-89. On the other hand, some cases elsewhere allow enforcement of adequately proved agreements (sometimes set out or referred to in wills) to make dispositions of particular property. See e.g. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>53 Cal. 2d 567, 587-589; <em>Helms </em>v. <em>Darmstatter, </em>56 Ill. App. 2d 176, 182-187; <em>Estate of Wade, </em>202 Kans. 380, 385-390 (will held contractual despite absence from it of language to that effect); <em>Wimp </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>414 S. W. 2d 65, 70-77 (Mo.); <em>Geiger </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>185 Neb. 700, 702 (agreement in wills); <em>Tutunjian </em>v. <em>Vetzigian, </em>299 N. Y. 315, 319-321 (\u201cresulting trust\u201d held to result from contract); <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Mueller, </em>19 N. Y. 2d 228, 231-234; <em>God-win </em>v. <em>Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>259 N. C. 520, 529-530 (simultaneously executed wills, incorporating an invalidly executed trust agreement, held evidence of a contract) ; <em>Olive </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>276 N. C. 445, 464-465. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Foley </em>v. <em>Elliot Community Hosp. </em>98 N. H. 186, 190.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The uncertainties concerning the effect, interpretation, and consequences of joint, mutual, or reciprocal wills are strong reason for strictly construing such instruments, in effect, as presumptively not intended to make or reflect a contract for a particular disposition of property. In the absence of explicit language compelling such a construction, simultaneously made wills with reciprocal provisions, we think, should not be interpreted as expressing a contractual obligation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if a contractual obligation in fact is intended in such circumstances as here appear, we are of opinion that the desired result is likely to be accomplished more clearly (and with more complete understanding by the parties) by the use of a carefully expressed trust instrument rather than by the use of wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The asserted agreement (at least apart from par. F, fn. 5, supra) is not one to make a devise at Edna\u2019s death or to make a will (see G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 560, \u00a7 1, and \u00a7 5A, inserted by St. 1965, c. 560, \u00a7 2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but is one to make the inter vivas dispositions which each will stipulates. See c. 259, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The disposition in Edna\u2019s will, if it determined that a contract was intended, in terms is specific enough to constitute a memorandum. It is signed by Edna, the party to be charged. It states the terms of the \u201cagreement\u201d between her and Anthony, and indicates the consideration. It proposes inter vivas transfers of specifically described parcels. The statute of frauds thus can be satisfied by the writing contained in the will. See <em>Herr Estate, </em>400 Pa. 90, 96; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 509. See also <em>Tzitzon Realty Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Mustonen, </em>352 Mass. 648, 651-654; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>136 Cal. App. 2d 125, 129-132.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">We recognize that the references in Edna\u2019s will to the existence of an agreement are somewhat unusual in Massachusetts, and that there exists uncertainty whether (a) they reflect a binding contract or trust rather than (b) an informal intra-family understanding subject to alteration at the will of the parties. These doubts arise primarily because of paroi testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">The cases elsewhere (see fn. 9 and related text of this opinion) have employed, with considerable freedom, paroi evidence to resolve ambiguities implicit in similar language in or affecting wills. The references to a contract, however, in the simultaneous wills before us may be more definite than those upheld as reflecting a contract in most of the cases in other jurisdictions already cited. Not only is the language adequate to meet the requirements of the statute of frauds, but it purports definitely to describe a specific agreement. In no respect is the contract described a strange one for a wife (married twice and with children by each marriage) to make with a husband with a similar family background, for the appropriate treatment of all of the children. Neither the instruments nor the paroi evidence suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that any contract between the parties was based on an express or implied condition that the agreement be dependent upon the continuance of an amicable marriage relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The agreement seems intrinsically a fair one. It was drawn by an attorney who seems to have tried to state clearly an integrated and binding contract. Even paroi evidence, admitted without exception, cannot be employed to vary an integrated written agreement. See <em>Gethins </em>v. <em>Breeyear, 252 </em>Mass. 326, 327-328; <em>Kerwin </em>v. <em>Donaghy, </em>317 Mass. 559, 568. See also <em>Frick Co. </em>v. <em>New England Insulation Co. </em>347 Mass. 461, 467; <em>Pagliarulo </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>353 Mass. 449, 450. In the present case, however, the paroi evidence was properly considered at least to disclose the circumstances attendant upon the execution of the wills and, to that extent, to assist in determining what the parties intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The judge\u2019s decision was based on meager subsidiary findings and was at best ambiguous. He concluded only that the instruments \u201cin so far as it is . . . [a] question of fact . . . [from Edna\u2019s and the attorney\u2019s testimony] <em>ivere wills, </em>and as <em>such . . . </em>Edna . . . could revoke . . . [her] will at her pleasure\u201d (emphasis supplied). Although he made subsidiary findings, which were consistent with parts of Edna\u2019s paroi testimony, he did not address himself directly to the issue whether the parties intended to make, or had made, a contract. He also did not deal in explicit terms with whether the instruments stated or recorded an integrated agreement, which would preclude variation by paroi evidence. He seems to have reached his conclusion solely on the basis that the instruments were wills and hence revocable, an issue not decisive of the case. Much more complete subsidiary findings and a more detailed statement of conclusions would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Although the evidence is before us, the court concludes that it should not attempt to resolve the ambiguities in the judge\u2019s decision. We have had no opportunity to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and appraise the witnesses. Accordingly, we remand the case for a new trial (in the light of this opinion) in which there should be specific findings on all appropriate issues.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">2. The remaining question is whether these plaintiffs can maintain the present suit. This is in part a proceeding for declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231 A. That chapter (see \u00a7 9) is to be construed broadly. See <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>340 Mass. 235, 239; <em>Norwell </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Ind. Co. </em>358 Mass. 575, 578. See also <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>346 Mass. 677, 684, fn. 6. Even if a plaintiff is not entitled to the particular relief sought, he is entitled to a binding declaration of rights under an agreement. See <em>Hannan </em>v. <em>Enterprise Publishing Co. </em>341 Mass. 363, 365; <em>Provident Coop. Bank </em>v. <em>James Talcott, Inc. </em>358 Mass. 180, 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">The plaintiffs are all in an intimate family relationship to Edna. They may well be within the principle allowing enforcement of contracts by beneficiaries, who have furnished no consideration and who are not parties to the contract, but who are closely related by blood or family connection to a promisor or promisee. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Green, </em>298 Mass. 19, 20-23, and cases cited; Corbin, Contracts (and 1971 supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 826, 1154; Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 357-360. Cf. <em>Estate of Porter </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev. </em>442 F. 2d 915, 918-919 (1st Cir.). Enforcement of such a beneficiary\u2019s interest<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>may perhaps be sustained on the theory that a trust has been created in substance (see <em>Henry F. Mitchell Co. </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>353 Mass. 318, 320-322) if not in form. See <em>Rugo </em>v. <em>Rugo, </em>325 Mass. 612, 616. Cf. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>251 Mass. 218, 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We need not resolve these procedural problems in the present case. One plaintiff is the executor of Anthony, a party to the contract reflected in Edna\u2019s will. He may enforce Edna\u2019s obligation under the contract, as Anthony\u2019s personal representative. We think this plaintiff now should be allowed to amend the bill, to become also a party plaintiff in his capacity as executor. <em>Margolis </em>v. <em>Margolis, </em>338 Mass. 416, 418. See also <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>233 Mass. 351, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">3. The interlocutory decree overruling the demurrer is affirmed. The final decree is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further preliminary proceedings and a new trial in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b16-11\"> Two plaintiffs are sons of Edna\u2019s late husband, Anthony A. Bettencourt, by his first marriage. One plaintiff is Anthony\u2019s son by Edna. The plaintiffs, assert the right to bring the bill in behalf of another child, the daughter of Anthony and Edna, and of Edna\u2019s daughter (adopted by Anthony) of an earlier marriage, if these daughters should see fit to seek to be joined as plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b16-12\"> This demurrer asserted (1) absence of grounds for relief in equity; (2) the statute of frauds, G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 5A, and (3) absence of an enforceable right in the children to sue on a contract to which they were not parties and with respect to which no consideration moved from them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b17-9\"> Edna testified that \u201cthe divorce was denied\u201d and a support order was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b18-7\"> In each of pars. B through E, inclusive, there appears a final sentence,_ substantially (apart from minor changes appropriate to the particular designated child or children) like the following language in par. B, viz.: \u201cPromptly after the death of my husband, if I survive him, I will execute any deeds or other instruments necessary to convey the said property in fee to our said son and his issue by right of representation if he or any of his issue are then living.\u201d Some of the paragraphs refer also to personal property related to the real estate mentioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b18-8\"> Another possibly relevant provision is par. F of Edna\u2019s will, which reads: \u201cIf I survive my husband, all the real and personal property which we owned jointly, including any of the properties described in paragraphs A through E above the grantees of which shall have predeceased me, shall belong to me absolutely as survivor to do with as I see fit. I give, devise and bequeath such part of said properties as I may still own at the time of my death, and also all other real or personal property which I may then own, or to which I may be entitled, or over which I may have any power of appointment, in equal shares to our then living children, Richard, Walter, Andreanna, Anthony and Rebecca, the issue of any deceased child to take by right of representation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b19-6\"> There was also introduced in evidence the transcript of parts of Anthony\u2019s testimony at the hearing of the divorce libel in which he replied to a question about the conversation among the lawyer, Edna, and himself: \u201cWas anything said . . . that she could not revoke the will?\u201d Answer: \u201cNo, there was nothing said about it, not a word.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b20-5\"> See cases collected in Page, Wills (Bowe-Parker ed. and 1972 supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 10.1 to 10.50; Powell, Real Property, pars. 962-963 (and 1971 supp.) ; Thompson, Wills (3d ed. and 1962 supp.) \u00a7 16; Tiffany, Real Property (3d ed.) \u00a7 1093 (and 1972 supp.) ; Sparks, Contracts to Make Wills, 190 \u2014 198; annotation, 169 A.
