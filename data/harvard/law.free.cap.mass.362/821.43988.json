The defendants denied that the structure was a mobile home or trailer, contending that the \u201cbuilding\u201d was erected in compliance with the permit and not in violation of the town by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">1. The case was referred to a master who heard the parties and their witnesses and took a view. The master recited detailed subsidiary findings and reported his ultimate findings to be \u201c[u]pan all the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom . . ..\u201d He found that (1) the defendant\u2019s premises are in a residence A district; (2) the unit in question is a mobile home; (3) a mobile home is not a permitted use in a residence A district; and (4) the \u201cplacement\u201d of the unit on the defendants\u2019 premises was in violation of the local zoning by-law. The evidence is not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The third and fourth \u201cfindings\u201d are more properly considered rulings of law <em>(Manchester </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>343 Mass. 591, 593-594) which the order of reference appointing the master did not empower him to make. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Scheffreen, </em>215 Mass. 444, 449. But since the master\u2019s report was confirmed as modified by the Superior Court judge, he must be presumed to have made his own rulings from the master\u2019s findings. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Scheffreen, supra, </em>449. See <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>353 Mass. 341, 346; <em>International Tel, &amp; Tel. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>357 Mass. 282, 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The defendants filed two objections to the master\u2019s report. The judge, in an interlocutory decree, sustained the objections as exceptions and confirmed the master\u2019s report as so modified. A final decree was then entered dismissing the board\u2019s bill, and the board appealed from both decrees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The pertinent facts as found by the master are sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>marized. For \u201cover nine years\u201d before 1970 the defendants had operated a package store, laundromat and tavern on their premises in a wooden building. The building was L shaped with a second story extending over part of the premises, on a foundation, with wrought iron columns supporting the roof. In 1970 a fire completely destroyed the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">One of the defendants, James D. Garvey, filed an application with the board for a building permit in which he indicated that the purpose of the structure was to house a laundromat and a package store; that the building materials were to be aluminum, steel and wood; and that the building would be one story high on a concrete block foundation. After receiving the permit the defendants contacted a manufacturer of mobile homes to build a unit with an office, salesroom and storage space.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The\" master found that the \u201cusual Mobile Home consists of 5 rooms including bath.\u201d As further distinguished from the usual mobile home, the defendants\u2019 unit has wooden doors and no windows in the back portion. It h\u00e1s heavier floors and more insulation. On delivery of the unit, the attached wheels and undercarriage were removed and the unit, which has no sanitary facilities, was placed on a foundation of cinder blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The defendants\u2019 premises are located in a \u201cmostly single family residential\u201d area although there is a nearby market and across from the defendants\u2019 premises is a \u201cdilapidated barn.\u201d The property is in a residence A district which restricts use to detached one family dwellings and other uses not here pertinent. Before placing the unit on their land the defendants were warned by a member of the board not to do so because the placement of a \u201cmobile home\u201d on the premises would be in violation of the zoning by-law. The defendants took the position that the structure was a modular unit and not a mobile home, and the unit was installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The board argues that the use of the defendants\u2019 property before the fire \u201cas a package store, cafe and laundromat . . . [constituted] a nonconforming use,\u201d and that the \u201csaid uses were carried on and conducted in a wooden frame building and not in a trailer or mobile home.\u201d The argument continues that because the old building was totally demolished by fire, any new construction must conform to the zoning by-law, and we agree. The only violation of the by-law specifically alleged and argued is that the defendants\u2019 unit is a \u201cmobile home\u201d and therefore does not conform with the by-law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We restrict our decision to a consideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Since the defendants have not claimed, and do not appear to be entitled to, any exception to the structure requirements of their district, they, like other builders in the area, must comply with the by-law in this respect. We agree with the board\u2019s argument that it was \u201cthe intention of the draftsmen in drawing the zoning by-laws of the town to restrict . . . [mobile homes] to a business B district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The portion of the by-law governing residence A districts does not include \u201cmobile homes\u201d in its list of permitted uses. \u201cIt is a \u2018familiar principle of interpretation that express mention of one matter excludes by implication other similar matters not mentioned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mayor of Beverly, </em>315 Mass. 567, 569. <em>Building Inspector of Chelmsford </em>v. <em>Belleville, </em>342 Mass. 216, 218. Since \u201cmobile homes\u201d are specifically permitted in business B districts, it would seem that the exclusion of these structures from residence A districts did not occur through oversight. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mayor of Beverly, supra, </em>at 570. We conclude, therefore, that the defendants are not permitted to replace their old building with a \u201cmobile home.\u201d It is thus crucial to the case whether the defendants\u2019 unit is properly described as a \u201cmobile home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The defendants excepted to the master\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>the unit was a mobile home because such a finding was \u201cinconsistent with the description of the unit by the Master as a building ordered and erected for business purposes\u201d and because such a finding conflicted with the definition of a mobile home as outlined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge sustained this exception \u201cas to the ultimate finding that the unit placed on the premises is a mobile home.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Where the evidence is not reported both the trial judge and the appellate justices are required to treat the master\u2019s findings of fact as binding unless they are mutually inconsistent, contradictory, plainly wrong or vitiated in view of the controlling law. <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>280 Mass. 303, 308. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>297 Mass. 466, 469. <em>Boxborough </em>v. <em>Joatham Spring Realty Trust, </em>356 Mass. 487, 489. <em>Gil-Bern Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>357 Mass. 620, 623. Thus we must decide whether the trial judge was justified in modifying the master\u2019s report by sustaining the defendants\u2019 exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The defendants objected that the master must use the phrase \u201cmobile home\u201d as it is defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L. In <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>343 Mass. 591, 593, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>n. 3, we stated that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L, related \u201conly vaguely, if at all, to . . . [the interpretation of a zoning by-law. The statute\u2019s] concern is with matters other than zoning.\u201d See also <em>Ellis </em>v. Assessors <em>of Acushnet, </em>358 Mass. 473, 474. We believe that the definition of a \u201cmobile home\u201d und\u00e9r G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> primarily relates to licensing and regulating mobile home parks as outlined in \u00a7 32A through \u00a7 32K and is not controlling in the interpretation of municipal zoning by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The board argues that the master\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cmobile home\u201d must be controlled by its use in the portion of the by-law regulating business B districts. Generally, a zoning by-law must be read in its complete context and be given a sensible meaning within that context. <em>Rando </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Bedford, </em>348 Mass. 296, 297-298. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>358 Mass. 253, 258-259. Under the zoning by-law of the town of Hatfield \u201cmobile homes\u201d are a permitted use within a business B district. The board maintains that the placement of mobile homes within a business district implies that the draftsmen of the by-law were aware of the commercial uses of mobile homes, and that therefore the master\u2019s finding that the unit was a mobile home, in violation of the by-law, was justified and should not have been deleted from the master\u2019s report by sustaining the defendants\u2019 exceptions. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The by-law, which permits the placement of mobile homes in a commercial district, does not necessarily imply a recognition of the commercial uses of mobile homes. It may simply be a method of banning such homes from certain residential districts. Business B districts allow \u201c[a]ny use permitted in a Business District A\u201d and business A districts allow \u201c[a]ny use permitted in a Residence District A.\u201d It follows that \u201cmobile homes\u201d in a\" business B district may be used for dwelling purposes. Even if the by-law were considered to recognize that some mobile homes in business B districts may be used for commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>purposes, that would not indicate that a mobile unit, constructed solely for commercial purposes and having none of the features of a home, should be classified as a mobile home under the by-law. We think that the use of the phrase \u201cmobile home\u201d rather than \u201cmobile unit\u201d or the like indicates an intention that the mobile structures referred to in business B districts should have some structural features resembling a home.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We believe that the master\u2019s findings that the manu; facturer constructed the unit specially for use as a liquor store, that the unit contained an office, salesroom, storage space, and no sanitary facilities, was not intended to be used as a dwelling unit, had reinforced floors, extra insulation, no windows at the back and three wooden doors at the front, contains a built-in walk-in refrigerator, two portable coolers and a cash register, and that the unit is sitting on two rows of cinder blocks on a set foundation, are mutually inconsistent with his findings that it was in fact a mobile home, especially in light of his finding that the \u201cusual Mobile Home consists of 5 rooms including bath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Our opinion in <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>which included an extensive review of analogous cases and authorities (343 Mass. 591, 596-597, and notes 4 and 6), is not to the contrary. In that case the town by-law specifically excluded an \u201covernight camp, trailer, or mobile home\u201d from the term \u201cdwelling.\u201d We held that a trailer that had been permanently affixed to a foundation was not a \u201cdwelling\u201d and thus was not permitted in a single residence district. It was clear that the unit was constructed with all facilities to make it suitable for living quarters. Sewage connections had been made and it was \u201c \u2018. . . elaborately equipped with kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, a bath and a long connecting hall.\u2019 \u201d 343 Mass, at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The issue in the <em>Manchester </em>case was essentially whether the unit could properly be called a \u201cmobile home\u201d when it was no longer mobile. The issue before us in this case is whether the defendants\u2019 unit can prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>erly be classified as a mobile home when it is neither mobile nor has the facilities of a home. In the circumstances of this case, where the town by-law has not elaborated upon the definition of \u201cmobile home,\u201d we think that the defendants\u2019 unit cannot properly be described as a \u201cmobile home,\u201d and that, therefore, the master\u2019s report was appropriately modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In light of our view that the phrase \u201cmobile home\u201d may import different structures in different statutory contexts, we cannot.delineate any definite set of components that will necessitate the finding in all cases that a particular structure is a mobile home. In the circumstances of the instant case the judge below ruled correctly that the structure described in the master\u2019s report is not a \u201cmobile home\u201d as that term is used in the zoning by-law of the town of Hatfield. The trial judge was, therefore, justified in modifying the final report as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\"> The defendants have not submitted a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\"> It appears that this was the first unit the builder had made for business rather than for residential purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\"> The question of the defendants\u2019 right to rebuild at all, after their structure was totally destroyed, was not argued. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\"> The statute was designated by the defendants as \u201cMassachusetts General Laws, Chapter 140, Section 32 (1)\u201d which was stated to define mobile homes: \u201c\u2018As used in Section 32 (h) to 32 (k) inclusive, the words \u201cMobile home\u201d <em>shall </em>mean a <em>dwelling unit </em>built on a chassis and containing complete electrical, plumbing, and sanitary facilites, and designed to be installed on a temporary or permanent foundation, for <em>permanent living quarters.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied).\u201d In fact there is no \u00a7 32 (1) of c. 140. We presume the defendants were referring to \u00a7 32L of that chapter, as appearing in St. 1964, c. 592, \u00a7 14, which reads: \u201cAs used in sections thirty-two A to thirty-two K, inclusive, the words \u2018mobile home\u2019 shall mean a dwelling unit built on a chassis and containing complete electrical, plumbing and sanitary facilites, and designed to be installed on a temporary or permanent foundation for permanent living quarters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\"> The defendants also excepted to the master\u2019s finding that the \u201cplacement\u201d of the unit upon the premises was in violation of the zoning by-law on the ground that the master\u2019s admission that he was unable to determine the street lines abutting the defendants\u2019 premises prevented such a conclusion. The second exception was sustained \u201cas to the ultimate finding that the unit is a mobile home and thus may not be located on the land in question under the applicable zoning by-law.\u201d It appears, therefore, that the second exception was treated as an exception to the finding that the unit was a mobile home. The particular placement of the unit within the area comprising the defendants\u2019 premises does not appear to be in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> See n. 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
