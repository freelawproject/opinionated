J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACS\">The defendant appeals under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from a conviction of murder in the first degree with a recommendation that the death sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>not be imposed. The defendant urges the court, pursuant to its power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended, to reduce the charge to manslaughter or at most, murder in the second degree. He argues that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, is so vague, indefinite and uncertain as to murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, that it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The pertinent evidence is summarized. Officer Foley and his partner responded to a radio report at approximately 6:15 a.m. on August 19, 1970, that a man had been struck by a car in the vicinity of 615-617 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston. Officer Foley testified that at the scene the defendant approached him and told him that he had called the police and that the man had been struck by a car. Officer Foley stated that the defendant had \u201can odor of alcohol on his breath,\u201d but that in his opinion he was sober. Also at the scene, an eyewitness, Nick Cook, told Officer Foley that he had seen the defendant kicking the victim around his head. The defendant was taken into custody, at which time Cook stated, \u201cThat\u2019s the man that did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Cook testified that while he was walking on Massachusetts Avenue on his way to work, he heard a man calling for help. He continued walking and then stopped and looked across the street and saw a man \u201clying down in the street . . . and another man . . . kicking him.\u201d He crossed to the same side of the street and observed the defendant continue to kick the victim. He testified that it \u201c[l]ooked like he was kicking him somewhere around his head, somewhere around his shoulders.\u201d He further testified that the defendant walked away momentarily and then on four or five occasions over a five to seven minute period returned and continued to kick the victim. The victim did not move during the episode. On one occasion, the defendant \u201cgot down on top [of the victim], and . . . came up with some keys.\u201d He then tried to open a nearby car with the keys and was unsuccessful; \u201che went back and . . . kicked the man a little bit more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The only testimony as to how the altercation began came from the defendant. In essence his testimony was that he had been drinking all night visiting numerous bars including an \u201cafter hours joint\u201d and that he left the \u201cjoint\u201d at 6 A.M. intending to take public transportation home. As he walked along Massachusetts Avenue with his head down he \u201cbumped into a guy.\u201d There was an argument, the victim pushed him down and kicked him twice on his left side. He then managed to throw the victim down and kicked him several times. He put his foot on the victim\u2019s head and pushed him away when the victim grabbed him by his pants leg. He then walked away but returned thinking he had injured the victim badly. He shook the victim but he did not move; he then saw Cook and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Sergeant Marquardt, who was at the scene of the crime and at the booking, and Officer Brady, the booking officer, both testified that in their opinion the defendant was sober. He was able to answer the booking officer\u2019s questions and was able to make a telephone call from the station without any assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The case was submitted to the jury with the judge\u2019s instructions encompassing murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, manslaughter, assault and battery, and self-defence. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict on either \u201c[mjurder committed with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought, or with extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">To sustain a verdict of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, \u201cthe evidence must be of such a character as to show that the crime was committed under circumstances indicating something more than ordinary atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>265 Mass. 382, 388. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 628. \u201cRepeated violent blows have been held to evince such ferocity as would warrant a finding of extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGarty, </em>323 Mass. 435, 440. \u201cThe final determination of whether extreme atrocity or cruelty exists, however, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>decided by the jury, who, as the repository of the community\u2019s conscience, can best determine when the mode of inflicting death is so shocking as to amount to extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra, </em>at 628. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>126 Mass. 253, 255. \u201cIt is not necessary, however, to show that such atrocity or cruelty was premeditated or that the defendant knew his conduct constituted extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>358 Mass. 407, 415. Whether or not the defendant was intoxicated therefore is not a relevant consideration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>165 Mass. 45, 57-59; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra, </em>416, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The medical testimony showed that there were lacerations on the forehead, \u201cover the eyelid to the left eye, and in front of the [left] ear.\u201d The lower left eyelid was swollen and reddish; there were abrasions on the left cheek, left ear lobe, chin and neck. The bones of the nose were crushed. The victim\u2019s lungs and windpipe were filled with blood and fluid, and the blood was coming from the crushed nose. This condition is called \u201caspiration of blood,\u201d which means \u201cthat the airways are filled with blood so no air can come through the windpipe . . . down to the bronchial tubes into the lungs.\u201d \u201cThe heart was slightly enlarged, but other than that, it was normal in every respect, and there were no abnormalities of the spleen or the liver, the kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract, except for the stomach, which was partially collapsed and also contained blood .... There was no evidence of fractures of the skull, and there was no hemorrhage, tumor or abscess, or any softening in the brain.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s opinion was that the injuries were consistent \u201cwith kicking with a shoe\u201d and that death was the \u201cresult of multiple blows to the head with fractures of nose and aspiration of blood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The defendant contends that the physical injuries inflicted were not of the magnitude to warrant findings of extreme atrocity and cruelty. The extent of physical injuries is not, however, the sole governing test. \u201cOur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>cases have usually looked to the consciousness and degree of suffering of the victim, the disproportion between the means actually needed to inflict death and those employed, the instrumentalities employed and the extent of physical injury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 628. The defendant kicked his victim to death over a period of five to seven minutes during which time the victim lay motionless and unable any longer to cry for help. The defendant returned on four or five separate occasions to continue his brutal attack on the victim. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that \u201cthe crime was committed with such savagery and brutality as to constitute murder committed with extreme atrocity and cruelty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feci, </em>235 Mass. 562, 571. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>126 Mass. 253, <em>255; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devereaux, </em>256 Mass. 387, 394; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartolini, </em>299 Mass. 503, 516; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGarty, </em>323 Mass. 435, 440; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra, </em>at 628-629. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Vaughn, </em>329 Mass. 333, 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In addition, \u201c[t]he injuries inflicted on the deceased showed a conscious and fixed purpose to kill continuing for a length of time and warranted a finding of murder with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 356. See <em>Commonwealth v. Tucker, </em>189 Mass. 457, 486-496; <em>Commonwealth v. Bartolini, supra, </em>at 515-516; <em>Commonwealth v. Brooks, </em>308 Mass. 367, 369. There was conflicting evidence as to the extent of intoxication at the time of the killing; the defendant\u2019s testimony indicating that he was drunk, and the police officers testifying as to his sobriety. The jury could properly conclude that the defendant was sufficiently sober so that he was capable of forming a deliberately premeditated intention to kill. See <em>Commonwealth v. Rogers, </em>351 Mass. 522, 532-533, cert. den. sub nom. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>389 U. S. 991; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 634-635.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">This court has already decided \u201cthat G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, is not void for vagueness. The statutory language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>\u2018extreme atrocity or cruelty\u2019 has been applied frequently and for many years. These words convey \u2018sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>332 U. S. 1, 8.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eisen, </em>358 Mass. 740, 747.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim as to a conflict between himself and counsel as affecting the outcome of the case is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We have reviewed the entire evidence and are of opinion that justice does not require a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-16\"> Habeas corpus was granted on other grounds. <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>452 F. 2d 860, 865 (1st Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
