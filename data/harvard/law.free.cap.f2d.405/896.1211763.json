A paper furnish composition suitable for the preparation of non-woven paper sheets comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-21\">(a) an aqueous dispersion of cellulosic paper-making fibers, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-22\">(b) from about 0.5 to 30 per cent by weight, based on the weight of the cellulosic fibers, of high purity chrysotile asbestos characterized by a specific surface area greater than 60 m2/gm., a magnetite content less than 0.5 per cent, a reflectance greater than 72 per cent, and a pulpability such that less than 1.0 per cent of the asbestos is retained on a 65 mesh Tyler screen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-24\">Claims 6 and 14 are also independent claims drawn, respectively, to a process of manufacturing paper using the composition of claim 1 and a paper sheet obtained by this process. Claims 2-5, 7-10, and 15-18 are ultimately dependent on claims 1, 6, and 14, respectively, and recite \u201csizing,\u201d a \u201crubbery latex binder,\u201d or a \u201cnon-fibrous inorganic filler\u201d as additional paper-making ingredients. Claims 11 and 12 are independent claims drawn to two preferred embodiments of the process wherein a pre-mixed, \u201chigh-purity\u201d asbestos composition containing a dye (claim 11) or containing a non-fibrous inorganic filler (claim 12) is added to an otherwise conventional paper furnish composition prior to depositing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number><em>the </em>furnish on a paper-making screen. Claim 13 is dependent on claim 12 and recites a specific filler, titanium dioxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">The only issue we find it necessary to consider is whether or not the claimed invention is obvious within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 in view of prior art and therefore unpatentable. Four United States patents were relied on by the examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">Greenman et al. 2,698,788 Jan. 4, 1955</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJb\">Schur et al. 2,733,720 Feb. 7, 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-6\">Poelman et al. 3,034,981 May 15, 1962</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\">Novak 3,062,701 Nov. 6, 1962</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">The examiner rejected all claims on Novak <em>alone, </em>certain claims were <em>alternatively </em>rejected on Schur <em>alone, </em>and several claims were further rejected on Novak in view of Poelman or Greenman. We need not discuss Schur because Novak is clearly the more relevant of the two primary references. Since Poelman and Greenman were cited solely to show the use of latex with asbestos fiber compositions, and since appellant, in his application and in his brief, admits that this use of latex was known in the art, it is also unnecessary for us to dise\u00fcss these two references or the rejections based on their combination with Novak.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The only remaining reference, Novak, discloses a method of opening the tight fiber bundles of milled chrysotile asbestos into unit fibers and discloses the use of these fibers as an additive in cellulosic paper. The milled asbestos is opened by agitation in water containing a controlled amount of a surface active agent. There is obtained a dispersion of unit fibers which, upon standing, reverts to a \u201cminimal clotted\u201d state. Novak states that \u201cSuch minimal clotted asbestos fiber body may then be readily diluted to any desired degree in the paper-making process and added at a point in the beater where the paper-making adjuvants, such as alum, sizing, and the like are introduced.\u201d Novak asserts that this method of obtaining unit asbestos fibers is preferred to grinding and beating milled asbestos to very small bits, lengthwise and in diameter, because it provides longer fibers of more uniform diameter.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">The examiner observed that Novak shows the combination of cellulosic fibers and unit asbestos fibers and took the position that it would be obvious to one skilled in the art to substitute other unit asbestos fibers for those used by Novak. The board affirmed the decision of the examiner stating, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbgR\">Since * * * Novak * * * disclose [s] the use of asbestos fibers in papermaking, it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this art to employ a subsequently discovered or developed improved form of asbestos fibers for the same purpose with the expectation of obtaining improved results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">With reference to a Rule 132 affidavit filed by appellant, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-18\">* * * it appears that the advantages urged are those which would be expected to flow from the substitution of a \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos for any of those previously employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-19\">Appellant acknowledges \u201cthat asbestos has long been used as an additive to cellulosic paper * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, he says that attempts to use \u201cprior art asbestos\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the better grades of paper, such as white writing paper, have presented a number of problems such as lumping, coarseness, black specks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>gray coloration. The lumping and coarseness, appellant says, are caused by \u201cflakes and bundles of unrefined or unopened asbestos fibers\u201d which \u201cnot only give the paper an unsightly appearance, but * * * [give] it a rough uneven surface which causes uneven dye and ink receptivity.\u201d This lumping and coarseness is said to prevent the use of prior art asbestos even in brown wrapping paper. With respect to the problems of black specks and gray coloration, resulting from the use of \u201cprior art asbestos,\u201d appellant\u2019s specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-4\">Prior art asbestos has not been used successfully in the manufacture of white paper, for several reasons, among them being its low (below 70%) reflectance level. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS_-\">* * * It is to a great extent the presence of magnetite particles that renders prior art asbestos grey rather than white, which is the color of highly purified asbestos. Magnetite occurs in most chrysotile asbestos deposits as a hard black crystalline material. Its presence is highly detrimental in a paper furnish, since it causes black specks to appear in the paper, lowers its reflectance, and due to its abrasiveness causes excessive wear on paper-making screens and printing plates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxC\">Appellant has discovered that all these problems can be avoided by utilizing an asbestos having a higher reflectance, lower magnetite content, higher specific surface area, and lower pulpability than the \u201cprior art\u201d asbestos; the magnitude of the differences between \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos and \u201c[two] types of the closest <em>commercially available </em>* * * chrysotile asbestos\u201d (emphasis added) is shown in Table I, infra, from appellant\u2019s specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Table I</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">COMPARATIVE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ASBESTOS FIBERS</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Type of Asbestos Per Cent Reflectance Per Cent Magnetite Specific Surface Area, m2/gm. Pulpability % +65 mesh</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Canadian Chrysotile 55-70 3.5-4.8 19-31 10-20</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">Conventional Coalinga Chrysotile 60-64 1.0-3.0 55-59 10-67</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">High Purity Coalinga Chrysotile 72-78 0.04-0.5 60-80 0.25-1.0</p>\n<p id=\"b958-35\">The higher purity (higher reflectance and lower magnetite content<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) of \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos eliminates the problems of grayness and black specks; the small<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>er particle size (higher specific surface area) eliminates coarseness; and the low incidence of unopened fiber bundles (low pulpability) eliminates lumping. Also, examples in appellant\u2019s specification demonstrate that, compared to the use of <em>no asbestos </em>in the manufacture of paper, \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos improves retention of cellulosic fibers, fillers, and latex as water is eliminated from the paper furnish composition; the asbestos is said to \u201cact like a filter\u201d which catches the other ingredients and is also said to <em>attract </em>inorganic fillers such as titanium dioxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Appellant acknowledges that patent-ability of all of the appealed claims rests only on one ground, the use of \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos. The issue of non-obviousness may therefore be reduced to the following: would one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time appellant\u2019s invention was made, have considered it obvious to use an asbestos having the characteristics of \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos in the manufacture of cellulosic paper with the expectation of obtaining improved results which appellant has shown to be possible. In view of the specific teachings of Novak referred to below, we are convinced that he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Regarding the desirability of using an asbestos which has a high surface area and is free of unopened fiber bundles, Novak says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">Surface area determinations have indicated that the area of a given weight of my unit asbestos fibers is at least five times that of milled asbestos fiber. Since the increase in the number of fibers is at least five times the increase in surface area as a bundle of fibers is opened to its unit fibers, there must be at least 25 times as many fibers in a given weight of my fibers as in milled fiber. This is responsible for the much greater smoothness, softness, and uniformity of asbestos papers made from these opened fibers. This also accounts for the much greater efficiency of these fibers in separating cellulose fibers from each other when used with cellulose fibers in cellulose paper making.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-12\">The softness and inertness of asbestos fiber has been desired as a modifier of the relatively harsher cellulose fibers, but combinations have been unsatisfactory because of the <em>same coarseness and ununiform fiber character </em>that exists in commercial asbestos paper. Bits of <em>unopened asbestos fiber </em>that might be tolerated in the latter, <em>would be fatal to the expected uniformity of cellulose papers. </em>* * * my opened fiber in slurry <em>form is </em>as smooth and uniform as a well-made cellulose paper making slurry, and can therefore be used therewith in any desired proportion to provide its characteristic properties to the composite of fibers. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdC_\">Regarding \u201ccleanliness and fineness,\u201d Novak also teaches that \u201cundesirable oversize or foreign particle material content\u201d should be removed from the unit asbestos fibers by \u201cscreening, straining, centrifuging, etc.,\u201d the colloidal suspension. Novak further discloses that unit asbestos fibers aid in the retention of \u201cpowdered materials such as pigments, fillers, resins or other modifying agents\u201d because of entanglement of the latter in the former, and further discloses that titanium dioxide particles are strongly <em>attracted </em>to unit asbestos fibers when the two materials are in a dispersion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">Comparing the differences between appellant\u2019s \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos and the \u201cprior art\u201d asbestos (other than Novak\u2019s, note 2 supra) we thus find the desirability of each difference taught in Novak, namely, low foreign material particle content (high reflectance and low magnetite content), high surface area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>and relative absence of unopened fiber bundles (low pulpability). We also find teachings that unit asbestos fibers aid in the retention of other paper making ingredients by way of entanglement and even find a teaching that unit asbestos fibers attract titanium dioxide particles.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Appellant maintains that Novak does not render obvious the use of \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos because suspensions of unit asbestos fibers produced by the Novak process contain a surface active agent and because the final product of the Novak process is in a minimal clotted state. These arguments, however, are not well taken since both of the differences referred to relate only to the Novak process and product and do not in any way detract from the teachings of the importance of using, in cellulose paper making, an asbestos in the unit fiber state, free of unopened fiber bundles, and free of foreign particles. In short, we think that one skilled in the art having used a \u201cprior art\u201d asbestos in the manufacture of, for example, white writing paper and having obtained a coarse, lumpy, black-speck-containing, gray product, would be led by the Novak teachings to use a cleaner, finer asbestos free of oversize particles and black-speek-causing materials. To us it appears that appellant has at best found that an asbestos of optimum cleanliness, fineness, and uniformity will give the expected results. We appreciate that production of such an asbestos on a commercial scale might be very difficult indeed; but that fact does not render non-obvious the use of that asbestos in paper making.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Appellant\u2019s Rule 132 affidavit <em>at first glance </em>appears to show that use of appellant\u2019s \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos in the manufacture of paper gives results superior to those obtained using asbestos prepared according to the Novak process;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> upon closer scrutiny, however, we find a number of serious defects which render this affidavit totally unpersuasive. The most serious of these defects, and the only one we need discuss, is that the asbestos compared with appellant\u2019s \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos was prepared in a manner <em>contrary </em>to Novak\u2019s teachings. Whereas Novak makes it abundantly clear that the amount of surface active agent used in his process should be just sufficient to result in the formation of an <em>unstable </em>colloidal dispersion of asbestos fibers which will revert to a \u201cminimal clotted\u201d state, appellant\u2019s affidavit expressly refers to the use of an amount of surface active agent sufficient \u201cto obtain a <em>stable </em>dispersion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, although Novak teaches that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-10\">Bits of unopened asbestos fiber that might be tolerated in * * * [asbestos paper], would be fatal to the expected uniformity of cellulose papers * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-13\">During the evanescent colloidal periods it was possible to clean the fibers by screening, straining, centrifuging, etc., <em>to remove undesirable oversize or foreign particle material </em>content, and then allow the slurry to break [revert to the \u201cminimal clotted\u201d state] on further standing or mixing * * * [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">appellant omitted this cleaning step. It is therefore no wonder to us that the paper produced from the Novak asbestos <em>(as prepared by appellant) </em>was coarse and ununiform and contained dark specks and asbestos fiber agglomerates.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AEI\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b961-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>WORLEY, C.

The following definition appears in appellant\u2019s application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-11\">The term \u201cpaper\u201d is used throughout the specification and claims of this disclosure in its generic sense to include any non-woven, felted fibrous sheet, including but not restricted to bond, wrapping, tissue, printing, -wall and backing paper, as well as cardboard, wallboard, millboard, and the like.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-21\">. This expression, as used by appellant and as used herein, refers to \u201ccommercially available\u201d asbestos such as that compared with appellant\u2019s \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos in Table I, infra, and does not include asbestos obtained by the Novak process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-36\">. It is pertinent to point out that appellant does not assert that the art failed to recognize these causes of lumping, coarseness, black specks, and grayness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b958-37\">. Appellant\u2019s brief states :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-38\">Perhaps the Board was misled by the term \u201chigh purity\u201d asbestos and assumed from this convenient lable [sic] that appellant\u2019s asbestos product was simply more pure than \u201cprior art\u201d asbestos. Reference to the specific, critical and unique characteristics or limitations will show that only one of the four limitations is related to purity, namely <em>magnatite </em>[sic] <em>content. </em>The other three limitations, surface area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>reflectance, and pulpability have no direct relationship to purity. [Einphasis quoted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Appellant's specification, however, belies these assertions, viz. :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-14\">The significantly greater <em>purity </em>of the asbestos essential in this invention is demonstrated by its improved reflectance <em>and </em>magnetite content. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b960-6\">. Appellant has not contended that one skilled in the art -would have difficulty producing such an asbestos at least on a laboratory scale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">. Superior results, of course, are not necessarily unexpected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b960-8\">. Novak discloses that, if a suspension of \u201cminimal clotted\u201d asbestos fibers is diluted with water, there results a \u201csmooth slurry- of small, fluffy clots of fiber,\u201d whereas, if a colloidal dispersion of asbestos fibers is diluted with water, the fibers form \u201cstrings or clots of jellylike character.\u201d Such dilution occurs when the suspension or dispersion of asbestos fibers is added to aqueous suspensions of other paper-making ingredients.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
