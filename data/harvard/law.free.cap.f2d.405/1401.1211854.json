Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sustaining an opposition by Laughner\u2019s Drive-In, Inc. to Steer Inn Systems, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>Inc.\u2019s application<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to register the service mark STEER INN for \u201cRestaurant Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">The record shows that opposer has been incorporated under the laws of Indiana since December 21, 1958, and that, under the name LAUGHNER\u2019S STEER-IN, it operates a drive-in restaurant in Indianapolis, Indiana, specializing in hamburgers, cheeseburgers, steaks, and the like. The designation STEER-IN was first used on the construction site of LAUGHNER\u2019S STEER-IN drive-in restaurant in February, 1959. The restaurant was opened for business on June 29, 1960, under the name LAUGHNER\u2019S STEER-IN and has continued to operate under that name. Opposer has used the mark STEERBURGER on one of its products since June 29, 1960, and TWIN STEER on another since July 6, 1960.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Opposer\u2019s restaurant has been advertised in newspapers and on radio and television.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">The applicant owns and operates sixteen STEER INN drive-in restaurants in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. There is testimony that it decided, in January, 1960, to engage in the drive-in restaurant business under the name STEER INN. The designation STEER INN was displayed on applicant\u2019s business office from January, 1960, to September, 1960, when the applicant was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">We agree with appellee\u2019s synopsis of the board\u2019s findings that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-7\">(a) \u201cOpposer\u2019s record supports its use of the designation \u2018STEER-IN\u2019 in connection with the rendering of drive-in restaurant services in Indianapolis, Indiana since as early as June 29, 1960. While applicant was incorporated in September 1960, the record is silent as to when applicant first rendered its drive-in services under the mark \u2018Steer Inn.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-11\">(b) \u201cIn either event, we find on the record that opposer is the prior user * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-12\">(c) \u201c \u2018Steer-In\u2019 and \u2018Steer Inn\u2019 are substantially identical designations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-13\">(d) \u201cOpposer has used the name \u2018Laughner's\u2019 in association with the designation \u2018Steer-In\u2019 on its menus, signs,-and-the like; but it is also apparent from the record as indicated above, that \u2018Steer-In\u2019 has on occasion been used separate' and apart from \u2018Laughner\u2019s\u2019 to identify opposer\u2019s restaurant and the food served therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOJu\">The record is clear that the op-poser first engaged in the drive-in restaurant business as early as June 29, 1960, under the name STEER-IN and that the applicant first engaged in <em>that </em>business some time after opposer. Also, the opposer has testimony to the effect that it first displayed a sign showing the mark STEER-IN on its construction site in February, 1959. The applicant has claimed first use of the mark STEER INN from January to September, 1960; but <em>that </em>use was on a business office door sign, letterheads, architectural drawings, etc., all prior to applicant\u2019s opening its first drive-in restaurant under the mark. Under these facts, we think that the opposer was the prior user for purposes of service mark registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">The opposer urges that confusion as to source is likely because of the similarity in sound and appearance of the marks STEER-IN and STEER INN and because both marks are used in connection with drive-in restaurant services. The applicant argues that there is no likelihoold of confusion because the design of its restaurants is distinct and distinguishable from opposer\u2019s and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>business operations are basically different as to menu, price, service, and accommodations. Applicant also argues that opposer\u2019s restaurant is promoted as <em>LAUGHNER\u2019S </em>STEER-IN, rather than STEER-IN per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">However, all that opposer needs to establish is <em>likelihood </em>of confusion, to be determined after considering the marks and the services of the respective parties. Fred W. Amend Co. v. American Character Doll Co., 223 F.2d 277, 42 CCPA 983, 187 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">Both parties are operating drive-in restaurants wherein hamburgers, cheeseburgers, beverages, and the like are featured. The use of the same or similar marks in connection with these services could well lead persons to mistakenly assume that there is some connection between the two operations. \u201cSTEER-IN\u201d and \u201cSTEER INN\u201d are substantially identical designations. Op-poser has used the name \u201cLAUGHNER\u2019S\u201d in association with the designation \u201cSTEER-IN\u201d on its menus, signs, and the like; but it is also apparent from the record, as indicated above, that \u201cSTEER-IN\u201d has on occasion been used separate and apart from \u201cLAUGHNER\u2019S\u201d to identify opposer\u2019s restaurant and the food served therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">The board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1463-9\">KIRKPATRICK, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1461-30\">. Reported at 151 USPQ 650.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">. Serial No. 133,422, filed December 5, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">. From the record, it appears that opposer\u2019s only use has been in <em>intrastate </em>commerce, not <em>interstate. </em>Opposer is the present owner of the following Indiana registrations : No. 5005-525 for STEER-IN, August 25, 1960; No. 5006-042 for TWIN STEER, February 26, 1963; No. 5005-526 for STEERBURGER, August 25, 1960; and No. 5005-524 for a composite mark consisting of a steer holding a plaque and the words LAUGHNER\u2019S STEER-IN, August 25, 1960. No arguments concerning the intrastate-interstate dichotomy have been presented here; thus, we will not discuss the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
