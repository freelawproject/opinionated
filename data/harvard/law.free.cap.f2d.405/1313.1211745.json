One part, e. g., the ball, is cast by injection molding using a higher melting thermoplastic resin, while a second part, e. g., the socket, is cast at least partially about the first using a lower melting thermoplastic resin. The difference in melting point of the resins employed prevents fusion of the two cast parts, thus allowing relative movement between them. Claim 1 is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-20\">1. A product of the character defined comprising two thermoplastic elements arranged one upon the other, said elements being relatively and freely movable, one element comprising a molded thermoplastic of one melting point, the other element being arranged upon the first element, and said other element comprising a molded thermoplastic of a melting point lower than the melting point of said first element.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-21\">Claims 1, 2, 7 and 8 were rejected under \u00a7 103 in view of Mainardi<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alone, with Arenson<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Morin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> being relied on in conjunction with Mainardi for certain details of claim 6. As noted by the examiner and board, the main difference between Mainardi and appellant is that Mainardi, in intercasting a threaded container cap with a thermoplastic container body and container head utilizing the cap as a mold, expressly employs a cap which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-22\">* * * may be made of metal or of <em>a plastic material preferably a thermosetting resin, </em>and, <em>in any case </em>the <em>melting temperature of said resin </em>must be <em>higher </em>than the <em>melting temperature of the plastic material constituting the body of the container. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-23\">Said the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-24\">* * * We are of the opinion that the words \u201cmetal or of a plastic material preferably a thermosetting resin\u201d would include or make obvious the use of thermoplastic material for the cap * * * to one with ordinary skill in the art. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>We can say little more than that we agree with the board. There being, in general, but two classes of plastic resins \u2014thermosetting and thermoplastic \u2014 the use of thermoplastic resins possessing the requisite melting point for the cap of Mainardi would be no less obvious to one of ordinary skill than the use of thermosetting resins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">We have examined the other allegations of error asserted by appellant, but find no merit in them. The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1375-7\">KIRKPATRICK, J., took no part in the decision of this ease.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1374-12\">.
