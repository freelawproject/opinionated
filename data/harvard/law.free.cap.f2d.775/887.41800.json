These are \u201cemployers\u2019 contributions\u201d and are not taxable income for the employee until the plan pays benefits to the employee. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(a), 4Q3, 501(a). The employer alternatively may give the employees higher stated salaries but dedicate some of the salaries to the pension plan. These deductions are \u201cemployees\u2019 contributions\u201d and are taxable income to the employee, but corresponding amounts of pension disbursements will not be taxed. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-23\">The distinction between \u201cemployers\u2019 contributions\u201d and \u201cemployees\u2019 contributions\u201d to qualified pension plans is almost wholly nominal. It is a matter of indifference to an employer whether it pays $30,000 salary to the employee plus $3,000 to a pension plan on the employee\u2019s behalf, or instead $33,000 to the employee, of which it sends $3,000 to a pension plan. In either event the employee receives $30,000 at once and $3,000 in deferred compensation, and the employer may deduct the whole $33,000 as an ordinary and necessary business expense. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 404. But the tax consequences of the distinction are substantial. The tax on employers\u2019 contributions is deferred until retirement, and the discounted present value of the deferred tax is less than the value of tax paid today.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-24\">The distinction between employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 contributions is one example of the dominance of form over substance in the tax code. Perhaps aware that there was no substance\u2014but substantial conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>quences for the revenue \u2014 in this distinction, Congress allowed governmental bodies (but not private employers) to select still a third label. A section added in 1974, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 414(h)(2), provides that if a state or local government\u2019s contributions \u201care designated as employee contributions but [the] employing unit picks up the contributions, the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">This statute might be read to require a state to \u201cpick up\u201d the contributions by assuming them, topping up the total compensation so that the employee then receives his full stated salary without a deduction for pensions. There is some support for such a view in the conference report, which describes a \u201cpick up\u201d plan as one \u201cwhere the contribution is paid by the government, with no withholding from the employee\u2019s salary ...\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. 93-1280, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 279 (1974), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, pp. 4639, 5038, 5060. But a requirement that there be \u201cno withholding\u201d from the salary would be the same thing as. traditional \u201cemployers\u2019 contributions.\u201d The Internal Revenue Service therefore has treated \u00a7 414(h)(2) as an extension of the nominalism from which it grew. See Rev.Rul. 81-35, 1981-1 Cum. Bull. 255; Rev.Rul. 81-36, 1981-1 Cum. Bull. 256; Rev.Rul. 77-462, 1977-2 Cum. Bull. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Under the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation \u00a7 414(h)(2) permits a government to treat contributions as \u201cemployees\u2019 contributions\u201d for its own purposes but \u201cemployers\u2019 contributions\u201d for purposes of federal income taxation. The government establishes two \u201csalaries.\u201d One, for state purposes, is the base from which contributions are withheld; the other, for federal purposes, is a lower salary from which nothing is withheld; the difference between the salary for state purposes and the salary for federal purposes is the \u201cpicked up\u201d contribution. In order to use this option, a government announces that the employees\u2019 contributions have been \u201cpicked up\u201d and reduces their salaries \u2014 or more accurately the amounts shown as wages on their W-2 forms. So long as the employer forecloses the employees\u2019 \u201coption of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the pension plan\u201d (Rev.Rul. 81-35, 1981 Cum.Bull. 255), it meets the requirements of \u00a7 414(h)(2).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">In 1980 Illinois enacted a statute providing that after January 1, 1981, each governmental unit \u201cmay pick up the employee contributions required\u201d by the state\u2019s pension laws. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 108\u00bd \u00a7 18-133.1. The Commissioner then issued a private letter ruling that contributions \u201cpicked up\u201d by the state after December 31, 1981, and paid to the retirement system would not be includable in the employees\u2019 gross income. See CCH <em>Private Letter Rulings, </em>Ltr. 8209038 (Dec. 4, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Snyder Howell, a circuit judge in Williamson County, Illinois, is covered by the Judges\u2019 Retirement System of Illinois. Some of each circuit judge\u2019s salary is withheld and turned over to the system; the exact amount withheld depends on whether the judge is contributing to a fund for spouses\u2019 benefits. Judge Howell\u2019s contribution was 11% of his salary. For purposes of state law, the contributions are employees\u2019 contributions. (The parties have not told us why, but the salaries of Illinois judges are protected against diminution during their terms in office, and the adoption of employees\u2019 contributions may have been a method of establishing a pension plan without a nominal reduction in the judges\u2019 salary or an increase in the net payments made by the state.) Beginning in 1982, the Comptroller of Illinois issued Howell and other judges W-2 forms show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ing a lower taxable salary; the Comptroller reduced Howell\u2019s stated salary by the 11% contribution made to the Retirement System. The state did not make any other change in Howell\u2019s compensation. Only the taxable wage reported to the IRS changed. As a result, the state withheld less tax from Howell\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Judge Howell then filed amended tax returns for 1978-80. He claimed a refund for taxes paid on the sums that had been withheld from his pay and turned over to the Retirement System. These sums, he maintained, had been \u201cpicked up\u201d by the state fully as much as the sums turned over to the Retirement System starting in 1982. There was no substantive difference and therefore, he maintained, there should be no tax difference. The IRS denied the request, and Howell filed this suit. The suit is financed by the Illinois Judges Association, whose members have an interest in common with Judge Howell.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The district court concluded that the pension contributions before 1982 were \u201cemployees\u2019 contributions\u201d within the meaning of federal law. State law designated them this way, and under federal law the employer\u2019s designation controls. The proviso allowing employers to \u201cpick up\u201d employees\u2019 contributions gives them a way to reverse the effect of their own designation, but they must avail themselves of the privilege. Illinois did not do so until 1982, so Howell lost. We agree with both the result and the reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The starting point for income taxation is that all sums paid to, or on behalf of, an employee are taxable income. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61. If Illinois were to send money directly to Judge Howell\u2019s cousin on his behalf, the money would be Howell\u2019s income even though he never saw it; if the state put gold coins in a safe deposit box for safekeeping until his retirement, this also would be Howell\u2019s income. That the employee never gets the use of the money, or that the use is deferred, does not override the general principle that the full compensation for services rendered \u2014 no matter to whom paid, or when \u2014 is income immediately taxable to the person who earned the money. See <em>United States v. Basye, </em>410 U.S. 441, 93 S.Ct. 1080, 35 L.Ed.2d 412 (1973) (payments to a pension plan are taxable when they vest even though not for the account of a particular person); <em>Lucas v. Earl, </em>281 U.S. 111, 50 S.Ct. 214, 74 L.Ed. 731 (1930) (anticipatory assignments of income do hot reduce taxable income). Money paid to a retirement plan is money earned; that the employee has no control of the amount or the purpose to which it is devoted is an irrelevant detail. E.g., <em>Hogan v. United States, </em>513 F.2d 170 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 836, 96 S.Ct. 62, 46 L.Ed.2d 55 (1975) (amounts involuntarily paid to the federal civil service retirement plan are taxable income); <em>Zwiener v. CIR, </em>743 F.2d 273 (5th Cir.1984) (same for a state plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">It would not have mattered in <em>Lucas v. Earl, </em>which held that the employee must pay tax on 100% of his salary even though he had irrevocably assigned 50% of it to someone else, if the employer had \u201creduced\u201d the salary by 50% and \u201ccontributed\u201d an identical amount to the other party. The matching contribution would still be compensation for services rendered, and therefore income. So, too, is any contribution to a pension plan. It therefore does not matter whether a contribution on an employee\u2019s behalf is designated as an \u201cemployer\u2019s contribution\u201d \u2014 not unless Congress causes it to matter. Congress did. By allowing an employer to designate a contribution as an \u201cemployer\u2019s contribution\u201d and defer taxation of that income until retirement, Congress both created an opportunity and left its exercise to the employer. As an economic matter, employers\u2019 contributions and employees\u2019 contributions are identical; they differ in name only. Under the tax law the name matters, and the employer picks the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">Section 414(h)(2) gives governmental employers a second name to use, in order to achieve the same result. Its function is evidently to avoid hurdles of state law that might prevent governments from designating pension contributions as \u201cemployers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>contributions\u201d and so deferring employees\u2019 tax. By \u201cpicking up\u201d contributions, governments may both preserve their internal characterization of the contributions and achieve the tax benefits that private employers regularly do when they make \u201cemployers\u2019 contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The employee is stuck with the employer\u2019s designation, no matter what it is. Until 1981 Illinois by statute called the contributions to the Judges\u2019 Retirement System employees\u2019 contributions. This remitted Judge Howell to the presumptive rule that the whole salary is taxable. We could not accept his argument that the state \u201cpicked up\u201d his contributions even before 1982 \u2014 because he never saw the money either before or after the new law and never has had any choice about its destination \u2014 without either reversing one of the most venerable principle of taxation (that he who earns the money pays the full tax) or disregarding the rule that permits the employer to designate a contribution as made by it or by the employee. Illinois made one choice for years before 1982, and now (using the right to \u201cpick up\u201d contributions) it has made another. Judge Howell is bound by both.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">This exalts form over substance, no doubt. In tax, however, form and substance often coincide. The election between employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 contributions is nothing but form, and the new designation option in \u00a7 414(h)(2) simply continues the practice. A court must apply an empty distinction with the same fidelity as it applies any other. Congress may choose, if it wishes, to allow employers to control the tax consequences of pension contributions, and the selection of one device is neither better nor worse than another. \u201cWhen we are dealing with statutory terms of art, the form-substance dichotomy is a false one. \u2018Substance\u2019 can only be derived from forms created by the statute itself. Here substance <em>is </em>form and little else; there is no natural law of reverse triangular mergers.\u201d Joseph Isenbergh, <em>Musings on Form and Substance in Taxation, </em>49 U.Chi.L.Rev. 859, 879 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The designation has consequences. Taxes deferred are taxes reduced. Similarly the change in wages reported on the W-2 form affects the amount of income from which exclusions may be made, and it reduces the adjusted gross income from which deductions may be made. One tax effect breeds another. None of this matters. The outcome of this case follows from the employer\u2019s power to elect designations with tax effects for the employee. Before 1982 the designation in Illinois was that the contributions were made by the employee, and that is that.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-6\"> Whether the state must pass a statute, as opposed to using some other process of reducing wages and \u201cpicking up\" contributions that is adequate for the purpose under state law, we need not decide. We also do not decide whether the Commissioner\u2019s definition of a \"pick up\" is the only one he could have chosen. The IRS has discretion to interpret ambiguous terms, and the interpretation the Commissioner has placed on \u00a7 414(h)(2) is highly favorable to taxpayers. Perhaps he could have been more stingy; we need not say.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
