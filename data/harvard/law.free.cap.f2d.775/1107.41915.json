We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Familiarity with the district court\u2019s opinion being assumed, only those factors necessary to an understanding of this court\u2019s decision will be discussed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">The district court\u2019s opinion contains an excellent explication of the technology involved, reflecting a clear recognition of the undisputed fact that the filter and camera embodiment <em>described in the specification </em>of SRI\u2019s United States Patent No. 3,378,633 (the \u2019633 patent) issued to SRI as assignee of the inventor Dr. Albert Macovski on April 16, 1968, <em>operate </em>somewhat differently from the MEI filter and camera accused of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">\n<em>The Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">Each claim charged to have been infringed is drawn to a structure. Because of its central role as the broadest, claim 1 is set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-10\">1. A spatial filter for affording a monochrome recording from which upon subsequent scanning, information for reproducing an image in color of the object photographed may be derived, said filter comprising a first grid of parallel spaced lines having the color of a subtractive primary, a second grid relatively angu-larly superimposed over all of the said first grid, said second grid having parallel spaced lines having the color of another subtractive primary, each grid having the same line density.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">Claim 2 depends from claim 1, adding only \u201cthe relative angle between the first and second grids is 45\u00b0.\u201d Claim 7 and dependent claim 8 are drawn to a camera in combination with the filter of claim 1. Claim 9 and dependent claim 10 are drawn to \u201capparatus for generating the color representative electrical signals required for a color television receiver to reproduce a scene in color,\u201d and include the filter of claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-13\">Claim 3 was not charged to have been infringed. It is set forth because it affects the question of claim interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-14\">3. In a camera of the type wherein light from a scene being photographed is focused by a lens on black and white, monochromatic sensitive film, the improvement for affording a recording of the color information in the scene being photographed on said film in a manner so that said color information may be electronically derived therefrom comprising a filter adjacent said film, said filter having a first grid of <em>vertical </em>spaced lines which are colored cyan, and superimposed over all of said first grid a second grid having its lines at a 45\u00b0 angle to the lines of the first grid, said second grid lines being yellow in color, both said grids having the same line density. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-15\">\n<em>Operation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-16\">The district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion included helpful illustrations, that of SRI\u2019s filter being based on Figure 1 of the \u2019633 patent drawings. Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the invention set forth in claim 1, in which one grid is superimposed over all of the other grid, the equi-width stripes of one are vertical and those of the other are angled to the vertical. In the operation of that embodiment, the horizontal distance travelled by the scanning beam in a single pass (\u201cscan line\u201d) across and between angularly disposed stripes is greater than that across and between vertical stripes. Thus, the frequency range generated by interruptions in a single pass across the angular grid is lower than that across the vertical grid, and two basically discrete (red and blue) carrier frequency ranges are generated at that point. The frequencies are then decoded by low and band pass filters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>In the MEI filter, one grid is superimposed over all of the other grid and both grids have equi-width stripes, but the stripes of the two grids are at equal and opposite angles to the vertical. In operation, the horizontal distance travelled by the scanning beam in a single pass across and between stripes of both grids is the same, and the red and blue carrier frequency ranges thereby generated are the same at that point. However, the phase difference between successive, timed scanning passes produces a concentration of red and blue components at alternating, overlapping, or interleaved frequencies. To delay successive passes and decode the interleaved frequencies, MEI employs a 1-Hertz (1-H) delay comb line filter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">\n<em>District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxJt\">\n<em>(a) Preliminaries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">On July 19, 1982, SRI filed a complaint and jury demand, alleging MEI\u2019s willful infringement of claims 1, 2, and 7-10 and seeking treble damages, costs, attorney fees, and an injunction. That same day, the district court scheduled a status conference for October 22, 1982. On September 29, 1982, MEI filed answer, alleging invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement, and a counterclaim for declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">In April, 1983, the parties filed extensive briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">On October 19, 1983, the district court issued a comprehensive Second Order for Pretrial Preparation, setting April 30, 1984 for \u201cTrial before the Jury\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">The October 19, 1983 order required the filing of exhibits, witness lists, summaries of all proposed testimony, statements of experts\u2019 theories with conclusions and bases therefor, experts\u2019 curriculum vitae, and reports prepared for testimony. The order form also contained a requirement applicable \u201cIn non-jury cases\u201d, i.e., the filing of a written narrative statement of the proposed direct testimony of each witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">The October 19, 1983 order also required the filing of objections to testimony or exhibits, with the ground for each objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to another order of the same date, the parties were required to prepare statements of fact which each party contends should be submitted to a jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-13\">In response, on January 20,1984, counsel for SRI wrote the court, listing among the issues for the jury the question of whether MEI\u2019s filter is \u201cso far changed in principle\u201d that SRI\u2019s and MEI\u2019s filters are different inventions (MEI\u2019s position) or different versions of the same invention (SRI\u2019s position), quoting <em>Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co., </em>170 U.S. 537, 568, 18 S.Ct. 707, 722, 42 L.Ed. 1136 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-14\">On February 2, 1984, counsel for MEI wrote the court, saying that: no issue required jury determination; the issue is whether the claims can cover MEI\u2019s filter; that issue is one of claim language scope and a matter of law; and whether MEI\u2019s camera functions in a basically different manner is a legal question, citing <em>Kalman v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>713 F.2d 760, 218 USPQ 781 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-15\">\n<em>(b) February 10, 198k Pretrial Conference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-16\">A February 10, 1984 pretrial conference to narrow the issues began with a late attempt by MEI\u2019s counsel to bar the inventor (Dr. Macovski) as an expert witness because of his financial interest in the outcome of the litigation. MEI\u2019s counsel said they had originally considered objecting on the ground that \u201c[t]he subject matters [sic] as to which Dr. Macovski is going to testify is so far outside of anyone\u2019s real world experience that it\u2019s almost impossible to evaluate without appropriate technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>background and credentials,\u201d and was therefore not appropriate \u201cto go to a jury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That objection was not made. The court overruled the objection with respect to financial interest on the ground that SRI would be prejudiced if denied its witness on the eve of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">The court then turned to the purpose of the conference, i.e., determining \u201cwhether there are any issues here involving conflicts of facts.\u201d Having read the papers then on file, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-5\">It seems to me, under the particular recent decisions under the Federal Circuit, it\u2019s a pure question of deriving ultimate facts from undisputed evidence which is properly done by the judge. Mr. Gregg, I have read your papers carefully, but I don\u2019t see any factual issues that would be proper for a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">SRI\u2019s counsel then said: \u201cThat if there are no evidentiary facts in dispute, this is a case that is ripe for summary judgment. And I would suggest under those circumstances and with your Honor\u2019s consent, that the defendants bring a motion for summary judgment.\u201d When the judge asked whether SRI wished also to bring a summary judgment motion, SRI\u2019s counsel said it did not because counsel believed there were factual disputes present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">Asked to identify the disputes, SRI\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-8\">The dispute with respect to infringement largely evolves around this: There is no question but what the words of the claim, as we say, \u201cread on,\u201d cover, define, not only the structure in the 633 patent, which is in suit here, but the structure which the defendants used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-9\">And in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Graver vs. Linde, </em>you look to the words of the claim, and do you determine whether or not they cover what the accused device is; and if it does, infringement is made out, and that is the end of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">But there is another side of the coin, and the other side of the coin is this: That if the invention, if whatever the defendant has, if his device is so utterly different in principle from the device which is described in the patent, then regardless of the wording of the claims, the claims have not validly covered it. And that is the issue with respect to infringement, the principle [sic] issue as to whether or not the system which is used by the defendants in this case is so different in principle that it\u2019s an altogether different invention. One is an apple; the other is an orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">And that seems to me to be mainly a fact of determination, and so on down the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">To that statement the court responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-14\">Well, I don\u2019t think so____ [I]f the issue in this case is whether a thing which is colored orange, has [a] peel about an eighth-inch thick, ... and once it\u2019s peeled, it\u2019s sectioned, those facts are undisputed. The question is whether the ultimate fact may be derived from that evidence that it is an orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-16\">That doesn\u2019t strike me as a jury issue. That strikes me as an issue that is appropriate for a judge to decide, particularly if oranges are rather obscure kind [sic] of things in the common experience of a jury. There is no dispute it has certain kinds of seeds inside. There is no conflict, in other words, in the evidence. There is only a conflict in the interpretation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-17\">It strikes me that is appropriate for a judge to decide. Whether it should be decided on summary judgment or not is another question. I wouldn\u2019t keep anybody from making a motion for summary judgment, but it would be useful in this case for the court to hear the testimony of the experts because I think the court needs some enlightenment on some rather technical questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>After some discussion of evidence of obviousness, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-4\">I just don\u2019t see any dispute here, and it seems to me that these are all legal issues, that is, they are issues of ultimate fact concerning the application of principles such as obviousness, anticipation, infringement, to undisputed facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-5\">Of course, Mr. Gregg, the two sides will present different evidence, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is any conflict in the evidence. And in the absence of an evi-dentiary conflict, I don\u2019t see a jury issue in a patent case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">MEI\u2019s counsel at that point said he would move for summary judgment \u201cif it were done in a manner which I think would be permitted by the rules, where on the motion the court could hold an evidentiary hearing which would permit the court to hear the experts at least, and in a live situation develop an education as to the subject matter.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">The court then described its procedure in bench trials, under which, to preclude surprise and facilitate preparation for trial, written narrative statements of testimony are exchanged, and the record after trial would become those narrative statements plus testimony adduced at trial. The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-8\">And that way the record will be a combination of the narrative statement of testimony, plus the testimony adduced here. Now, that is not summary judgment, but it is a bench trial, and it anticipates the testimony and provides everybody with a complete statement of testimony and exhibits in advance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-9\">Now, that will be my way of proceeding in this case. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for summary judgment just because I would want the live witnesses. But I do think we can resolve these questions fairly and intelligently in a reasonable fashion in this way, and also I think more economically and expeditiously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-14\">Usually when trials are conducted in this fashion, they don\u2019t take as long as people anticipate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-15\">The February 10, 1984 conference ended with the setting of March 30 for submission of pretrial briefs and April 30 for a bench trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-16\">On February 23, 1984, the court issued a Third Order for Pretrial Preparation and Trial in which it denied SRI\u2019s request for jury trial and ordered the bench trial discussed in the foregoing quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-17\">It appearing that there are no disputed issues of fact requiring determination by a jury; it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVqx\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the liability phase of this case shall be tried to the Court in accordance with the following schedule ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-18\">The order then repeated the bench-trial requirement for filing narrative statements of testimony, exhibits, and objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-19\">\n<em>(c) April IS, 1984 Pretrial Conference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-20\">On April 13, 1984, at what proved to be the last pretrial conference and last courtroom event, the court conducted an extended dialogue with SRI\u2019s counsel, beginning with the court\u2019s demand that counsel state the \u201cessence\u201d of the \u2019633 patent and \u201cthe novel element on the basis of which that patent was issued.\u201d The court asked SRI\u2019s counsel whether the assertions in MEI\u2019s brief (claims are limited to filters so operat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>ed that the angle difference of the stripes creates different frequencies) stated \u201cthe essence of the patent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">Counsel for SRI began correctly by stating the structural limitations of the claims. When the court said the \u201cessence\u201d was \u201cthe difference in the angles of the two sets of stripes creates different frequencies for the transmission of red and blue color,\u201d counsel said \u201cstripes at an angle to one another and creating different frequencies\u201d was old and that the \u201cnovel feature\u201d was the equal width and spacing of the stripes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Pressed by the court on whether \u201cthe basis on which the patent was issued\u201d was \u201ctwo sets of stripes being at an angle to one another\u201d and \u201cfor the purpose of generating different frequencies,\u201d SRI\u2019s counsel finally, and inexplicably, said, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s correct.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">The court then said MEI\u2019s filter does not generate frequency differences. When SRI\u2019s counsel said it did, the court demanded an explanation. Pleading that inventor Macovski could explain it better, counsel said MEI\u2019s 1-H delay resulted in frequency differences without which no camera would work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Pointing to a statement in a brief filed a year earlier (April 29, 1983) by SRI\u2019s counsel (that MEI\u2019s was a \u201cphase\u201d system), the court deemed counsel\u2019s statement in the April 13, 1984 conference (that MEI\u2019s system generated two frequencies, albeit in a different way) an improper and possibly punishable change of position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">Counsel said he had learned more during the year, and that his expert witnesses and a paper by MEI\u2019s employee, Nakabe, would at trial show the correctness of his present statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-13\">When the court pointed out that \u201ctenth grade geometry\u201d shows no difference in spacing across and between MEI\u2019s stripes, SRI\u2019s counsel agreed, saying that, \u201c[tjhere is no frequency difference on a given scan line,\u201d but that \u201cMEI\u2019s 1-H delay produced frequency differences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-14\">When the court asked whether the real issue was whether the \u2019633 patent \u201cprotects a system\u201d which generates color differences by a time delay in rate of scanning between different lines, counsel answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then asked whether the patent or file wrapper said anywhere that \u201can essence or novel idea in this patent to be protected is the generation of frequency differences through time delays.\u201d Counsel for SRI sought to answer by citing references in the specification to frequency overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">Invited to comment, MEI\u2019s counsel simply agreed, in three sentences, with what the court had been saying, i.e., that use of \u201cphase\u201d and \u201cfrequency\u201d was mere \u201csemantics\u201d and that nothing in the \u2019633 patent suggests MEI\u2019s \u201ctechnique\u201d, at which point the court said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t grant summary judgment in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-16\">Referring repeatedly to the statement about \u201cphase\u201d in the year-old brief of SRI\u2019s counsel, the court rejected counsel\u2019s promise of what Dr. Macovski would show at trial and counsel\u2019s assertions that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>skilled in the art would immediately on reading the \u2019633 patent recognize the availability of what counsel called the minor changes made by MEI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The court then asked MEI\u2019s counsel whether he desired a trial or summary judgment. MEI\u2019s counsel responded by offering to have his narrative witness statements sworn. The court said there was no need for any statements, because MEI\u2019s exhibits and the year-old statement of SRI\u2019s counsel removed all controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Recognizing that it had surprised SRI, the court set a schedule for briefing on summary judgment. SRI accompanied its brief with an affidavit of Dr. Macovski. MEI filed no affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">On August 1, 1984, after considering counsels\u2019 voluminous submissions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the district court entered summary judgment in favor of MEI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment of non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"ax--dedup-0\">\n<em>(1) Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">The Federal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure and of Evidence are and should be applied in patent cases no differently from their application in any other type of case. Hence summary judgment under Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P., is entirely appropriate, in a patent as in any other case, where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Molinaro v. Fannon/Courier Corp., </em>745 F.2d 651, 653-54, 223 USPQ 706, 707 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Chore-Time Equipment, Inc. v. Cumberland Corp., </em>713 F.2d 774, 778, 218 USPQ 673, 675 (Fed.Cir.1983). The movant bears the burden of demonstrating absence of all genuine issues of material fact, <em>Cooper v. Ford Motor Co., </em>748 F.2d 677, 679, 223 USPQ 1286, 1287-88 (Fed.Cir.1984), the district court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor, <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962), <em>Martin v. Barber, </em>755 F.2d 1564, 1566, 225 USPQ 233, 234 (Fed.Cir.1985), and must resolve all doubt over factual issues in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, <em>Palumbo v. Don-Joy Co., </em>762 F.2d 969, 973, 226 USPQ 5, 7 (Fed.Cir.1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-14\">The party opposing the motion must point to an evidentiary conflict created on the record; mere denials or conclusory statements are insufficient. <em>Barmag Barmer Maschinenfabrik AG v. Murata Machinery, Ltd., </em>731 F.2d 831, 836, 221 USPQ 561, 564 (Fed.Cir.1984). Because, however, infringement is itself a fact issue, a district court must approach a motion for summary judgment of infringement or non-infringement with a care proportioned to the likelihood of its being inappropriate. <em>D.M.I., Inc. v. Deere &amp; Co., </em>755 F.2d 1570, 1573, 225 USPQ 236, 238 (Fed.Cir.1985); <em>Palumbo v. Don-Joy Co., </em>762 F.2d 974, 226 USPQ at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-15\">Though speedy and inexpensive, summary judgment is nonetheless a \u201clethal weapon\u201d capable of \u201coverkill\u201d. <em>Brunswick v. Vineburg, </em>370 F.2d 605, 612 (5th Cir.1967). <em>See generally </em>Louis, <em>Federal Summary Judgment Doctrine: A Critical Analysis, </em>83 Yale L.Rev. 745 (1974). It denies the non-movant its \u201cday\u201d, i.e. a trial, in court. Moreover, experience has shown that a trial often establishes facts and inferences not gleanable from papers submitted pre-trial. Further, a reversal of summary judgment on appeal is not dispositive, but merely remits the case for trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>If reversal be error, that error will manifest itself at close of the non-movant\u2019s case, when the district court may direct a verdict or enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">In the present case, the admirable and extensive pretrial preparation system designed and vigorously managed by the district court, moved from preparation for a jury trial, through determination of whether the jury demand should be granted, to preparation for a bench trial, to the court\u2019s examination of unsworn counsel, to the court\u2019s study of exhibits and unsworn narrative statements, and finally to a grant of summary judgment. Counsel did not supply the clear, candid, and uncompromising explication of the law required to protect the pretrial preparation system in this instance from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">As was stated in <em>Cable Electric Products, Inc. v. Genmark, Inc., </em>770 F.2d 1015 (Fed.Cir.1985), \u201cthe circumstances appropriate to summary judgment are those in which a district court is able to conclude that, with regard to any factual issues material to granting judgment as a matter of law, no genuine dispute exists.\u201d Here there was no dispute on the structure of MEI\u2019s filter and camera, and no dispute on the manner in which that structure is operated, but there was a dispute, as discussed <em>infra, </em>on whether that manner of operation meant that MEI\u2019s structure was so far changed in principle that it performed the same or similar function as the claimed invention in a substantially different way. As discussed, <em>infra, </em>that disputed question raises a genuine issue of material fact and the answer to that question controls the issue of infringement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-13\">Focusing exclusively on the way the structure of the Figure 1 embodiment in the specification operates, the district court allowed that focus to control its claim interpretation and its grant of summary judgment. In so doing, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-14\">\n<em>(2) The Claims Read on MEI\u2019s Structure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-15\">The claims are structural, not method, claims. MEI did not in its brief before us concede that the claims as written read directly on its filter and camera.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because MEI\u2019s argument is based entirely on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>\u201ctechnique\u201d, i.e., on how its structure and that disclosed in Figure 1 of SRI\u2019s specification (or SRI\u2019s commercial embodiment) are <em>operated, </em>a concession that its structure falls literally within the words of the structural claims in suit would have saved time and cost for all concerned by focusing on the sole <em>actual </em>infringement issue present, which, as discussed below, centers on the so-called \u201creverse doctrine of-equivalents\u201d, i.e. no infringement in law, in spite of literal correspondence with the claim language, because the product or process alleged as an infringement is not actually the invention patented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">The factual issue is whether MEI\u2019s filter and camera infringe properly interpreted claims. <em>Fromson v. Advance Offset Plate, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 1565, 1569, 219 USPQ 1137, 1140 (Fed.Cir.1983). Nothing in the present record would justify a determination that <em>literal </em>correspondence with claim 1, for example, is avoided by a composite filter structure formed of grids with equi-width stripes superimposed in their entire-ties at equal and opposite angles to the vertical to derive information for reproducing an image in color, i.e., the MEI filter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">The language of the claims themselves is clear, definite, and unambiguous. It reads directly, unequivocally, and word-for-word on MEI\u2019s structure. As above indicated and as the district court correctly noted, there is <em>no factual dispute </em>concerning the structure of MEI\u2019s filter. It is undisputed that MEI\u2019s filter employs \u201crelatively angularly superimposed\u201d grids. The asserted claims, as the district court appeared to sense, are therefore literally met. If literal correspondence with the language of the claims were the sole consideration, SRI would on the present record be entitled to summary judgment, because there is <em>no issue </em>of genuine material fact that could affect that consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Determination of actual infringement is not in every case, however, limited to literalism. An accused infringer, as here, may argue that the claim language, as properly interpreted, does not actually read on his device. <em>See Leesona v. United States, </em>530 F.2d 896, 906, 208 Ct.Cl. 871, 887-88, 185 USPQ 156, 163 <em>(aff'd </em>192 USPQ 672) (1976) (\u201cmore than a literal response to the terms of the claims must be shown to make out a case of infringement\u201d). Where, as here, a defendant says the claim language, as interpreted in light of the specification, prosecution history, and prior art, does not actually read on his device, claim interpretation is required. If the presently asserted claims must be interpreted as limited to a structure that is operated in the precise manner in which Figure 1 of the specification is operated, a structure not operated in that manner would not be an actual infringement. As appears below, however, nothing of record requires that the asserted claims be so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">\n<em>(3) Claim Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">Claim interpretation or construction is a legal matter subject to review free of the clearly erroneous standard applicable to fact findings. <em>Raytheon Co. v. Roper Corp., </em>724 F.2d 951, 956, 220 USPQ 592, 596 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Fromson, supra, </em>720 F.2d at 1569, 219 USPQ at 1140. In construing claims, the prosecution history is a useful tool, <em>McGill Inc. v. John Zink Co., </em>736 F.2d 666, 673, 221 USPQ 944, 949 (Fed.Cir.1984), as is the patent specification, <em>Fromson, </em>720 F.2d at 1569, 219 USPQ at 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">A claim is construed in the light of the claim language, the other claims, the prior art, the prosecution history, and the specification, <em>not </em>in light of the accused device. Contrary to what MEI\u2019s counsel wrote the district court, claims are not construed \u201cto cover\u201d or \u201cnot to cover\u201d the accused device. That procedure would make infringement a matter of judicial whim. It is only <em>after </em>the claims have been <em>construed without reference to the accused device </em>that the claims, as so construed, are applied to the accused device to determine infringement. <em>See Palumbo v. Don-Joy Co., </em>762 F.2d at 974, 226 USPQ at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number><em>(i) Prosecution </em>History<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AnV\">Responding to the examiner\u2019s initial rejection of certain claims in view of Kell, U.S. Patent No. 2,733,291, SRI entered extended Remarks in which it distinguished Kell on a number of different bases. Among those Remarks were these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-4\">Claim 1, as amended, distinguishes over Kell in calling for a spatial filter which is comprised of a first grid of parallel spaced lines having the color of a <em>subtractive primary, </em>and a second grid <em>which is relatively angularly superimposed over all of said first grid, </em>said second grid having parallel spaced lines which are the color of another <em>subtractive </em>primary____ Claim 1 further distinguishes over Kell in calling for each grid to have the same line density. Every teaching in Kell, both in the specification and in the drawings, ... is that the line density is different for each grid. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-6\">The reason why Kell makes his line density different for each grid is that that is the way that he generates his two different modulating frequencies. This applicant insures two different modulating frequencies by virtue of placing one grid at an angle to another grid. As a result, the scanning beam, which traverses the line grids in successive parallel lines, is interrupted at two different frequencies by the two angularly disposed lines of the two grids.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">At the April 13, 1984 conference, the court intensively examined SRI\u2019s counsel, focusing on and reading aloud the second of the two paragraphs above quoted. Continuing, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">Do you accept that statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">MR. GREGG: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-10\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s the essence of the \u2019633 patent, is it not?</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">MR. GREGG: That\u2019s part of the essence, bearing in mind what the statute ... 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, has to say, ... that you must look at the invention as a whole. And in connection with claim one, it is the filter; in connection with claim seven, for example, it is the entire camera, with the filter in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">The district court in its Memorandum Opinion quoted the middle sentence of the paragraph it read aloud: \u201c[T]his applicant insures two different modulating frequencies by virtue of placing one grid at an angle to another grid,\u201d and held that the claims must therefore be interpreted as limited to composite filters with angled stripes that themselves generate \u201ctwo different modulating frequencies\u201d when scanned in one pass. 591 F.Supp. at 470, 224 USPQ at 75. Because it found that MEI\u2019s angled stripes themselves generate the same modulating frequency in one pass, the court thought there could be no infringement of the structural claims in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-15\">Unlike the patentees in <em>Prodyne Enterprises, Inc. v. Julie Pomerantz, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 1581, 223 USPQ 477 (Fed.Cir.1984) and <em>Builders Concrete Inc. v. Bremerton Concrete Prods. Co., </em>757 F.2d 255, 225 USPQ 240 (Fed.Cir.1985), SRI did not amend a claim to avoid a prior art reference by insertion of a structural limitation. SRI did not rely on incorporation by reference, as did the patentee in <em>Envirotech Corp. v. Al George, Inc., </em>730 F.2d 753, 760, 221 USPQ 473, 477 (Fed.Cir.1984). Nor, as did the patentee in <em>SSIH Equipment S.A. v. U.S. Intern. Trade Com\u2019n, </em>718 F.2d 365, 376, 218 USPQ 678, 687 (Fed.Cir.1983), did SRI amend a claim to escape prior art by inserting language which could be understood only by reference to the prosecution history. SRI not only did not amend to escape prior art, it did not insert \u201crelatively angularly superimposed\u201d to do so, and at no time did it insert language into either the claims or the specification that would limit the \u201cinformation\u201d (set forth in claim as produced by its crossed grids) to that consisting of two rather than one frequency-</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>Nor did SRI insert in any claim any limitation to a particular manner of operation of its claimed structure. Nor in its Remarks did it distinguish Kell on the basis of Kell generating only one frequency in his single scan pass. On the contrary, SRI expressly recognized in the above-quoted Remarks that Kell generated two (\u201cthat is the way he generates his two different modulating frequencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">Nowhere in the prosecution history is there any discussion of a composite filter that generates one modulating frequency. As the first above-quoted paragraph indicates, SRI recognized that Kell angularly superimposed parts of striped grids and that Kell got two frequencies in a single pass, but pointed out that Kell did so with <em>partially </em>superimposed grids of <em>different </em>line density. SRI could not have properly relied for patentability over Kell on <em>admittedly old </em>features.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">The claims being structural, the quoted Remarks distinguished them over Kell, as those Remarks were required to do, on the basis of <em>structure, </em>i.e., grids angularly superimposed in part (Kell) vs. grids angularly superimposed in their entireties (SRI) and different line densities (stripe widths) (Kell) vs. same line densities (SRI). The claims were necessarily allowed on the basis of those structural differences. SRI\u2019s Remarks cannot be read, therefore, as strictly limiting (actually rewriting) the claims as though they were drawn to a method of operation in which angled stripes themselves generate two frequencies. Cf<em>. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 1351, 1361, 219 USPQ 473, 480 (Fed.Cir.1983). SRI\u2019s explanation that Kell and SRI used different structures to get two frequencies illustrated the <em>claimed structural distinction </em>between partial vs. entire superimposition and different vs. same stripe widths; it did not convert the claims in suit to method claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">In determining that SRI had \u201cargued to the Patent Office a narrow construction of the claims,\u201d and was \u201cprecluded from arguing a broader construction for purposes of infringement,\u201d 591 F.Supp. at 470, 224 USPQ at 75, the district court misconstrued the nature and effect of the prosecution history. Nothing appearing in that history in relation to Kell required a \u201cnarrow construction\u201d limiting the structural claims in suit to a method of operation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It was therefore not necessary for SRI to argue \u201ca broader construction\u201d to prove infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">We review the district court\u2019s construction of the claims in light of the prosecution history as a question of law and we hold it to have been in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">\n<em>(%%) The Specification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-11\">The district court also focused on the specification, saying, 591 F.Supp. at 470, 224 USPQ at 74:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>The specifications of the \u2019633 patent make clear that the claims allegedly infringed envision a filter with grids superimposed at different angles from the vertical to generate frequency variations for the two primary color signals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\">Quoting the specification\u2019s description of a composite filter structure comprised of two grids having lines at \u201crelative angles such that ... an adequate separation is obtained between carrier sidebands derived from said scanning,\u201d the district court said \u201cthe specifications assume one of the two grids to be oriented vertically with the other diagonally imposed on it to form a 45\u00b0 angle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 224 USPQ at 74. The district court correctly described the specification, but the difficulty is this: claims are infringed, not specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">When claim construction is required, claims are construable, as above indicated, in light of the specification, <em>United States v. Adams, </em>383 U.S. 39, 49, 86 S.Ct. 708, 713, 15 L.Ed.2d 572, 148 USPQ 479, 482 (1966), yet \u201c[t]hat claims are interpreted in light of the specification does not mean that everything expressed in the specification must be read into all the claims.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. v. Roper Corp., </em>724 F.2d at 957, 220 USPQ at 597. If everything in the specification were required to be read into the claims, or if structural claims were to be limited to devices operated precisely as a specification-described embodiment is operated, there would be no need for claims. Nor could an applicant, regardless of the prior art, claim more broadly than that embodiment. Nor would a basis remain for the statutory necessity that an applicant conclude his specification with \u201cclaims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. It is the <em>claims </em>that measure the invention. <em>Aro Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., Inc., </em>365 U.S. 336, 339, 81 S.Ct. 599, 600-01, 5 L.Ed.2d 592, 128 USPQ 354, 356-57 (1961); <em>Bandag, Inc. v. Al Bolser\u2019s Tire Stores, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 903, 922, 223 USPQ 982, 996 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Jones v. Hardy, </em>727 F.2d 1524, 1528, 220 USPQ 1021, 1022 (Fed.Cir.1984).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here the claims, which must be read as a whole, set forth structures distinguished from the pri- or art and were allowed on the basis of structural differences (e.g., claim l\u2019s limitation to superimposition of entire grids, each having equi-width stripes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">Infringement, literal or by equivalence, is determined by comparing an accused product not with a preferred embodiment described in the specification, or with a commercialized embodiment of the patentee, but with the properly and previously construed claims in suit. <em>See ACS Hospital Systems, Inc. v. Montefiore Hospital, </em>732 F.2d 1572, 1578, 221 USPQ 929, 933 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Teledyne McCormick Selph v. United States, </em>558 F.2d 1000, 1007, 195 USPQ 261, 267 (Ct.Cl.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">The law does not require the impossible. Hence, it does not require that an applicant describe in his specification every conceivable and possible future embodiment of his invention. The law recognizes that patent specifications are written for those <em>skilled in the art, </em>and requires only that the inventor describe the \u201cbest mode\u201d known at the time to him of making and using the invention. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>As the Supreme Court said in <em>Smith v. Snow, </em>294 U.S. 1, 11, 55 S.Ct. 279, 283, 79 L.Ed. 721, 24 USPQ 26, 30 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">We may take it that, as the statute requires, the specifications just detailed show a way of using the inventor\u2019s method and that he conceived that particular way described was the best one. But he is not confined to that particular mode of use since the claims of the patent, not its specifications, measure the invention. <em>Paper Bag Patent Case, </em>210 U.S. 405, 419 [28 S.Ct. 748, 751, 52 L.Ed. 1122]; <em>McCarty v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., </em>160 U.S. 110, 116 [16 S.Ct. 240, 242-43, 40 L.Ed. 358]; <em>Winans v. Denmead, </em>15 How. 330, 343 [56 U.S. 330, 14 L.Ed. 717]. While the claims of a patent may incorporate the specifications or drawings by reference, see <em>Snow v. Lakeshore R. Co., </em>121 U.S. 617, 630 [7 S.Ct. 1343, 1351, 30 L.Ed. 1004] and thus limit the patent to the form described in the specification, it is not necessary to embrace in the claims or describe in the specifications all possible forms in which the claimed principle may be reduced to practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">As one of our predecessor courts stated in <em>Autogiro Co. of America v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 391, 398, 181 Ct.Cl. 55, 64, 155 USPQ 697, 703 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-6\">The specification \u201cset[s] forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. This one embodiment of the invention does not restrict the claims. Claim interpretation must not make use of \u201cbest mode\u201d terms inasmuch as the patentee need not guard against infringemment by listing every possible infringing device in the specification. <em>Adams v. United States, </em>330 F.2d 622, 165, Ct.Cl. 576 (1964), <em>aff'd </em>383 U.S. 39 [citations omitted] (1966) ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">The specification language on which the district court focused was excerpted from that describing and explaining the operation of the structure shown in Figure 1, the embodiment employing a set of vertical grid stripes and a second set of grid stripes disposed at a relative angle to the vertical of 45\u00b0. The specification, however, expressly states that Figure 1 \u201cby way of example\u201d shows a version of the claimed invention in which a filter has vertical stripes and stripes angled at 45\u00b0 to the vertical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">The language of no asserted claim requires that any stripes be vertical. Claim 2 is expressly more narrow than claim 1 in that it specifies \u201c45\u00b0 \u201d as the <em>relative </em>angle between the stripes of the two grids.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Non-asserted claim 3, <em>supra, </em>however, does contain a limitation requiring that one set of grid stripes be \u201cvertical\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-11\">The district court thus read, via the specification, the \u201c45\u00b0\u201d limitation of narrower claim 2, and the \u201cvertical\u201d limitation of narrower claim 3, into broader claim 1 and the other asserted claims. It is settled law that when a patent claim does not contain a certain limitation and another claim does, that limitation cannot be read into the former claim in determining either validity or infringement. <em>Fromson, supra, </em>720 F.2d at 1570, 219 USPQ at 1141; <em>Environmental Designs, Ltd. v. Union Oil Co. of California, </em>713 F.2d 693, 699, 218 USPQ 865, 871 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Palumbo v. Don-Joy Co., </em>762 F.2d at 977, 226 USPQ at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-12\">The reason for the rule is well illustrated here. Non-asserted claim 3 is specifically drawn to the structure of Figure 1. To interpret the asserted claims as though they were <em>also </em>drawn to that structure (or to its manner of operation) would be to render the asserted claims superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-13\">In interpreting the asserted claims in light of the specification, the district court read limitations into them from other claims. That was error as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-14\">\n<em>(4) The Reverse Doctrine of Equivalents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">As counsel for SRI told the court, the \u201cprincipal issue\u201d of fact was whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>MEI\u2019s filter is \u201cso different in principle that it\u2019s an altogether different invention,\u201d an apparent attempt to paraphrase the judicially stated reverse doctrine of equivalents.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As a basis for its grant of summary judgment, the district court found non-infringement under that doctrine. Because in this case there is a genuine issue of material fact respecting whether MEI\u2019s filter and camera structure is so far changed in principle that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way, a trial of that issue is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\">Availability of the reverse doctrine of equivalents was set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., Inc., </em>339 U.S. 605, 608-09, 70 S.Ct. 854, 856-57, 94 L.Ed. 1097, 85 USPQ 328, 330 (1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1209-5\">The wholesome realism of [the doctrine of equivalents] is not always applied'in favor of a patentee but is sometimes used against him. Thus, where a device is so far changed in principle from a patented article that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way, but nevertheless falls within the literal words of the claim, the doctrine of equivalents may be used [in reverse] to restrict the claim and defeat the patentee\u2019s action for infringement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">As made clear in <em>Graver Tank, </em>in which the Court upheld a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as \u201csupported by the record\u201d and \u201cnot clearly erroneous\u201d, the ultimate finding of infringement, or \u201cactual infringement,\u201d may depend on facts and circumstances unique to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-9\">Infringement is defined in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) as the unlicensed making, using, or selling of a patentee\u2019s claimed invention. Recognizing frailties of language and limitations on human foresight, the law acknowledges that one may appropriate another\u2019s patented contribution not only with a product precisely described in a patent claim (literal infringement) but also with a product that is not quite so described but is in <em>fact </em>\u201csubstantially the same thing, used in <em>substantially </em>the <em>same </em>way, to achieve substantially the same result\u201d (doctrine of equivalents). The law also acknowledges that one may only appear to have appropriated the patented contribution, when a product precisely described in a patent claim is in <em>fact </em>\u201cso <em>far </em>changed in principle\u201d that it performs in a <em>\u201csubstantially different </em>way\u201d and is not therefore an appropriation (reverse doctrine of equivalents). One who takes a claimed structure and merely uses it in a way that differs from that in which a specification-described embodiment uses it, does not thereby escape infringment. <em>Smith v. Snow, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-10\">The patentee bears the burden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Envirotech Corp. v. Al George, Inc., </em>732 F.2d 1572, 221 USPQ 929 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>SSIH Equipment S.A. v. United States International Trade Commission, </em>718 F.2d 365, 218 USPQ 678 (Fed.Cir.1983). Initially that burden is carried when literal infringement has been proved.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See Graver Tank, </em>339 U.S. at 607, 70 S.Ct. at 855-56, 85 USPQ at 330. When a patentee establishes literal in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>fringement, the accused infringer may undertake the burden of going forward to establish the fact of non-infringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents. If the accused infringer makes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the patentee, who retains the burden of persuasion on infringement, must rebut that <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">The doctrine of equivalents raises a fact question determinable upon inquiry into whether a product is substantially the same thing used substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result. <em>Graver Tank, </em>339 U.S. at 609, 70 S.Ct. at 856-57, 85 USPQ at 330 (\u201cA finding of equivalence is a determination of fact.\u201d). <em>See also Autogiro Co. v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 391, 181 Ct.Cl. 55, 155 USPQ 697 (1967). As above indicated, the reverse doctrine of equivalents also raises a fact question, determinable on inquiry into whether a product has been so far changed in principle that it performs the same or similar function in a substantially different way. Though the second inquiry differs (literal infringement being present) it is nonetheless directed to a fact issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">The district court here addressed the <em>factual </em>inquiries listed in <em>Autogiro, </em>but said it was doing so \u201cas a matter of law\u201d because, as it construed the claims in suit, the \u201cgist of the ... patent is the creation of two carrier frequencies to encode color information.\u201d But a court\u2019s election to ignore the structural claims, and to substitute a \u201cgist\u201d drawn from the operation of a disclosed embodiment, cannot convert the fact question raised by the reverse doctrine of equivalents into a legal question of claim construction. That fact question is simple and direct: Is the accused product so far changed in principle that it performs the function of the claimed invention in a substantially different way?</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">There is no question, as the district court found and as SRI from the outset admitted, that MEI\u2019s filter and camera are so operated as to perform their functions in a way that differs from the way in which the structure of SRI\u2019s Figure 1 performs those functions. SRI and MEI had the right, however, to adduce documentary and testimonial evidence at trial in an effort to convince the fact finder that the MEI filter is or is not \u201cso <em>far </em>changed in principle\u201d that it performs \u201cin a <em>substantially </em>different way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">The test mandated in <em>Graver Tank </em>leaves room for the fact finder\u2019s application to varying circumstances. Words like \u201cso far\u201d, \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201csubstantially\u201d are not subject to rigid pre-definition; nor will the \u201cprinciple\u201d of a structural invention be always and immediately apparent. It is precisely the role of a trial to apply the test in light of all the live testimony and physical evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-9\">At trial, SRI and MEI can cross-examine each other\u2019s witnesses on their narrative statements, and may sustain all or some of their objections filed pursuant to the October 19, 1983 order. (Those objections asserted conflict with witnesses\u2019 other statements and writings.) The SRI and MEI filters and cameras may be demonstrated. The principle of the claimed invention, and that of MEI\u2019s product, and the degree of change, if any, in the latter, may be determined in light of all the evidence, as may the question of whether the latter performs in a substantially different way. In sum, the key infringement question, i.e., whether a principle has been so <em>far </em>changed that the way is <em>substantially </em>different, depends on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-10\">The Supreme Court supplied guidance useful here in <em>Graver Tank, </em>339 U.S. at 609, 70 S.Ct. at 856-57, 85 USPQ at 330 (e.g., equivalence is not the prisoner of a formula, nor an absolute to be considered in a vacuum; it does not require identity in every purpose and respect; it is determined against the context of the patent, the prior art, and particular circumstances of the case; one factor is whether the accused product resulted from independent research; an important factor is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was). A major factual dispute in this case, for example, is whether the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>ties employ substantially different ways of encoding color (MEI\u2019s position) or readily interchangeable ways long known to those skilled in the art for whom patents are written (SRI\u2019s position). <em>See Thomas &amp; Betts Corp. v. Litton Systems, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 1572, 1580, 220 USPQ 1, 6 (Fed.Cir.1983) (known interchangeability of elements is evidence of equivalence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">\n<em>(5) Reason for In Banc Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AvO\">MEI relies on one phrase in a single case,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Kalman v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>713 F.2d 760, 218 USPQ 781 (Fed.Cir.1983), for the proposition that non-infringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents is a legal question. In <em>Kalman, </em>this court determined that the district court\u2019s <em>fact finding </em>of identity of invention (reached after a four day bench trial) was not clearly erroneous, and that \u201cthe stipulation by the parties, coupled with [Kimberly Clark\u2019s] failure to counter Kalman\u2019s affidavits and evidence submitted in his motion for summary judgment\u201d dictated a finding of infringement. On that undisputed record, this court affirmed the judgment based on that finding. In response to an argument of appellant, the question of the reverse doctrine of equivalents\u2014in a case involving that particular record of stipulation and unchallenged affidavits\u2014was termed \u201ca legal question\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 771, 218 USPQ at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">Because the statement respecting the reverse doctrine of equivalents, i.e., that it raises a legal question, may be considered a holding to that effect, the court has <em>sua sponte </em>taken this case under consideration <em>in banc. See South Corp. v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1368, 1370 n. 2, 215 USPQ 657, 658 n. 2 (Fed.Cir.1982). To the extent that the statement constituted a holding in <em>Kalman, </em>it must be and is hereby overruled.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">It is settled that the question of infringement (literal or by equivalents) is factual. <em>Graver Tank, supra. </em>It would be anomalous to hold that the question of noninfringement (literal or by the reverse doctrine of equivalents) is not factual. Equivalence and non-equivalence, as the terms indicate, are but opposite sides of the same coin. In determining each, a court must say whether an accused device operates in substantially the same way (equivalence) or in a substantially different way (non-equivalence). The doctrine of equivalents may be employed, as was said in Graver, to expand or <em>restrict </em>a claim.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Graver Tank, supra, </em>and one of our predecessor courts in <em>Decca Limited v. United States, </em>420 F.2d 1010, 1014, 190 Ct.Cl. 454, 459-463, 164 USPQ 348, 351, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 865, 91 S.Ct. 102, 27 L.Ed.2d 104 (1970), said \u201cthe <em>doctrine of equivalents </em>may be used to restrict the claim,\u201d (emphasis added), and this court in <em>Kalman, </em>713 F.2d at 771, in rejecting appellant\u2019s argument on the reverse doctrine of equivalents, employed the classic statement of equivalence, saying: \u201cthe Berlyn devices do the same work, in substantially the same way, to accomplish substantially the same result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-11\">The question of non-infringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents, as above indicated, raises in this case a genuine issue of material fact which renders the issued summary judgment inappropriate. <em>See Martin v. Barber, </em>755 F.2d 1564, 225 USPQ 233 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>\n<em>(6) Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">The genuine and material fact question of whether MEI\u2019s filter and camera are \u201cso far changed in principle\u201d that they \u201cperform the same or a similar function in a substantially different way\u201d being present and disputed, the district court erred in granting summary judgment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">REVERSED.</p>\n<author id=\"b1212-6\">MARKEY, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">with whom PAULINE NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, joins, additional views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-7\">The court, sitting <em>in banc, </em>has declined to decide whether the denial of the jury demand was improper in this case, considering that step unnecessary and adhering to the rule that courts should not, unless compelled, decide constitutional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-8\">Because of this court\u2019s mandate to contribute to uniform guidance in the national law of patents (as well as in that governing federal personnel, government contracts, international trade, and claims against the government), and because of what is seen as the mistaken belief by some members of the bar and some district courts, including the district court in this case, that this court has created or is creating a dichotomy between the rules governing the right to jury trials in patent suits for damages and the rules governing the right to jury trials in other suits for damages, these additional views are offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-9\">The district court here abandoned the initial pretrial preparation for jury trial, converting it into preparation for a bench trial. In denying the presence of a \u201cfactual issue that would be proper for a jury\u201d the district court, as above quoted, responded to the metaphorical reference by SRI\u2019s counsel to MEI\u2019s position that operation of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 and MEI\u2019s \u201ctechnique\u201d were as different as apples and oranges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-12\">That doesn\u2019t strike me as a jury issue. That strikes me as an issue that is appropriate for a judge to decide, <em>particularly </em>if oranges are rather obscure things <em>in the common experience of a jury. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1212-13\">The district court, in deciding at that point to conduct a bench trial in place of the demanded jury trial, referred to unidentified \u201cdecisions\u201d of this court (which hears appeals of district court judgments in patent cases) as indicating a dichotomy between factual issues appropriate for a jury and factual issues appropriate for a judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8p\">It seems to me, under the particular recent decisions under [sic] the Federal Circuit, it\u2019s a pure question of deriving ultimate facts from undisputed evidence, which is properly done by the judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-14\">Mr. Gregg, I have read your papers carefully, but I don\u2019t see any <em>factual issues that would be proper for a jury. </em>[Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1212-15\">At another point, the court appeared to specifically distinguish demands for jury trials in patent cases from those in other types of cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-16\">Of course, Mr. Gregg, the two sides will present different evidence, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is any conflict in the evidence.

To begin, the same governing Rules apply. First, if genuine material fact issues are absent, jury trial may be denied and summary judgment granted as a matter of law. Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P. Second, a court may remove a case from the jury on motion for a directed verdict, the facts presented at that point being undisputed by the movant and failing in law to support any possible verdict for the non-mover.

They discourage unnecessary pleadings and encourage stipulation of undisputed matters. They precharge the jury and explain legal and technical terms to be used. They shield the jury from irrelevant, non-probative evidence and from unnecessarily lengthy or complicated \u201cfoundation\u201d laying. They encourage use of charts, graphs, and other visual devices to focus and clarify the evidence. Following summations, trial judges greatly facilitate the jury\u2019s function when they give clear-cut, comprehensible jury instructions in plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>and simple English. <em>See generally </em>Schwarzer, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">And if further reassurance be demanded, it can be found in the availability of the appellate process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">.

One must do so to resolve any ambiguity in claim language. Use may be made by either party of materials extraneous to the words of a claim, to give them a \"special meaning\u201d which will support an assertion of actual infringement/non-infringement under the doctrines of equivalents/reverse equivalents. That use does not change the answer to the question of whether the claim language <em>as written </em>\"reads on\u201d the accused device, which is synonymous with what has long been called <em>\u201cliteral </em>infringement\u201d. As the text makes clear, determination that the claim words read literally on the accused device is but an \"initial hurdle\". <em>See Autogiro Co. of America v.

We do not say, of course, that when an applicant distinguishes prior art and obtains allowance of a structural claim on the basis of the manner in which the claimed structure operates, he may not thereby have so limited his claim. When that happens, the examiner will normally require insertion of limitations to the argued operation. Nor do we say here that claim 1 may not be limited by prior art not before us on this appeal. Nor do we say that the claims must be interpreted to cover all products that literally infringe, no matter how <em>far </em>those products may be changed in principle to operate in a <em>substantially </em>different way from the way in which the claimed invention operates. We hold only that the single sentence on which the district court focused did not, in view of the structural distinctions argued and claimed, form the basis for allowance of claim 1. Because it was not relied on for patentability, as was the insertion in <em>Builders Concrete, Inc. v. Bremerton Concrete Products Co., </em>757 F.2d 255, 225 USPQ 240 (Fed.Cir.1985), that sentence did not constitute a prosecution history estoppel. A sentence pointing out how SRI\u2019s different structure can be operated to achieve the same result as Kell did not limit the claim solely to structures operated as the Figure 1 embodiment of the claimed invention is operated. MEI does not, of course, claim to employ Kell's structure or anything similar thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-13\">Further, our present holding is limited to the present record and the grant of summary judgment. It does not foreclose the introduction by the parties at trial of any evidence, including that reflected in the prosecution history, on which the fact question raised by the reverse doctrine of equivalents, <em>infra, </em>may be resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">. The district court said, \"[r]ead alongside the specifications, then, the allegedly infringed claims plainly teach a filter which positions red and blue signals at different carrier frequencies so that they can be decoded by electrical bandpass filters.\u201d 591 F.Supp. at 470, 224 USPQ at 74. Specifications teach. Claims claim. There is nothing in the asserted claims themselves about frequencies or band-pass filters. Claim 1, for example, is drawn to a filter affording a recording from which, upon scanning, \"information\" for reproducing an image may be derived. That a specification describes only one embodiment does not require that each claim be limited to that one embodiment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1207-11\">. Whether SRI was <em>entitled </em>to a claim of the breadth of claim 1, for example, depends on what appears in the prior art as a whole, not on whether one or more embodiments appear in the specification. Entitlement is a question of patentability, and, as above indicated, is not before us. That the claims in suit are supported by the specification's disclosure has not been here challenged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">. If, as SRI contends, MEI\u2019s stripes are each at 221/2\u00b0 to the vertical, (i.e., that MEI merely \"tilted\" the grids of Figure 1) their relative angle would be 45\u00b0. MEI tells us it does not rely on the absence of vertical stripes from its filter as an indication of non-infringement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">. At various points, SRI\u2019s counsel was, however, unhelpful to the district court. Under extended questioning by the court, counsel responded affirmatively to a question of whether the specification of the \u2019633 patent contained material describing MEI\u2019s filter operation, leading the court to state a nonexistent requirement, \u201cI don\u2019t think anywhere in the '633 patent do you find a picture of filters that are identical to the MEI.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">. Surprisingly, neither party cited <em>Graver Tank, supra, </em>on appeal. The case sets the classical considerations governing determination of literal infringement, infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, and noninfringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents. <em>See also Westinghouse v.

As indicated in the text, counsel cited the statement in <em>Kalman </em>to the district court.

A genuine issue of material fact being present, a trial on that issue is required. Presumably, jury trial was here denied on the premise that no such issue was present.

The court was not here dealing with the deci-sional rules governing motions for summary judgment, or for directed verdict, or for JNOV, but with the sole question of whether the \"liability phase\u201d of the case would be <em>tried </em>before a jury or before the judge, as its order, <em>supra, </em>stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">. SRI\u2019s brief on appeal argues that it was wrongly denied its demand for a jury trial on the infringement issue.

The same argument could be applied to many segments of the Constitution. Moreover, it is irrelevant whether a case involving 1985 complexities could be well decided by a 1791 jury. Judges in 1791 were among the very few who were educated. The Seventh Amendment brings the people into our jurisprudential system. In almost 200 years, while society grew more complex, the education and work experience of the people advanced as well. It is clear that juries will necessarily differ in \u201ccompetence,\u201d but it is at best incongruous to suggest that a society that sends its citizens routinely into space could never produce a jury competent to determine a case some judge might consider too \"complex\u201d for people with \"common experience\u201d to decide. <em>See infra, </em>note 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">. The requirement is that trials be fair, not perfect. As discussed in the text, numerous safeguards exist against a clearly \"erroneous result\" following a jury trial. Much of the support for a complexity exception appears bottomed on an assumption that time and cost might be saved if all the trappings of the jury system (jury wheels, scheduling, impanelling, excuses from duty, risk of \u201chung\" juries, interference with juror\u2019s lives in a long trial, etc.) were eliminated in at least some civil cases. <em>See </em>POSNER, THE FEDERAL COURTS; CRISIS AND REFORM 130 n. 1 (1985). That assumption may be contrasted with one of the reasons for re-emergence of demands for jury trials in patent cases, i.e., that a verdict may be obtained in hours, whereas obtaining a court decision after a bench trial of a patent case has often required years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">That juries have been eliminated from most civil litigation in Great Britain is of little if any relevance to the present discussion. The training and recruitment of judges in that country differs substantially from our own, and there is no Seventh Amendment requirement that the right to jury trial be preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">.

(Emphasis as in lead opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Since there is disagreement in this case whether material facts are in dispute, instead of just referring to the district court opinion and merely stating that it contains an \u201cexcellent explication of the technology involved,\u201d I choose to quote the undisputed facts as found by the district court. It is significant that the lead opinion in its opening paragraph recognizes the \u201cundisputed fact that the filter and camera embodiment described in the specification of SRI\u2019s United States Patent No. 3,378,633 (the \u2019633 patent) issued ... April 16, 1968, operate somewhat differently\u201d from the MEI filter and camera accused of infringement. The trial judge chose to find the undisputed material facts to be as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">\u201cFACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">\u201cThe \u2019633 patent describes a method by which single tube color television cameras can perceive and transmit color images. Although the detailed technology of the patented and accused devices is complex, the gist of the \u2019633 patent and its only teaching at issue in this action is the way in which a special light filter employs geometric principles to register the color of an object being televised. To understand how the filter facilitates color transmission, however, it is helpful to briefly note the functioning of the camera itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">\u201c1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">\u201cSingle tube television cameras operate by focusing the image to be televised onto a photosensitive image area in a part of the camera called a pick-up tube. The pick-up tube converts the image into a series of electrical signals by means of a sequence (or \u2018raster\u2019) of horizontal lines across the image area. The amplitude of the electrical signals varies according to the intensity of light at any given point on the image area. These signals are then transmitted to a receiver and used to reproduce, the original image on a television screen. When generated directly from the pick-up tube, the signals can record the intensity of the image but not its color.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">\u201cAn image in color is made up of various light components: a general brightness component called \u2018luminance,\u2019 and components of each of the three primary colors: red, blue, and green. To reproduce an image in color, the pick-up tube of a television camera must subdivide the image area into three primary color areas so that electrical signals corresponding to each of these colors can be generated simultaneously by a single raster scan of the pickup image area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">\u201cBoth systems at issue in this action accomplish color subdivision by placing a composite filter in front of the pick-up tube. The composite filter consists of two super-imposed filters each with a grid of different colored stripes. The stripes of one grid are yellow, a color that passes all light except blue (and is referred to as \u2018subtractive blue\u2019), and the other\u2019s stripes are cyan, a color that passes all light except red (and is referred to as \u2018subtractive red\u2019). As the scanning beam moves across the image over which the composite filter has been placed, the output signal generated includes two signal components representing the red and blue portions of the image. If the yellow stripes are of a different width than the cyan stripes, the beam of light moving at a constant speed will generate output signals of different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>frequency for the light (i.e. colors) passing the yellow stripes than for that passing the cyan stripes. These output signals, which are said to have \u2018encoded\u2019 the color information from the image, are then \u2018decoded\u2019 by a series of electrical filters and ultimately used to reproduce the image on a television screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">\u201c2. <em>Prior Art: The Kell Patent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">\u201cThe way in which striped filters \u2018encode\u2019 color information is further explained by reference to U.S. Patent No. 2,733,291, issued in 1956 to Ray Kell for a color television camera (\u2018the Kell Patent\u2019), which both parties concede to be the most analogous prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">\u201cKell teaches the use of a composite filter consisting of two grids of stripes, one colored cyan and the other yellow as shown in Figure # 1:</p>\n<p

uniform width. As the scanning beam moves across the image area covered by the composite filter, the blue light component of the image is periodically interrupted when the beam passes over each yellow stripe. This periodic interruption generates an electrical signal rerpresenting the blue content of the image at a frequency corresponding to the frequency with which yellow (subtractive blue) appears in front of the image area. At the same time the filter generates a signal representing the red content of the image at a frequency corresponding to the frequency of cyan (subtractive red) stripes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">\u201cUnder the Kell patent, because the cyan and yellow stripes vary in width, the frequency of the red and blue signals differ from each other and from the frequency of the luminance or general brightness component.

width=\"1133\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-14\">where the horizontal axis represents frequency measured in megahertz (MHz) and the vertical axis represents amplitude or intensity of the light. Each color is said to have a \u2018carrier frequency\u2019 at the central hump of its frequency range and \u2018side bands\u2019 on either side of the carrier frequency. As can be seen, the luminance component has the lowest frequency range while the red and blue components have higher frequency ranges depending on the spacing of the subtractive color grids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">\u201cThe output signals thus generated are then \u2018decoded\u2019 by three electrical filters called \u2018low pass\u2019 and \u2018band pass\u2019 filters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>which are able to separate out luminance, red, and blue signals by virtue of the variations in their carrier frequencies: In a process not relevant to this action, the green color component is obtained by subtracting out the blue and red components from the luminance component. The separated signals are then funnelled out through different output channels and are ultimately recombined to reproduce the colored image by means of a second scanning beam projected on the television screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">\u201cThe Kell patent suggests a number of minor variations to this basic scheme, one of which is relevant to this action. Kell recognized that the superimposition of one vertical grid on another creates the possibility of \u2018beats\u2019 or \u2018moire\u2019 interference which takes the form of light and dark bands across the filter. The Kell patent teaches that moire interference can be reduced if the stripes are placed at an angle, rather than parallel, to one another. Figure 4D of the Kell patent shows striped grids so angled, and the specification explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-6\">the orientation of the different negative grids with respect to the scanning direction as shown in Figure 4D decreases any moire effects that might otherwise be produced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">\u201c3. <em>The \u2019633 Patent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s \u2019633 patent teaches basically the same system as Kell except that the two grids have stripes of equal width. The grids are placed at an angle to one another, however, so that as the scanning beam moves horizontally across the filter, the frequency ranges of the red and blue components will still differ.

blue signal component. The frequency diagram for the \u2019633 patent is thus identical to that of the Kell system in Figure # 2, and the signals are decoded by low- and bandpass filters just as in Kell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">\u201c4. <em>The MEI System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">\u201cThe MEI camera also employs a composite filter of angled cyan and yellow striped grids with equally spaced stripes to encode color signals off a single pick-up tube. The grids of the MEI filter, however, are placed at equal and opposite angles to the vertical. As a result, the distance travelled by the scanning beam over the stripes of both grids is the same and no variation in frequency range is created between the blue and red components.

Instead, it employs what is called a 1-H delay line comb filter which separates the red and blue components by means of a complicated series of manipulations as follows. As the scanning beam moves across the first scan line over the filtered image, it creates signals of alternating red and blue zones as shown in Figure # 6:</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>Figura #6</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">These signals are said to be \u2018out of phase\u2019 because the red and blue components alternate rather than overlap. As the beam moves across the next line, however, it creates a signal of zones containing neither color alternating with zones containing both colors. Here the red and blue components are \u2018in phase\u2019 because they overlap rather than alternate. The 1-H delay line comb filter operates to delay the scan line signal just long enough for the filter to align it with the next scan line and then combine the two. Where the red signals in a given pair of aligned zones from two scan lines are in phase once the scan lines have been shifted and combined, and the blue signals are out of phase, the blue signals will cancel out and only the red will remain. Conversely, where the blue signals are in phase and the red out of phase, only the blue signal will remain. Thus the 1-H delay line comb filter uses the phase variation of the red and blue signals in alternating scan lines to separate out or decode the two colors. The luminance and green components are separated out in the same way as in the Kell and \u2019633 patents, and the various signals recombined to reproduce the full color image on a television screen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">The lead opinion does not dispute any of the facts recited in the above trial judge\u2019s findings. In fact, it agrees that they were the facts. As I see it, then, the major weakness of the lead opinion lies in its failure to point, with convincing or useful specificity, to any material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">While recognizing that summary judgment is granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the lead opinion asserts that MEI did not carry the burden required by the rule to establish the absence of a material fact issue in regard to the manner of operation of its device. I am at a loss, however, to determine from the lead opinion, an issue of material fact, supported by the record below, which precludes the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Barmag Barmer Maschinenfabrik AG v. Murata Machinery, Ltd. </em>731 F.2d 831, 836, 221 USPQ 561, 564 (Fed.Cir.1984) (party opposing motion for summary judgment must point to evi-dentiary conflict created on the record; mere conclusory statements are insufficient). Suggestions by the lead opinion that evidence may be developed at trial is mere speculation and inappropriate in ruling on a Rule 56 motion. <em>First National Bank v. Cities Service, </em>391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1592-93, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">Furthermore, where, as here, the evidence on an issue leaves no room for any reasonable difference of opinion as to its resolution, the district court should resolve such issue, as it did in this case, as a matter of law. <em>See Jamesbury Corp. v. Litton Industrial Products, Inc., </em>756 F.2d 1556, 1560, 225 USPQ 253, 257 (Fed.Cir.1985); <em>Williams v. Butler, </em>746 F.2d 431, 440 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Trace X. Chemical v. Canadian Industries, </em>738 F.2d 261, 265 (8th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 911, 83 L.Ed.2d 925; <em>B.D. Click Co., Inc. v.

U.S., </em>436 F.2d 992, 1002, 193 Ct.Cl. 962, 979 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>I agree with the district court that the attempt to characterize the MEI camera as a \u201cfrequency\u201d device rather than a \u201cphase\u201d device, hardly rises to the level of an evi-dentiary conflict as to the nature and operation of the accused product sufficient to preclude a grant of summary judgment. While it is true that frequency and phase are not synonymous terms, the court below is quite right in its conclusion that the application of one label rather than another does not detract from the fundamental distinction between MEI\u2019s use of a single frequency modulated carrier in its operation and SRI\u2019s use of a two frequency modulated carrier in the \u2019633 patent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Since there was no dispute as to the manner in which the accused device operated, the district court correctly concluded that the question of infringement reduced to a construction of the scope of the claims asserted by SRI. This, of course, is a question of law. <em>SSIH Equipment, S.A. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>718 F.2d 365, 218 USPQ 678 (Fed.Cir.1983). The district court particularly considered the history of prosecution of SRI\u2019s \u2019633 patent before the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and properly concluded that SRI, having argued a construction of the claims which emphasized the generation of frequency variation by angle differentiation, was precluded from arguing a construction which involves essentially no frequency variation for the purposes of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">The lead opinion on this point takes the position that the district court misconstrued the nature and effect of the prosecution history and that, in essence, if SRI had relied for patentability over the Kell patent on the basis of the generation of two frequencies in a single pass of the scanning beam across light passing through the composite grid filter, the examiner would necessarily have rejected the claims as based on an admittedly old feature. In support, the lead opinion states that SRI never discussed in its Remarks to the PTO, a composite filter that generated only one modulating frequency and that SRI acknowledged that Kell generated two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">As I view it, during the prosecution of '633 patent, the principal argument made to distinguish the claimed invention from the Kell patent, the closest prior art, was SRI\u2019s contention that the Macovski filter \u201cinsures two different modulating frequencies by virtue of placing one grid at an angle to another grid,\u201d while Kell generated two different modulating frequencies by making \u201chis line density different for each grid.\u201d This point is perhaps best illustrated by quoting, as does the lead opinion, from Remarks filed by SRI in response to the examiner\u2019s initial rejection of certain claims in view of Kell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-9\">Claim 1, as amended, distinguishes over Kell in calling for a spatial filter which is comprised of a first grid of parallel spaced lines having the color of a <em>subtractive primary, </em>and a second grid <em>which is relatively angularly superimposed over all of said first grid, </em>said second grid having parallel spaced lines which are the color of another <em>subtractive </em>primary____ Claim 1 further distinguishes over Kell in calling for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>grid to have the same line density. Every teaching in Kell, both in the specification and in the drawings, ... is that the line density is different for each grid. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-4\">The reason why Kell makes his line density different for each grid is that that is the way that he generates his two different modulating frequencies. This applicant insures two different modulating frequencies by virtue of placing one grid at an angle to another grid. As a result, the scanning beam, which traverses the line grids in successive parallel lines, is interrupted at two different frequencies by the two angularly disposed lines of the two grids.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">The lead opinion is correct in noting that Macovski did not distinguish his own invention from Kell on the basis of Kell generating only one frequency in a single scan pass. There would be no reason to do so, of course, as Kell generated two modulating frequencies in a single scan pass and relied on such frequency variation to produce color information. Kell produced this frequency variation using unequal line densities in two separate grids of a filter. The \u2019633 patent, in contrast, using equal line density grids, relies on a particular angular orientation of these grids to produce frequency variation. To avoid Kell, and yet produce the same color information, Macovski distinguished his invention on the basis of angular orientation of these grids, in contrast to their unequal line density as in Kell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The lead opinion further concludes that SRI\u2019s Remarks to the PTO can only be applied in a structural, not operational context. I cannot agree. Having made narrowing arguments to the PTO to obtain allowance of a patent, SRI may not now seek a broader scope for its patent claims in an attempt to cover the MEI device. Moreover, arguments made to the PTO to define and explain the claimed invention for the purpose of distinguishing it from the prior art limit the proper interpretation of the claim language, whether or not actual amendments to the claim language are</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">made and whether or not the lead opinion chooses to classify such arguments as \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201coperational\u201d in nature. <em>Coleco Industries, Inc. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>573 F.2d 1247, 197 USPQ 472 (CCPA 1978). As stated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in <em>Coleco:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-8\">A response to an examiner\u2019s office action may include an amendment accompanied by remarks or it may include only remarks. Because applicant\u2019s ultimate goal in submitting amendments and offering arguments in support thereof is the securing of a patent, we find no reason not to extend the traditional es-toppel doctrine beyond estoppel by amendment to estoppel by admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ard-dedup-0\">573 F.2d at 1258, 197 USPQ at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">I add further on this point, that the lead opinion, in concluding that SRI could not have properly relied for patentability over Kell on the basis of the generation of two different frequencies in a single scan pass across the composite grid filter is outside its rightful purview. Since the district court did not rule on the validity of the \u2019633 patent, this Court may not attempt to circumscribe any future resolution of that issue. <em>See Structural Rubber Products v. Park Rubber, </em>749 F.2d 707, 223 USPQ 1264 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">In a related holding, the lead opinion concludes that the district court, in interpreting the asserted claims in light of the specification, improperly read limitations into them from other claims and in so doing, erred as a matter of law. I take a different position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">It is axiomatic that claims of a patent must always be interpreted in light of the specification. <em>Autogiro Company of America v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 391, 181 Ct.Cl. 55, 155 USPQ 697 (1967). This is not to say, of course, as the lead opinion correctly notes, that an applicant in his specification must describe every conceivable and possible future embodiment of his invention. <em>Raytheon Co. v. Roper Corp., </em>724 F.2d 951, 957, 220 USPQ 592, 597 (Fed.Cir.1983). But where, as here, the specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>cation does not refer to an angular orientation of the grids of the filter as only a \u201cbest mode\u201d for utilizing the invention, but rather teaches this arrangement as essential to achieve the objects of the invention, I am satisfied, as was the trial judge, that the invention has not been improperly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">In this case, the specification of the \u2019633 patent teaches that the angles and orientation of the two grids of the filter are chosen so as to produce adequate separation between the blue and red frequency components of the modulated carrier. The specification provides no other basis for selecting the angle or orientation of the filter\u2019s grids. SRI\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201crelatively angularly superimposed\u201d, appearing in its asserted claims should be read to mean merely that the grids of the filter must be crossed at any angle, was properly rejected by the lower court which inspected the specification of the \u2019633 patent and concluded in light thereof, that the grids of the filter must be angled to generate frequency variation for red and blue color signals. Nevertheless, the lower court\u2019s correct interpretation of the claims in light of the specification is mischaracter-ized in the lead opinion as an improper exercise whereby the limitations of narrow claims are read into broader claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Finally, I believe that the district court properly held that the MEI device \u201ccannot be found to do the same work in the same way\u201d as the device claimed in the \u2019633 patent. Considered as a whole, the record shows that the MEI device operates in a fundamentally different way from the SRI filter, produces a different electrical signal and requires entirely different signal processing. That the two devices ultimately produce an image should not obscure the fact of how each accomplishes this result since numerous devices which could never reasonably be argued to be equivalents also produce images. Under these circumstances, according to the reverse doctrine of equivalents, the MEI device cannot be found to infringe. <em>Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co., </em>170 U.S. 537, 18 S.Ct. 707, 42 L.Ed. 1136 (1898). <em>Leesona v. U.S., </em>530 F.2d 896, 906, 208 Ct.Cl. 871 (1976) (\u201cmore than a literal response to the terms of the claims must be shown to make out a case of infringement.\u201d) Since the question of infringement in this ease is resolved on an undisputed fact record, the application of the reverse doctrine of equivalents is a matter of law. <em>Kalman v. Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>713 F.2d 760, 218 USPQ 781 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>see also Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, </em>280 U.S. 30, 36, 50 S.Ct. 9, 10-11, 74 L.Ed. 147 (1929) (\u201cupon the undisputed evidence the question of infringement resolves itself ... into one of law, depending upon a comparison between the structure disclosed on the face of the patent and the [accused device] ... and the correct application thereto of the rule of equivalency.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">I dissent lastly from the lead opinion statement of reasons for <em>in banc </em>action. This case was not taken <em>in banc </em>to exclusively consider overruling <em>Kalman. </em>Rather, in addition to the <em>Kalman </em>issue, the <em>in banc </em>action was taken to determine whether summary judgment was improperly granted by the lower court and whether the lower court impermissably denied SRI a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">Based on the foregoing, I would affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">In view of the disposition of the case as suggested herein, notwithstanding the fact that there has been no clear and definitive ruling by the district court denying a request for a jury trial, <em>see Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-47, 50 S.Ct. 466, 482-83, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936), I believe it unnecessary to go into the question of the right to a jury trial in complex cases. The Third Circuit has stated that, in exceptional circumstances, the right to jury trial may be denied due to the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of the suit, <em>see In re Japanese Elec. Prod. Antitrust Litigation, </em>631 F.2d 1069 (3rd Cir.1980), while the Ninth Circuit has rejected such a \u201ccomplexity\u201d exception in <em>In re U.S. Financial Securities Litigation, </em>609 F.2d 411, 432 (9th Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>446 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>1866, 64 L.Ed.2d 281 (1980). The lead opinion in an addendum takes the Ninth Circuit views. It is a complicated question of Constitutional law, mooted in this case by the disposition I suggest.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">. \u201cLiteral correspondence,\u201d as the lead opinion coins the term, is quite different from literal infringement under the precedent of this Court. Under our precedent, literal infringement cannot be determined without first determining what a claim means in light of the specification, the prosecution history, and the prior art. <em>Envirotech Corp. v. Al George, Inc., </em>730 F.2d 753, 760, 221 USPQ 473, 477 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>SSIH Equipment S.A. v. USITC, </em>718 F.2d 365, 376, 218 USPQ 678, 688 (Fed.Cir. 1983); <em>Astra-Sjuco, A.B. v. USITC, </em>629 F.2d 682, 686 (CCPA 1980); <em>Autogiro Co. of America v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 391, 396-97, 181 Ct.Cl. 55, 155 USPQ 697, 702 (1967). The lead opinion, in contrast, uses the term \u201cliteral correspondence\" to mean that the words of a claim are to be read in a vacuum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>irrespective of specification, prosecution history or prior art. MEI has never conceded literal infringement in this case. Rather, MEI has argued that there was no literal infringement of properly interpreted claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">. I have considered the Ball affidavit but fail to understand how the experiments of Mr. Ball raise an issue of material fact when, on the undisputed record, the SRI and MEI cameras do not operate in substantially the same way. <em>Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Co., </em>339 U.S. 605, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097, 85 USPQ 328 (1950). The Nakabe paper, referred to in the lead opinion on page 12 is even less convincing to show material facts in dispute. SRI asserts in this context, that Nakabe describes the MEI camera as a \"single carrier-frequency division system\u201d while describing a camera system such as that described in the '633 patent, as a \u201ctwo carrier-frequency division system\". The mere use of the term \"frequency\u201d, however, does not compel the result that the MEI system operates as a so-called \"frequency\" system. On the contrary, as the trial judge realized, the term \"single carrier-frequency division system\u201d simply means that the MEI system modulates a carrier wave with only one \u201csingle\u201d modulating frequency. The term \u201ctwo carrier frequency division system\u201d as applied to the '633 patent only means that, in the system disclosed by the patent, a carrier wave is modulated with \"two\u201d modulating frequencies. The findings of the trial judge are in accord with Nakabe\u2019s descriptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
