The Board held that he did not have that right and dismissed his appeal to it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-22\">The VRA, as amended, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014, extends (up to September 30, 1986) to \u201cveterans of the Vietnam era\u201d eligibility to veterans readjustment appointments with the federal government. Petitioner received such an appointment in September 1982 (as an Immigration Detention Officer) with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of the Department of Justice. Later, he successfully sought a similar VRA appointment (as a Federal Protection Officer) with the General Services Administration (GSA). When the latter reviewed his records, it was discovered that he had not had sufficient military service to quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>fy for a VRA appointment, and he was ultimately refused the position with GSA. The INS refused to accept him back for the same reason \u2014 he did not meet \u201cthe basic VRA veteran eligibility requirements for the position.\u201d On his appeal to the MSPB, the presiding official held a hearing on the issue of whether the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal. Petitioner did not contest the fact that he had insufficient military service for a VRA appointment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but urged Board jurisdiction on legal grounds. The presiding official held that the MSPB had no jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s appeal, and the full Board declined review.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It is by this time a commonplace that the Board has only the jurisdiction granted it by statute or regulation. <em>E.g., Cowan v. United States, </em>710 F.2d 803, 805 (Fed.Cir.1983). In the case of a federal employee, the Civil Service Reform Act expressly provides that an employee (or applicant for employment) \u201cmay submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a). In turn, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A) and (B) declare that for removal (and other adverse action) purposes, an \u201cemployee\u201d includes non-probationary individuals <em>in the competitive service, </em>and also a non-probationary <em>preference eligible </em>in an executive agency \u201cin the excepted service\u201d (including the postal agencies).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, only those designated classes of persons can appeal under the statute to the MSPB from agency adverse actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">In this case, the Board correctly and indisputably held that petitioner is not a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d within the meaning of the second prong of the appeal statute, <em>supra, </em>because he does not meet the requirements for a \u201cveteran\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108(1)(A) or (1)(B) (a person who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days during specified time periods).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108(3)(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">The issue is, then, whether his VRA position was in the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d so that he could avail himself of the first prong of the appeal provisions, <em>supra. </em>We hold, as did the MSPB, that such a VRA appointment is <em>not </em>in the competitive service. First, it is plain that the appointment is an \u201cexcepted\u201d one. The regulation governing that type of appointment specifically declares that a \u201c \u2018Veterans readjustment appointment\u2019 is an <em>excepted appointment </em>made after April 8, 1970, under this part to a position <em>otherwise </em>in the competitive service of a veteran who served during the Vietnam era.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.101(c) (emphasis added). Second, an Act of Congress explicitly states that (1) the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch <em>\u201cexcept </em>\u2014 (A) positions which are <em>specifically excepted </em>from the competitive service by or under statute\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(a), emphasis added) and, correlatively, (2) the \u201c \u2018excepted service\u2019 consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>vice\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2103(a)). Nothing could be clearer \u2014 a VRA appointment does not bring the individual holding it within the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A), <em>supra, </em>the first branch of the statute authorizing \u201cemployee\u201d adverse action appeals to the MSPB.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Petitioner urges that, nevertheless, <em>Miller v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 109 (3rd Cir.1983), somehow authorizes the present appeal to the Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Miller </em>case, however, was very different in one significant respect. That employee \u2014 unlike petitioner \u2014 was found to be a bona fide preference eligible, and the Third Circuit therefore considered that he fell directly under the second prong of the statute, allowing appeals by preference eligibles in the excepted service, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B), <em>supra. See </em>717 F.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">We hold, therefore, that the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board is correct and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\">. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011(2)(A) and (4)(A) require, for a \"veteran of the Vietnam era,\u201d service \u201con active duty for a period of more than 180 days and [discharge or release] therefrom with other than a dishonorable discharge.\u201d Apparently petitioner had only four months of active duty service between January 21, 1971 and June 7, 1974, and five years of service with the Army National Guard (which is not counted as active duty).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">.
